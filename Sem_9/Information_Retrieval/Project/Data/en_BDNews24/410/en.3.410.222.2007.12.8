<TITLE> Sundarbans and coastal biodiversity face serious threats </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) Lying along Bangladesh's southern coasts, the Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its unique biodiversity now faces serious depletion or even extinction due to the adverse impacts of climate change, World Conservation Union (IUCN) Bangladesh representative Dr Ainun Nishat told bdnews24.com's Maruf Mallick. Nov 15's Tropical Cyclone Sidr damaged about 25 percent of the sprawling Sundarbans, a naturally regenerating coastal 'green belt' protecting Bangladesh through centuries against the ravages and caprices of cyclones and storm surges brewing year-round in the Bay of Bengal. Sidr almost razed to the ground 16 percent of the mangrove forest, Dr Nishat said. The devastation has mostly occurred in the eastern Sundarbans as that area of the forest fell foremost in the path of the Nov 15 cyclone, he said. Nishat stressed that increasing salinity will also gradually impact the mangrove ecosystem adversely, rendering unfit the habitats of the wildlife species resident in the Sundarbans. This will require the species to migrate or perish. In the case of the Sundarbans, the resident wildlife species will most possibly perish, Dr Nishat said, as species will hardly find the unique environment of the mangrove ecosystem available within migrating distance. Extensive institutional programmes must be formulated for protecting the Sundarbans against the onslaught of climate change. Just a one-metre rise in sea levels will inundate the whole of the Sundarbans, the IUCN representative said, the shrinking habitat resulting in the depletion of already critically threatened flora and fauna species. Safe habitats have to be nurtured and maintained for its wildlife species in view of the increasingly recurrent natural disasters forecast due to climate change. Excess rainfall during the monsoon and its scarcity through the winter months will also affect the ecosystem and its living resources. Mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and, above all, the Bengal Tiger will face extinction, Nishat said quoting IUCN studies and reports. On the Sundarbans' role as a protective wall along the coast, he said the mangrove forest absorbs 70-90 percent of the impact of extreme weather events, acting as a natural seabreak. A Coast Trust study pointed out that the 'top-dying disease' attacking Sundari trees will increase with rising salinity in the mangrove environment. On average, 114 Sundari trees per hectare of forest are already afflicted with the disease, it said. The study also said the Sundarbans happens to be the worst victim of climate change in the region, as extreme humidity and water shortage in winter is further raising the soil salinity each year, causing its capacity for regeneration to dwindle. Ziaul Huq Mukta, an official of Oxfam International, told bdnews24.com that the flora and fauna of the Sundarbans will continue to be destroyed by increasing salinity, rises in temperature and sea level and recurrent cyclonic storms. As a result, the celebrated Bangladesh Sundarbans may soon assume dwarfish proportions gradually coming to resemble the isolated mangrove clumps of the West Bengal Sundarbans. bdnews2
