<TITLE> Poland's Tusk declines to set date for euro entry </TITLE>

 PARIS, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk still wants Poland to adopt the euro as soon as possible, he said in an interview published on Friday, but declined to set a date for joining the currency grouping. "It's always risky setting a date," he told the daily. "I said I wanted to join the euro as soon as possible. There's more to it than giving a date at random, like 2012," he told the Le Monde newspaper. Tusk, whose centre-right coalition government took power last month, also said he would continue to push for a planned Russian-German gas pipeline to pass through Poland, rather than under the Baltic Sea. "This gas pipeline has an exorbitant cost and presents a potential threat to the environment, which is recognised by several of the other Baltic countries," Tusk told the paper. A Polish route would be cheaper, he said, adding that he wanted Warsaw's voice to be taken into account on that issue and the need to diversify energy supplies and ensure their independence from Russia. Tusk urged Russia to end its ban on meat imports from Poland, saying it was purely political. An end to the ban would show Russia wanted to normalise relations with Poland and the European Union, he said when asked if he was ready to lift a Polish veto on starting talks with Russia on a new partnership accord with the European Union.
