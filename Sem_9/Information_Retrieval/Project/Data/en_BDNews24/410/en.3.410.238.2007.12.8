 Los Angeles, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Days after sounding a brief note of conciliation, studio bosses and striking screenwriters broke off contract talks again on Friday, dashing hopes the two sides were making progress toward settling the worst Hollywood labor crisis in two decades. News that four straight days of negotiations had collapsed in acrimony came in a sharply worded statement issued late in the day by the studios' bargaining arm, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. The Writers Guild of America confirmed bargaining had broken off but had no other immediate comment. The studios blamed WGA leaders for making "unreasonable demands that are roadblocks to real progress." "We're disappointed to report that talks between the AMPTP and WGA have broken down yet again," the studios' statement said. "We're puzzled and disheartened by an ongoing WGA negotiating strategy that seems designed to delay or derail talks rather than facilitate an end to this strike." Some 10,500 WGA members have been on strike since an earlier round of talks collapsed on Nov. 5 in a dispute that has hinged on how much the writers should be paid for work that is used on the Internet. Earlier in the day, the two sides exchanged public statements accusing each other of foot-dragging in the latest talks, and suggesting the other side was ready to pull the plug on negotiations. OPTIMISM SUBSIDES Two days ago, the WGA sparked a flicker of optimism with an upbeat statement saying the parties had engaged in "substantive discussions of the issues important to writers" for the first time since negotiations began in July. The AMPTP also struck a more cordial tone in recent days, declaring its proposals were not meant as "take-it-or-leave-it" offers and the parties could find common ground. But Friday's round of bad-mouthing indicated the two sides remained far from a deal. The strike, which began on Nov. 5, has halted production on dozens of TV shows, including most of the major networks' prime-time series, as well as several movies. Thousands of non-writing film and TV workers have been idled along with the WGA members on picket lines. Meanwhile, a group of more than 300 filmmakers, most of whom are Writers Guild members, have asked the Directors Guild of America to hold off on launching its own contract talks with studios while the WGA remains in negotiations. The DGA is widely seen as more sympathetic to the studios and less militant than the Writers Guild, whose negotiating position could be undermined if the AMPTP strikes a deal first with the directors. The DGA contract expires next June. A union spokeswoman said the writer-directors made their request in a letter delivered to the DGA on Thursday. Signatories included such leading filmmakers as Joel and Ethan Coen, Ed Zwick, Lawrence Kasdan and Sean Penn. The DGA spokeswoman said the AMPTP had not approached the Directors Guild about starting early contract talks, nor had the union made such overtures to the studios. bd
