<TITLE> Poland relents on EU day against death penalty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Warsaw, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland has dropped its objections to creating a European day against the death penalty, as its new leaders move to improve relations with the rest of the European Union, Polish news media said on Friday. Under the previous conservative-led government of Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Poland held up plans to mark the abolition of capital punishment in the bloc on Oct. 10 each year, saying such a day should also condemn euthanasia and abortion. "The Portuguese have asked us where we stand on the day (against death penalty). We decided that there are no obstacles for us to support the initiative," Justice Minister Zbigniew Cwiatkowski was quoted as saying in the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Following the defeat of the Eurosceptic party of Kaczynski and his twin brother Lech, who was president, in October the new centre-right government has promised to improve relations with the EU, which had suffered. Earlier this week, Prime Minster Donald Tusk pledged during his first visit to Brussels since taking office to cooperate on issues such as climate change and environmental protection.
