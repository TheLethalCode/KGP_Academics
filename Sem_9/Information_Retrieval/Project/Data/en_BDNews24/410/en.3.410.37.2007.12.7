 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Brazil striker Romario was named player-coach of Vasco da Gama on Thursday, two days after announcing he had failed a dope test while playing for the team in October. Romario, who blamed a hair loss treatment after testing positive for the banned substance finasteride, will be in charge of Vasco for the opening games of next season, club president Eurico Miranda told reporters. The 1994 World Cup striker, still playing at the age of 41, has been provisionally suspended until Dec. 18, when Brazil's disciplinary tribunal is due to hear the case. Miranda said Romario's role would be restricted to coaching if the tribunal extends the ban. Vasco are due to play two friendlies in Dubai in January before taking part in the Carioca championship, one of the regional tournaments which kick off the Brazilian season in mid-January. Romario replaces Valdir Espinosa, who quit after the 2007 season ended on Sunday. "Romario will be player and coach until the end of the Guanabara Cup (the first half of the Carioca tournament)," said Miranda. "That is definite. Maybe he will continue a while longer." "If the tribunal maintains the suspension, he will go to Dubai as coach. But I think the ban will be overturned." Romario took on the role of player-coach for one game for Vasco in October. Although they beat Mexico's America 1-0, Vasco lost their Copa Sudamericana tie 2-1 on aggregate. BEACH SOCCER Romario has kept his playing career going over the last few years, defying those who said he should hang up his boots. Three years ago, he was sacked by Fluminense after being jeered off the field by the crowd during the match at the Maracana. But Vasco, the club where he began his career, took him back and in 2005, in a remarkable turnaround, he scored 22 goals in the Brazilian championship to finish as the competition's top scorer at the age of 39. In between, he took time out to play in the Beach Soccer World Cup and last year went on a four-month excursion to the United States to play for Miami FC, where he added 27 goals to his tally. He also played four matches for Adelaide United in Australia. In May, he scored what he claimed to be his 1,000th goal by converting a penalty in the 3-1 win over Sport Recife. But he admitted the total includes more than 200 goals scored in youth team, reserve, friendly and testimonial games. On Monday, he was given a special award for the achievement at a ceremony to mark the end of the Brazilian championship
