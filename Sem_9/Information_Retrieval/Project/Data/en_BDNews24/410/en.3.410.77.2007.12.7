 BRUSSELS, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Czech Republic hopes to reach a deal with the United States by February for a missile defence plan that is strongly opposed by Russia, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said on Friday. The United States wants to build a radar base in the Czech Republic as part of its missile shield and is still negotiating terms for the deal. "First we have to conclude the treaties and of course that means hard dealings with the United States," Schwarzenberg told reporters on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers meeting. "Hopefully we will find a solution in January or February or something like that," he added. The United States plans to build a radar in the Czech Republic and an interceptor missile base in Poland to counter threats of ballistic missiles from countries such as Iran, which the United States has suspected of building a nuclear bomb. But earlier this week, a US intelligence report said Iran had stopped its nuclear weapons programme four years ago, in direct contradiction to previous U.S. claims. Asked whether there was less need for a missile defence system following the new U.S. intelligence estimate, the Czech minister said the threat was not only from Iran but many other nations could be a problem in the future. Washington argues the shield will protect Europe as much as the United States but the plan has run into vehement opposition from Russia, unsettling some EU governments who fear a return of an arms race on the continent. The Czech minister said his country was working closely with Russia and listening to their concerns over the shield.
