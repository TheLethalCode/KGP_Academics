 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  All-rounder Saqib Al Hasan already sees the reflection of new coach Jamie Siddons' new training method in the practice matches ahead of this month's New Zealand tour. "We are playing the practice matches to apply the techniques we are learning from him and these are reflected in the practice matches. It's not possible to understand it sitting outside the field," Saqib told reporters during the warm-up matches at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Friday. "In the first practice match a lot of wickets fell, but today the batsmen are playing cautiously as the wicket is carrying good bounce," said Saqib during the interval of a 30-over-a-side match. Coach Siddons also believes the practice was getting better. "I won't say it is a perfect practice match, but it is getting better and the bottom line is the batsmen have to stay in the middle as much as they can," said Dav Whatmore's successor. In the match, the Red Team, led by Mushfiqur Rahim, beat the Green Team, led by Mohammad Ashraful, by four wickets. The winners raced to 149 for six in 29.4 overs in reply to Green's 145 for five in 30 overs. Siddons kept the batsmen busy, who faced the bowling machine on the outside pitch where a granite slab was placed. The cricketers had a slip-catching practice. Saqib believes they would benefit from the innovative training sessions as the bowlers sporting the New Zealand jerseys in the nets were bowling over the mark to simulate the New Zealand fast bowlers. "We are learning something new each day. A batsman now has to ponder a change in his role after 10 overs," said the 20-year old batsman, who hammered a match-winning 58-ball 70 not out against the Green Team. The left-handed middle-order batsman, however, said it was not possible to bring a drastic change in a week as things would improve gradually. Saqib was optimistic about the tour of New Zealand and believed they could upset the Black Caps in three-ODI series. "Though it is unlikely that we will win the series it is possible to win a match against them as all of us selected for the tour were in playing well in the domestic games," said Saqib. b
