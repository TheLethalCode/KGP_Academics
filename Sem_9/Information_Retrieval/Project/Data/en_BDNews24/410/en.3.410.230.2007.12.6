 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) - Youth and Sports adviser, Tapan Chowdhury, Thursday said that those responsible for corruption in sports would be brought under the purview of existing laws. His remark came at a press briefing during the announcement of the national sports award in the conference room of the sports and youth ministry. "Yes, I've received the task force's investigation report in three volumes with 724 pages today," Chowdhury said, "We'll let you know about the report later as our top priority in sports is to curb corruption." "The persons responsible for corruption will come under the country's existing laws, and we will try to execute the recommendations of the task force," said Chowdhury. The caretaker government on March 5 formed the task force, headed by Brigadier General Najib Hasan, to probe corruption in the National Sports Council (NSC) during the BNP-led government stint. It was learnt that the task force had interviewed hundreds of people including former state minister for sports and ex-NSC chairman Fazlur Rahman. Sources related to the task force said that it had found about Tk 80 crore related to corruption in the NSC and Tk 50 crore in shop allotment scams.
