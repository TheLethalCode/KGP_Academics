 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Thursday withdrew its stay order on the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) elections. The HC also declared illegal the verdict of the FBCCI arbitration council cancelling the voting rights of five BGMEA members. An HC bench of justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice Shahidul Islam delivered the verdict after hearing the case filed by Faisal Samad and Annisul Huq of BGMEA. "Truth has won...we've won the case," Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com in an instant reaction. "The FBCCI is the country's apex trade body. We've to uphold the prestige of the organisation," Huq added. BGMEA members Annisul Huq, Mohammad A Salam, Faisal Samad, ABM Shamsuddin, and Ferdous Parvez Bivon were dropped from the FBCCI voter list following a petition filed by businessman Mahbub Minhaz, claiming that the five had been elected to the executive committee through a flawed poll. The arbitration council of the FBCCI in a verdict on Sept 25 ruled that the BGMEA election was held in violation of court orders and the results were illegal and void. The BGMEA later filed a case challenging the FBCCI verdict resulting in the court's staying the FBCCI elections on Sept 30 and ordering the federation to explain why its verdict would not be ruled illegal. bdnew
