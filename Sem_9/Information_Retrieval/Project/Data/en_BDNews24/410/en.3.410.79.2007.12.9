There was no immediate confirmation from police. In 2002, Anne Darwin reported her 57-year-old husband John missing, saying she feared he had suffered an accident while canoeing in the North Sea near their home in Hartlepool, northeast England. A few weeks later the shattered remains of his red kayak were discovered. In 2003, following a police inquiry, a coroner declared him dead. But his 55-year-old wife told British newspapers on Saturday she had hidden him at the family home during the missing years after her husband "disappeared". She described how her husband had avoided discovery by using a small passage to an apartment in an adjoining house owned by the couple. On Saturday he was charged by police with obtaining money by deception and making a false declaration to get a passport. He is due to appear at Hartlepool Magistrates Court on Monday. The Mirror's website said his wife was due to be questioned by police later on Sunday.

Newspaper reports said Darwin's life insurance and work benefits had been paid to his wife
