<TITLE> WTO services talks bogged down in North-South row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZENEVA, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks on opening up services from banking to telecoms are virtually deadlocked at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in an increasingly bitter North-South row. A meeting that ended on Friday after running overtime saw the United States and India trading recriminations as developed and developing countries hurled accusations at each other. Talks on services -- accounting for two-thirds of global output and one-third of employment -- started two years before the 2001 launch of the Doha round to open world trade. But they have little to show, unlike talks on agriculture and industry. "When you look at ... the substance that is being discussed, services is actually in a dire situation," said one rich-country senior diplomat. Developed and developing countries are seeking openings in others' services sectors, but the talks are stuck in three ways. First, countries that have liberalised a service sector are unwilling to permanently bind those changes into a WTO deal. Second, many countries mulling requests to expose a sector to competition are keeping limits on ownership and control of companies in place, discouraging foreign investment. Third, where these states are willing to open an industry, they are often keeping part of the sector off-limits. Developing countries mainly in the southern hemisphere are mostly on the receiving end of requests to open up services. But many have one major demand which is being rebuffed by rich countries: to free up rules on people travelling to another country to supply services. That could be a fashion model flying to a shoot -- or engineers travelling to work on a big construction project. "One man's temporary worker is another man's immigrant," said the rich country diplomat. DIFFICULT TALKS Unlike trade talks on agriculture and industry, services negotiations are about domestic regulations rather than tariffs and subsidies. Talks are conducted bilaterally and in groups. For instance in financial services, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, the United States, Taiwan, Ecuador, Hong Kong, Korea and Panama have sent requests to 21 states including Brazil, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, and Egypt. Among other things, they want to make it easy for all financial services businesses to establish new companies, or acquire existing ones, in the target countries. But the requesting countries expressed "dissatisfaction" with the responses so far and complained of the "absence of a clear indication of ambition", according to a paper summarising the talks so far by Canada, the coordinator of requests in financial services. A copy of the paper was seen by Reuters. Rich countries argue such investments are good for the economies of the fund recipients. But many developing nations are wary of losing political and regulatory control. Many developing countries are waiting to see what concessions they get in farm trade before committing. But rich countries, contemplating painful sacrifices in farm support, want all WTO members to agree a text on services liberalisation so that they can sell a deal at home. This would be issued soon after agreement on an outline deal in agriculture and industry, expected in the form of revised negotiating texts on those areas early next year. At the meeting that ended on Friday, coordinators for the requests in 18 of the 22 sector negotiations in services produced papers summarising progress as they see it. According to copies seen by Reuters, progress was minimal in most of them.
