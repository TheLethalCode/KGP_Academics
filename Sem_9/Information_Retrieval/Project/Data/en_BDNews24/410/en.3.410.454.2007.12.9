 Dubai, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stars from Hollywood, Bollywood and the Arab world descend on multicultural Dubai on Sunday for the start of a film festival that sees itself as a bridge between East and West. Gracing the red carpet for the fourth Dubai International Film Festival are Danny Glover, who will receive a lifetime achievement award, as well as Sharon Stone and Sadie Frost. George Clooney, in town to support the opening film "Michael Clayton", about a conflicted lawyer working for a chemical firm, said film was a great way to boost understanding among cultures. "We have to get to the point where we understand each other a bit more... art is a great way of doing that," Clooney said. "I said I would come back when we were working on Syriana and they were kind enough to let us shoot that film here." Parts of Syriana, a political thriller about a fictional oil-rich Arab state, were filmed in the United Arab Emirates. Dealing with terrorism, poor labourers, oil and Western policy, it drew both praise and criticism in the West and the Arab world. Many were surprised such a film was shot in the UAE. But organisers say they want to bring international films and production houses to a Gulf Arab region often derided as a cultural desert, and are showing 141 films from 52 countries. In 2006, the Dubai festival launched the Muhr Awards for Excellence in Arab Cinema. This year, the competition will include seven world premieres in its three categories -- features, documentaries and shorts -- which carry top cash prizes of $50,000, $40,000 and $30,000 respectively. It will also introduce $10,000 prizes for Best Actor and Best Actress and $7,000 prizes for Best Scriptwriter, Best Cinematographer, Best Editor and Best Composer. Over 300 films were submitted for the 2007 competition. "This year we have a diversity of topics, in addition to the social issues and current political situation of the Arab world," said Mohammed Rouda, Competition Associate Director. "Arab cinema is no longer stopping at presenting issues, but trying to draw attention to artistic and stylistic techniques." This year, audiences will also be able to vote for their favourite films with a people's choice award and there will be a special competition to nurture fledgling UAE film-making. Among Arab films on offer are Mohammed Khan's "In the Heliopolis Flat" -- Egypt's entry for best foreign-language film at the Oscars -- and Mahmoud al-Massad's "Recycle" about a former jihadist struggling to cope with civilian life in Jordan. Also showing are a slew of films on the 2006 war in Lebanon. They include "33 Days", a documentary by Lebanese director Mai Masri that follows a group of journalists and aid workers, and Philippe Aractingi's "Under the Bombs", which explores interfaith love in war-ravaged south Lebanon. Lebanese-Belgian director Borhane Alaouie's film "Khalas", about life after Lebanon's 15-year civil war, is also showing
