<TITLE> Merkel urges German states to improve child welfare </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel will urge the leaders of Germany's states to focus more on child welfare after a spate of grisly deaths involving young children, a government spokesman said on Friday. This week police detained a 31-year-old German mother on suspicion of involvement in the deaths of her five boys aged between three and nine. Reports of German parents fatally neglecting or murdering their children have become an almost daily occurrence. Another woman was arrested after the corpses of her three children were found in a suitcase, a freezer and a plastic bag on a balcony. Under Germany's federal system child welfare is ultimately the responsibility of local authorities and the 16 state governments. "We don't want to question that responsibility," federal government spokesman Thomas Steg told reporters. "However, the chancellor wants to use a Dec. 19 meeting with the state premiers to emphasise the issue of child welfare and protection." It was important for child protection authorities to ask themselves if enough was being done to prevent neglect and abuse and where improvements needed to be made, he said. German media reported last week local child welfare authorities had been visiting the family of a 5-year-old girl in in the former communist east but failed to intervene before she died of starvation. Some state ministers say the federal government should assume more responsibility for child protection because the quality of protection programmes is uneven across Germany. Reports of child abuse in Germany are increasing, according to the federal Family Ministry. But ministry officials say it is too early to know whether abuse is becoming more common or if people are better at reporting suspected abuse. Police in Berlin said on Friday they found a 24-year-old mother and her baby dead in their apartment. The cause of death was unclear though police said the mother had a drug problem. Police in Dresden found a dead baby overnight in an apartment. They said the child showed signs of serious neglect. Last year Germany was shocked by the death of a malnourished 2-year-old boy whose body was found in his father's refrigerator in the northern city of Bremen. Before that there was Jessica, a 7-year-old girl from Hamburg whose parents starved her to death.
