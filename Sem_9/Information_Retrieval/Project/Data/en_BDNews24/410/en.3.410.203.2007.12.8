 Jimbaran, Indonesia, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trade ministers opened a new front in combating global warming on the fringe of UN climate talks on Saturday despite splits over import barriers to clean energy technologies. About a dozen trade ministers, including from the United States, Australia, Brazil and Portugal, which holds the European Union presidency, started two days of meetings in Bali to discuss whether more trade will harm or help the environment. "The meeting...emphasises the point that it's not just the environmental imperative we are dealing with, but the economic opportunities that come from solving climate change," Australian Trade Minister Simon Crean said. "Climate change solutions open up important opportunities for jobs and trade," he told reporters. "The intention is to start a dialogue. This is the first time that trade ministers are meeting to discuss these (climate) issues," Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu said. The meeting, on the fringe of 190-nation climate talks involving about 10,000 delegates in a nearby resort on the Indonesian island, is the first time that annual UN climate talks have widened from environment ministers. In a sign of mounting worries about the economic impacts of more droughts, floods, and rising seas, a group of finance minister will also meet in Bali on Monday and Tuesday. The trade talks began around midday (0400 GMT), to discuss how trade policies can promote economic growth and shield the environment after UN reports this year warning of ever more droughts, heatwaves, disruptions to farming and rising seas. On Nov. 30, the United States and the EU made a proposal to eliminate barriers to trade in clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines or solar panels, as part of the long-running Doha round of world trade talks. PROTECTIONISM But India and Brazil criticised the measures as disguised protectionism to boost exports from rich nations. Brazil, a big producer of biofuels from sugar cane, noted the proposals did not include biofuels nor biofuels technologies. Australia's Crean said the US-EU proposal was encouraging if it helped eliminate trade barriers for environmental goods and services. The Dec. 3-14 UN climate change meeting in Bali is trying to launch two years of formal talks on a new pact to widen the UN's Kyoto Protocol to all nations beyond 2012, including more participation by the United States, China and India. Kyoto now binds 36 developed nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels, by 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12 in a step to slow global warming. At the climate talks, an alliance of 43 small island states urged much tougher action to fight climate change, saying they otherwise risked being washed off the map by rising seas and more powerful storms. "We want to see drastic action," said Angus Friday, of Grenada and chairman of the group in Bali. He said a protective barrier for one island in the Maldives alone cost $100 million. Saturday's trade talks were focused on the links between trade, investment and climate policies for the development of climate friendly technologies and clean energy systems. On Sunday, World Trade Organization chief Pascal Lamy will look at "what kind of tools and instruments can be applied to maximise linkages between trade and climate policies". A UN report in August projected that net annual investments of $200-$210 billion by 2030 were needed to curb emissions, in cleaner areas such as renewable energies.
