 NEW YORK, Dec 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Motorola Inc Chief Financial Officer Tom Meredith did not rule out a break-up of the company as he affirmed the phone maker's earnings guidance for the fourth quarter on Thursday. Asked about a recent call by activist investor Carl Icahn for Motorola to break into several units, Meredith would not rule out structural changes to the company, which has been losing market share to rivals due to a weak phone line-up. "I believe there's every opportunity for us to create significant economic value as a whole. Does that mean other options aren't viable? Not at all," Meredith told an investor conference Webcast. Meredith backed Motorola's forecast for fourth-quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of 12 cents to 14 cents per share. He said Motorola's mobile device unit would see sequential revenue and bottom-line improvements.
