 DHAKA, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Afghan authorities have rescued BRAC aid worker Noor Islam after 82 days in the captivity of abductors, an official said Saturday. "The police in Afghanistan rescued him Friday midnight," M Anwarul Haq, director of public affairs and communications, told bdnews24.com by phone. Noor, 37, was abducted from his office in the Afghan province of Loger on Sept 15. He was employed by BRAC to oversee its micro-finance scheme in the war-ravaged nation. Haq said he was expecting Noor to be handed back to BRAC authorities after a routine health check-up. The rescue came hours after Afghan foreign minister Rangin Spanta told foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury that security forces had traced the location where Noor was kept. Bangladesh had earlier sought assistance from the US and Pakistan for freedom of the BRAC official. Unidentified Afghan gunmen had earlier shot dead another BRAC worker Abdul Alim while he was travelling through the remote northeastern region in Afghanistan by motorbike. bd
