<TITLE> What ancestry testing will and won`t tell you </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A range of genealogy companies now offer DNA testing to those curious about their ancestry. Here are a few facts about DNA genealogy tests: - Tests cost between $119.00 and $895.00 and are available from a variety of online vendors. - Different tests are used to trace maternal and paternal ancestry. - Paternal DNA is found on the Y chromosome, which is passed down unchanged from father to son. Because women do not have a Y chromosome, those wishing to test their paternal line must have a brother or father take the test for them. - Maternal DNA is found in mitochondria, the organelles that provide energy to cells. Women and men can take this test. - DNA tests can't give a complete picture of your ancestry because they are only capable of tracing direct matrilenial and patrilineal lines, in other words, your mother's mother's mother, or your father's father's father. The test does not reveal the genetic makeup of other forebears, such as your maternal grandfather. - The tests show your broad genetic category, or "haplogroup," and where in the world that group is commonly found. But the tests cannot identify more specific ancestral information such as which town or river valley your ancestors came from. - Tests can indicate that two people are related if their results match up closely. Scientists have called on test providers to better educate consumers about their limitations and have warned that the tests should not be used to resolve legal disputes, such as whether somebody qualifies for membership in an American Indian tribe
