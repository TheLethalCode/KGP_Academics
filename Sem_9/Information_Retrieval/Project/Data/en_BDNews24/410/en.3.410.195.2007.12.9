 DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A virus has ruled South Africa captain Graeme Smith out of a Twenty20 match against West Indies in Port Elizabeth next Sunday. Morne van Wyk will replace Smith and Shaun Pollock will take over the captaincy. Smith contracted the virus on South Africa's tour to Pakistan in October. "His doctors feel that rest and recuperation is the way for him to go and they have recommended that he takes three weeks off," South Africa coach Mickey Arthur was quoted as saying in a Cricket South Africa news release on Sunday. Arthur added that doctors were confident Smith would be fit to play in the first test against West Indies in Port Elizabeth on Dec. 26. South Africa: Morne van Wyk, Herschelle Gibbs, JP Duminy, AB de Villiers, Gulam Bodi, Shaun Pollock (captain), Vernon Philander, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini
