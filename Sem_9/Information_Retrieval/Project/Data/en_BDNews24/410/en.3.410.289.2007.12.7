<TEXT>
 Singapore, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The release of Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will be a key factor in the Philippines' decision to ratify a new charter for a regional grouping, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has said. Arroyo, striking a tough posture, told the Financial Times that Myanmar's military rulers must comply with the human rights elements in the charter of the Association of South East Asian Association (ASEAN) by speeding the move toward democracy. She said the release of Suu Kyi, who has spent 12 of the last 18 years under house arrest, will be the "number one benchmark" for Manila to decide whether to ratify the charter of the 10-member grouping that was signed at its meeting last month. The charter needs ratification by all 10 ASEAN members before an economic and security bloc encompassing 560 million people can be established. Despite the chorus of outside disapproval, Myanmar's rulers have made clear they do not intend to do anything outside the framework of a seven-step democracy roadmap, which the West says will simply solidify the military's grip on power. At least 15 people died in a crackdown on anti-junta protests in September crackdown, drawing unprecedented international criticism and pressure to embark upon meaningful democratic reform including the release of political detainees.
