 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  Improving regional connectivity seems to be the mantra at the ongoing SAARC (South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation) foreign ministers' meet in the Indian capital New Delhi. Foreign ministers of SAARC nations will consider taking up work on seven intra-regional transport projects to move SAARC "from the declaratory phase to the implementation phase," according to Indian foreign secretary Shivshanker Menon. Connectivity will be the main theme of the inter-summit meeting, Menon said. The projects include ferry services connecting Colombo, Kochi and Tuticorin, a rail corridor between Chennai and Colombo, Agartala-Chittagong and Kathmandu-Kolkata road corridors and extending the rail link on the border with Bhutan. The inter-linking proposals include launch of direct air service between Delhi and Islamabad. The meet would also consider applications by Mauritius and Australia for enrolment as observers to the eight-nation grouping, which already has six observers in the European Union, China, Republic of Korea, Japan, the U.S. and Iran. Tehran was the latest addition at the previous SAARC summit held in New Delhi earlier this year. During the meeting, foreign ministers will discuss ways to implement various conventions on combating terrorism. bd
