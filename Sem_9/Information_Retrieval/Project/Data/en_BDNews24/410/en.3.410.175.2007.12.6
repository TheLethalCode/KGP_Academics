 KARACHI, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif needs surgery to cure a chronic elbow problem, an Australian specialist has told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). "Asif is likely to remain out of action for two months from the day he has the surgery. He will certainly miss the one-day series against Zimbabwe in January," a PCB source told Reuters on Thursday. The sports injuries specialist in Sydney had recommended surgery after examining Asif and conducting tests over the last two days, board sources said. Asif, who has had to miss the current series in India, was sent to Australia for a third opinion after local specialists disagreed on the treatment needed for the problem. The injury also forced Asif, who has played 11 tests for 51 wickets, to miss three tests in England last year and four one-day internationals against South Africa recently at home. A PCB official said a decision on when the surgery should take place would be made soon. "For the time being he is returning home tonight," the official said. A board source said Asif was likely to have the surgery soon as Pakistan were keen to have him fit for the home series against Australia in March and April. Pakistan have struggled with injury problems affecting their main pace bowlers and recently sent two replacements to India after pacer Umar Gul had to return home with a back problem
