<TEXT>
 Paris, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French police have detained a suspect in connection with the parcel bomb that exploded in a Paris office on Thursday killing a legal secretary and injuring five other people, a police source said on Friday. The man, thought to be in his mid-forties, is an architect who had in the past harassed one of the lawyers in the office that was targeted by the bomb, the source said. A search was being carried out on the suspect's home. The source said police were also still looking for a woman who delivered the parcel to the building. The building houses a law firm partly owned by French President Nicolas Sarkozy but Paris public prosecutor Jean-Claude Marin said on Thursday the explosion was not linked to Sarkozy.
