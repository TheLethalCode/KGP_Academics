 Beijing, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A record 640,000 Chinese people sat the annual national exam for government posts on Sunday, showing ferocious competition for secure jobs even as the economy grows at breakneck speed. More than 800,000 would-be bureaucrats were approved to take the exam. But many did not turn up, apparently discouraged by the tough selection process that will offer one post for every 48 people taking the day-long test. Last year there were 530,000 applicants, with 42 people competing for each job. For many centuries, civil service entrance examinations served as a key first step for young, educated Chinese hoping to join the vast imperial administration. The test in its modern form started in the mid-1990s and has seen a steep rise in applicants in recent years, especially with ballooning numbers of university graduates struggling for limited jobs with uncertain prospects. China is the world's fastest growing major economy, with private investment driving much job growth. But in this top-down Communist Party-ruled nation, officials enjoy power, prestige and privileges that still make government a career magnet for many, including graduates of top-flight universities. "Everyone knows there is very small chance to finally get a post. It is like winning the lottery," said Mei Yongchun, 23, an economics graduate from the People's University of China. He has applied for a job in the Ministry of Finance. "But we don't want to miss the chance." Close to 22,000 school rooms, halls and other venues were set aside for the big test. The fiercest competition is to get into the ruling Communist Party's central offices, whose staff enjoy perks and power that are the envy of ordinary citizens and lesser officials. "You can never imagine how hard it is to finally make it," Mei said. "Almost everyone in my department applied, but only a very few of them will finally get in." In the four-and-a-half hour written test, applicants sweat over multiple-choice questions about maths, logic, Marxism and other subjects, and also write an essay. Early next year there is a make-or-break interview for those who do best in the exam. Some worry that the interviews are open to favouritism and corruption that make the exam competition moot. "That is the most competitive and uncontrollable part of the exam," a student from the elite Tsinghua University, who was taking the exam, said of the interviews
