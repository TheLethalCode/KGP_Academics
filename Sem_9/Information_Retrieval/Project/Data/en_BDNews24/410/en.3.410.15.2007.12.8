 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers will continue their protest programme Sunday and plan out the next move after a meeting, a teacher said. The announcement came after a rushed meeting late Saturday night to review the decision to launch the protest programme. Acting DUTA president Professor Tajmeri SA Islam briefed reporters on the latest decision after the meeting ended shortly before 11:00pm. The teachers had earlier said they would press ahead with the protest programme if the government did not assure them of releasing detained colleagues and students. Officials of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence held a meeting with the leaders of the Dhaka University Teachers Association at the university. Vice Chancellor Prof SMA Faiz was also present at the meeting. DUTA held an emergency meeting Friday where the teachers demanded the detained teachers and students be released by Wednesday. They planned to wear black badges Sunday and a hold sit-in at Aparajeo Bangla Monday. After the meeting, the VC told reporters that they had constructive talks with the DGFI officers. "We are expecting positive results," he said. "They (DGFI) are trying to get to the bottom of it. I think the discussion was fruitful," he added. On the freedom of the detained teachers, Professor Tajmeri said that there was hope for it but nothing could be said for sure. Former DUTA president Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique said they had talks with the DGFI team on the association's programme. He said the DUTA leaders told the meeting that programmes could be considered if the government had assured them of meeting their demand. bdnews24.
