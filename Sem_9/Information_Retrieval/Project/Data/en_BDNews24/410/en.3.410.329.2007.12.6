 BELGRADE, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia coach Javier Clemente was sacked on Thursday after failing to reach Euro 2008, Serbian Football Association (FSS) president Zvezdan Terzic said. "The results are always the final barometer of whether someone has been successful or not and we have made the decision not to extend Clemente's contract expiring on December 31," Terzic told reporters after a meeting with his aides. "Clemente himself said he didn't want to carry on unless he had unanimous support from the FSS, the fans and the media, which he doesn't although only a few people wanted him out," he added. "He had a difficult task of reaching the Euro 2008 finals with a young team in the process of being rebuilt and we were unrealistic in our expectations." Terzic last month vowed to back the 57-year-old Spanish coach after Serbia failed to reach next year's finals in Austria and Switzerland but made a u-turn after coming under strong pressure from local media and the fans. He criticised the media for "building a negative atmosphere" towards Clemente and poured scorn on the fans for a "complete lack of commitment". "To see only a few hundred fans turn up for home matches when we still had a chance of reaching next year's tournament is very disappointing," added Terzic. "I can understand the fans are disappointed but too many of them have shown no commitment to their country or support for the national soccer team when we needed it most." Terzic declined to name candidates for the job after the media had listed former Atletico Madrid manager Radomir Antic and Partizan Belgrade coach Miroslav Djukic as Clemente's most likely successors. "We should have a new coach by January 24 but it's not the end of the world if we take a little longer to pick the right man for the job," Terzic said
