<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka University Teachers' Association Sunday halted all protest programmes for two weeks, teachers said. The DUTA members took up the programmes to demand the release of detained colleagues and students. The decision came after DUTA's Sunday night meeting. Acting DUTA president Tajmeri SA Islam, who chaired the meeting, said: "We have decided to halt all programmes for two weeks as we have received concrete assurance from the government and a request from the education adviser (to halt the protests)." She explained the term 'concrete assurance' and said: "The concrete assurance means the release of all detained DU and RU teachers and students." "We had a working committee meeting Saturday evening, followed by the Sunday night meeting," Tajmeri said. Asked about what would be the next step if the students and the teachers are not freed in two weeks, she said: "We will sit again and decide the next move if needed." Acting DUTA general secretary Dr Mamun Ahmed said: "We hope the government's decisions won't compel us to go back to a protest programme." A total of 138 teachers were present at the three-and-a-half-hour meeting that ended at 10:00pm. Teachers were divided on whether to continue the programmes. Prof Sharifullah Bhuiyan said: "It took us so long to reach a decision. One faction wanted to withdraw the protest plan and give the government some time. The other faction wanted to press on with the protests." bdnews24.c
