<TITLE> HC approves bail for Sabera Aman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Sunday granted bail to Sabera Aman, wife of former BNP state minister Amanullah Aman. The court also ordered an explanation on a provision of the emergency powers rules, which bans bail for convicts until disposal of a post-verdict appeal in the Supreme Court. The HC asked the government to explain why the provision would not be declared unconstitutional. The home secretary, an Anticorruption Commission deputy director, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner and Dhaka Special Court-1 judge have to respond to the HC order. On March 6, ACC deputy director Abdullah Al Zahid filed a case with Shahbagh Police Station against Aman and his wife for earning Tk 8.28 crore through "unfair means". Sabera was arrested on May 9. The Dhaka Special Court-1 on June 21 sentenced Aman to 13 years and Sabera to three years in jail. Barrister Rafiq-ul Huq, who defended Sabera in court, said there is a provision in the emergency powers rules, which revokes the provision for bail unless a final verdict is handed down. "The provision is unconstitutional," he said. Sabera had earlier appealed to the High Court seeking bail but the appeal was turned down due to the provision, Huq added. bdnew
