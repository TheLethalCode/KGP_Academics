 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) - Mohammedan Sporting Club Friday clinched the Teletalk best-of-three football match series 2-1 after beating Abahani 4-2 second time in a penalty shootout in the third and final match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) organised the series to raise funds for Sidr survivors. A nearly 15,000-strong crowd turned up at the big bowl to watch the series decider after the black-and-whites got the better of the sky-blues 5-4 in a sudden-death tiebreaker in the opener while Abahani beat them 2-1 in the second match. The 90-minute regulation time ended in a goalless draw, and the match rolled into a tiebreaker. In the shootout, Ariful Islam, Hasan Al Mamun, Farhad Hossain and Ripon Khan converted for Mohammedan to ensure the series. Abahani's Jahid Hasan Emili and Jahangir Alam Mintu found the back of the Mohammedan net, but Nazrul Islam and Abul Hossain missed the target. bdne
