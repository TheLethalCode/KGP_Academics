 Sydney, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Monday while the dollar held near one-month highs against the yen as hopes of an aggressive US interest rate cut this week faded after stronger-than-expected US jobs data. Worries that slower US growth will crimp demand sent oil sliding below $88 a barrel, which in turn kept gold pinned near $796 an ounce. A slightly better-than-expected US employment report on Friday had dashed hopes of a half percentage point rate cut at the Dec. 11 Federal Reserve meeting, but also soothed fears that the world's biggest economy would fall into recession. "The US rate outlook is all-important at the moment," said Richard Morris, investment manager at Constellation Capital Management in Australia. "The Fed has has indicated to the market they are on a tack of loosening monetary policy, so a quarter-point (cut) will probably do the trick in boosting market confidence." Tokyo's Nikkei average was 0.5 percent lower by the mid-session break, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks also slipped 0.5 percent by 0220 GMT, taking a breather after last week's 1.9 percent rise. The MSCI index is about 8 percent away from the Nov. 1 record high, and has advanced 37 percent this year, strongly outperforming a 12.5 percent rise for MSCI's key world stock index. China's mainland stock market eased 0.4 percent after yet another monetary policy tightening by Beijing on Saturday to curb inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. ENERGY STOCKS DOWN Investors sold energy firms with US crude trading at $87.79 a barrel. Japan's Inpex Holdings, Australia's oil and gas producer Woodside Petroleum and PetroChina all fell more than 1.5 percent. Investors also took profits on some of the recent gainers, sending chip tester maker Advantest Corp, Hynix Semiconductor and SMIC lower. But SP Ausnet jumped after the Australian infrastructure firm said it would not go ahead with plans to buy assets of de-listed energy firm Alinta for $7.3 billion, citing poor capital market conditions. SP Ausnet's Australian shares surged 7.1 percent, while the Singapore-listed shares gained 5.3 percent. DOLLAR FIRM In the forex market, the dollar was trading at 111.62 yen not far off a one-month high of about 111.80 yen set on Friday, while the euro bought $1.4645 off Friday's high of $1.4672. "At the moment, bearish sentiment for the dollar appears to be receding," said Tomoko Fujii, a senior economist and strategist at Bank of America in Tokyo. Against the Japanese unit, the single European currency fetched 163.47 yen slipping from a three-week high of around 163.90 yen on Friday. Safe-haven government bonds were mixed, with diminished expectations for an aggressive US rate cut offset by falls in equities. Japan's benchmark 10-year bond yield climbed one tick to 1.575 percent, while the 2-year bond yield eased half a tick to 0.735 percent
