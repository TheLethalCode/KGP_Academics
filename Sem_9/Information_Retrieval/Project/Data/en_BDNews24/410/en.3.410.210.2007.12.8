<TITLE> Anticorruption drive keeps many away from noble work: Wahiduddin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)Former caretaker government adviser Wahiduddin Mahmud Saturday urged the government to raise the ceiling on tax-free donations to encourage the affluent to come forward to help Sidr survivors. Speaking at a seminar on "Social Accountability" organised by the Bankers' Forum at the CIRDAP auditorium, Prof Mahmud urged people to stand by the cyclone-hit people. He urged rich people and big educational institutions to come forward in aid of the cyclone victims keeping in mind their social responsibility. Many rich and philanthropic people stayed away from contributing to noble work, frightened by the anticorruption drive. Mahmud said that anybody making donations for a noble cause gets income tax rebate, referring to the Income Tax Ordinance. Mahmud said a number of private banks had received awards for welfare work. "It was a positive sign." He, however, said all banks should not look for profit but rather come forward for noble causes with a sense of social responsibility. bdnews
