 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com) -- The government is to give loans to some 52,000 fishermen in the cyclone-hit coastal belts to enable them to start fishing immediately. Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, the state-run microcredit funding institution, will distribute the loans through its 32 partner NGOs. Each fisherman will be given up to Tk 15,000, officials said. "The decision has been taken immediately after chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's urgent directives," a top official with the fisheries and livestock ministry told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named.

He said that each fisherman would be given a maximum Tk 15,000 and minimum Tk 5,000.
