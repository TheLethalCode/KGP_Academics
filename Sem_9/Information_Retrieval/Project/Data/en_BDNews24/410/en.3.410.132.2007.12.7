<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) Speakers at a cartoon exhibition Friday said that instead of placing restrictions on the freedom of expression of cartoonists, allowing them to draw freely would help curb corruption. Transparency International Bangladesh organised the exhibition of young cartoonists, in two age groups under 35, at DRIK Gallery in the capital. Chairman of the Anticorruption Commission Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, speaking as chief guest at the function, urged the country's cartoonists to take an anti-corruption stance in their cartoons with the same vigor as they did in the past. TIB had earlier held a cartoon competition to mark the upcoming International Anticorruption Day on Dec 9, with 'Corruption as it affects the general population' as its main theme. A total of 747 cartoons were submitted out of which 56 cartoons were selected for exhibition. "We are trying to launch a social movement against corruption. In the past couple of years, we have been organising this type of programme involving the nation's youth," TIB executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman said at the opening of the exhibition. Cartoonist Prof Rafiqunabbi (popularly known as Ronobi) said that cartoons reflect the situation in society. "Cartoonists always identified corrupt people, but this suddenly stopped. Opportunity for the cartoonists to work freely would have to be created again," he said. Also speaking at the opening programme, former adviser to the caretaker government Adv Sultana Kamal said: "Though freedom of speech has been curtailed, we must continue our work in our respective fields." The exhibition will continue till Dec 11. bdnews24.
