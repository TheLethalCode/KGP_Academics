 Banja Kula, Bosnia, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bosnian Serbs voted for the Bosnian Serb Republic's president on Sunday and Prime Minister Milorad Dodik said his party's candidate had won the election to the mainly ceremonial post. Law professor Rajko Kuzmanovic, nominated by his Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), had won more than 45 percent out of the more than 60 percent of the votes counted so far, Dodik said. "This victory is a proof of our good policy. The Serb Republic will now again have the opportunity to function in a full capacity," Dodik told reporters in the SNSD headquarters. Ten candidates competed in the vote organised after the sudden death of President Milan Jelic in September. Analysts have said the poll was a test of support for Dodik rather than for Kuzmanovic, who is 76 and new to politics. "I will be the president of all Serb Republic citizens," said Kuzmanovic who has pledged to "protect the Serb Republic". Turnout was estimated at about 36 percent of the 1.1 million-strong electorate, the election commission said. The first preliminary results were expected at 2300 GMT. The Serb Republic is one of two autonomous regions that makes up Bosnia under the 1995 Dayton peace accords that ended the 1992-95 war. The Muslim-Croat federation is the other half. Bosnian Serbs hotly oppose the strengthening of Bosnia's central institutions, fearing it could diminish the autonomy they had won during and after the war. The region's president does not have decision-making powers but no law can be passed without his approval. Ognjen Tadic of the nationalist Serb Democratic Party (SDS) and Bosnia's ex-foreign minister Mladen Ivanic of the Party of Democratic Progress (PDP) are expected to be the runners-up. The region's president is elected after one round of voting with a simple majority deciding the winner
