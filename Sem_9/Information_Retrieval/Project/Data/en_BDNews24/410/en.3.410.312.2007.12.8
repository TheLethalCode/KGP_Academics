 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)Sheikh Hasina will file a writ petition with the High Court Sunday challenging the relocation of a Dhaka court to the Sangsad Bhaban premises to try the former prime minister, her lawyer said. Syed Rezaur Rahman, a lawyer for the detained Awami League chief, told bdnews24.com Saturday: "The Nov 26 circular by the law ministry on court relocation is illegal as the judiciary is now separate from the executive now." "We will file a writ appeal, and at the same time we will appear in court (on the Sangsad Bhaban premises," he said. Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are set to appear in court Sunday for a second time in a corruption case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury.

Hasina's lawyers debated the relocation decision with prosecution lawyers in court, prompting the judge to defer the proceedings to Sunday. bd
