 Dhaka, May 17 (bdnews24.com)A F M Abul Fateh, Bangladesh's first foreign secretary, turned 85 on Saturday, his family said. After his defection from Pakistan in July 1971, he was the most senior member of the Mujibnagar government-in-exile after the cabinet, as adviser to the acting president until after independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's return and as ambassador-at-large until just after liberation. He was the first Pakistani ambassador to defect during independence war in 1971 under what a fellow diplomat said "very dangerous circumstances". He was also the highest Bangladeshi official in Dhaka until the acting president and cabinet arrived after the victory. On his arrival in Dhaka, recalls one freedom fighter, he was driven under escort from the airport in order to become the first civilian official to lay a wreath at the ruins of the Shaheed Minar, an act planned to mark the first presence of the government in Dhaka. Fateh later witnessed many interesting and sometimes unfortunate things in the first couple of months of independence, living in Bangabhaban until Abu Sayeed Chowdhury became president. He politely declined Bangabandhu's offers of a continuation as adviser to the president and of becoming foreign minister, and got himself posted as first ambassador to Paris. Syed Badrul Ahsan in his column on New Age said Fateh was an unusual diplomat of his time: he was Bengali-born, but had managed to work his way up the ranks of the Pakistani power structure. Then when Bangladesh began seeking independence, it was a massive morale boost for the Bangladeshi people, for people of Fateh's stature to resign from the Pakistani power structure, and support the fledgling country of Bangladesh. His story was documented in a National Geographic documentary, 'Running for Freedom'. After the Pakistani military crackdown in March 1971, Fateh received a request from a former university dormitory mate, Syed Nazrul Islam, acting president in the Bangladesh government-in-exile, to join the liberation struggle. The announcement of Fateh's defection to the Bangladesh cause marked the first time a full ambassador had joined the fledgling Bangladesh diplomatic service. The Mujibnagar government made him ambassador-at-large, followed in Aug 1971 by the concurrent position of advisor to the acting president, a position he was to resign in Jan 1972 after the return to Bangladesh of independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He took up the position of Bangladesh's firstaAmbassador in Paris (1972-1976). The early part of this posting involved extensive travel in Africa to persuade African governments to recognise the independence of Bangladesh. In 1973 he represented Bangladesh at a Commonwealth conference for Youth Ministers in Lusaka. In 1975 he went to Morocco and, at a time of a shortage in supply of phosphates, managed to secure a substantial phosphate shipment for Bangladesh. His last post was as ambassador in Algiers (19771982). He represented the Bangladesh government at conferences on Namibia in Algiers of the United Nations (1980) and the Non Aligned Conference (1981). Retiring in 1982, he lived with his wife in Dhaka for ten years before they settled in London to be near their so
