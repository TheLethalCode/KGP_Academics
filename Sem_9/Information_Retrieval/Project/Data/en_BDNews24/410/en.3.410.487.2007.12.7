 MONROVIA, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in Liberia arrested the former head of the country's transitional government on Friday to face charges of embezzling $1.4 million while in office in the wake of a devastating civil war. Former businessman Gyude Bryant ran a power-sharing administration in the West African country for the two years following the 1989-2003 war, which killed some 200,000 people and devastated the nation's infrastructure. He was charged in February with embezzlement after an audit by West African regional bloc ECOWAS uncovered evidence of widespread graft during his 2003-2005 period in office. Two court officials and a dozen police officers arrested Bryant at his residence in the capital Monrovia before escorting him to the city's maximum security prison. "This is a very, very, very dark day for Liberia. This is the reward we get for restoring peace and democracy to our country," Bryant, dressed in a white shirt and olive-coloured trousers, told reporters as he was led into the compound. He said he did not know how long he would be in detention. Liberia's President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who came to power in post-war polls in 2005 as Africa's first elected female head of state, has vowed zero tolerance for corruption as she tries to return the country to its former prosperity. The Bryant administration, which grouped all the factions from the civil war, was tasked with guiding Africa's oldest independent republic to polls after ex-dictator Charles Taylor -- now on trial in The Hague for war crimes -- went into exile. Bryant has denied the findings of the ECOWAS report. He has warned that any prosecutions could prompt a constitutional crisis in the mineral-rich state by reopening the wounds of one of modern Africa's bloodiest wars. More than a million people were driven from their homes by the fighting, in which drugged child soldiers raped, mutilated and killed their way across the country in a conflict partly financed by diamonds from neighbouring war-torn Sierra Leone.
