<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf will lift emergency rule and restore the suspended constitution on Dec. 15, a day earlier than previously announced, Attorney General Malik Mohammad Qayyum said on Saturday. "It will be on the 15th," Qayyum said by telephone, adding he did not know why Musharraf had decided to end it a day earlier than originally planned. "Everybody says the emergency must be lifted, so earlier the better," he added. "Maybe it's because Dec. 16 is a Sunday. Musharraf's spokesman said he did not know if the date had been brought forward. Musharraf imposed the emergency on Nov.3, suspended the constitution and purged the Supreme Court to fend off challenges to his re-election.
