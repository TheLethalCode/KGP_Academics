<TITLE> India cancels $600 mln chopper deal with EADS: reports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has cancelled a $600-million deal to buy 197 military helicopters from EADS and may offer the contract to other bidders, newspapers said on Friday. Besides being a setback for EADS, the maker of the Airbus family of commercial jets, the deal's collapse will also further delay India's plans to replace its ageing helicopter fleet by at least two years, newspapers said. India will issue a fresh tender next year, a defence ministry source told the Hindustan Times. EADS' India office said it was not commenting on the defence ministry's decision.
