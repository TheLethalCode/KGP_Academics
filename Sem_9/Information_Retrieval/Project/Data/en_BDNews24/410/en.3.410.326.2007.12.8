<TITLE> Indonesian rights body may reopen cases under Suharto </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission wants to reopen six cases of human rights violations during former president Suharto's era that had been put on hold, a senior commission official said on Saturday. Achmad Baso, the commission's research coordinator on cases during Suharto's rule, said they included the killing of 5,000-10,000 Indonesians, mostly ethnic Chinese, in West Kalimantan in 1967-1968. The agency is also looking at cases of alleged human rights violations by the army in Aceh, which was torn by separatist violence for decades until a peace pact after the December 2004 tsunami, and in Papua where a low-level separatist insurgency has simmered for years. "I don't know why the previous team put the cases on hold. We started following up the reports as soon as we were elected in late August and expect to complete our report by the end of December," Baso told Reuters. The commission will meet next month to decide on whether it can reopen the cases. Many rights violations in Indonesia, including those during army operations in the once-rebellious Aceh province, were linked to government forces during the 32-year authoritarian regime of President Suharto and have failed to reach resolution. Former president Suharto, who turned 86 in June, ruled Indonesia until he was forced to resign amid violent protests in 1998. Jakarta has consistently denied any reports of rights violations by the military. Prosecutors have filed a civil suit against Suharto seeking to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in state funds allegedly misused by one of his charitable foundations. Both he and his family members deny any wrongdoing. Suharto was previously charged with graft but escaped prosecution because he was deemed too ill to stand trial. The civil suit against Suharto is seen as an important test of the government's pledge to clamp down on corruption. After the overthrow of Suharto, a former general, Indonesia has transformed into a young democracy with open political debate and wide-ranging freedoms. But critics say many of those guilty of rights abuses remain unpunished and endemic corruption persists, despite pledges by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, also a former general, to tackle these issues.
