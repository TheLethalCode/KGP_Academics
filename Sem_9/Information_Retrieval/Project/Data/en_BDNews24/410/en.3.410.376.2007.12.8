 Jhalakathi, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain Saturday said national wealth had been wasted in the past in the name of making voter identity cards with photographs. This time, the Election Commission is working fast in a coordinated way along with the army, district administration and people's representatives at the grass-root level, Sakhawat said at a meeting with people at Jhalkathi Pourashava. "All patriotic citizens should actively participate in the preparation of voter list and national identity cards," the commissioner said. Sakhawat said the EC was determined to present the nation a free and fair election with a transparent voter list and national ID cards. He also pointed out that there was red tape in the makings of the voter list in the past. On the role of the army he said: "The army has been relentlessly working on the voter list and national identity cards despite the natural disasters." "Those who could not sign up for the voter list within the timeframe will have an opportunity to get their names as voters," Sakhawat said. bdnews24.c
