<TITLE> NASA clears shuttle for launch try Sunday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cape Canaveral, Florida, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA will try again on Sunday to launch space shuttle Atlantis after imposing new flight rules to offset possible problems with a critical engine cutoff system. The shuttle, which is heading to the International Space Station to deliver Europe's Columbus science laboratory, is scheduled to lift off at 3:21 p.m. EST (2021 GMT) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Meteorologists predicted an 80-percent chance weather conditions would be suitable for launch. "All parties agreed that it was safe to go fly," shuttle program manager Wayne Hale told a news conference. NASA had hoped to be in orbit already, but an initial launch attempt on Thursday was called off after inaccurate readings from a pair of sensors in the shuttle's external fuel tank. The sensors are part of a backup system to cut off the shuttle's three hydrogen-burning main engines if the tank should run out of fuel during the climb to orbit due to a leak or other problem. Running the engines without propellant could cause their pumps to break and possibly trigger a catastrophic explosion. The motors consume 1,000 pounds (450 kg) of propellants per second during ascent, with pressures reaching 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit (3,300 degrees Celsius) -- hotter than the boiling point of steel. "It takes a great deal of courage for people to climb on board of that rocket ship and launch into space on any given day," Hale said. After two days of discussions, managers decided to attempt launch again despite the erratic sensors. "If everything works perfectly, as we expect from our past history, we will go fly," Hale said. "And if we have any more anomalies or a repeat of an anomaly, we will stand down and troubleshoot." That would suggest no more launch attempts in December, he added. READY TO STAND DOWN NASA will begin by refilling the shuttle's fuel tank with more than 500,000 gallons (2.2 million litres) of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen beginning about 6 a.m. EST (1100 GMT) and watching the fuel sensors carefully. The sensors have a history of glitches of unknown cause. Engineers believed they had traced the problem to a subtle manufacturing issue and solved the puzzle by replacing all suspect devices. Hale said the continued problems show that no one knows what is causing the discrepancies. Following Atlantis' mission, NASA will start another round of investigations and engine upgrades in an attempt to determine the cause of the problem. NASA has less than a week to get Atlantis and its crew of seven astronauts off the ground and still fit in an 11- to 13-day mission to the International Space Station. Repairs likely would entail removing the shuttle from the launch pad, bumping Atlantis' mission to mid-January. To protect against sensor failures after launch, ground controllers will constantly monitor the sensors. Atlantis also will launch on the most direct path to the space station, saving fuel so that there is less chance a leak or engine problem would trigger the fuel-depletion sensors during ascent. "Now could something bad happen in spite of all our caution? Yes," Hale said. "This is a risky business." NASA has 10 shuttle flights remaining to complete construction of the $100 billion space station. It also wants to make two resupply flights and a servicing call to the Hubble Space Telescope before the shuttle fleet is retired in 2010
