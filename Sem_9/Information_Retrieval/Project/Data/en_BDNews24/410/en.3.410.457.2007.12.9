 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chairman, Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, Sunday said the government should put people's interests first in making the Truth and Accountability Commission. "The commission's priorities should be the interests of the country and its people. The government and people will determine the activities of the commission," Chowdhury said at a seminar on the "UN Convention against Corruption: Implications for BangladeshWhat Next?" "The ACC has nothing to do with the Truth Commission," he said. A four-member committee has completed the draft of the Truth and Accountability Commission and submitted it to lieutenant general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, coordinator of the national coordination committee on curbing serious crimes. Advocate Anisul Huq, a member of the committee, told bdnews24.com Saturday that they had designed the structure and legal affairs of the commission for a one-year term. The ACC boss said: "We overcame a major hurdle by signing the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The results of our journey against corruption must be visible. No community or class can distract us from our mission." Fighting corruption is a complex task, he said. "It is not possible to wipe it out overnight. We just started work and I hope there will be results." TIB trustee board chairman Professor Muzaffer Ahmad stressed decentralisation of administration and said the size of the cabinet must be trimmed to curb corruption. "Corruption is a contagious disease. The commission must be aware of legal loopholes," Ahmad said. Establishment secretary Abdus Salam Khan stressed rewarding honest people to get rid of corruption. Former ACC chairman Professor Moniruzzaman Miah said politics and bureaucracy are the two issuesmost affected by corruption. Dr Iftekharuzzaman in his keynote speech said people are the main force for an anticorruption movement. "Corruption will gradually be curbed when the people hate and speak against corruption and take part in anticorruption activities," he said. The ACC and the Transparency International Bangladesh organised the seminar at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on International Anticorruption Day. bdnews
