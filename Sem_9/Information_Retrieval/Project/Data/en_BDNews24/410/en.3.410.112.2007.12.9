<TITLE> Ex-Thai PM`s unity govt call wins little support </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's proposal for a national unity government to rule Thailand for two years after an election this month has won little support from rivals back home. Thaksin, who has not returned to Thailand since he was overthrown, said in an interview with Reuters in Hong Kong on Friday that another poll should be held in two years under a new constitution. "It is up to leaders of all political parties to consider whether this kind of government is viable for running the country," General Sonthi Boonyaratglin, deputy prime minister and former army chief who staged a coup against Thaksin in 2006, told reporters on Sunday. Thaksin insisted in the interview he would never be prime minister again, but said the military junta that overthrew him would harm the country if it tried to rig the Dec. 23 general election. The People Power Party (PPP), taken over by Thaksin supporters after his party was dissolved for electoral fraud, is widely expected to win the most seats. But it is also expected to fall short of a majority because of a new constitution designed to prevent the return of strong, one-party government. Although he has lived in exile in London since he was ousted, Thaksin appears to have lost none of his attraction in rural areas which swept him to two landslide election victories. "FAR-FETCHED" Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the Democrat Party, the PPP's main poll rival, dismissed Thaksin's proposal as a premature gesture that would confuse the public. "I think the suggestion has come too early. Thais would be quite confused if, after listening to different policies of contesting parties, they end up seeing all these parties joining the same government," Abhisit told reporters on Saturday. National unity would be better served if contesting politicians toned down the language of attacks on rivals during campaigning, Abhisit said, referring to pro-Thaksin PPP leader Samak Sundaravej's fiery campaign speeches in recent weeks. Suvit Khunkitti, leader of Puea Pandin (For the Motherland) Party, said Thaksin should return to Thailand to fight criminal charges against him in court and help ease national polarization before talking about national reconciliation. "The proposed national unity government is a far-fetched idea as some parties have staked clear-cut positions of not joining others. The pro-Thaksin and anti-Thaksin camps have polarized society," he said. Many analysts believe the military will try to prevent the PPP from heading a coalition government in the 480-seat lower house. Thaksin, who faces corruption charges, said some elements in the junta that overthrew him were trying to "save face" by aiding his opponents
