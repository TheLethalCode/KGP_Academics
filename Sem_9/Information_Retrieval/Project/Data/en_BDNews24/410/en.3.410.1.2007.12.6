<TITLE> Kosovo makes del Ponte lose hope for Mladic arrest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 THE HAGUE, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia is unlikely to capture a major war crimes suspect in the coming weeks because potential Kosovo independence is distracting Belgrade, the chief UN war crimes prosecutor said on Thursday. Carla del Ponte, who visited Belgrade on Monday, said she had become much less optimistic that former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic, suspected of genocide, would be caught before she steps down at the end of the year. She had recently said she saw an "80 percent" chance of his arrest in December or January. "Politically it is a very delicate situation," del Ponte told Reuters in an interview. "In the end the Kosovo decision, in my personal evaluation, prevents the arrest of Mladic." Negotiations between Serbia and its breakaway Kosovo province formally end on Monday and international mediators have said there is no chance of a compromise, with Kosovo's Albanian majority expected to declare independence in early 2008. Despite Serbia's potential loss of its medieval heartland, del Ponte said it was crucial for the European Union to keep up pressure on Serbia to hand over Mladic. EU foreign ministers will discuss the issue at a meeting on Monday. "Some states are coming now and saying poor Serbia. What? Serbia is hiding war criminals. Justice must not be neglected because of political issues," she said. "The political will today is that Mladic should be in The Hague to allow Serbia to continue the procedure to enter the European Union, but politically they don't want to arrest him and they know they could not persuade him to voluntarily surrender," she said.
