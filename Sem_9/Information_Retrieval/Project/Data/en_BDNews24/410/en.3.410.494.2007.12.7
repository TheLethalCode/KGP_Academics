<TEXT>
 MILAN, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A bottom side Empoli beat 10-man Juventus 2-1 at home in an Italian Cup last 16 first leg match on Thursday. Juve, third in Serie A, fielded a much-changed side from their usual league lineup and paid the price when Empoli's Nicola Pozzi scored on 19 minutes when his header came down off the bar and just crossed the line. Ignazio Abate extended the Tuscan side's lead six minutes into the second half before Juve's former Empoli midfielder Sergio Almiron was sent off for a foul and subsequent protest. Italy striker Vincenzo Iaquinta pulled one back for Juve 10 minutes from time to give the visitors hope of going through when Empoli go to Turin for the second leg on Jan. 16. Alessandro Del Piero started for a near second-string Juve after being a substitute for their last two outings. The other first leg fixtures in the round are spread across December with the second legs also due to take place in mid-January
