<TITLE> Iran's Sepahan beat Kiwi part-timers 3-1 in Japan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Sepahan brushed aside New Zealand part-timers Waitakere United 3-1 in the opening game of the Club World Cup on Friday. Waitakere's collection of teachers, salesmen and builders were caught cold in Tokyo as striker Emad Mohammed effectively killed the game off with two goals in the first four minutes. Sepahan's comfortable win gives them the opportunity to avenge their defeat by Japan's Urawa Reds in last month's Asian Champions League final in Toyota on Monday. Mohammed's two poacher's strikes left Waitakere stunned before his fellow Iraqi Abu Al Hail added a third two minutes into the second half. Late pressure from the New Zealanders earned them a consolation goal in the 74th minute, Darren Bazeley credited as the ball slipped under goalkeeper Mohammad Savari. European champions AC Milan and South American Libertadores Cup holders Boca Juniors join the seven-team tournament at the semi-final stage next week
