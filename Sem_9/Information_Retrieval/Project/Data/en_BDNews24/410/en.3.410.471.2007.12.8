<TITLE> All nations must join climate fight: Bali draft </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All nations will have to do more to fight climate change, with deep greenhouse gas cuts by rich nations to avoid the worst impacts of a warmer world, a draft proposal at UN talks said on Saturday. The four-page draft, written by delegates from Indonesia, Australia and South Africa as an unofficial guide for delegates at the 190-nation talks, said developing nations should at least brake rising emissions as part of new global climate pact. It said there was "unequivocal scientific evidence" that "preventing the worst impacts of climate change will require (developed nations) to reduce emissions in a range of 25-40 percent below 1990 levels by 2020."
