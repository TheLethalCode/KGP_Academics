 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com)  Sidr survivors have suggested designing schools, colleges and government installations to double up as shelters in the disaster-prone coastal areas. A leading disaster management expert echoed them. They said multi-purpose local government offices, health centres and drainage systems would save crores of taka in reconstruction costs and ensure that there were enough shelters for people and livestock in emergencies. bdnews24.com correspondent Abu Noman Sajib was told by people during a Nov 24-30 tour of the ravaged areas of Barguna and Patuakhali, the districts hardest-hit by the tropical storm, that there were few shelters to turn to when they scurried for cover on the night of Nov 15. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed this week told ambassadors and representatives of donor agencies that Bangladesh would require $1 billion in total assistance to rebuild the coastal districts in the south and southwest. Mohammed Yunus, a clerk at Garjanbunia High School in Barguna Sadar, said, "Building single-purpose cyclone shelters will be very expensive. It's better to build them for dual purpose use, as educational institutions and shelter centres during the disasters." "It will save cost and benefit both them and us." Yunus said with no shelter centres around one to two kilometres, several hundred people of the villages jostled each other into the lone shelter centre to save life. Md Abdul Jabbar Akhand, 70, headmaster of Nawab Sir Salimullah Secondary School, said that 60 schools and as many madrasas had been completely damaged in Barguna Sadar. "We hear the government will construct several thousand more educational institutions in. Instead of building new shelter centres, the damaged schools should be rebuilt in a way so that people can take shelter during disasters." The villagers said the shelters should have space for cattle, otherwise people would not feel encouraged to come to shelter centres leaving the livestock to face the fury of nature. The immediate-past deputy commissioner of the remote district agrees with the locals. Md Altaf Hossain, who was recently withdrawn from Barguna as deputy commissioner, said: "In Barguna district alone, Sidr smashed to the ground 300 educational institutions and partially damaged 587 others." "In the circumstances, the totally damaged schools can be repaired to make them work as shelters. There won't be much difference in spending." Disaster management expert and BRAC University vice chancellor Prof Jamilur Reza Chowdhury said: "I headed a review team in 1992-93 funded by the UNDP and supervised the World Bank. We did not recommend building only cyclone centres. "We suggested new designs in case of building up new schools. It would have enabled the schools to be used as rehabilitation centres. The then government implemented the recommendation partially. "If the recommendations were fully implemented the number of casualties by Sidr would have been much less," said Prof Chowdhury, a former caretaker government adviser. "People will not go to the shelter centres if arrangements are not there to provide shelter to their cattle as well. This aspect needs to be taken into account." bdnews
