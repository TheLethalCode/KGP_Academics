 Washington, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Coast Guard on Thursday announced record annual cocaine seizures worth more than $4.7 billion and said trafficking in the illicit drug appears to be shifting from the Caribbean to the Pacific. The Coast Guard said it captured 355,755 pounds (161,368 kg) of cocaine in the past year. The largest seizure was 20 tons (18.1 metric tonnes) of the narcotic discovered aboard a Panamanian vessel in March. Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen said drug smugglers have resorted to riskier tactics to evade interdiction at sea including the practice of dissolving cocaine in diesel fuel. The Coast Guard, the leading US maritime law enforcement agency, said smugglers are also turning increasingly to Pacific Ocean routes, including via the Galapagos Islands, due to aggressive enforcement efforts that it said have all but shut down major routes in the Caribbean Sea. Colombia is the world's biggest producer of cocaine, followed by its Andean neighbors Peru and Bolivia, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The United States has bilateral agreements with 26 Caribbean and South American countries that allow the Coast Guard to operate outside US territorial waters in an effort to interdict smugglers in foreign-flag vessels.
