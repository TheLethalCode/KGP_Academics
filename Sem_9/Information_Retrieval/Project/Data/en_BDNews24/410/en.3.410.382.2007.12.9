<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court bench Sunday approved an appeal by detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina to file a writ petition challenging the relocation of a court, which is dealing with charges of extortion against her, a lawyer said. A two-member panel of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Abdul Awal gave the approval after Hasina's lawyers appealed to the bench, said barrister Shafique Ahmed, a Hasina counsel. Shafique said they would file the writ petition sometime later Sunday after completing necessary procedures. He hoped the same bench would hear the appeal later Sunday after the petition was filed. If the writ is filed finally, it would actually challenge relocation of the court of Metropolitan Sessions Judge M Azizul Haque to Sangasd Bhaban area from Johnson Road. The court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises Sunday started proceedings of the charge framing against the former prime minister in her absence, as she was not produced before the court because of her sickness. Authorities have been keeping Hasina in a special jail, which is very close to the relocated court, since July 16. The state side had earlier said the relocation was necessary for security reasons while defence counsels had argued the process was illegal after the judiciary got separated from the executive. The case involves charges of extortion from businessman Azam J Chowdhury, who accused Hasina of taking about Tk3 crore during her 1996-2001 term in return for allowing him to build a power plant. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. All of them rejected the charges, and the Awami League has said the charges are aimed at tarnishing the image of the party chief. Hasina believes the charges are designed to prevent her from contesting next polls. bdne
