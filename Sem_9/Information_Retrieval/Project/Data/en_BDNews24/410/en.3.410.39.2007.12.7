<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have not called up an extra batsman following the retirement of Sanath Jayasuriya for the second test against England starting on Sunday. "We have not added any additional players and Upul (Tharanga) will now open the batting with Michael Vandort," captain Mahela Jayawardene told Reuters on Friday. There had been speculation that Jehan Mubarak's place in the middle order was under threat after he contributed only nine runs to Sri Lanka's victory in the first test. "The middle order is a bit of concern but we have to be fair to the youngsters we have identified and give them a decent run," Jayawardene added. Sri Lanka are unlikely to make changes to their bowling attack. "The bowling combination will depend on the pitch but knowing the SSC it will probably be three seamers and Murali," Jayawardene said. Sri Lanka lead the three-match series 1-0 after beating England by 88 runs in Kandy. "We have got to take forward the confidence we got with the win in Kandy," said Jayawardene. "It was a confidence booster for us for the rest of the series and we should not lower our guard and allow England to come back." Sri Lanka squad - Mahela Jayawardene (Capt), Kumar Sangakkara, Michael Vandort, Upul Tharanga, Chamara Silva, Jehan Mubarak, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Lasith Malinga, Dilhara Fernando, Malinga Bandara, Sujeewa de Silva, Muttiah Muralitharan
