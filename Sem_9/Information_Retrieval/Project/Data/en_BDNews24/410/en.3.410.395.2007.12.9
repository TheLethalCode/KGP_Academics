 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The fire department stopped rescue operations at the collapsed Rangs Building Sunday as the condition of the building was "too risky to continue". Fire service officials and Tejgaon police said at least three bodies were buried by the rubble inside the building but no further recovery was possible for the present. Tejgaon police officer in charge Lutfor Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Three bodies are reportedly lying inside the building. There might be others trapped inside the building." Fire Service and Civil Defence trainer Debashish Bardhan told bdnews24.com that associate professor Dr Raquib Ahsan and assistant professor Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed of the BUET's civil engineering department had visited the site and announced it too risky. "The recovery work has been stopped following the advice of Dr Raquib," he said. Debashish said the BUET professors told the fire department that no work involving vibrations should be carried out inside the building. "They fear further serious accidents may happen," he added. Rafiqur Rahman, director general of the Fire Service and Civil Defence Directorate, also visited the spot, Debashish said. Rangs general manager (corporate) Kutub Uddi briefed journalist at the building premises. He said the court ordered demolition of Rangs Bhaban above six stories, but did not order demolition of the first six floors. "Now the whole building has become risky. Given their backgrounds many workers and officers are virtually on the streets. We do not even have any place to store the office goods. The government will have to arrange this for us." bdnews24.com/lh/
