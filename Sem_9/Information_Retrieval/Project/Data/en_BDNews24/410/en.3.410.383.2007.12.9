 TEHRAN, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters demanding the release of detained Iranian students tore down the bars of a gate at Tehran's main university on Sunday, an Iranian media report said and photographs showed. The demonstration was held a day after Iran's Intelligence Ministry said it had detained several people who were planning an "illegal gathering" at Tehran University. The student protesters chanted slogans against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and carried placards with slogans such as "Live free or die", "No war, no fascism" and "Women must decide their fate, not the state." Iranian state radio, monitored by the BBC in London, said "some other people, who did not seem to be students and did not have student cards, entered the university by breaking one of the doors." Photographs obtained by Reuters showed some protesters trying to tear down bars on one of the university's gates, with several of them already bent. The official IRNA news agency, saying protesters carried placards bearing the names of four detained students, did not mention the gate in its report but said some protesters threw stones at police without hitting them. The Fars News Agency said the protest ended peacefully: "The students were chanting anti-president slogans criticising Ahmadinejad's policies on different issues." Tehran University is the largest and one of the oldest universities in Iran. Student protests have been relatively rare in recent years in Iran, which is embroiled in a nuclear row with the United States and is often criticised by Western rights groups for cracking down on dissent at home. But last month students gathered at Tehran University to protest against the detention of three fellow students who were picked up during a small demonstration at another Iranian university a week earlier. Liberal-minded students and academics have criticised Ahmadinejad for clamping down on dissent on campuses. The president and his government say they support free speech and welcome constructive opposition.
