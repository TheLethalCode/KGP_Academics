 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government will take action against private firm Six Star for the Rangs Building floor collapse that killed one worker and injured several others, an adviser said Sunday. Housing and public works adviser Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com by telephone: "The firm was awarded the job because of their experience in the field. Such an accident is not expected from an experienced company." The adviser expressed his sorrows over the death and injuries of workers. "The injured will be given proper medical treatment," he said. "The government is not doing the demolition work directly. The construction firm was allowed to do the job as it claimed to be efficient." "The housing and public works secretary is looking into the matter," he said. bdnews24.c
