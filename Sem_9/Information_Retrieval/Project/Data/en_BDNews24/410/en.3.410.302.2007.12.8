<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Iran has sent a protest letter to the United States accusing it of spying on the Islamic state's nuclear activities, the official IRNA news reported on Saturday, citing the country's foreign minister. The letter, submitted to the Swiss embassy in Tehran which handles US interests in the country, was in reaction to a US intelligence report published last Monday which said Iran halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003. "The ministry submitted a letter to the Swiss embassy in Tehran ... demanding explanations over America's espionage on Iran's nuclear case," Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki was quoted as saying by IRNA.
