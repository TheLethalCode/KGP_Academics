 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan club captain Paolo Maldini has quashed rumours of a shock retirement after the Club World Cup. The 39-year-old, who is hanging up his boots at the end of the season after 22 years at Milan, said on Friday he would not be making an emotional farewell in Japan, despite reports to the contrary in the Italian press. "I have a contract with Milan until next June and I have no intention of not honouring it," Maldini told reporters. "I am fit and focused on winning the Club World Cup." The stylish defender does not have fond memories of Japan or Asia in general. Maldini was on the losing side in the Club World Cup's forerunner -- a one-off match between the champions of Europe and South America -- in 1993, 1994 and 2003. He also quit the Italy team in 2002 after they were dramatically knocked out of the World Cup in South Korea, Maldini outjumped by Ahn Jung-Hwan for the hosts' extra-time winner. "I don't like thinking back to those games," said Maldini, who won Intercontinental Cup medals with Milan in 1989 and 1990. "But this Club World Cup is a huge tournament and extremely important to Milan. Hopefully, I can channel those disappointments in a positive way here." European champions Milan and South American Libertadores Cup holders Boca Juniors join the competition at the semi-final stage next week. Milan play either Japan's Urawa Reds or the winners of Friday's opening game between Iranian side Sepahan or New Zealand part-timers Waitakere United. Carlo Ancelotti's side have a week to prepare for their semi-final and a Kaka-inspired Milan will be favourites to give Europe a first victory in the revamped FIFA competition. "We are not too worried," a relaxed-looking Ancelotti said. "It will be difficult but we believe we have the power and the quality to win the title." Brazilian clubs triumphed in the first two editions of the new-look tournament, Sao Paulo beating Liverpool 1-0 in 2005 and Internacional stunning Barcelona by the same score last year
