<TEXT>
 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  The two-day SAARC foreign ministers' meeting, beginning today in the Indian capital New Delhi, will focus largely on creating of a Poverty Alleviation Fund and Infrastructure Fund as well as prospects of starting a South Asian Development Bank. The proposed SAARC Development Fund would have three windows. The Social Window, with an initial corpus of US$300 million, is planned to fund, among others, poverty alleviation programmes and projects. Through the Infrastructure Window, funds would be mobilised, from within and beyond the region, to finance infrastructure projects. The Economic Window, which is expected to be professionally managed, would fund other non-infrastructure commercial projects. To be eligible for the fund, each project must find acceptance in at least two member-states. India has committed to provide $ 100 million to the fund while Nepal will have to cough up $ 35 million. An agreement on the Development Fund could not be reached at the SAARC summit earlier this year because of differences over which country will contribute how much. The meet will also review progress on various other proposals, including setting up of tele-medicine network, a SAARC University and a SAARC Food Bank. bd
