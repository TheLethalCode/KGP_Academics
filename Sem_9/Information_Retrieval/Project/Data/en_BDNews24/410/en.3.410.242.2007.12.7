<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  The wives of the Rajshahi University teachers who were jailed for two years urged university authorities Friday not to rush a decision on their jobs. Swapna Banerjee, Susmita Chakrabarty, Shanchita Ray and Udisha Islam, wives of professors Moloy Kumar Bhowmik, Selim Reza Newton, Dulal Chandra Biswas and Abdullah Al Mamun, made the request when they visited RU vice chancellor Prof Altaf Hossain Friday. They told the VC that they feared a decision to terminate the jobs of the jailed teachers might be taken at a university syndicate meeting scheduled for Dec 10, as reported by some newspapers. The reports had prompted them to call on the VC and express their concern, they told reporters. They said they had also asked the VC not to keep the issue on the meeting agenda. Prof Hossain told newsmen that the wives had said they would file a mercy petition on behalf of the families for the government to pardon the four teachers. The VC added that he had told the wives if they did file such an appeal on humanitarian grounds, he would surely recommend it. He avoided an answer on whether they had said anything to him about termination of the jobs of their husbands. No appeal has been made in the higher court against the jail sentences of the teachers because their defence counsel had not received a copy of the verdict, according to one of their lawyers, Golam Arif Tipu. The court sentenced the four teachers to two years in jail on Dec 4 for violating emergency powers rules during the August campus unrest at Rajshahi University. bdnews24.
