 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion Thursday seized corporate documents and files from Grameenphone apparently to unpack its alleged links to illegal VoIP business. In another closely-timed raid, RAB officers busted some equipment, believed to be used for VoIP operations, from AccessTEL, a broadband service provider, which allegedly secured E-1 connections from GP. Major Mohammad Shamsuzzoha, RAB intelligence wing deputy director, told bdnews24.com that the RAB officers raided the GP head office at Celebration Point in Gulshan at 10am Thursday. Shamsuzzoha led the raid that continued into late Thursday night. VoIP and IP telephony allows computer users to make phone calls over the internet. An E-1 connection can run 256 phone links. "We have seized corporate files and other documents on technical data (from GP)," he said. "It may take two to three days to check all the data and files. If need be, we have to seize more files," Shamsuzzoha told bdnews24.com by phone. The officer alleged that AccessTEL ran VoIP business with E-1 connections from GP from July 2006 to February 2007. Shamsuzzoha said AccessTELits head office located in Concord Tower on Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenuestashed away VoIP accessories in cartons after the elite force had launched a crackdown on VoIP business. Another RAB officer said he was all but certain that GP had provided E-1 connections for AccessTEL. GP, the country's largest mobile phone operator by subscribers, was fined Tk 168 crore ($25.2 million) by Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission for its alleged involvement in VoIP operations that cost the government millions in lost revenue. bdn
