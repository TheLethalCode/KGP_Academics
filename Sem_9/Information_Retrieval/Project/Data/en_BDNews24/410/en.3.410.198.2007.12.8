 MANCHESTER, England, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England defender Wes Brown could leave Manchester United after rejecting a new contract, said manager Alex Ferguson. Brown, whose existing deal expires at the end of the season, has failed to agree terms on an extended contract with the Premier League champions and will not receive another offer. "He has not agreed anything, which is entirely up to Wes," Ferguson told reporters. "We feel we have made him a good offer. "We have had several meetings with his agent. Some agents are difficult. They have rejected our last offer so that's the end of it. We won't be going back." Ferguson said the 28-year-old, who has been at Old Trafford since leaving school, may leave on a free transfer at the end of the season. "It's a possibility. It would be a disappointment," said the United manager. The versatile Brown has been a regular for United this season, playing at right back in place of injured captain Gary Neville
