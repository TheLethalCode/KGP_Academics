<TITLE> WTO conditions put economy, culture at stake: experts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) - The World Trade Organisation (WTO) often imposes conditions in agreements on the developing countries, which put at stake the economy, politics, culture and even sovereignty of poor countries. The remark came from a discussion Friday afternoon marking the unwrapping of a book titled "National Law in WTO". Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin was the chief guest at the function held at the BRAC Inn Centre at Mohakhali. Economist and former caretaker government adviser Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud, writer of the book Dr Shrafiuddin Bhuiyan were present among others. The chief justice said the book focused on many legal loopholes that creep up due to uneven agreement between WTO and underdeveloped countries. The book presented in detail the lack of transparency in WTO agreements and it would serve the students of law and economics, he said. Prof Mahmud said the World Bank often becomes a threat to the economy, politics, culture and sovereignty of poor countries. Jurist Dr Kamal Hossain said the publication of the book was timely. Cambridge University Press has simultaneously published the book from Cambridge and New York. bdne
