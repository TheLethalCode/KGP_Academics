<TITLE> Africa rejects EU trade deals, wants more talks: Wade </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LISBON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Most African leaders refuse to accept Economic Partnership Agreements demanded by the European Union and want to negotiate different accords to replace them, Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade said on Sunday. "We are not talking any more about EPAs, we've rejected them ... we're going to meet to see what we can put in place of the EPAs," Wade told reporters on the second and final day of an EU-Africa summit in Lisbon. The Senegalese president said he had led stiff opposition by the majority of African leaders against the accords at the summit, which had been called to forge a new cooperation partnership between Europe and Africa. An EU spokesman said European countries would not raise tariffs on imports from African countries that reject trade deals. "There will not be a unilateral decision by the European Union to raise tariffs on Jan. 1, but there will be legal uncertainty, any non-African country can go to the WTO with a complaint," Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said. The EU has been pressing developing countries to sign the new trade deals, or temporary accords instead, before Dec. 31, when a World Trade Organisation waiver on preferential trade with the European bloc expires. African governments and anti-poverty campaigners say vulnerable African economies will suffer from the impact of the end of preferential trade with the EU. "I agree with this spirit of creating a new relationship (with Europe), but we have to define what that relationship is," Wade said, adding: "It's clear that Africa rejects the EPAs".
