<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission Sunday sued Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia in separate cases that involve awarding deals to Canadian oil company Niko Resources by abusing power, police said. Inspector Lutfar Rahman, OC of Tejgaon Police Station, told bdnews24.com that two ACC deputy directors had filed separate cases against the two former prime ministers. Six other persons have been accused in the case filed against Hasina by ACC deputy director AMM Sabbir Hasan. They are former state minister for energy Prof Rafiqul Islam, former principal secretary to the Prime Minister's Office SA Samad, and former energy secretaries Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury and M Akmal Hossain, former Petrobangla chairman Md Mosharraf Hossain and Niko Resources official Kashem Sharif. The case filed against Khaleda also involves former minister barrister Moudud Ahmed, former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former acting secretary Khandaker Shahidul Islam and Kashem Sharif. Kashem is accused in both cases. Another ACC deputy director, Mahbubul Alam, filed the case against Khaleda. ALLEGATIONS The then prime minister Sheikh Hasina approved a Niko deal in 2001, which cost the government Tk 13,630.50 crore in losses, according to case details. The case alleged that Niko Resources was "very inefficient" in different aspects, including technical know-how for oil explorations, but the deal was approved in violations of a proper procedure. The BNP-led government also connived with Niko in implementing an "illegal" joint venture agreement soon after the alliance assumed power in October 2001, it was alleged in the case filed against Khaleda. Niko applied to state minister for energy Mosharraf Hossain to close the deal, but some experts of Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company and Petrobangla opposed the agreement, according to case details. Khaleda, the then prime minister, allegedly ignored opinions of the gas experts and took sides with Niko on the deal, costing the state Tk 10,000 crore in losses. SHADY DEALS  Niko took part in bidding in 1997 for oil and gas explorations in Bangladesh but a Petrobangla committee declared it unfit.  Niko pressed on. In alleged collusion with Hasina and six co-accused persons, the oil company collected "secret data" about some gasfields having huge gas reserves.  Niko turned in a "letter of intent" to the Prime Minister's Office on Oct 8, 1997 for exploring the gasfields in Fenchuganj, Chhatak and Kamta.  The PMO rejected the proposal, leading Niko to eye a joint venture with Bapex to explore the gasfields which were termed "marginal and non-productive".  On June 28, 1998, Niko submitted another proposal to the energy ministry.  The then energy secretary Towfique-e-Elahi Chowdhury sought opinions from Petrobangla on the proposal.  Petrobangla and Bapex gas experts opposed the proposal.  But the then Petrobangla chairman Md Mosharraf Hossain backed the proposal and returned it to the energy ministry with a favourable comment that an agreement might be signed with Niko through Bapex.  Hasina approved the proposal and her government prepared a draft agreement for Niko in 2001. Hasina also signed a memorandum of understanding with Niko.  The joint venture deal was not complete.  In 2003, the then prime minister Khaleda Zia in alleged collusion with her co-accused including former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain asked related officials to arrange the signing of a joint venture agreement between Bapex and Niko allegedly for personal gains and Niko's benefit.  Some Petrobangla and Bapex officials stood in Niko's way. To resolve probable legal hurdles, Niko engaged the then law minister Moudud Ahmed in its efforts to clinch the deal. bdnews
