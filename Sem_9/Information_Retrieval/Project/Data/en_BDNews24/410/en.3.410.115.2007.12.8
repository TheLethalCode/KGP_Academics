 BOSTON, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's crackdown on democracy protests in September killed at least 31 people, three times the official count, with up to 4,000 arrested and 1,000 still detained, a report by a UN's rights envoy showed on Friday. The report, to be presented at the United Nations on Dec 11, said Myanmar's military rulers used "excessive force against civilians" in quelling the monk-led street protests against high fuel prices and falling living standards. The 77-page report, written by UN special rapporteur Paulo Sergio Pinheiro following his Nov 11-15 fact-finding visit, is among the fullest accounts to date of the suppression of the country's largest uprising since 1988. Official media in Myanmar have only acknowledged that 10 people died in the crackdown. Pinheiro said authorities confirmed to him 15 deaths and that he had found evidence of a further 16 people killed in street demonstrations. Along with live ammunition and rubber bullets, authorities used a range of weapons against protesters including tear gas, smoke grenades, wooden sticks, rubber batons and slingshots, said the report obtained by Reuters. It said between 3,000 and 4,000 people were arrested, compared to the official count of 2,927. Between 500 and 1,000 protesters "are still detained at the time of writing." "In addition, 1,150 political prisoners held prior to the protests have not been released," Pinheiro wrote. He described large-capacity informal detention centers and said he had credible reports of a special punishment area known as "military dog cells" in Yangon's notorious Insein Prison. This consists of a compound of nine tiny isolation cells measuring 6-1/2 feet (two metres) by 6-1/2 feet (two metres) constantly guarded by a troop of 30 dogs. Its inmates were held in "degrading conditions," the report said. Cells lacked ventilation or toilets. Detainees, mostly political prisoners, slept on thin mats on the concrete floor and were only allowed to bathe with cold water once every three days for five minutes, the report said. One detainee described being forced to kneel bare-legged on broken bricks and to stand on tiptoes for long periods. Monks were disrobed and intentionally fed in the afternoon when they are religiously forbidden to eat, the report said. Pinheiro said Myanmar's rulers had failed to take serious steps to respect human rights. His findings contrast with UN special envoy Ibrahim Gambari's upbeat assessment on Nov. 13 when he said the situation in Myanmar was improving. "The use of lethal force by law enforcement officials from 26 to 29 September 2007 in Myanmar was inconsistent with the fundamental principles reflected in the basic international norms deriving from international customary law," Pinheiro said. The military has run the reclusive Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma since 1962, refusing to hand over power after the National League of Democracy, the party led by opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, won a 1990 election.
