 Berlin, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana expects no violence in Serbia's breakaway province Kosovo after the deadline for mediated talks between Pristina and Belgrade expires on Monday, a German newspaper reported. "I don't expect unrest after Dec. 10," Solana was quoted on Sunday as saying in an interview with Welt am Sonntag newspaper. "I expect that the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians will be prudent and won't risk stability in the Balkans." "I'm confident that Belgrade and Pristina will keep their word not to resort to violence and will do nothing that could threaten security in Kosovo or elsewhere," he said. Mediators on the future of Kosovo said in a report made available on Friday that four months of mediated talks between Belgrade and Pristina had failed to reach a deal because neither side would yield on the key question of Kosovo's sovereignty. With no deal agreed, the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo is widely expected to declare independence early next year, a move key Western countries are likely to accept. Despite their disagreements, Solana made it clear that there was agreement between Serbia and Kosovo about their future position inside Europe. "It is clear that the future of Serbia and Kosovo lies in the European Union. That's something that both sides agree on," Solana said. The United States and almost all EU member states support independence for the territory, seeing it as the best way to ensure stability in the Balkans. Kosovo Albanians say they will declare it within weeks. But Russia, an ally of Serbia, asked again on Friday for talks to continue until the two sides reach an agreement. It has said it wants any final solution for Kosovo to go through the United Nations Security Council, where Russia has a veto. Serbia also called on Saturday for further talks with Kosovo. Analysts dismiss talk of war, but say low-level violence is to be expected. NATO fears Serbs in the north, where they form the majority, could try to break away from an independent Kosovo, potentially sparking Albanian retaliation against isolated Serb enclaves elsewhere in the province. Diplomats say Kosovo could declare independence in late January at the earliest
