<TITLE> Nigeria wants to work on gas project with Algeria </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABUJA, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria has proposed working with Algeria on the idea of building a transatlantic gas pipeline to make better use of gas reserves in the Gulf of Guinea, the president's spokesman said in a statement on Sunday. President Umaru Yar'Adua proposed to his Algerian counterpart Abdelaziz Bouteflika that the two countries should set up a joint committee to work on the idea and Bouteflika accepted, the statement said. The two presidents met on the fringes of a summit between Africa and the European Union in Lisbon. Algeria is the third-biggest gas supplier to Europe and its coastline is on the Mediterranean Sea unlike Nigeria which has an Atlantic coast. The Nigerian statement did not make clear what would be the benefit of Algerian involvement in a transatlantic gas pipeline project. Both countries are OPEC members and are already working together, along with Niger, on a plan to pipe Nigerian gas across the Sahara. It would then cross the Mediterranean via a growing network of pipelines that now transport Algerian gas. They are still looking for investors. Nigeria is the world's eighth-biggest exporter of crude oil but even though it has the seventh-largest proven gas reserves in the world it has not developed its gas industry to anywhere near full potential. About 2.5 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas associated with the extraction of crude oil are burnt off every day because there is no infrastructure to make use of the gas. Nigeria exports about 3 bcf per day through a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant but is able to supply only about 0.5 bcf to domestic power plants which are starved of gas and would require about four times that amount. One of the problems is that it has been unable to fix a sabotaged gas pipeline from the oil and gas heartland, the Niger Delta, to a key power plant near Lagos. A West African gas pipeline supposed to provide Nigerian gas to Benin, Togo and Ghana has been repeatedly delayed, although officials have promised it would go into operation on Dec. 23. Plans to start building two more LNG plants have been delayed because of a violent crisis in the Niger Delta and because of the absence of legislation on gas investments and taxation
