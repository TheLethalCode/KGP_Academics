<TITLE> US House passes energy bill, Bush set to veto </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US House of Representatives on Thursday passed an energy bill that would boost vehicle fuel economy requirements by 40 percent by 2020, raise ethanol use by five-fold by 2022 and impose $13 billion in new taxes on big energy companies. The centerpiece of the 1,055-page Energy Independence and Security Act is an increase in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards to 35 miles per gallon (15 km per liter) by 2020, the first congressional boost in fuel rules since 1975. The plan -- an amalgam of energy priorities driven by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- passed by 235-181 in a mostly party-line vote. But it faces resistance in the Senate and the White House says it will veto the measure in its current form. Analysts say the bill is unlikely to survive in its current form, but a stripped-down version could become law if controversial tax and renewable electricity provisions are dropped. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said he wants to call a vote on the bill in coming days, before Congress adjourns later this month. Senate Republicans and the Bush administration say they will block a final bill if it includes a $21.5 billion tax package and a mandate for utilities to get 15 percent of their power from renewable sources like wind and solar by 2020. Pelosi called the bill "a historic opportunity" and "a shot heard around the world for energy independence," with crude oil prices near $90 a barrel and retail gasoline over $3 a gallon. Republicans called it a "no energy bill" because it doesn't open new U.S. acreage to oil and natural gas drilling. They said the bill will do nothing to curb soaring prices for gasoline and home heating fuels. "The Democratic majority's remarkably undemocratic process has produced a bill that harms more than it helps and has no chance of being signed into law," said Rep. Joe Barton, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee. The House bill also contains popular provisions to boost use of renewable fuels like ethanol to 36 billion gallons by 2022. Ethanol, blended mostly from corn in the United States, is popular in Midwest states like Iowa. But to allay anger from livestock growers and food makers, who have seen corn costs soar with ethanol use, the bill caps the amount of corn-blended ethanol at 15 billion gallons. The rest -- 21 billion gallons -- would come from nonfood "cellulosic" sources like switchgrass and wood chips by 2022. The bill's tax provision -- worth about $21.5 billion over 10 years -- would dangle federal tax incentives for homeowners and businesses to buy new solar arrays, wind turbines and hybrid gas-electric cars. To pay for most of the renewable incentives, the House bill repeals about $13 billion in tax subsidies extended to big oil and gas producers like Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips and Chevron Corp. The rest of the money comes from other revenue raisers, such as a change in reporting requirements for stock sales, estimated to generate $4.1 billion, and an extension of federal unemployment taxes.
