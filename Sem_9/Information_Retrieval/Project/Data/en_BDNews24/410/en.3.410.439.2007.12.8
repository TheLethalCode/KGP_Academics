<TITLE> Britain to take three Guantanamo detainees: lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Guantanamo inmates who are British residents will be released under an agreement between Britain and the United States, their lawyer said on Friday. Jamil El Banna of Jordan, Omar Deghayes of Libya and Abdenour Sameur of Algeria are expected to be returned to Britain shortly and are not expected remain in custody there, said Zachary Katznelson, a lawyer with the British organization Reprieve that represents the three men. He was not able to say when the release would happen. "I can confirm to you that the British government has reached an agreement with the Americans that the men will be repatriated to England, where they are all legal permanent residents. They actually all got asylum from their home countries," he said. Katznelson said Britain initiated the agreement. Pentagon spokesman J.D. Gordon said he was unable to confirm the deal, but noted Washington has been trying to transfer some prisoners. "We've been hard at work with the international community for quite some time to encourage other government to accept detainees held at Guantanamo in order to reduce the population there," Gordon said. The United States has faced fierce criticism worldwide for the detention without charge -- often for years -- of suspected al Qaeda and Taliban members at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "We're of course thrilled by the news that their ordeal in Guantanamo will hopefully soon be over," Katznelson said. "Guantanamo is a lawless place. No one should be held here without charge, without trial. And these men have received nothing here in the way of justice. Nothing at all." Two other permanent British residents remain at Guantanamo, Katznelson said. He said there were reports one might be released to Saudi Arabia, but he was not able to confirm that. About 305 inmates in President George W. Bush's war on terrorism are held at the prison, including about 70 whom US military panels have cleared for release or transfer. A judge at Guantanamo this week heard the first testimony in a US military war crimes proceeding since the end of World War Two. The Guantanamo war crimes tribunals first convened in August 2004 but no witnesses were called in previous hearings. bd
