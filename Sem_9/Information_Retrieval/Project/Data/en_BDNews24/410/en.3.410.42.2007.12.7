 PARIS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - France hopes to sign "a large number" of contracts with Libya in areas including arms, nuclear power and agriculture during a visit to Paris by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi next week, the French president's office said. Gaddafi's visit will be his first trip to France in more than 30 years. Paris says it is a significant step in Libya's return to the international fold after abandoning its weapons of mass destruction programme and freeing a group of foreign medics who were imprisoned there. "We hope that a large number of commercial agreements will be signed," French President Nicolas Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon told a weekly news conference. "We hope for a positive conclusion to a number of contracts in a number of areas such as energy, such as nuclear technology, but also agriculture, health," he added. Martinon would not be drawn on the total value of the contracts that were expected to be signed, and declined to be drawn on the specifics of the various planned deals. "We are working on it," he said when asked about arms deals, adding that certain French firms were interested, as well as a French-German firm -- an apparent reference to EADS -- and a French-German-Italian company. "As long as it's not signed, it's not signed. The two delegations are working towards concluding this deal," he said when asked about the possibility of a nuclear deal. He declined to say whether the sale of a reactor was involved. Sarkozy signed a memorandum of understanding on nuclear cooperation with Libya earlier this year. Political and administrative agreements were also planned involving France's National Audiovisual Institution, which manages the national television archives, as well as the Louvre museum, Martinon said.
