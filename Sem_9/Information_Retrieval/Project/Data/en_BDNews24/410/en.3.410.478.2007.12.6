 MOSCOW, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's opposition Communist Party dropped its threat to boycott the next parliament on Thursday but will mount a legal challenge against what it said were widespread violations in last weekend's election. The Communists won 57 seats in the Dec. 2 election, the only anti-Kremlin party to secure representation in the 450-member parliament, known as the State Duma. "We will not reject our seats in the Duma, but will continue to fight for the rights of our supporters," Vadim Solovyev, a member of the Communist Party's central committee told Reuters.
