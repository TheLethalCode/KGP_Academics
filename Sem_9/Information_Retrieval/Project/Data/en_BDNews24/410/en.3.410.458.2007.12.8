 PARIS, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two French trade unions plan a rail strike next week to try and get concessions from the government over a planned pension reform, a move which state rail operator SNCF said on Saturday would likely lead to disruptions. Their industrial action will follow a Paris transport strike planned for next week and walkouts in October and November that crippled the French public transport system in union protests against President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to end special pension rights. The government eventually agreed to participate in talks with unions and state transport companies to discuss the pension reform as the November strikes wound up after causing huge disruptions for commuters and businesses. But the powerful CGT union said it had given notice it would strike from midnight on Thursday to 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday as it needed to exert more pressure in the talks. "We said that we would call for a new intervention by rail workers if blockages appeared during the course of the negotiations that are under way. This is the case today," the CGT said in a statement. An SNCF official told Reuters that while the CFE-CGC union had also submitted a strike notice, other unions were not expected to join in the strike for the time being. However, he added: "The CGT ... is the biggest union in the SNCF so there is a risk of disruptions." Train, metro, tram and bus services were badly disrupted by strikes in November and October to protest against the reform proposed by the government, which aims to trim pension benefits and bring them into line with the majority of French workers. Only around 6 percent of pensions fall under the so-called special regime, which was designed to reward those with hard jobs, and the government has stood firm on its main demand that the contribution time be increased to 40 years from 37.5 years.
