<TITLE> Is Putin about to solve Russian succession riddle? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The coming week may give a clue to Russia's biggest political riddle -- who will President Vladimir Putin bless as his preferred successor and how will he remain in control after leaving the Kremlin next year? Putin is barred by law from running for a third consecutive term in the March 2 presidential election. But Putin, whose popularity tops 70 percent after presiding over the biggest economic boom in a generation, has said he will retain influence and make sure his successor carries on his legacy. He has two options, analysts say. Firstly, he could install a strong but loyal lieutenant who will continue his policies for the next four or even eight years. Secondly, he could opt for a weak candidate who would pave the way for his early return to the Kremlin. There is no constitutional bar on Putin running in the 2012 presidential election -- or before if his successor resigns early. PARTY CONGRESS On Dec. 17, United Russia, the party Putin led to a crushing victory in parliamentary polls last weekend, holds its congress. Analysts say Putin's appearance at the congress and his explicit support for its choice of presidential candidate could solve the succession riddle. "If United Russia proposes a presidential candidate who looks even remotely solid then he will be treated as a hand-picked successor," said Boris Makarenko, deputy head of the Centre of Political Technologies, a Moscow think-tank. The Kremlin chief has a selection of loyal ministers whom he could use for different scenarios. "First Deputy Prime Ministers Sergei Ivanov and Dmitry Medvedev are favourites," said Alexei Mukhin, head of the Centre of Political Information. "Add here Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov to get the front rank of potential successors." Fair Russia leader Sergei Mironov, St Petersburg governor Valentina Matviyenko and a number of other less know figures form the second echelon of hopefuls who should not be written off, he said. "If Putin decides that his successor should be a solid player to stay in office for four or eight years, that will be Ivanov," Internet newspaper Gazeta.ru quoted analyst Dmitry Badovsky as saying. "A weaker candidate like Zubkov or (parliamentary speaker Boris) Gryzlov would mean he intends to come back to the Kremlin in the near future," he said. Gryzlov, who is also United Russia leader, made clear on Friday he intended to keep his parliamentary job, effectively ruling out plans to run for president. GUESSING GAME But second guessing Putin's plans could prove more complicated. A new public movement "For Putin!" is vying to become the election engine for Putin's preferred candidate, and Putin has attended congresses of both United Russia and "For Putin!". "We will be watching very carefully who 'For Putin!' proposes," Mironov, head of the pro-Kremlin Fair Russia which decided against fielding its own candidate, said last week. Parliamentary sources say "For Putin!" could name its presidential candidate on Dec. 12 or 13 -- ahead of the United Russia congress. Some analysts suggest Putin -- keen to avoid turning into a lame duck for as long as possible and keen to put forward an image of fair play in the presidential race -- could use United Russia and "For Putin!" to field competing pro-Kremlin candidates. Arranging some kind of competition in the presidential race could help Putin ease criticism of parliamentary polls, described by the West as "neither fair, nor free" because of heavy-handed Kremlin involvement in favour of United Russia. "It would be good to improve (Russia's) image, tarred by parliamentary polls which critics say were not exactly democratic," Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper wrote on Thursday. But analysts see little chance that Putin would really opt for a straight race between pro-Kremlin candidates. "Most likely, one of them will pull out in the decisive moment, but even before that their campaigning styles will let Russia watchers see who is the primary candidate," Makarenko said. While the succession riddle may -- or may not -- be resolved next week, one thing is for sure, analysts say. If Putin opts for a powerful candidate to succeed him, United Russia, Fair Russia and "For Putin!" will all rally behind him. And opinion polls show more than half of Russians are ready to vote for the candidate endorsed by Putin
