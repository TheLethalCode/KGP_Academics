<TITLE> India makes neglect of parents a criminal offence </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indians who neglect their ageing parents face possible prison under a new law passed by worried politicians. The law, passed late on Thursday, reflects concerns that rapid modernisation and a growth in nuclear families is undermining a centuries-old social fabric of extended families. "At least now the elderly can have a roof to live under and food to eat in their old age," Gyan Prakash Pilania, a Hindu nationalist MP, was quoted as saying in local news reports. Under the law, Indians can face up to a month in jail if found guilty of parental neglect. The law also allows authorities to order children or relatives to pay a monthly maintenance allowance to the aged.
