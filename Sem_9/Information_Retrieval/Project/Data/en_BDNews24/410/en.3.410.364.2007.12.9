<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Sunday halted extortion case proceedings against Sheikh Hasina and the transfer of a court to Sangsad Bhaban to try the former prime minister for three months. The twin orders came after the Awami League chief filed a writ appeal earlier in the day, challenging the relocation of the trial court, a lawyer said. Meanwhile, a metropolitan sessions judge's courtthe trial court for Hasina set the next hearing into the extortion case for Dec 13. Judge Md Azizul Haque Sunday issued the order at the makeshift court sited on the Sangsad Bhaban premises as Hasina could not appear in court because of her illness. A senior prisons official informed the court that Hasina was suffering from headache and eye ailments. A two-member panel of justice ABM Khairul Haque and justice Abdul Awal halted the case proceedings and court relocation. Hasina's lawyers had earlier filed a writ appeal with the HC bench, said barrister Shafique Ahmed, a counsel for the former premier. The court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises Sunday started proceedings of the chargeframing against the former prime minister in her absence. Hasina has been kept in special jail, close to the relocated court, since July 16. The state side had earlier said the relocation was necessary for security reasons while defence counsels had argued the process was illegal after the judiciary was separated from the executive. The case involves charges of extortion from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, who accused Hasina of taking about Tk 3 crore during her 1996-2001 term in return for allowing him to build a power plant. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. All of them rejected the charges, and the Awami League said the charges were aimed at tarnishing the image of the party chief. Hasina believes the charges are designed to prevent her from contesting next polls. bdnews24.co
