<TITLE> Bolivia assembly to vote on new constitution </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LA PAZ, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The assembly rewriting Bolivia's basic law agreed to reconvene on Saturday to vote article by article on a draft constitution that has caused a deep split and violent protests in the poor Andean country. Among controversial reforms the assembly could approve this weekend are allowing presidents to serve more than one consecutive term, turning the bicameral legislature into a one-house body, and granting Indian communities and provinces more autonomy from the central government. The assembly's board of directors said in a news release that it called for delegates to meet on Saturday evening in Oruro city, two weeks after three people died in violent protests in Sucre, the assembly's original base. The assembly is controlled by allies of leftist President Evo Morales who aim to empower Bolivia's poor Indian majority after centuries of discrimination. Its work stalled for months because of fear of violence. But two weeks ago the delegates met under military guard and approved an outline of the constitution in a vote boycotted by the opposition. That vote sparked violent protests in Sucre and a general strike in six of the country's nine provinces. Once the assembly agrees on all the provisions of a new constitution it must go to a national referendum for approval. Opposition delegates have said they will stay away from the reconvened assembly. But delegates from Morales' party and allies can probably muster a 170-member quorum needed to vote on the constitutional rewrite in the 255-seat assembly. Morales became Bolivia's first leader of indigenous descent in January 2006, ending the political dominance of a mainly white economic elite who fear the constitutional reforms could threaten their property holdings. His first major reform was to nationalize Bolivia's large natural gas fields, which forced foreign companies to give the government much larger shares of their profits while Argentina and Brazil must pay more for the fuel. But his drive to overhaul the constitution has enraged the opposition. Critics fear he will use it to concentrate power. Morales is an ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, whose own constitutional reform project was defeated narrowly in a referendum vote last weekend. Another ideological ally, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, is also pushing changes to his country's constitution.
