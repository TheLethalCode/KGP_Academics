 BANGALORE, India, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India batsman Yuvraj Singh knows he is not guaranteed a place in the team for the test tour of Australia later this month despite scoring a century against Pakistan on Saturday. Yuvraj, 26 next week, smashed a career-best 169 off 203 balls to rescue the team from 61 for four with a 300-run fifth wicket stand with Saurav Ganguly. India were 365 for five at stumps on the opening day of the third and final test. Already the team's batting mainstay in the game's shorter formats, Yuvraj got the chance to play in this test after Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Dhoni were ruled out with injury and he made the most of it with his third test century in 20 matches. "My focus was to help win the match, not think of the team composition for Australia. I might play there or might have to sit out," said Yuvraj, player of the series in the preceding one-dayers. He admitted it would be hard to get a regular place in the test team because of the stiff competition. "It's difficult to replace (Rahul) Dravid, Tendulkar, Ganguly and (Vangipurappu) Laxman because of their test record," Yuvraj told reporters. Indian cricket selectors named Yuvraj on Wednesday in a list of 24 probables for the tour of Australia
