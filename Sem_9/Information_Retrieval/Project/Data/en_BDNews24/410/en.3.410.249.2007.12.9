 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  At least one worker died after a floor of Rangs Building in Dhaka collapsed Saturday night, rescuers said. The accident injured several workers and trapped at least 100 others inside. The dead worker has been identified as Monirul Islam, Fire Service and Civil Defence director general Rafiqul Islam told reporters on the scene. At least 12 people were rescued alive from inside the building, he said. Islam said he found one worker trapped inside the debris. Most of the workers came from Chittagongwho had been employed to erase parts of the building. After winning approval from the Supreme Court for knocking down 16 floors from top, Rajuk initially demolished inner parts of the structure and handed the rest of the work to private construction firm Six Star. After the collapse of the building on Bijoy Sarani, up to 40 army officers tightened security in and around the area and blocked traffic on the road. bdnews24.com photographer Mustafiz Mamun went inside the building along with fire-brigade officials and saw mangled metal sheets covered in layers of debris. Kabir Mia, 50, told bdnews24.com that he had suffered injuries when he tumbled off the 14th floor on heavy impact of the crashing floor. Selim Newaz Bhuiyan, deputy director of the Fire Service and Civil Defence, also went inside the building, but failed to give details on casualties. Assistant police commissioner Mashiur Rahman said that at least three workers had been rushed to hospital. Authorities halted the rescue operation for security reasons. A fresh operation is expected to begin after Rajuk engineers arrive. Ziblu Miah, 28, who arrived on the scene in search of his relatives believed trapped inside, was seen crying. He said his cousin Farid was among 17 people from Faridpur, who were working in the building. Six of them were rescued alive, but Farid was still missing. Ziblu Miah was desperate on his cellphone contacting his relatives. Rajuk, the city developer, won approval from the Supreme Court on August 3 and started a drive a day later to knock down the "illegal" 16 floors of the building from top. A 20-year-old worker, Sohrab Hossain, died in a fall from the 12th floor of the structure on August 8. bdnews
