 ABUJA, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua has defended himself against accusations he has failed to make progress towards fulfilling his campaign promises during his first six months in office. Yar'Adua had pledged swift action on seven priorities that included improving electricity supplies and addressing a violent crisis in the oil-producing Niger Delta. But the lights are still out and in the delta rebels are resuming attacks after a period of grace. As a result, Yar'Adua is facing growing criticism. The Action Congress opposition party said earlier this week that the government was "groping in the dark while the citizens suffer". "I would not entirely dismiss the party's position as sour grapes because there are also Nigerians who genuinely feel that this administration has been slow," said Olusegun Adeniyi, Yar'Adua's spokesman, in a nine-page statement. He said Nigerians were frustrated with the slow pace of progress on power, roads, schools and hospitals, but urged them to be patient because the president was working on a "planned, systematic approach to governance". He would break with a past of profligate spending and unfinished projects, Adeniyi said. "Four years down the line, the president wants Nigerians to be talking about the kilometres of roads his administration has built and not the billions of naira in road contracts he has awarded, the stability of the power situation and not the megawatts of excuses," he said. He gave few details about how this would be achieved in a chaotic country where decades of mismanagement under corrupt military dictators left a legacy of poverty, ill health, crime, ethnic and religious tensions and collapsed infrastructure. CONFRONTING THE CABAL Africa's most populous country with 140 million people, Nigeria is also the continent's biggest exporter of crude oil. Hopes were high that a return to civilian rule in 1999 would turn around its fortunes but many Nigerians are disappointed. Economic reforms launched by Yar'Adua's predecessor in 2003 yielded some successes such as improved public finances at federal level and an $18 billion debt relief deal, but the poor majority have felt no impact on their lives. Yar'Adua came to power after elections denounced by international observers as "not credible" because of widespread fraud and intimidation. His legitimacy has always been in question, and now he is also being accused of doing nothing. Most Nigerians, who either have no power at all or suffer blackouts that can last days on end, were encouraged by Yar'Adua's talk of declaring an emergency in the sector but are now impatient that after six months he has not done so. "There is a strong cabal which has been sabotaging government efforts at providing electricity to the citizenry because it pays them for the sector not to work. The president is confronting this cabal squarely," said Adeniyi, adding that the results of his action would "become more apparent soon". On the Niger Delta, where armed rebels demanding local control over oil resources have crippled the industry, Adeniyi said Yar'Adua had been right to delay a promised summit because talks were under way that would make it more meaningful. "The summit the president envisages, for which negotiations are almost concluded, is one that is expected to end all such summits," he said.
