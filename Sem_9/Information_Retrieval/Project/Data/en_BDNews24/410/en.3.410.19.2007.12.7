<TEXT>
 Seoul, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A 146,000 tonne Hong Kong-registered tanker was hit by a crane while at anchor off the port of Taean, south of Seoul, causing a leak of 15,000 tonnes of crude oil, Seoul's maritime ministry said on Friday. The tanker, Hebei Sprint, was anchoring near Taean to discharge crude brought from the Middle East at the port's unloading facilities, the ministry said. Industry sources said the crude was being unloaded for South Korean refiner, Hyundai Oilbank, but the refiner was not immediately available for comment. Hebei Sprint was hit by the crane early on Friday, a Coast Guard official said, adding the equipment was in transit after being used to build a bridge in Taean. Friday's spillage is the largest in South Korean waters since a 5,000 tonne crude discharge in 1995 at Yeosu, south of Seoul.
