 Gaza, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian in the Gaza Strip on Friday, local medical workers said. Palestinian medics said a local farmer was killed and another was wounded by Israeli gunfire near the southern Gaza town of Khan Younis. The circumstances were unclear. The Israeli army was looking into the incident. Israeli forces regularly carry out raids into Gaza to try to prevent militants from launching short-range rockets into the Jewish state or firing mortar bombs at border crossings.
