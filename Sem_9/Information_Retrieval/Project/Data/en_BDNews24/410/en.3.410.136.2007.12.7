<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com) - US Navy ship USS Tarawa, which took part in the relief operations, will leave Bangladesh in "two to three days", officials said Friday. "It will leave in two to three days," Lt. Gen. Masud Uddin Chowdhury told reporters in Dhaka. His comment came as Bangladesh's military Friday formally gave farewell to the US military, which ended its military help in relief operations in the cyclone-battered south, on the premises of the Armed Forces Division. Chowdhury praised the US help and said they "came in a time when people had been languishing in thirst and hunger, sitting on the ruins of their houses." He said the relations between the two nations would grow in the future. "The US-Bangladesh friendship has stood the test of time and we had been working in many fields including combating terrorism," Gen Masud said. "Now with (the) Operation Sea Angel II, our relationship has further been cemented." He said working with the US military was an opportunity. "It was indeed a wonderful opportunity for members of both the armed forces to share experience, put their expertise and resources together," he said. "Your presence and the whole-hearted support had been a great boost to our officers and men." Brig. Gen. Ronald L. Bailey, who coordinated the Nov.22-Dec.6 U.S. operations, said he was also happy working with Bangladeshi troops. He termed Bangladesh "a friend and a partner", saying that the US relationship with Bangladesh would grow further in coming days. Bailey said end of the military relief operation means it was a transition to long-term effort and added that "trauma" brought the two nations together. Geeta Pasi, charge d' affaires at the US Embassy in Dhaka, Friday reassured that civilian aid efforts by the US agencies including USAID would continue. She said they were working with other donors to determine what other long-term assistance Bangladesh needed. "The ship is moving out but the embassy is here," Pasi told reporters. The USS Tarawa also participated in relief operations in 1991--dubbed Sea Angel I--when a powerful cyclone killed about 140,000 people in Bangladesh. b
