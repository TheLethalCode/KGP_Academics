 MOSCOW, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A blast on a bus in Russia killed at least one person on Sunday, Russian news agencies said, less than a month after five people died when a nail bomb exploded on a bus in a neighbouring province. Interfax quoted an unnamed source in the security services in the Stavropol region as saying the explosion may have been a "terrorist" act. Stavropol borders Russia's north Caucasus, a volatile region wracked by violence and centred around Chechnya, which has fought two wars against Russia since 1994. The bus had been travelling from the city of Stavropol to another town when an explosion started a fire on the bus while it was parked at a station. News agencies quoted the local emergencies ministry as saying one or two people died in the blast and two more had been taken to hospital. On Nov. 22 a bomb tore apart a bus on the border of North Ossetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, an attack blamed on rebels.
