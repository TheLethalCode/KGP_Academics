<TITLE> Global markets: US subprime plan aids stocks before payrolls </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks and the dollar rose on Friday as Washington's rescue plan for troubled US homeowners and expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week brightened investor mood before a key jobs report. US President George W. Bush announced new steps on Thursday to help subprime mortgage borrowers, offering a five-year mortgage-rate freeze. The plan is aimed at slowing a wave of home loan foreclosures that has threatened to knock the US economy into recession. The Fed is expected to cut interest rates next week by 25 basis points, following up on its monetary easing in September and October. The non-farm payrolls report due later will be key to determine whether the Fed would ease by half a point -- a view partially priced in by markets. "Everybody is now looking forward to the non-farm payrolls ... It will give key guidance on what to expect from the Fed next week, so the market is very much undecided on this one," Niels From, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. Economists expect the economy added 90,000 non-farm jobs in November. "If we get a sub 50,000 reading on the payrolls, we are likely to see the dollar coming under massive pressure, as it will probably increase speculation of a 50 bps rate cut from the Fed," he said. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was up 0.6 percent on the day while MSCI main world equity index gained a quarter percent. In a sign that investor risk aversion is easing, UBS's risk index hit its lowest level in more than six weeks as cross asset market volatility decreased. The dollar was up 0.1 percent against a basket of six major currencies at 76.482, edging up towards Thursday's one-month high. It was steady at 111.23 yen, but rose against sterling and Canadian dollar -- two currencies which have been hit by rate cuts this week. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 1 bps while emerging stocks were steady on the day. The March Bund future was down 0.3 percent. U.S. light crude fell half a percent to $89.76 a barrel, while gold slipped to $797.50 an ounce.
