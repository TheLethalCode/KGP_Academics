 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers set a rushed meeting for late Saturday night to review the decision to launch a protest programme Sunday, a teacher said. "We have received a message from the education adviser. We are going to sit in a meeting now," acting DUTA president Professor Tajmeri SA Islam told bdnews24.com, shortly before 9:00pm. She would not reveal the details of the message. The teachers had earlier said they would launch a protest programme Sunday if the government did not assure them of releasing detained colleagues and students. Leaders of the Dhaka University Teachers Association made the announcement, shortly after a meeting with officials from the Directorate General of the Forces Intelligence at the university. Vice Chancellor Prof SMA Faiz was also present at the meeting. DUTA held an emergency meeting Friday where the teachers demanded the detained teachers and students be released by Wednesday. They planned to wear black badges Sunday and a hold sit-in at Aparajeo Bangla Monday. After the meeting, the VC told reporters that they had constructive talks with the DGFI officers. "We are expecting positive results," he said. "They (DGFI) are trying to get to the bottom of it. I think the discussion was fruitful," he added. On the freedom of the detained teachers, Professor Tajmeri said that there was hope for it but nothing could be said for sure. Former DUTA president Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique said they had talks with the DGFI team on the association's programme. He said the DUTA leaders told the meeting that programmes could be considered if the government had assured them of meeting their demand. bdnews24.
