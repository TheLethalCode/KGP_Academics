<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  The draft of the Truth and Accountability Commission has been completed, an official said Saturday. A four-member committee designed the structure and legal affairs of the commission, which will continue for one year. Corruption suspectsespecially businesspeoplewill be able to confess crimes to the commission, the draft said. The commission's activities are likely to begin in January. Advocate Anisul Huq, a committee member, told bdnews24.com that they had submitted the draft to lieutenant general Masud Uddin Chowdhury, coordinator of the national coordination committee on curbing serious crimes. The 18-page draft contains 27 sections. The committee recommends naming the commission "Truth and Accountability Commission". "The commission will be absolutely independent," Anisul Huq said. The commission will be formed with three to five members, with a retired chief justice leading the way. Other members will be either a judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court or persons experienced in law and justice. The draft said any person can enjoy the facilities of the commission, but the persons who have already been accused in cases pending trial will not qualify. The commission can summon any person. "If he doesn't respond to the order, it may sentence him to a maximum of three years," Huq said quoting the draft. "If any person confesses crimes, no legal steps will be taken against him, unless he gets involved in further crimes," he said. The commission may fine the person or confiscate his assets, but the amount will not exceed the value of his property. If any person lies to the commission, it will send him to court for trial, according to the draft. bdnews24.com/
