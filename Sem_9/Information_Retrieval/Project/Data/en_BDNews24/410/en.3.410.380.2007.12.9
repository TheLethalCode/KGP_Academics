<TEXT>
 LONDON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley has appointed Jonathan Powell, a chief of staff for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, to boost its European arm. Morgan Stanley said Powell will join as a managing director in its investment banking division from the start of January. Powell worked alongside Blair from 1994 until his departure from office earlier this year, coordinating the prime minister's political, civil service and press relations. He will work on transactions involving the bank's largest clients in Britain and Europe. His appointment is seen as a coup for Morgan Stanley, as Powell was targeted by major banks.
