 MOSCOW, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Russia must achieve nuclear arms parity with the United States, Itar-Tass news agency quoted First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov as saying on Friday. "Military potential, to say nothing of nuclear potential, must be at the proper level if we want ... to just stay independent," Tass quoted Ivanov as saying. "The weak are not loved and not heard, they are insulted, and when we have parity they will talk to us in a different way," he added.
