<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 6 (bdnews24.com) - The government has appointed former adviser to the caretaker government leading businessman Syed Manzur Elahi as administrator to the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The commerce ministry as the regulatory authority Thursday issued an order to that effect. The ministry order said that the government had appointed Elahi to the FBCCI for 120 days in line with the Trade Organisation Ordinance 1961. The administrator will hold elections to the federation within the given time, the ministry said. The tenure of the present executive committee ended on Sept 5. The government later extended the deadline for polls to the country's apex trade body for 90 days to Dec 6. The committee failed to hold the elections within the extended timeframe due to a court case filed by Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association for excluding the voting rights of its five members. Elahi will take care of the daily activities of the FBCCI and take necessary steps to hold polls within the given time. "I'll try my best to carry out the responsibilities given to me by the government," Elahi told bdnews24.com. "I have to do two things within this short period of time -- one is to take care of its daily activities and the other, to hold transparent and peaceful elections." Mir Nasir Hossain, who just ended his tenure as president of FBCCI Thursday, told bdnews24.com that the government had done what it thought to be best. The Board of Directors, with Mir Nasir Hossain as president, took charge of the federation on Sep 5, 2005, for a two-year term. BGMEA members Annisul Huq, Mohammad A Salam, Faisal Samad, ABM Shamsuddin, and Ferdous Parvez Bivon were dropped from the FBCCI voter list following a petition, filed by businessman Mahbub Minhaz, claiming that the five had been elected to the executive committee through a flawed poll. The arbitration council of FBCCI in a verdict on Sept 25 ruled that the BGMEA election was held in violation of court orders and, therefore, the results were illegal and void. BGMEA later filed a case appealing the FBCCI verdict, with the result that the court on Sept 30 stayed the FBCCI elections and ordered the federation to show cause why their verdict would not be ruled illegal. bdnews24.com/
