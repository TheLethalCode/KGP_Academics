 Islamabad, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber rammed a car packed with explosives into a schoolbus near an air force base in northwest Pakistan on Monday, killing himself and wounding about nine people, including several children, the military said. "A terrorist targeted a schoolchildren's bus. The driver and the guard who were sitting in the front have been seriously injured," said military spokesman Major-General Waheed Arshad. "Because of the timely reaction of the driver, the children were saved. Only about six or seven children were injured," he added. "It was outside the Kamra air base. It was specially targetting the schoolchildren's bus." The base is about 45 miles (75 km) northwest of the capital, Islamabad. The attack came a day after a suicide bomber rammed a car packed with explosives into a police checkpost in the volatile Swat valley in northwest Pakistan on Sunday, killing six people. There have been a rash of suicide attacks blamed on Islamist militants since a military assault on the Red Mosque, a militant stronghold, in Islamabad in July. More than 800 people have been killed in ensuing violence across the country since then, about half of those killed in suicide attacks
