 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Barisal Sunday brought down high-flying Rajshahi in one-dayer of the National Cricket League while Khulna and Dhaka also returned to their winning streaks, defeating Chittagong and Sylhet respectively. Barisal handed a tense 18-run defeat to the league leaders Rajshahi at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium. An all-round performance by Nazmus Sadat helped Khulna taste first triumph after three losses as the visitors thrashed hosts Chittagong by nine wickets at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. A five-wicket haul from national discard Mohammad Sharif powered holders Dhaka to an emphatic 51-run win over the struggling Sylhet at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Despite the first loss, Rajshahi have still on top of the 6-team point table with 12, four points ahead of joint Khulna and Dhaka. Barisal raised their points to six while both Chittagong and Sylhet stuck to their previous points of four. Barisal vs Rajshahi Rajshahi were skittled out for 170 in 45.5 overs, chasing an easy target of 189 set by Barisal, who were asked to bat first. Jahirul Islam (36) and Rabiul Karim (32) gave a great start to Rajshahi putting on 63 runs for the opening stand, but the league leaders failed to keep the momentum in the face of some tight bowling from the Barisal bowlers each of whom got wicket. One-down Farhad Hossain was the fifth Rajshahi batsman out for 39, triggering a collapse as Rajshahi lost the last five wickets for 34 runs. Tariqul Islam was the pick of the attack with three for 43, followed by Sumon Kumar Sharman, who took two for 43. Earlier, Barisal were in tatters at 60 for four, but middle orders Abul Bashar (65) and Raisul Islam (35) rescued their side to help them put up a modest score of 188 all out in49.4 overs. Khulna vs Chittagong Despite a decent start, Chittagong saw their innings end at 188 all out after choosing to bat first. Opener Mahbubul Karim and one-down Nazimuddin, centurion of four-dayer, hit identical 40 before pacer Monjurul Islam and occasional Nazmus Sadat rattled the middle and late orders with three wickets each. Then, Nazmus smashed an unbeaten 92 to steer Khulna to 190 for one in 35.1 overs. Nazmus struck a dozen of fours facing 97 balls, and put on 169 runs for the opening stand with Mostafizur Rahman, who made a 104-ball 78 clubbing 14 boundaries. Dhaka vs Sylhet Sylhet's pacer Rashidur Rahman proved Dhaka's decision to bat first wrong after removing three top batsmen to reduce the holders to 45 for three. However, Mehrab Hossain Opee (51), Nadif Chowdhury (51 not out) and Mohammad Rafique (39) provided some resistance in the middle to take Dhaka to a fighting total of 225 all out in 49.2 overs. In reply, Sylhet also faced hiccups to reduce to 56 for four and never recovered from the damage. Sharifullah, however, stood tall in the middle to make a fine 71-ball 52, but it was not enough to salvage Sylhet from their fifth defeat in seven outings. Pacer Mohammad Sharif captured five for just 23 as Sylhet eventually were all out for 174 in 41.5 overs.
