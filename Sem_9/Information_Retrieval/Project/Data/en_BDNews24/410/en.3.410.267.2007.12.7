 MANCHESTER, England, Dec 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United captain Gary Neville has had his latest comeback plans shelved after suffering another injury blow. Neville, who has not played since March because of an ankle problem, had been scheduled to return in United's final Champions League group game at AS Roma next Wednesday. However, the 32-year-old England defender has suffered a complication with the injury in training and is set for a further spell on the sidelines. "Gary unfortunately has had a setback again and we are disappointed with that," United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters on Friday. "He's gone back to the specialist to have another look at it. I can't be positive on that." Ferguson described the problem as a "niggle" and stressed that the latest injury is not serious. However, he added: "When you've had an injury operated on six or seven months ago and he's still not back it is a concern. "He has had small setbacks almost every time he's ready to play. That's a disappointment but hopefully we can sort it out and get him back." Neville, who has won 85 England caps, has started over 500 games for United since coming through the club's youth system and making his debut in 1992
