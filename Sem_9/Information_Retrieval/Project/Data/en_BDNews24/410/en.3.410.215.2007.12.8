<TITLE> Bleak days in Sirajganj </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KAOAKOLA, Sirajganj, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)Floods have disappeared but 60-year-old Hazrat Ali is frightened by the thought of how he will pass the coming days with eight other members of his family. "I can't think of the future," Hazrat, once a happy farmer, said when he was aboard a crowded passenger boat Tuesday. The fear of the future echoes dimming hopes for fast recovery from the recent rampaging floods in Sirajganj. Raging waters in July-September flooded villages on the banks of the river Jamuna destroying homes, killing cattle and poultry and displacing thousands of poor villagers in the north. Although three months have passed by, people in the region are still struggling to go back to their original days. "We live with the floods. It's our fate. But this year's floods have taken a huge toll," Hazrat said as he was crossing the river with dozens of other people to the other side for fishing. "I was a happy farmer. I had about 40 bighas of arable land when I was young. Now I have nothing," he said. "The river and the floods have taken away everything from me." A small piece of fertile land where he used to cultivate crops is now part of the "desert" as sand has covered his land. "I can't feed my family with whatever I have. I'm trying my luck on fishing." Hazrat is among thousands of victims of the recurrent floods. Many are trying to make up for losses with little help from the government. Some are rearing goat or farming poultry but they lack cash. A walk through several kilometres of the "desert" after crossing the Jamuna river by boat to get to Kaoakola char under Sadar upazila of the district reveals people's struggle. People in nearby Do Gachhi, Chhoto Koira, Hat Baira, Mirzapur, Mohish Kangla, Shoia Shakha and Boro Koira chars have similar stories to tell. Signs of poverty are visible along with other problems: lack of safe drinking water, no basic healthcare, broken-down or no road infrastructure and no electricity. "I need to rebuild my hut but I have no money," said 25-year-old Fulera Begum, standing in front of her ruined hut on a raised ground in Kaoakola. She said her family had to take shelter on a flood protection embankment after waters started to swallow her home. The family stayed there for nearly two months and returned with nothing. "I need to rebuild my home as winter is approaching. I don't know how it's possible. Maybe I have to take loans from Mohajon (loan shark)," said Fulera. Her husband peddles a rickshaw in Sirajganj town. "I don't know how I can buy clothes for my children," she said. Farmers in the region have got wheat seeds and fertiliser from the government but the help was not enough. "I have got some (wheat) seeds and fertiliser, which are not enough," said Namdar Ali Mondal in Kaoakola. A district relief official said the government provided "adequate help" for flood victims after the waters receded. "We have provided them with seeds and cash," the district's relief official Kartik Chandra Howlader told bdnews24.com by phone. "We have tried our best to rehabilitate the people." The government's "adequate help" may still be a boost to many, but 50-year-old Abul Hossain of Boro Koira has hardly anything to hope for. "What shall we do with the government's support? I don't need any," a frustrated Abul Hossain said. Floods will come again, maybe next year, then again, he said. bd
