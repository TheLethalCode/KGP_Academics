<TITLE> Kenya enjoying greatest freedoms ever: Thiong'o </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nairobi, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya has enjoyed its greatest democratic freedoms under President Mwai Kibaki, but a proliferation of "paper" political parties could threaten the gains, one of Kenya's most famous ex-political prisoners said. Author Ngugi wa Thiong'o, in an opinion piece in the Sunday Nation newspaper entitled "Why I Maintain Faith in My Country," said voters must show respect to those who died to bring Kenya democracy by scrutinising candidates' closely before voting. Voters in east Africa's largest economy are due to vote on Dec. 27 in what looks to be Kenya's closest race ever. The latest of four separate polls show Kibaki with 39-42 percent, compared to main rival Raila Odinga's 43-46 percent. Thiong'o, who rose to literary prominence as one of Africa's strongest political critics, notes Kibaki's rule has seen corruption, extrajudicial police killings and a government raid on a media group that drew international condemnation. "But in the main, these are the first five years including colonial and post-colonial times of Kenyatta and Moi when Kenyans have not been killed, exiled or imprisoned on the basis of their political views," he wrote. The government of Kibaki's predecessor, Daniel arap Moi, imprisoned Thiong'o without charge in December 1977 after peasants and workers performed his play "Ngaahika Ndeenda", which criticised inequalities in Kenyan society. Thiong'o went into exile in 1982 and only returned in 2004, when he and his wife were assaulted in what he maintains was a politically motivated attack. Three men were sentenced to death for the crime. He now lives in California, where he teaches literature at the University of California-Irvine. BETTER OFF NOW? Thiong'o, who once studied economics under Kibaki at Makerere University in Kampala in the heady years before Kenya's independence in 1963, stopped short of an endorsement. Kenyans, Thiong'go wrote, must ask "Are we better off now than we were after Kibaki took over? Does he deserve a chance to build on the positives of his rule? Or are there others who can do a better job?" Odinga argues Kibaki's government has failed to meet its 2002 election promise to reverse the greed, rot and abuses of Moi's era, which saw thousands of critics including Odinga, imprisoned, tortured or killed and billions of dollars looted. Kibaki's camp argues Odinga, who was roads minister until a fallout with the president in 2005, has done little to develop the country and his own constituency, which has one of Africa's biggest slums, Kibera. Under Kibaki, economic growth has gone from negative numbers to a forecasted 6.9 to 7.0 percent this year. No matter who wins, Thiong'o said, Kenya must reform its political system to create stable parties with a track record and mechanisms to develop and change leadership. Kenya now has dozens of political parties -- bought and sold as election vehicles -- and often discarded quickly, as November primaries showed when candidates who lost in one party adopted others so they could continue vying for office. "We have moved from a one-party state to a 'paper-parties' state ... this is a very poor heritage for the Kenya of tomorrow. These paper parties may in the end negate the very democracy which enabled their birth," he said
