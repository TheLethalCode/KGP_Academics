 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers Sunday attended classes wearing black badges as part of a protest programme to demand the release of detained colleagues and students. "I am hoping that an honourable solution can be reached by all. We are having talks with the relevant sections of government," DU vice chancellor SMA Faiz told reporters Sunday after an award distribution programme of the Professor Sitara Parvin Trust. Professor AAMS Arefin Siddique, acting dean of the social science faculty, said: "The section of the government responsible is discussing the situation directly with us for the first time. Perhaps we are moving toward a hopeful solution." Siddique said a DUTA emergency meeting would be held Sunday evening to decide whether the proposed silent procession would go ahead Monday. After an emergency meeting Friday, DUTA had demanded that all teachers and students detained following the August student protests be released by Wednesday, Dec 12. They set forth a two-day programme including the wearing of black badges Sunday and a silent procession from Aparajeyo Bangla Monday morning. bdnews24
