<TITLE> Anti-graft drive made little impact: TIB official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)The government's massive anticorruption drive seems to have a very small impact on reducing corruption, said an official of the Transparency International Bangladesh Saturday. "It won't be possible to eliminate corruption in such a short time," TIB's executive director Iftekharuzzaman told bdnews24.com, adding it did not seem that the country's negative image for corruption was erased. " The extent and level of corruption was not created in a day," he said. His comments came on the eve of International Anticorruption Day Sunday. Iftekharuzzaman said an initiative had been taken to reform the Anticorruption Commission to make it operate more effectively. The Public Service Commission had also been reformed and the judiciary separated from the executive, he added. "All created an environment to prevent corruption." "Big fish were being made to stand in the dock, but there was no proof that corruption had declined to a great extent," he went on. To what extent the next government would follow up on the steps of the present administration remains to be seen, he said. In a 2003 resolution, the United Nations decided to observe Dec 9 as International Anticorruption Day. Bangladesh first observed the day in 2004. The government signed the UN anticorruption convention on Feb 27, 2007. A long-term strategy and active participation of people will ratchet up anti-graft efforts, the TIB official said. On how much the next government would follow the policies of the caretaker government, he said: "It has to be monitored how much the next government follows the precedents set by the present government." The Bureau of Anticorruption was abolished on Nov 21, 2004 and the present commission was formed, but it could not take any effective step in more than two years after formation. Changes at the top level of the commission were made after the present government took power. The ACC has far filed 118 cases against corruption suspects. Chargesheets have been submitted in about 60 cases and verdicts in more than 20 cases have been delivered. Forty-two cases are on trial. bdnews24.
