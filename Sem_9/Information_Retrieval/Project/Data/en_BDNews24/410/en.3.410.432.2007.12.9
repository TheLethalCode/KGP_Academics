<TITLE> Country faces 'depression' in unemployment: Akbar Ali </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is facing a 'depression' in unemployment, chairman of the recently-established Regulatory Reforms Commission Dr Akbar Ali Khan said Sunday. He called government statistics in this regard unacceptable, saying they failed to reflect the real rate of unemployment. "Unemployment is one of the major problems in Bangladesh," he told a discussion on 'Our steps in creating employment' organised by 'Aim in Life' at the National Press Club Sunday. "I am not sure of the exact number of unemployed in the country but I estimate the rate will be 30 to 40 percent," Akbar said. He called the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics data on unemployment "ridiculous", as it showed the rate to be only three to four percent. "These statistics are simply unacceptable to me," Akbar said. The RRC chairman said that when the US rate of unemployment stood at 17 percent in the past, the country termed it a 'depression in unemployment'. "But we have been facing the situation over years." "If the employment rate is not increased we will not achieve our economic target. The unemployment problem will create economic as well as social crisis." "It is not possible on the part of the government to solve the problem alone," Akbar added. He hoped the private sector would come forward to help solve the problem, and asked the government to encourage and work with the business community to tackle unemployment. bdnews
