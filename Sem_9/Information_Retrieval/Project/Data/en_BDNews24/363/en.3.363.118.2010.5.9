 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested four activists of the student wing of the banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir from a Dhaka University hall early on Sunday. The Shahbagh police arrested the four activists of Chhatra Mukti from Surja Sen hall at around 2am on charges of distributing leaflets on the campus the day before, university proctor KM Saiful Islam said. The arrested students are Rafiqul Islam Parash, a 2nd year student of finance department, Nayan and Abdul Hye Raju, 3rd year students of the same department and Mohsin Hossain, 3rd year student of the accounting department. A lot of jihadi literature was also recovered from their rooms, the proctor claimed. Islam explained that the police came to arrest the four students as one of the them, Raju, had handed a leaflet to a student of the hall, and other students had informed the authorities about this. Police then came to the hall and arrested Raju. The three other students were arrested on the basis of Raju's statement, the proctor said. Islam said they feared that the activists might stay in other halls of the university. "We will hold talks with the hall teachers and decide our next course of action," he said. Police last month arrested the main coordinator of the Islamist outfit Mahiuddin Ahmed, an associate professor of business administration faculty of Dhaka University. DU authorities sent him into forced retirement last year after the Islamist outfit was banned. bd
