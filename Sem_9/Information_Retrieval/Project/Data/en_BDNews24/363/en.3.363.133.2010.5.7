 NEW DELHI, May 7 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh and India are exploring bilateral cooperation on generation of energy from renewable sources. A high-level delegation, led by prime minister Sheikh Hasina's economic advisor Mashiur Rahman, has called on India's Minister for New and Renewable Energy Farooq Abdullah during its four-day-tour to India. Abdullah, who is overseeing India's just-launched Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission, and Rahman are believed to have discussed about possible bilateral cooperation on renewable energy  like exchange and training of scientific and technical personnel, sharing of information and transfer of technology and research and development. The two countries had identified renewable energy as a potential sector for bilateral cooperation during Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January this year. The joint statement that was issued after Hasina's meeting with her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh stated that the two prime ministers agreed that Bangladesh and India would cooperate in development and exchange of electricity generated from renewable sources. Abdullah, according to the sources in Indian government, conveyed to Rahman that New Delhi was keen to provide Dhaka with all necessary assistance in the latter's effort to augment generation of energy from renewable sources. Indian government launched the ambitious Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission in January this year. The objective of the mission is to augment installed capacity of generating solar power to 20000 MW by 2022. Rahman also met Indian finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and national security advisor Shiv Shankar Menon. He, however, could not meet India's water resources minister Pawan Kumar Bansal to discuss an interim treaty to share water of Teesta. Bansal, who also holds the parliamentary affairs portfolio, was busy as the Indian Parliament's Budget Session was on until Friday. Rahman is on a high-powered committee that government constituted on Monday to review a deal signed earlier by Dhaka and Delhi on open-ended import and export of electricity, before ratifying the deal for power purchase from the larger neighbour. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith and planning minister A K Khandaker are the other members of the committee tasked to examine the Memorandum of Understanding signed during Hasina's visit to New Delhi. The high-level delegation, which also included director general (South Asia) of the Bangladesh foreign ministry, reached New Delhi on Tuesday to push for implementation of the joint communiqu that also includes a power deal. India agreed to export 250 megawatts of electricity to energy-starved Bangladesh through connecting the power grids of the two countries. India's National Thermal Power Corporation and Bangladesh Power Development Board are likely to set up a joint-venture power plant at Chalna. Rahman also discussed with Mukherjee Dhaka's plans for utilisation of New Delhi's Line of Credit of US $ 1 billion for infrastructure projects mainly in the railway and road se
