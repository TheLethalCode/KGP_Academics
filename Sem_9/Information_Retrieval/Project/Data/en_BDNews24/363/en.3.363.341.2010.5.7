 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has urged the people to be vigilant so that no one can violate their rights. She spoke at a programme at her official residence marking the third anniversary of her return from exile on Friday. "Those anti-democratic powers who hijacked the Election Commission and played games with the voter list in the past may again try to destroy the democratic rights of the people." Though she did not name opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, but her speech clearly pointed to their last tenure. "People have to be vigilant so that their rights are not violated," she added. After the BNP-led government handed power to the caretaker government in 2006, the general election was scheduled for Jan 22, 2007. Alleging that the Election Commission was not neutral and the voter list was riddled with fake voters, Awami League boycotted and launched street agitation to stop the vote. After violent political protest and clashes a state of emergency was declared on Jan 11, 2007. But the military-backed interim government enforced an unofficial ban on Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia from travelling abroad. Hasina went to see her grand-daughter Sofia Wajed Joy in America after the withdrawal of the travel ban. However, she was asked not to come home through a government press note on April 18. She left the United States for UK to return to Bangladesh on Apr 19, 2007. But the British Airways did not let her pass through the boarding gate when she was about to leave London on April 22. In a dramatic reversal, the military-backed interim government, apparently under immense public pressure, withdrew the bar on Apr 25, 2007. She returned on May 7 that same year after 53 days. Awami League (AL) leaders flocked to the airport and followed her to Sudha Sadan, her private residence, to greet their party chief. Since then, Awami League remembers the day as 'Sheikh Hasina's homecoming day'. Eldest among the five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, Hasina's party was elected to power in the general elections of Dec 29, 2008. Many compare this homecoming with another one of May 17, 1981 when Hasina returned from India six years after the massacre of her family including Sheikh Mujib. She has been the president of the ruling Awami League since 1981. On Friday, party leaders and activists went to her Ganabhaban residence where Hasina shared her experience during the state of emergency with the journalists and her party members. bdnews24
