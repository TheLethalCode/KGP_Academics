 LONDON, May 7(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's opposition Conservatives were in pole position to take power on Friday after winning the most seats in parliament in a bitterly fought election and securing the tentative backing of the third largest party. While the centre-right Conservatives failed to gain an outright majority in the 650-seat House of Commons, creating the first "hung parliament" since 1974, they were comfortably ahead of the ruling centre-left Labour party. Speaking outside his Downing Street residence, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the Conservatives and the smaller opposition Liberal Democrats should have the opportunity to try to reach an agreement on forming a government. Brown said he would speak to the Lib Dems if those talks proved unsuccessful, and stressed his support for electoral reform, a key Lib Dem demand. Conservative leader David Cameron was to outline his plans in a statement soon after. His party said he would "set out how he will seek to form a government that is strong and stable with broad support, that acts in the national interest". The 43-year-old former public relations executive has said his party would make deeper and faster spending cuts than Labour, which has been in power since 1997. Any new government faces the daunting and potentially unpopular task of bringing down a record budget deficit of 163 billion pounds for fiscal 2009/10. Bookmakers saw a better than one-in-three chance of another British election this year, a scenario that would be likely to spook the markets further. The pound, stocks and British government bonds fell on the inconclusive election result. But they pulled back from their deepest losses after ratings agencies said Britain's top-grade credit rating was not at risk, and the prospect appeared to grow that the Lib Dems could support a Conservative-led government. With results in 637 constituencies declared, the Conservatives were on 301 seats, followed by Labour on 255 and the centrist Lib Dems on 54. The lack of an outright winner able to command 326 votes in the House of Commons brings smaller parties into play. While Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg was disappointed with his party's showing, he called on the Conservatives, as the largest party, to try to form the next government. But he and other senior party officials indicated their support might be conditional on reforming an electoral process that is stacked against smaller parties. "It seems this morning that it is the Conservative party that has more votes and more seats, though not an absolute majority, and that is why I think it is now for the Conservative party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest," Clegg told reporters in London. The BBC calculated the Conservatives had taken 36 percent of the overall vote, Labour 29 percent and the Lib Dems 23 perc
