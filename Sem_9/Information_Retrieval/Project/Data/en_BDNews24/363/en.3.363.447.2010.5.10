 Narayanganj, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  Workers belonging to two readymade garment factories in Narayanganj blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway over their wage arrears on Monday grinding traffic to a halt. Workers of Antim Knitting Dying and Antim Composite took positions on the highway at around 9am and smashed about 8 vehicles. Rupganj police chief Forkan Sikder said they were trying hard to quell the situation. The workers had earlier damaged furniture inside the factories and locked the main entrance. The demonstrators said the owners had told them they would be paid their outstanding salaries on Monday. But when they came to the factory they came to know that they were not getting salaries which provoked them to take this action. About 4,000 workers are employed in the two factories. bd
