 ACCRA, May 8 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac on Friday unveiled a 30-man squad for a May 24-29 training camp in France ahead of the World Cup finals. Four players, including three goalkeepers, who play club football in Ghana are included in the squad alongside Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien, currently recuperating from a knee injury. Portsmouth's Kevin-Prince Boateng was also named in the squad, having chosen to represent the country of his birth despite previously playing for Germany at youth level. His final inclusion for the June 11-July 11 tournament in South Africa depends, however, on a green light from world governing body FIFA. Ghana, making their second World Cup appearance after that in 2006, have been drawn in Group D for football's showpiece event, and will play Serbia (June 13), Australia (June 19) and Germany (June 23) in their pool matches.
