 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Co-chairman of education policy formulation committee Qazi Kholiquzzaman has urged the government to raise allocation for education to Tk 20,000 crore in the next budget from current the Tk 14,400 crore. He made the call from a roundtable discussion on financing education organised by the National Teachers-Employees Front at the National Press Club on Thursday. Kholiquzzaman suggested establishing a permanent education commission and formulating a comprehensive law to better implement education policy. "Without a permanent education policy there will be no continuity of the commission's decisions," he said. Kholiquzzaman also suggested establishing a council to determine the standards of education. Teachers-Employees Front chief coordinator Kazi Faruk Ahmed said investment in education has to be increased "since it's the most productive sector." Director general of the secondary and higher secondary education directorate Abdur Rashid, president of Bangladesh Polytechnic Teachers' Association Shamsur Rahman and finance director of the National University Mollah Mahfuz Al Hossain also spoke at the roundtable.
