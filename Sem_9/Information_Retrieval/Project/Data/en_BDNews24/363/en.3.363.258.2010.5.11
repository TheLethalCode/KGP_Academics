 KIEV, May 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Around 2,000 supporters of Ukraine's pro-Western opposition held an angry protest in central Kiev on Tuesday to condemn President Viktor Yanukovych's pursuit of close ties with Russia. The protesters held banners with slogans such as "Yanukovych, stop selling Ukraine!" and waved blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags outside the country's parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, amid a heavy police presence. Several hundred counter-demonstrators from Yanukovych's political party also rallied next to the parliament building, which was surrounded by metal barricades erected by police. More than 1,000 police, many wearing flak jackets and armed with truncheons, stood guard around parliament and kept the two camps apart. Tuesday's mass protest had been called by Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister and head of Ukraine's biggest opposition party, to condemn what she considers Yanukovych's attack on Ukrainian sovereignty. It comes three weeks after Yanukovych signed a controversial agreement with Moscow that will allow Russia to main a naval base in Ukraine for at least 25 more years in exchange for cheaper natural gas. Yanukovych said the pact would save Ukraine billions of dollars and help the country recover from a deep economic crisis, but critics slammed it as a sell-out of Ukraine's national interests to its Soviet-era master. Lawmakers from pro-Western opposition parties threw eggs and smoke bombs and brawled with Yanukovych supporters during a raucous session of parliament last month in which the controversial agreement was ratified. The Verkhovna Rada was calm on Tuesday, but lawmakers voted to hold hearings on Wednesday in which the government will explain what further agreements it plans to sign with Russia -- a potentially explosive topic. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is scheduled to visit Kiev on May 17-18 and the opposition is worried that he will sign more agreements binding together Russia and Ukraine. Late last month, Russia's strongman Prime Minister Vladimir Putin outraged the Ukrainian opposition with a proposal to merge of Ukraine's state gas firm, Naftogaz, with Russia's much larger state energy giant, Gazprom. There have also been reports that the two governments are considering closer cooperation in the nuclear-energy and aircraft-construction sectors. The flurry of deals between Russia and Ukraine comes after Yanukovych was elected president in February, replacing the staunchly pro-Western Viktor Yushchenko, who had chilly relations with Moscow. Under Yushchenko, Ukraine had sought close ties with the European Union and membership in the NATO military alliance, angering the Kremlin. Following his election victory, Yanukovych was widely expected to improve ties with Russia, but many observers were stunned by the speed with which his team moved to conclude agreements with Putin and Medvedev. Tuesday's demonstration is a key test for Tymoshenko, a former prime minister turned opposition leader, as she fights to retain relevance after losing the presidential election to Yanukovych in February. Tymoshenko announced on Saturday that she would seek to have Yanukovych impeached, but her effort appears to be symbolic, since impeachment requires a two-thirds majority in parliament and the opposition is in the minority. Last week Tymoshenko also accused Yanukovych of allowing Ukraine to slip into "dictatorship" and said he was failing to consult with civil society as he pushed ahead with his pro-Russian polici
