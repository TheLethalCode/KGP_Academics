<TITLE> Launch strike weakens </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)- The strike of launch workers seemed to be weakening on Tuesday morning as the strike entered its fourth day, with eight out of 10 scheduled launches leaving Sadarghat terminal. The number of launches that left on Monday morning was six out of scheduled 10. Two other launches failed to leave due to mechanical fault, said Mahtab Uddin, traffic inspector of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. He said 18 launches arrived at the terminal from the southern region in the morning. The members of the Noujan Sramik Federation, who enforced the strike, were not seen in the terminal. On Monday, the federation's acting president Shah Alam was arrested on Monday in a case for vandalising the office of the pro-government Noujan Sramik League which had filed a case on Sunday against 125 federation members. The strike started on Friday midnight as the Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a government announcement of a new pay scale increasing wages by between 50 to100 percent against a demand from them of a 300-350 percent rise. Some unions have already agreed to the pay hike. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, however, had termed the strike 'irrational' as it was called even after declaring the new pay scale. On Sunday the minister called for the workers to call off the strike and to sit in a meeting. The workers rejected the call and demanded the resignation of the minister. bdnews24.
