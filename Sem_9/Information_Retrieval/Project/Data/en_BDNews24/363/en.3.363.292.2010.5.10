 MANILA, may 10 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Ten people were killed and glitches with vote-counting machines frustrated voters in Philippine elections on Monday, but authorities insisted the country's first automated ballot was a success. Tens of millions of Filipinos turned up at polling stations across the archipelago to elect a successor to President Gloria Arroyo, whose near decade-long rule has been tarnished by allegations of corruption. Noynoy Aquino, a 50-year-old bachelor, was the favourite to win the presidency after riding a wave of popular sentiment for his democracy-hero parents and vowing to crack down on government corruption. But violence that always plagues Philippine politics, as well as problems with the nation's first effort at using computers to count votes, fuelled longstanding concerns about whether the election would be credible. "Many people are voting and there are many complaints," election commissioner Rene Sarmiento told reporters. More than 17,000 positions were at stake -- from president down to municipal council seats -- and local politicians who are infamous for using their "private armies" to eliminate rivals or intimidate voters were out in force. Ten people were killed across the country on polling day, bringing the death toll from election-related violence over the past four months to at least 40, according to police statistics. Two of the fatalities occurred as gunbattles raged in the flashpoint southern province of Maguindanao, where 57 people were killed in an election-linked massacre late last year. The army, which deployed thousands of troops to Maguinanao to minimise the violence there, said soldiers engaged in a series of firefights with unknown assailants who fired rocket propelled grenades near polling stations. Voters fled polling booths to escape the violence, while the military reported the two people who died were killed in clashes elsewhere between the private armies of rival politicians. Technological problems also emerged immediately after polls opened with some machines breaking down, and the election commission was forced to extend the voting period by one hour. Long queues formed at polling stations with the election commission estimating 85 percent of the 50 million eligible voters would turn out. Most embarrassingly for election organisers, Aquino was forced to wait five hours to vote in his home province of Tarlac when a ballot-counting machine broke down. "This should not have happened and it would not have happened if Comelec had done its job," said Aquino, referring to the election commission. Nevertheless, the election commission and security chiefs insisted the country's first effort at automated polling had succeeded. Election commissioner Gregorio Larazzabel described the elections as a "celebration of democracy", while the military said the number of deaths was lower than previous elections thanks to the automated polls. "I think the effect was the counting was faster and therefore the anticipation and the tension was eased," national military election task force spokesman Colonel Ricardo Nepomuceno told reporters. Aquino's main rivals are former president Joseph Estrada, 73, and property magnate Manny Villar, 60. Two major independent surveys gave Aquino voter support of between 39 and 42 percent, a two-to-one lead over his challengers that placed him on course for the biggest win in Philippine election history. The frontrunner is the only son of former president Corazon Aquino and her assassinated husband, Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, who are revered by many for spearheading the restoration of Philippine democracy in the 1980s. However, Philippine democracy is unpredictable and Aquino's win is no certainty because of Villar's vast political machinery and Estrada's popularity among the poor even after being deposed as president in 2001 for being corrupt. Many colourful characters are contesting the elections, including world boxing champion Manny Pacquiao, 31, who is running for a seat in the lower house. Another candidate for the lower house is Imelda Marcos, 80, who gained global notoriety when thousands of her shoes were found in the presidential palace after her late husband Ferdinand's overthrow in 1
