<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has given the telecoms regulator seven days to decide whether RanksTel's licence should be cancelled. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Gobinda Chandra Tagore gave the order on Tuesday following a writ petition by A Rouf Chowdhury, chairman of the private land phone company. The verdict said: "If the licence is cancelled, an administrator has to be appointed there." "The administrator will be working for six months or until the criminal case against the authority is resolved." Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) on Mar 18 shut down RanksTel, the third telephone company to be caught in BTRC's drive against illegal VoIP operations. Rouf filed a writ petition on Mar 21 challenging its legality. The court asked for an explanation from the government on why the disconnection was not illegal. The BTRC on Mar 23 served a notice on the company asking why its licence would not be cancelled. Rafique-ul-Huq argued for the accused and deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil for the state.
