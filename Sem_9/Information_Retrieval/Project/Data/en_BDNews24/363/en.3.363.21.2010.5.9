 Dhaka, May 09 (bdnews24.com) -- The BDR mutiny was triggered by rumours spread by a group of over-enthusiastic renegades, according to outgoing BDR chief Mainul Islam. Speaking at a press conference at the BDR Peelkhana headquarters on Sunday, his last day in office, he however did not explain what the rumours were. Gen Mainul became chief of the Bangladesh Rifles last year after the killing of then director general Maj Gen Shakil Ahmed during the mutiny of Feb 25-26, 2009. He is now returning to the army after completing his job in the paramilitary force. Maj Gen Rafiqul Islam will replace him. On whether there was any provocation for the mutiny, Islam said, "This does not fall under our jurisdiction. The Criminal Investigation Department is investigating it." The CID is also investigating the killings that took place at the BDR headquarters. The outgoing chief also said that many of the accused BDR members are not telling the truth at the court. "Proving that they are lying at court is enough to prove guilt." Responding to a journalist query about whether his absence would hamper the trial, the BDR chief said that it is a continuous process and would not be hampered. There are also six special courts trying those accused of taking part in the mutiny. They were set up under the BDR law with the BDR chief as the head of the courts. Special tribunals in Satkhira, Feni, Panchagarh, Rangamati and Thakurgaon have already delivered verdicts. Many BDR men have already been sentenced to the highest penalty of seven years in jail. After Mainul became the chief of BDR he took steps to reconstruct the force. The name of the force is to be changed and the members have also got new uniforms. After getting approval from the government the paramilitary force will be named as Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB). Gen Mainul said, "There are two main changes. One is in the law and other is in the overall organisation." According to him, the counting of arms in Peelkhana finished on Apr 18 and 78 weapons are missing including pistols, rifles and submachine guns. He said a three-tier intelligence system has been introduced in the force with the Border Security Bureau in the forces level, Regional Intelligence Bureau in the region and sector level, and the Battalion Intelligence Platoon in the battalion level. Gen Mainul said a decision has been made to build 20 to 25 feet high sentry-post along the border. Mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in the capital resulted in deaths of more than 70 people, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. bdnew
