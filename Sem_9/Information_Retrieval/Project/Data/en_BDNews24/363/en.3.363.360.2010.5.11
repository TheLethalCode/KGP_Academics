<TITLE> 'Govt giving quack cures to power, water crises' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  A former caretaker adviser has accused the government of preferring quack cures for the crisis-ridden power and water sectors to taking any concrete measure. The often vocal Akbar Ali Khan said on Tuesday almost 40 to 50 million people of the country has no access to drinking water. The government should ensure drinking water to all by the next year, keeping with its campaign pledge, the former adviser said. But the way it is making progress, he observed, it will not be possible to hit the target even in 2021. The power crisis cannot be permanently resolved by setting up rental power plants, Khan claimed. He demanded publication of a white paper in parliament. Bangladesh's economy is going through a transition with a negative export growth and industries not buoyant, the interim adviser added. And even though the number of the destitute has reduced, the number of hungry people on the streets have increased. Bangladesh has more people starving than the entire Africa continent has, the former cabinet secretary said. Khan was speaking at a seminar on 'Inflation and Budget: Thought of Marginalised People' organised by Samunnoy in the city. Only speaking against business syndicates will not work, rather the government should pass strict laws against them. The government does not have adequate cold storages and godowns, Khan added. Khan stated that the government should provide increased allotment to this sector in the upcoming budget. He slammed the MPs for not speaking of the people's demands in the parliament, which is why the electorates had never seen their expectations reflected in the national budgets. Bangladesh Institute for Development Studies teacher Taibur Rahman said it is the poor people who suffer most from inflation. He also urged the government to implement anti-poverty projects. Khandaker Ibrahim Khaled, Bangladesh Krishi Bank chairman, presided over the seminar while the key address was presented by Mahfuz Kabir, BIDS research fellow. bdnews2
