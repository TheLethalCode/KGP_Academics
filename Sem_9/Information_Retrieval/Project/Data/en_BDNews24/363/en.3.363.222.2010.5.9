 ESTORIL, Portugal, May 9 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Roger Federer will attempt to put his game right with a rapid turnaround in Spain after falling 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) to defending champion Alberto Montanes at the Estoril Open on Saturday. The Swiss world number one, Estoril champion in 2008, was ambushed on a slow, rain-soaked court by the Spanish specialist, who he'd beaten in three previous meetings. But despite going down in just under 90 minutes, Federer is looking ahead with quiet optimism to a pair of high-profile title defences in Madrid from Sunday and then at Roland Garros. "I'm not worried, the French (Open) is still too far away," said Federer of the clay Grand Slam, which begins on May 23. "This stuff happens. "My goal is not to win 12 events in a year anymore. It's to win big events like Grand Slams, Masters 1000s and the year-end championships. "It's a disappointing match to lose. I just couldn't get off to a good start and I struggled the whole way through." After losing serve three times in the 30-minute opening set, Federer found a small patch of form against the world number 34. "I tried to play from the back of the court, but this is not the tennis I wanted to show for sure," he said. "In the second set I had some better moments, but I have to pick up my game." The Swiss insists that faster conditions on clay at altitude in Madrid will help him out, as well as the faster clay of the French Open. "I'm happy, at I least got three matches this week -- though I would have liked to get one more. Alberto played a good match," he said. "He's a clay-courter and knows his stuff. He didn't give me much and I struggled from the beginning." The contest began with more than two hours of delay after downpours drenched the Estadio Nacionale. Montanes will face off in Sunday's final against the winner from fifth seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez's encounter with Portugal's Frederico Gil. Federer now goes into his title defence at the Madrid Masters with a 2-2 record on clay this year. In the final of the WTA event, Latvian Anastasia Sevastova defeated Spain's Arantxa Parra Santonja 6-2, 7-5. Success on an outside court marked the first career trophy for the world number 74. "I'm very satisfied to win here," said Sevastova. "It was a very difficult match played in tough conditions. I hope to keep this up next week in Mad
