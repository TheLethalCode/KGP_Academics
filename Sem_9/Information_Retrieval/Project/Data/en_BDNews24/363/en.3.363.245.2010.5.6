<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6(bdnews24.com) -- Food minister Abdur Razzak has said the country is still facing the risk of food insecurity though the production has tripled from that of the pre-independence period. "We're yet to ensure food for all and still in the risk of food insecurity," he said while speaking at the closing session of a three-day workshop organised by private think-tank Centre for Policy Dialogue at BRAC Centre Inn in Dhaka on Thursday. The minister said Bangladeshi people's nutrition intake is not adequate. Economist M Sayeeduzzaman chaired the session, addressed, among others, by Sohrab Hossain MP from Khulna's cyclone Aila-hit area, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on agriculture Shawkat Momen Shahjahan MP and CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman. Apart from Bangladesh, delegates from India, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Pakistan and Sri Lanka attended the workshop. Razzak said climate change is posing a threat to agriculture of the country, which is very disaster-prone because of its geographical location. He said climate change has triggered rise in sea level, which will ultimately increase salinity in water. It will also cause droughts and floods, he added. "So we've to develop new species of food-grains so that we can continue production in adverse situation." The minister mentioned that two salinity-tolerant paddy species -- Bina-8 and Bina-9 -- are being cultivated in the country. He said annual wheat production has dropped to 10 lakh tonnes from 20 lakh tonnes. Referring to climate change fund, he said the people hit by climate change impacts would get money from the fund. bdn
