Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Quamrunnahar Rumi gave the orders on Tuesday. Investigation officer (IO) and sub-inspector of Turag police Nibaran Chandra Barman sought seven days in the murder case and five days in the arms case to remand the suspects in custody. The police recovered senior cameraman Shafikul Islam Mithu's strangled body from Rustampur dam on Sunday morning. Mithu had been missing since Saturday night while returning home from office. All the suspects were detained on Sunday. The IO in the remand request said the detainees were muggers and were primarily suspected to have been involved with the killing.
