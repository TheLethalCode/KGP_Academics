 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday granted the police three days to interrogate nine members of banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The nine Islamists were arrested from Badda, Dhaka on Sunday. The judge, SA Tofail Hossain, of Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Tuesday granted the police three days to quiz the detainees. Badda police sub-inspector Mosabbir Hossain had asked for ten days. According to the remand petition, the police arrested the nine  students of different educational institutions of the city  from a house in Bashundhara residential area for possession of Jihadist books and hand outs of Hizb-ut-Tahrir while they were in a secret meeting. The accused are identified as Nur Islam, Md Mahbub, Amanur Rashid, Rakib, Nazmul Hossain, Imtiaz Ahmed, Syad Nasir, Ariffuzzaman and Abdullah Al Mamun. Advocate Md Jashim Uddin prayed for the bail petition of the accused. Jashim Uddin said that the police had seized no hand outs from the accused. The students were only tenants of the house. They were not activists of the banned Islamist outfit. He claimed that the police arrested the students suspecting them as Tahrir activists to serve their own interests. A Dhaka court on Sunday granted police two days to interrogate four members of the same outfit's Dhaka University unit. The Shahbagh police arrested the four activists of Chhatra Mukti from Surja Sen Hall at around 2am on Saturday for distributing Islamist leaflets.
