<TEXT>
 Barguna, May 6 (bdnews24.com) Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked about the source of the huge undisclosed money that opposition chief Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman had later legalised. Addressing a public meeting in Barguna on Thursday, she asked, "Where did they get the money if they had not engaged in corruption?" She said BNP had looted people's assets after coming to power. "They wanted to be in power again by enlisting 12.3 million fake voters. But the people did not let it succeed." Blaming the BNP for the nagging power crisis, she said, "We have to face this crisis as the BNP cancelled projects undertaken during our previous term." "They did not even add one megawatt of electricity to the national grid during their five-year tenure," she claimed. However, Power Development Board (PDB) data show that three new power plants and two existing plants had extensions under the public sector between Oct 2001 and Oct 2006 period, when the BNP-led government was in power. The public sector added 667 MW. At the same time 679.45 MW was added by the private sector to put the total to 1346.45 MW. The prime minster said that the grand alliance government was moving ahead with a realistic work-plan for a comprehensive development of the sector. According to the long-term plans, projects were under way to generate 792 MW power by the end of this year. The long-term plan envisions that 920 MW will be added by 2011, 1369 MW by 2012, 1975 MW by 2013, 1770 MW by 2014 and 2600 MW by 2015. This would bring the total power generation to 9276 MW by 2015, according to Hasina's speech in parliament on Apr 5. bdnews2
