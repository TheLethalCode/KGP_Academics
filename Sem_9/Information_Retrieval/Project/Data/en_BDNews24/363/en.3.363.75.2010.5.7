 MUMBAI, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Supreme court will on Friday issue a ruling in a gas-pricing dispute between the billionaire Ambani brothers that has rattled investors and raised concerns over the influence of powerful businesses on government policy. The highly public feud in the country's richest family has riveted India. A decision is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. (0500 GMT) on Friday, according to the Supreme Court of India's website. The outcome could set a basis for future regulations on gas pricing in India, and could determine whether Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries, the country's most valuable listed company, makes or loses billions of dollars in potential profits on gas sales. Mukesh Ambani is the world's fourth-richest man with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $29 billion, while estranged younger brother Anil Ambani, ranked 36th, is worth about $13.7 billion. The case involves terms of a deal under which Reliance Industries was to supply Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural with 28 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas for 17 years at a rate below the government price. The gas, which Reliance Natural wants at almost half the government-set rate of $4.2 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu), comes from the Krishna Godavari basin off India's east coast, which is operated by Reliance Industries. The field is India's biggest gas find and should nearly double the nation's gas output when production is at full throttle at 80 mmscmd. Energy-hungry India, which wants to reduce its dependence on foreign oil and become a new frontier for oil and gas exploration, has showcased the Krishna Godavari discovery to attract foreign investors. But analysts worry the Ambani dispute is putting off foreign investors, with government interference in the pricing and marketing of gas raising investment risk in a politically sensitive resource. "This is going to be a benchmark judgement. Everyone wants clarity on what price gas is going to be sold in this country and only then will they agree to invest in it," Deven Choksey, chief executive of K.R. Choksey Shares and Securities, said. The disputed deal was part of a 2005 family settlement between the Ambani brothers under which the Reliance empire was split following the death of their father. The brothers have been in several disputes since then. A verdict was expected before May 11, as Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, part of a three-judge bench that heard the case, is set to retire on that date. Reliance Industries argues the private deal cannot take precedence over government policy, which determines who can receive gas and at what price. Anil Ambani, who claims otherwise, rolled out a series of front-page advertisements in major newspapers accusing the government of taking the side of Reliance Industries. The government initially filed a petition in India's highest court asking to be made a party in the dispute, arguing the family deal was not applicable, and Reliance Industries could only sell gas with its consent. The government later modified its stance, saying it only wanted to assert that it is the rightful owner of the
