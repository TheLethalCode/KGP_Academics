<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  It will be the third anniversary of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's return from exile on Friday. A military-backed interim government enforced an unofficial ban on Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia from travelling abroad since the imposition of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007. Hasina went to see her grand-daughter Sofia Wajed Joy in America after the withdrawal of the travel ban. However, she was asked not to come home through a government press note on April 18. She left the United States for UK to return to Bangladesh on Apr 19, 2007. But the British Airways did not let her pass through the boarding gate when she was about to leave London on April 22. In a dramatic reversal, the military-backed interim government, apparently under immense public pressure, withdrew the bar on Apr 25, 2007. She returned on May 7 that same year after 53 days. Awami League (AL) leaders flocked to the airport and followed her to Shuda Sadan, her private residence, to greet their party chief. Eldest among the five children of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding president of Bangladesh, Hasina's party was elected to power in the general elections of Dec 29, 2008. Many compare this homecoming with another one of May 17, 1981 when Hasina returned from India six years after the massacre of her family including Sheikh Mujib. She has been the president of the ruling Awami League since 1981. The members of the present government including the central AL leaders are set to meet Hasina at her official residence popularly known as Ganabhaban in the morning. bdne
