 MANILA, May 11 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Benigno Aquino was set Tuesday to become the new Philippine president, pledging to fight corruption after riding on a wave of support from the "People Power" movement of his democracy hero parents. Aquino told AFP in an interview even before being formally proclaimed the winner that he would "lead by example" and bring in clean government after almost a decade under the corruption-tainted rule of President Gloria Arroyo. The reserved 50-year-old senator steamrolled his rivals, with latest results showing him grabbing 40 percent of the estimated 37.5 million votes cast Monday in the country's first automated polls. In the interview, he also said that once in office he would ensure that Arroyo, one of the Philippines' most unpopular leaders, would be investigated for alleged vote-rigging in the last election in 2004. "I want to lead by example. We talk about corruption. I did make a public vow, I will never steal," he said, adding that this would give him the "moral authority" to make others conform. Millions of Filipinos had turned out to vote Monday despite deadly bouts of violence and complaints about problems with ballot-counting machines that led to long queues. "Noynoy" Aquino, the son of the Philippines' most revered democracy heroes, wooed the country during a tumultuous election campaign with his mantra of clean government and pledges to reduce poverty. His closest rival, former president Joseph Estrada, 73, was trailing on 25 percent with only a few million votes left to tally but he refused to concede until final results were in. However, other candidates were already congratulating Aquino, a former economics student of Arroyo who became one of her fiercest critics. He is due to take office at the end of her six-year term on June 30. Among the winners of the thousands of other posts up for grabs were Imelda Marcos, the flamboyant widow of toppled dictator Ferdinand Marcos, and world boxing champion Manny Pacquiao. Aquino's mother Corazon Aquino led the "People Power" revolution that overthrew the late dictator Marcos in 1986 and then served as president. His father, Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, was shot dead in 1983 as he attempted to return from US exile to lead the movement against Marcos. The United States, the former colonial power, hailed the overall conduct of the election and said it looked forward to working with the new leader of a key Asian ally. Aquino was a latecomer to the presidential race, declaring his candidacy only after his mother's death from cancer last August plunged the country into mourning and demonstrated the power of the family name. But Marcos's widow Imelda, the 80-year-old known for her fetish for fancy shoes, made a dramatic return to the public eye more than two decades after the popular revolt forced the family to flee into exile in Hawaii. Imelda won a seat in the House of Representatives, while her son Ferdinand Jnr, 52, was heading for the Senate and daughter Imee, 56, was elected governor of the family's home province of Ilocos Norte. The estimated 75 percent national turnout was seen as an affirmation of Filipinos' commitment to democracy and their desire to have a say in the country's future. Shares surged on Aquino's expected victory, with the Manila bourse closing up 3.85 percent to 3,262.93, the biggest jump in more than eight months. "I voted for him so that our lives will change. He should end our hardship," said Lina Biazon, a 55-year-old street vendor in Manila. The feisty Arroyo, 63, pledged a smooth handover of power but is intent on remaining in politics with a seat in congress. The violence that always plagues Philippine politics inevitably flared but security officials said it was a relatively peaceful and orderly exercise. More than 17,000 positions were at stake -- from president down to municipal council seats -- and candidates included local politicians who are infamous for using "private armies" to eliminate rivals or intimidate voters. Ten people were killed on polling day, bringing the death toll from election-related violence this year to at least 40, excluding the 57 killed in a grisly massacre last year that shocked the nation. Another six were killed Tuesday by communist guerrillas who have been staging sporadic attacks on security forces after being forced into small pockets of activity in the archipelago of more than 90 million peop
