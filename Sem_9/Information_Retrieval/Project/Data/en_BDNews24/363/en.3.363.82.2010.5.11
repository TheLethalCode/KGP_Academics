 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)--A man died in police custody allegedly from torture in Chittagong on Tuesday. Thirty-two-year old Muhammad Manik, a security guard of Abujan Market and Anjuman Hotel at Reazuddin Bazar, was arrested the day before in a case for stealing mobile-phone sets. Manik fell ill after vomiting several times in the early hours of Tuesday and died on his way to the hospital, said Muhammad Shahin, sub-inspector of Kotwali Police Station. Shop workers of Riazuddin Bazar alleged that Manik had died from torture. Banaj Kumar Mazumder, deputy commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (North), admitted that Manik died in their custody. He said that investigation can reveal whether the police had a hand in the death. On May 7, 28 mobile handsets and Tk 30,000 were stolen from a shop in the Abujan market and the shop owner, Arman, filed a case accusing Manik. Sub-inspector Shahin said that Arman and his employees handed Manik to the police around 11pm on Monday. He was ill when he was brought to the police station, Shahin claimed. The shop owner and his employees might have beaten him before handing him to the police, he added. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, joint general secretary of Riazuddin Bazar Workers Welfare Council, alleged that the police had ties with Arman and his associates, and Manik was tortured to death. CMP commissioner Mazumder said police would start investigation after the autopsy. A case in this connection has been filed. bdnew
