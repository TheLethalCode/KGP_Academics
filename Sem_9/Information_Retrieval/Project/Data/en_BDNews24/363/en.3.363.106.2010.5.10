 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com) The High Court has come down hard on the use of chemical agents like carbide for the ripening of fruits. Responding to a public interest petition, the court ordered legal measures to be taken against those using chemicals to artificially ripen summer fruits. The bench of Justice A H M Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Justice Mohammed Delwar Hossain on Monday ordered the government to identify those warehouses and depots where this is taking place, and to take action. The court also instructed the ministries of commerce, food and home to form their own monitoring committees, which should together submit a joint report within 15 days outlining measures to prevent the use of chemicals. The court also ordered the government to explain in three weeks why it had not taken any steps to bar the use of chemicals for ripening fruits in order to protect public health. Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a rights NGO, filed the petition. Manzil Morshed, who represented the organisation at the hearing, said some rogue businessmen use chemicals including carbides to quickly ripen fruits for higher profits. "But the chemicals are affecting people because of this practice." The National Board of Revenue chairman was also ordered to stop import of fruits mixed with chemicals. "Deputy inspector general of Rajshahi police was also asked to deploy police in the commercial mango orchards to prevent application of chemicals." He added that the directors general of both Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute (BSTI) and the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) had been also asked to constantly monitor food storages in Dhaka to prevent this practice of artificially ripening mangoes. The court also ordered daily examinations of the fruits. It asked relevant agencies to file charges under the special tribunal against responsible quarters at all stages. bdnews24.c
