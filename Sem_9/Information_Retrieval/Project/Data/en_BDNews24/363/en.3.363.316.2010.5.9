<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission on Sunday asked the Jamaat-e-Islami for the third time to amend its constitution in line with the electoral laws and the country's constitution. The opposition party says it will sit with the Commission soon over the amendments. Jamaat's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid told bdnews24.com, "We have earlier received a letter from the EC last week. We will sit soon to decide on our stance on the matter." "The party's law secretary will fix an appointment with Commission for a meeting." Asked how much time they will need to make the changes, the Jamaat leader said they will be done 'well before' the June 10 deadline. The Commission has marked at least seven articles in the party's constitution that require changing. The EC's joint secretary (law) and convener of the party constitution scrutinising committee Nurul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com, "It is the third time we have written to Jamaat-e-Islami for amending some of the conflicting articles in their constitution." The Commission first wrote to the fundamentalist party on Jan 24 and then on Mar 25. On Mar 24, Mojahid told bdnews24.com that their leaders had agreed upon making two changes to the party constitution. They, however, did not agree to make the remaining amendments, Mojahid said, adding that they would seek clarification on the articles in the meeting with Commission. On Mar 25, election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told reporters that measures would be taken in line with the registration guidelines if any party failed to amend its constitution accordingly. Guidelines allow for the scrapping of registration if amended constitutions are not submitted. But, Shakhawat added, "Although the Election Commission is empowered to cancelparty registration, it should not be done hastily." The parties could consult the Commission, which will help resolve their problems, he had added. Around 39 political parties had provisionally registered with the Commission with their draft constitution before ninth general elections. Freedom Party later lost its registration as it had failed to submit its amended constitution before Jan 25. The Commission, sources say, will remind some more parties about amending their constitutions. b
