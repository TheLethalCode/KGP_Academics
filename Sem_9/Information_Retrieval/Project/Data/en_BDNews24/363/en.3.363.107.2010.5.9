 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)The government plans to build a new road, bypassing Dhaka, connecting Mawa Ghat with Jamuna Multi Purpose Bridge. According to the communications ministry, this road - popularly known as the Western Bypass - is necessary as otherwise the construction of the new Padma bridge, connecting 22 southern districts with Dhaka, would cause unnecessary traffic to enter the capital causing gridlock According to the communications ministry north and south bound vehicles could be diverted through this 42km road. The communications ministry's joint chief Rokeya Begum told bdnews24.com that it has proposed that project should be included in the next year's annual development programme (ADP). The project would involve building a four lane 170-feet wide road from Baorvita point, of the proposed Padma Bridge's approach road towards Mawa Ghat, with the Jamuna Bridge approach road, via Turag point on the Dhaka-Aricha Highway. It said that, having seen the detailed area plan (DAP) of RAJUK (Rajdhani Unnayan Kortipokkah) and its strategic plan, the ministry was concerned that if it did not take the initiative immediately to build the bypass, the planned route of the bypass will be taken over by unplanned building and industrial mills. The ministry also said that the project cost would increase if the government delayed building the bypass as the proposed route is close to the city. An official of the Planning Commission said that the government has taken up implementation of the western bypass alongside the construction of Padma Bridge. The Padma Bridge's construction will start from next year and the government hopes that it will be completed by 2013. "The project proposal for the construction of the western bypass is at a primary stage," said Rokeya Begum, a joint chief of the communications ministry. The roads and highways department will take further preparations after it has been approved, she said. It's cost is estimated to be Tk 300 crore. The ministry wants the implementation of the western bypass project to be completed in the same period as the construction of the Padma bridge. About 89 hectares of land will need to be purchased with full compensation. About 18 kilometres will be constructed initially and the rest will be done in the second stage. b
