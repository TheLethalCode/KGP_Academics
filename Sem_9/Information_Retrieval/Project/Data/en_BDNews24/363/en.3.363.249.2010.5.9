<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  As the strike of a faction of water transport workers entered its second day, on Sunday, its effect appeared to intensify with less than half of the scheduled launches being able to leave Dhaka's Sadarghat terminal. Only six launches left Dhaka's Sadarghat terminal, instead of the 13 scheduled to leave. BIWTA traffic inspector Mahtab Uddin told bdnews24.com that there were less than 15 launches anchored to the terminal at Sunday midday, when on Saturday at that time 37 launches were anchored. The strike was called after the Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a government announcement of a new pay scale increasing wages by between 50 to100 percent against a demand from them of a 300-350 percent rise. The announcement came after a tripartite meeting on Thursday between government, workers and owners. Some unions have already agreed to the pay hike. Federation leaders claimed on Saturday that launch workers had been supporting their strike but the authorities had forced several launches to operate under police cordon. bd
