 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh A succumbed to their second consecutive defeat in the tri-series, falling short by 29 runs against West Indies A at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday, reports Cricinfo. West Indies were boosted by half-centuries from Darren Bravo and Brendan Nash which helped take their team to a competitive 259 for seven. The pair added 84 for the third wicket, and some attacking batting at the death from Imran Khan took West Indies past 250. Bangladesh were well placed for much of their innings, opener Nazimuddin leading the way with an 86-ball 89, comprising 13 fours. He was supported by captain Shamsur Rahman, with whom he added 84, while Raqibul Hasan and Marshall Ayub scored 46 and 43 respectively to keep the chase on track. At 176 for three in the 35th over, Bangladesh had the upper hand but two quick wickets in successive overs for one run pegged them back. Ayub fought hard, batting with the lower order, but when he fell with the score on 230 to make it nine down, West Indies had the game covered. Seamer Nelon Pascal starred for them, taking four wickets to trigger Bangladesh's slide after they had threatened to scale down the target. Score summary: West Indies A: 259-7 (Bravo 69, Nash 60) beat Bangladesh A: 230 (Nazimuddin 89; Pascal 4-49) Result: West Indies A won by 29
