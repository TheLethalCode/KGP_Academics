 SYDNEY, May 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - People living overseas might forget to send a card or flowers for Mother's Day but they do remember to pick up the phone with a study finding international call volume is higher that day than on any other holiday. The study, by US-based international calling firm VIP Communications, found call volume on Mother's Day is 8 percent higher than at New Year, 11 percent higher than Valentine's Day and 62 percent up on Halloween. "We analyzed the calling habits of more than 50,000 VIP Communications customers over the past year in order to determine which expats show the most loyalty to their mothers over the phone on Mother's Day in their respective countries," said Peter Rogers, senior vice president of VIP Communications.

The VIP Communications (www.JoinVIP.Com) study found the United States ranks in the middle of the pack.
