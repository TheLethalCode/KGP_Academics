 BERLIN, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Former England coach Steve McClaren has agreed to leave Dutch league winners Twente Enschede for 2009 German champions VfL Wolfsburg. "It is now official," a Wolfsburg club representative told Reuters on Tuesday. The Bundesliga team said he was given a two-year deal until 2012 but no financial details were released.

McClaren was sacked by the English Football Association in November 2007. The 49-year-old replaces interim coach Lorenz-Guenther Koestner, who took over at Wolfsburg from Armin Veh midway through the season. In McClaren's first year with Twente the club finished second in the league and lost the Dutch Cup final to Heerenveen but this season they clinched the title by finishing a point ahead of Ajax Amsterdam.
