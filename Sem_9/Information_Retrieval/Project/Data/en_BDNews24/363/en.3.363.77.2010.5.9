 Bogra, May 9 (bdnews24.com) BNP's half-day general strike in Bogra on Sunday, protesting last week's death of local BNP leader Zakir Hossain was observed in a reasonably peaceful manner. It is alleged that Hossain was killed by ruling party activists. BNP leaders and activists were attacked when they were on their way to attend party chief Khaleda Zia's rally in Rajshahi on May 5. This is the first general strike called by the BNP under the current government regime that came to power 15 months ago. Traffic in the district came to a halt during the strike  though trains operated under the protection of the police despite picketers trying to create difficulties. On Sunday morning BNP held several processions in the district town in support of the strike. Saiful Islam, senior joint convener of district BNP said in a brief meeting after the strike that the programme was a success, and that the movement to eject the AL government from power had now started. A very few rickshaws ran in the city but no motor vehicles were seen on the streets. Picketers smashed three buses including one belonging to Bangladesh Road Transport Authority. One covered van and two cargo trucks were also reported to have been damaged. Local people said that buses from other districts did not enter Bogra. Azharul Islam, manager of the BRTC (Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation) Bogra office told bdnews24.com that picketers had vandalised one of their buses at the city's Gokul area. Station master of Bogra Rail Station, Benjurul Islam said that trains left from the station. Picketers stopped two trains at Kahalu and Talura at around 7am and 10am but police dispersed them protesters, he said. Monjurul Haque, sub inspector of Bogra Sadar Police Station, said that though the BNP activists brought out processions and held rallies no major untoward incident took place. HSC examinations have been kept out of the scope of the strike, and were allowed to continue. bdnews24.
