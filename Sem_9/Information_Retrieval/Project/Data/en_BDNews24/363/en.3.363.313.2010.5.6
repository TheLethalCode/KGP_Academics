 Barguna, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has launched a 'national service' project in poverty-stricken Barguna to generate jobs for the unemployed. After inaugurating the project on Thursday, she said this service will begin in Gopalganj after Kurigram and Barguna. In her 20-minute speech, she revealed her government's future plans for Barguna, a place she said was 'very poor'. She said her government had plans to upgrade the Barguna Sadr Hospital to a 250-bed one and develop communications. She also said each district in the south, including Barguna, will get necessary power and for that her government was taking steps. "Local government and administration will be decentralised to reach the doorsteps of people." Hasina reached Barguna Circuit House by helicopter at noon when she met with divisional and district level officers. At the meeting, she put emphasis on increasing revenue income in order to continue development activities. She called on them to carry out their duty for the welfare of people by rising above politics.

The two-time elected prime minister asked government officials to be sincere in maintaining law and order. She handed over appointment letters to seven persons while inaugurating the project. Some 14,000 unemployed youths of Barguna, aged between 18 and 35 having passed SSC exams, will get jobs under the project. In the first phase in Barguna, 4,000 youths from five upazilas will get jobs after their training. They will get a daily allowance of Tk 100 during the three-month training. On completion, they will be paid Tk 200 a day over a period of two years.
