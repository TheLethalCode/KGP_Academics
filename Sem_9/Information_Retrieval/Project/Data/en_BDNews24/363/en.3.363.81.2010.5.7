<TITLE> Ancelotti chalks off crazy first Chelsea year as 'normal' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A possible League and Cup double, a shock Champions League exit, the private lives of his players splashed all over the front pages - just a 'normal' first season at Chelsea according to manager Carlo Ancelotti. Even allowing for the Italian's limited English vocabulary his shoulder-shrugging verdict on Friday was a surprising one. Victory over Wigan Athletic on Sunday would secure Chelsea's first title since 2006 and a win over Portsmouth in the FA Cup final six days later would earn the Londoners their first domestic Double. And as the unexcitable 50-year-old looked back over an eventful time since his arrival from AC Milan last June, everything else has been a sideshow. "Really, I didn't have strong problems to resolve, it was normal," Ancelotti told reporters as at the club's training ground. "We lost some games and had a difficult moment after Manchester City and Inter (Milan) defeats but we moved on very quickly." He said the antics of John Terry, who was stripped of the England captaincy after it was revealed he had an affair with the girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge, and Ashley Cole, whose marital problems were also front-page news, had no impact. "I think that was not a problem for me, they were personal issues," he said. "Ash and John Terry were able to keep these problems outside the training ground and I never spoke about the personal problems. "If they had needed to speak with me about this, I would have been able to help. But if they don't ask me to do something, it's not my problem. They didn't, absolutely not." One occasion when he did speak with all his players was in the much-publicised March meeting that followed the Inter defeat and a flat performance in a 1-1 draw at Blackburn Rovers five days later. RIGHT SOLUTION Despite Terry and others previously saying the meeting had been a turning point, Ancelotti played down its significance. Asked if it had been important, he said: "I don't think so. We spoke a lot of times with the players to find a solution of our problems. It's the best thing to speak together and find the right solution." Something certainly changed though as Chelsea bounced back by beating Portsmouth 5-0, Aston Villa 7-1 and then securing the vital 2-1 win at Old Trafford that has put them on the brink of the title. However, having lost at Wigan in September and aware that another defeat or even a draw opens the door for United to snatch the honours by beating Stoke City, Ancelotti was far from counting his chickens. "We are in a very good situation, we can decide our destiny at home but Wigan are a good team, they've beaten us so we have to pay attention," he said. "To be champions we have to play as we did against Stoke (in last month's 7-0 win) and against Liverpool (in last weekend's 2-0 Anfield success). "We have to maintain the same confidence and determination. Nothing is decided yet and if we miss this we have no chance to recover." It is sure to be a rip-roaring afternoon at Stamford Bridge and Ancelotti said he had been surprised and impressed by the atmosphere in grounds around the country. "The league is a little bit different (from what I expected)," said the Italian, who also said he expected Joe Cole to remain at the club despite media transfer speculation. "I found a fantastic atmosphere. I have a great consideration for this championship, not only because of the quality of the teams but also the atmosphere, the stadiums." Ancelotti said he felt his team, who have beaten United, Arsenal and Liverpool home and away this season, would be worthy champions and that owner Roman Abramovich would be pleased with the success and the style in which it has been achieved. "I think Roman will be happy with this team. We are playing good football, showing good fair play on the pitch," he said. "If we are able to win (the title) it could be considered a fantastic sea
