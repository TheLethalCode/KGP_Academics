 Chittagong, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty has expressed his country's interest in monitoring the Chittagong City Corporation polls. The polls are expected to be held at the end of June this year. The last CCC polls were held on May 9, 2005. "The US is interested to closely observe the election process, system and activities of the political parties," Moriarty told journalists following a courtesy visit and dinner at the CCC mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury's residence on Sunday. When asked about the possibility of BNP boycotting the CCC elections after the Bhola by-election, Moriarty said, "It is an internal matter of Bangladesh. I do not want to comment on it." He also declined to make any comments on the Dhaka City Corporation polls being deferred. Moriarty also spoke with Chittagong mayor about the investment climate in Chittagong and the port. Mohiuddin urged the US ambassador to set up a separate export processing zone (EPZ) at Chittagong funded by US investments and to increase their investment in the power sector. Regarding the port, Moriarty said that the US wants to see the port 'safe' and 'secure' similar to other ports of the world, adding that they (US) were giving assistance in this regard. He asserted that they are ready to extend the assistance, if needed. During the visit, the US envoy's wife Laurence Moriarty, USAID mission director Danish Laurence and senior officials of the CCC were also present. bdnew
