 WASHINGTON, May 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States courted Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Tuesday, pledging not to abandon Afghanistan as the two sides opened high-level talks aimed at showing a united front in the nine-year war. The discussions, which include diplomatic, defence, military and intelligence chiefs on both sides, follow weeks of hostility caused by Karzai's anti-Western comments, including blaming the West for corruption in Afghanistan. In the first public session in an elegant State Department reception room, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States has a long-term commitment to Afghanistan and the two sides could have disagreements without rupturing ties. "As we look towards a responsible, orderly transition in the international combat mission in Afghanistan, we will not abandon the Afghan people," Clinton said. The goal of pulling out US troops from July 2011 has raised concerns among many Afghans that the United States will turn its back on them as it did following the Soviet pullout from Afghanistan in 1989. Clinton sought to allay those fears. "President (Barack) Obama has made clear that we will not allow that kind of detachment and oversight again," Clinton said. The July 2011 deadline to start withdrawing has always seemed ambitious given the widening Taliban insurgency more than eight years after US forces invaded following the September 11 attacks. The invasion toppled Afghanistan's Taliban rulers who had harboured the al Qaeda leadership responsible for the 2001 attacks on the United States. 'STEADY AND MATURE' Top military and civilian brass from both countries were symbolically seated together in the ornate Benjamin Franklin room, with ministers paired with counterparts rather than sitting opposite one another in a more formal fashion. Clinton smiled broadly as she welcomed Karzai, referring to the "long-term commitment" of the United States to his country. The Afghan leader talked of a "steady and mature" relationship, a "joint venture" and "partnership". It was in sharp contrast to a visit to Afghanistan by U.S. President Barack Obama in March when he entered the country in darkness and spent just six hours in Kabul, leaving without even having a full news conference with his host. The message then was one of tackling corruption, with Obama saying progress there was "too slow" in dealing with graft. But Clinton made little reference to corruption during her opening remarks on Tuesday, except to praise Karzai for the efforts he had made so far and gently call for more. "We know that long-term stability requires improved government capacity at every level. It requires a common and concerted effort against corruption," said Clinton. Karzai repeated previous pledges to tackle corruption and also sought to put behind him the recent tensions after a string of anti-Western statements incensed the White House. "Afghanistan will continue to build its institutions to preserve its progress and to walk towards the future with steady, strong steps," Karzai said. "We will be having disagreements on issues from time to time. But that is the sign of a mature relationship, the sign of a steady relationship," he added. In his meeting with Obama on Wednesday, Karzai is expected to press him on civilian casualties which have undermined the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan. Obama also wants details on a plan to re-integrate lower-level fighters from the Taliban as well as reconciliation with senior-level commanders, which will be hammered out during a national peace assembly, known as a "jirga," in Kabul starting May 29. Clinton reiterated the US position that to be reconciled, Taliban leaders must renounce violence, give up any ties to al Qaeda and abide by the Afghan constitution, which includes rights for women. "We look forward to the inclusion of women in all aspects of your re-integration and reconciliation efforts and in all aspects of Afghan society," Clinton s
