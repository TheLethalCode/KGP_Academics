<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)--- Traffic on the second Buriganga Bridge stopped for one and a half hours on Tuesday morning due to a blockade by auto rickshaw, rickshaw and van drivers. Auto rickshaw drivers were demonstrating for a cut in the toll on the bridge and the rickshaw and van drivers were demanding complete withdrawal of tolls for them. About 500 demonstrators took position in the southern side of the bridge at around 9:30am. South Keraniganj police chief Nilotpol Dey told bdnews24.com that traffic movement resumed at around 11am after the demonstrators finished their programme. No untoward incident took place during the demonstration, he said. Keraniganj traffic inspector Nurul Islam Mallick said that vehicles used the first Buriganga bridge through Postogola. It caused minimal traffic problem, he said. Rickshaw and vans have to pay Tk 2 and auto-rickshaws Tk 10 for crossing the bridge. Toll collector at the second Buriganga bridge Amirul Islam said that since the government had set the toll rate, he can not make any change. He said they take less than the government rate considering the issues of the drivers. Amirul also said that they were collecting Tk 2 in place of Tk 6 from the rickshaw and vans, Tk 10 form the auto rickshaw instead of Tk 15. bdnews24.
