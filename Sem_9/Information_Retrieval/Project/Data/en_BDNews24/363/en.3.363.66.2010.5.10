 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court has given investigators three more months to submit a report on further investigation in the killings case involving the grenade attack at Bangabandhu Avenue on Aug 21, 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department earlier had nine months extended by the court. Dhaka's second additional metropolitan sessions judge Fazila Begum on Monday extended time to Aug 11. A day before, special superintendent of the CID Abdul Kahhar Akhand petitioned the court for time extension. At least 24 people, including senior Awami League leader Ivy Rahman, wife of president Zillur Rahman, lost their lives in the attack on the rally, addressed by Sheikh Hasina, the Awami League chief and prime minister . Scores sustained injuries, including Hasina, who was then the opposition leader. Investigators have previously been accused of attempting to derail the case through different means including recording of false statements from witnesses during the previous BNP administration. After the BNP's tenure, new investigators, appointed during the regime of the subsequent interim government, pressed charges against 22 people on June 11 last year. Former BNP MP Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu and chief of banned militant outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-IslamiuJ Mufti Abdul Hannan were among the accused. BNP's former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, now in jail, was also recently shown arrested in the grenade attack case.
