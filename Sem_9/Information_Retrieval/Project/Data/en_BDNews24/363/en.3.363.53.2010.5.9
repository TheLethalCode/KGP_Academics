 BAGHDAD, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's parliamentary election results have not changed significantly as the result of a recount of 2.5 million ballots that has now reached the halfway point, an elections official said on Sunday. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's predominantly Shi'ite coalition demanded the recount of ballots in Baghdad, alleging fraud after finishing second in the March 7 vote, two seats behind a cross-sectarian bloc headed by former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi, a secular Shi'ite.

IHEC said on Sunday it would send the voting results from 17 of Iraq's 18 provinces, excluding only Baghdad, to a court for a final certification. Iraq's presidency council suggested such a move last week as a way of speeding up the approval of the final results.
