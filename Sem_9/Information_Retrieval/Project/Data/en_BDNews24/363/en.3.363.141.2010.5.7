 Dhaka, May 07 (bdnews24.com) - A clash broke out in Sadarghat on Friday between a group of launch workers supporting the government and another group who have supported a strike in demand for a 300 percent wage rise. The group of the launch workers supporting the strike brought out a procession in the morning. They alleged that a group of launch workers who supported the government, the Noujan Sramik League, attacked the procession along with police. But the Noujan Sramik League denied the allegation. On Thursday a new wage scale was finalised in a meeting of the workers, owners and the government. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan announced the new structure raising wages by between 50-100 percent following a tripartite meeting at the residence of the labour minister Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain. The association of water-vessel workers, the Noujan Sramik Federation, had demanded a 300-350 percent raise and declared a strike from Friday night. Shah Alam, vice-president of the federation told bdnews24.com, "Supporters of the government and the police attacked our peaceful procession in front of Sadarghat at around 10 am." He said that at least 15 of their workers and leaders were injured in the attack. Moinul Islam, President of the Noujan Sramik League told bdnews24.com that the water vessel workers had brought out a procession even after the wage was increased. He said that the workers attacked the office of the Noujan Sramik League without any provocation. Sub-inspector of the Sadarghat Police Camp, Mozzammel Haque said that a running pitch battle broke out between the two groups and police managed to disperse both side after a baton-charge. Traffic inspector of Sadarghat, Mahtab Ahmed told bdnews24.com that water traffic was normal in the morning. He said that the bigger vessels bound for the southern part of the country left the terminal after the clash broke out. Since morning, 11 launches have left the terminal bound for different destinations, he said. He failed to give any assurance, however, about whether the Barisal and Patuakhali bound launches will leave for their destinations today. Shah Alam said, "We have been attacked. In this situation no launch will leave without security." Though the Noujan Sramik Federation has opposed the new pay scale, three other organisationsShip Workers' Federation, Noujan Sramik Union and Lighterage Jahaj Sramik Unionwelcomed the new wage levels. bdnews
