The pro-Awami League Noujan Sramik League sued members of the Noujan Sramik Federation including its president and general secretary. Sub inspector Zahidul Islam of Kotwali Police Station told bdnews24.com on Sunday night that the case was filed by Sajib Ahmed. Bangladesh Noujan Sramik League president Mainul Haque Moin told bdnews24.com that Sajib was a leader of his organisation and the case had been filed against the Noujan Sramik Federation activists for vandalising his party's office. The Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a new pay scale announced by the shipping minister and called for a general strike from Friday afternoon.
