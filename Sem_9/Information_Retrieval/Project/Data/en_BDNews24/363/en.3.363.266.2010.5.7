 Bagerhat, May 7 (bdnews24.com) Forest guards and bandits exchanged fire at Sharankhola range of the Sundarban's eastern part on Thursday evening. The guards seized five spent-bullet casings from the spot at Panirghat area of the range along with a boat of the bandits. Sharankhola asistant forest preserver Bipul Chandra Das told journalists that the guards launched an operation at Panirghat after receiving information about the presence of a bandit team of the Shohag group. He said that the bandits fired on the guards after being aware of their presence, which prompted the guards to fire back. The bandits were forced to retreat into the forest in face of the heavy fire. Recently, Mohammad Ali, another bandit leader, was arrested and sent to Bagerhat prison. The remaining members of his group reportedly joined his rival, Shohag. Shohag group has been responsible for a number of attacks on fishermen and honey collectors and a number of abductions. bd
