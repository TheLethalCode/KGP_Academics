 Dhaka May 7 (bdnews24.com)  The strike that a faction of water transport workers has called is illogical and politically motivated, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan says. The Water Transport Labour Federation had rejected the new wage structure and called for the strike from Friday night to press their 22-point charter of demand including a wage hike. The agitation programme came after the government on Thursday night declared a new pay scale. The minister announced the new structure raising wages by 50-100 percent following a tripartite meeting at the residence of the labour minister Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain. An association of water-vessel workers (Noujan Sramik Federation) had demanded a 300-350 percent raise. They boycotted the meeting in the evening and called the general strike since the minster's announcement did not meet their expectations. The same federation of workers had also enforced a strike for four days from Mar 15. The strike was called off after a high-level tripartite meeting at the labour minister's residence on Mar 18. Shahjahan declared, "Wages have been increased by 50-100 percent in the new scale." Employers will pay their workers according to the new scale, with effect from Jan 1, 2009, he said. The minister, however, warned that it would not bode well for those who initiate movement even after the announcement of the raise "Other workers will teach them a lesson." Earlier on Thursday noon, four workers' groups met with the labour minister at his office, but failed to reach any agreement. The federation leaders left the meeting soon after it had begun. Treasurer of the federation Abdul Malek said, "There is a scope to solve the issue through discussion by Friday." "Otherwise we will go for strike from Friday midnight," he added. The three other organisationsShip Workers' Federation, Noujan Sramik Union and Lighterage Jahaj Sramik Unionwelcomed the new scale. bdn
