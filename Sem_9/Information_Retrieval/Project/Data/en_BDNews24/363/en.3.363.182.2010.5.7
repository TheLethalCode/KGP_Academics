 BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Australia's opening pair of David Warner and Shane Watson hammered India's bowling attack setting their side on the way to a total 184 for five in their Twenty20 World Cup match on Friday. Warner put on 104 from 10.5 overs of brutal batting in an innings which included a feast of sixes -- the pair hitting 13 between them. In total, Australia made 96 runs, more than half of their total, from sixes as a sun-drenched crowd at the Kensington Oval lapped up the power hitting. Indian slow left-armer Ravinda Jadeja suffered the most as he was hit for three sixes in a row by Watson at the end of his first over. When he was brought back Warner also hammered him for three consecutive sixes. Jadeja's misery came after he had dropped Watson when the Australian opener was on just seven. David Hussey made 35 but after Australia were 150 in 15.2 overs they will be disappointed not to have become the first team to break the 200 barrier at this tourna
