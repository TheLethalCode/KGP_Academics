<TITLE> Petrol pump strike continues </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)--- Petrol pumps across the country remained closed and tank-lorries stopped operating from Sunday morning due to an indefinite strike enforced jointly by pump owners and workers. A committee bringing together the owners' and workers' association of petrol pumps and the tank-lorry unions initiated the strike from Sunday 6am to press for acceptance of their 13-point demands including increasing the commission they receive from fuel sales. CNG filling stations are not part of the strike. The committee convener Muhammad Nazmul Haque told bdnews24.com on Sunday that they had gone on strike as the government did not take any steps even after giving their assurances that they would do so. He said they would likely to hold a meeting with the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation later in the day. Recently on Mar 14 the council called for a symbolic strike of six hours across the country. Their demands include  increasing commission for fuel sale from 2 percent to 7 percent, implementation of policies for setting up petrol pumps, establish testing laboratory in every depot, accident insurance of Tk 500,000, building lorry terminal and rest-houses near the depots, increasing tank lorry charge and putting a stop to police harassment in the name of examining papers. There are nearly 9,000 petrol pumps across the country. bdnew
