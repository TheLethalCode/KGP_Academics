 Dinajpur, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  One miner has died as a tunnel in Barapukuria coalmine caved in. Three remain trapped. Md Kamruzzaman, general manager of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited said on Tuesday that a portion of a tunnel 1300 feet underground had caved in at 10am. Nineteen miners had been trapped and 15 of them have already been rescued. One miner's body has been recovered, he said The miner has been identified as Ranjit. Kamruzzaman added that the rescue mission was still on. Among the 16 rescued miners, two are Chinese. Six miners have been admitted in Rangpur Medical College Hospital. Two were taken to the Phulbari upazila health complex and seven others were taken to the mining company's medical centre. The Barapukuria coal mine was discovered by the Geological Survey of Bangladesh at Parbatipur in 1985. It is estimated that the mine has 390 million tonnes of coal reserve stretched over 5.25 square kilometres. The government entered into a contract with China for technical and financial assistance to set up the mine. Commercial coal production began from September 2005. In 1998, a sudden inrush of water flooded the mine resulting in the suspension of mine development for two years. The revised mine design reduced both the recoverable reserve and mine life. Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited supervises coal production over 1,000 miners in 35 tunnels. bd
