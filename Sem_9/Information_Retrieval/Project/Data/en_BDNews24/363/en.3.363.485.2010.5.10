 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)-- The launch strike enforced by a faction of water transport workers continued for the third consecutive day on Monday. Until 11am, 16 launches had arrived at Dhaka's Sadarghat terminal from the southern region. And though 10 launches were scheduled to leave the terminal only six have left  though those that left had carried extra passengers. BIWTA traffic inspector Mahtab Uddin said that four launches failed to leave for lack of passengers and crew. He told bdnews24.com that till 11am Tanjil-3, Sonar Tori-1, Lamia, Bogdadia-8, Swaranadeep-8, and Moyour-1 launches left for Barisal, Chandpur, Munshiganj, Potuakhali. No one from the Noujan Sramik Federation, who called the strike were seen at the terminal in the morning. On the previous day only six launches left the terminal though 13 were scheduled to leave and 15 anchored at the terminal. Preferring to be unnamed a manager of one of the launches told bdnews24.com, "Passengers of two launches are travelling on one." "Launches are being operated by the assistant launch masters instead of the actual masters." The strike was called after the Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a government announcement of a new pay scale increasing wages by between 50 to100 percent against a demand from them of a 300-350 percent rise. The announcement came after a tripartite meeting on Thursday between government, workers and owners. Some unions have already agreed to the pay hike. Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, however, had termed the strike 'irrational' as it was called even after declaring the new pay scale. "It has been motivated by certain political interests," he added. bdnews2
