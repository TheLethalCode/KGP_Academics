 Sylhet, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Tension flared in the Sylhet border on Tuesday after India's Border Security Force (BSF) did not receive a BDR letter requesting a flag meeting and amassed troops. The letter, sent by post, called for the meeting to discuss the killing of a Bangladeshi by the Indian force at Bichhnakandi border in Goainghat on Monday evening. Instead, the BSF increased force and took position on the Meghalaya hills, prompting their Bangladesh counterparts to prepare just in case. Sohrab Ali Mia, Nayek Subedar of Bichhnakandi BDR camp, said they had been attempting to sit for talks since morning but to no avail. "So we will have to do everything to face the situation." He also said they will officially protest the killing once the autopsy report is at hand. BSF on Monday shot dead a Bangladeshi cowherd, Jamal Uddin, 28, 200 yards inside Bichhnakandi border. Jashim Uddin, a local of the Bichhnakandi village, said that the Indians opened fire on Jamal around 4pm when he had gone near the pillar while grazing his cows on Bangladeshi land. Jamal died on the spot and his body was later recovered by BDR, Jashim added. He was buried on Tuesday following the autopsy. A general diary was filed at the local police station. Lt Col Jahirul Alam, the commander of 21 Rifles Battalion, told bdnews24.com that the BDR was on full alert. He also said that the BSF has been avoiding calls for BOP commander and company commander level meetings for the last two months. bdne
