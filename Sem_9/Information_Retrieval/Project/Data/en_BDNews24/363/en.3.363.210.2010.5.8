 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  The launch strike enforced by a faction of water transport workers continued on Saturday though a few water vessels left Dhaka's Sadarghat terminal under police protection. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authorities is however claiming that the launch operations remain normal. The strike was called after the Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a government announcement of a new pay scale increasing wages by between 50 to100 percent against a demand from them of a 300-350 percent rise. The announcement came after a tripartite meeting on Thursday between government, workers and owners. Some unions have already agreed to the pay hike. Federation leaders claimed that launch workers had been supporting their strike but the authorities had forced several launches to operate under police cordon. They also claimed that the police and government-backed Noujan Sromik League workers attacked them Saturday morning. Acting president of the federation Shah Alam told bdnews24.com: "The police and Sramik League workers attacked us when we brought out a procession at Sadarghat in the morning." Comments from the pro Awami League water transport workers' association were not available. Alam said, "The strike has been observed successfully, although the authority is forcing some launches to operate." Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan, however, had termed the strike 'irrational' as it was called even after declaring the new pay scale. "It has been motivated by certain political interests," he added. bdnews24.com's district correspondents have reported that launches were not operating from many terminals. They report that no inter-route launches ran in Barisal and no cargo water vessels ran in Bagerhat. Mongla port is also effected - with two ships anchored in the port but unable to unload. Kazi Abdus Salam, assistant manager (traffic) of Mongla Port authorities, said if the strike continues for much longer they would face problems. BIWTA traffic inspector Mahtab Uddin however said that three launches were seen to leave the Sadarghat terminal on Saturday morning, He also pointed to launches that have arrived from the southern regions, now anchored at the terminal. "To my knowledge the launch operation is pretty normal. But some launches are being operated by the assistant launch masters instead of the actual masters." bdnews24.com/
