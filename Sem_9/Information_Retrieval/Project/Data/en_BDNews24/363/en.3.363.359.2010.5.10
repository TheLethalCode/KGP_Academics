<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Australia took a huge step towards the Twenty20 World Cup semi-finals with a crushing 81- run win over Sri Lanka on Sunday that demonstrated once again their impressive strength in depth. The Australians were in trouble at 67 for five before Cameron White led an extraordinary fightback with an unbeaten 85 off 49 balls which dominated their total of 168 for five.

Mitchell Johnson was the pick of the bowlers, ending with figures of three for 15 from 3.2 overs but all the Australian attack kept the ball in the right areas and never allowed Sri Lanka the chance to regroup. Australia top Group F with four points and are almost certain to reach the semi-finals going into their match against West Indies Tuesday in St Lucia. Sri Lanka, though, having beaten West Indies, must come up with victory over winless India in their final game to progress. "We started off well but we missed one crucial catch. We were dismal with the bat. They grabbed this match from us. The stand between White and Michael Hussey put it beyond us," Sangakkara
