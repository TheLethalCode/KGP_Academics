<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  A special BDR court in Dhaka has set Dec 19 to frame charges against 113 members of the Rifles Security Unit accused of their involvement in the Feb 25-26 mutiny last year. The special court, at the Darbar Hall of the paramilitary force's Pilkhana headquarters, set the date on Saturday in presence of all the accused. The same court set Dec 5 to frame charges against 187 mutineers of the BDR signals sector. The court began at midday with outgoing BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam presiding. The court ended an hour later. Naik subedar Mohammed Abdul Matin Miah read out charges against the accused. The trial began on May 6. The mutiny saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Subedar Major of signal sector Ansar Ali (Bir Protik) was in the front line with the soldiers during the mutiny at Pilkhana. The chief of judges panel Maj Gen M Moinul Islam, who is also the BDR director general, asked him to describe how the carnage began. But Ansar Ali said that he saw nothing. Commotion started when a soldier, Moin (currently absconding) proceeded to the stage with arms. Seeing this, he fled with the others. "You were awarded the Bir Protik medal for the courage shown in the Liberation War," commented the court. "Still, how could you have ignored the command of the DG by fleeing when just one armed soldier entered?" enquired the court. The court also suggested that this meant he was aware of it from before. The DG once again asked the accused to describe the incident during the trial. But the signal sector and RSU members claimed that they saw no one or could not identify any rebel, though they were on duty during the mutiny. The trial of special court-6 started at Darbar Hall at 10:15 am with signal sector at first. Then at 12:00pm the trial of the RSU rebels began. The members of the signal sector were aware of the plan from the very beginning, claimed Lt. Col. M. Nazrul Islam, commander of the sector. He also said that they had performed the major task of hiding the dead bodies. After the start of the mutiny, when the BDR telephone exchange was contacted, they gave false information to the different sectors. The Subedar of the sector Ansar Ali left the hall and joined the unit in the mutiny, he added. Nayek Subedar Abul Kashem of the signal sector was on duty that day. The court heard his description of the incident. Though Ansar Ali claimed that he was not involved, at one stage, he said he was present at the gate 4 when the home minister and other ruling party MPs entered Pilkhana. Soldier Shariful Islam used the mike to make incendiary statements, accused the prosecutor. But Shariful denied the charge, saying he did not use or heard any mike. He was in his room and knew nothing of what happened outside, he added. At 12:00 pm the second round of the trial started. The accused RSU members were brought before the judges. Though this unit was responsible for intelligence gathering and was expected to inform the BDR officers about the impending mutiny, they instead were involved in it from the start, accused the unit's commander Lt. Col. Atikuzzaman. They did not inform the superiors of the secret meetings of the rebels, rather they also took part in those. They distributed the leaflets. Although a few thousand leaflets were distributed, they recovered only four, said Atikuzzaman. To celebrate BDR week, additional RSU members from across the country were brought to Dhaka, said the prosecutor. On that day, there were 70 RSU members in Pilkhana, but they did not warn any one. Even those who were at Darbar Hall did not make any move when Moin was advancing with his arms. Rather they left the hall and engaged in looting of the arms warehouse, the prosecutor said. Subedar Yusuf Ali and Habildar Daud Ali took part in the looting of the arms warehouse, he said. At this stage, the court asked a RSU member about the incidents. He said that he saw one person entering with arms and tried to inform the superiors. But none paid any attention. Nor did he try to stop the guy. Moinul Islam said that when he joined the BDR after the mutiny, the whole area was in a mess. But only exception were the RSU office and barrack, which looked clean and in perfect order. No rampage by the rebels there indicates how deeply RSU was involved. The panel ordered to present the accused in the same dress as they were on the day of mutiny. Meanwhile, it ordered the prosecutors to appoint 'Friends of the Accused' for them. An order was also given to provide the copy of accusation and the list of names of the witnesses. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. Special tribunals in Rangamati, Satkhira, Feni, Panchagarh and Thakurgaon have already given verdicts. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts, which will carry death penalty for the perpetrators. bdnews24.co
