 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  Salt producing farmers and mill owners on Thursday demanded that salt prices be fixed anew every year as it happens with rice. The demand was raised from an inter-ministerial meeting, headed by industries minister Dilip Barua. The meeting was called to finalise the draft Salt Policy. The participants also demanded establishment of warehouses in the cultivation areas. They stressed on identifying the market demand, monitoring and fixing the price. Moreover, formation of a strong salt board was also proposed to supervise the total process from production to sales. The minister urged all parties to protect the industry. He said the policy will possibly be finalised soon to benefit the farmers and owners.
