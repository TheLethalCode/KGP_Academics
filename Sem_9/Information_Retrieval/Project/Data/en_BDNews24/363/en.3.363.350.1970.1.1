 GROS ISLET, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan eliminated South Africa from the Twenty20 World Cup with an 11-run win over the Proteas in St Lucia on Monday which kept their own qualification hopes alive. The result meant England, who have won both opening Super Eight games, go through to the last four regardless of the outcome of their final match against New Zealand later on Monday. Pakistan and South Africa both have two points from three matches but Pakistan have a superior run-rate. New Zealand, also on two points, will go through with a win over England. Umar Akmal struck 51 from 33 balls, including four sixes, as Pakistan recovered from a poor start to post a respectable total of 148 for seven. In reply, South Africa were only 56 for three after 10 overs but a spirited 53 off 41 balls from AB de Villiers gave them a fighting chance which they were unable to make the most of as Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal took four wickets. LAME WAY It was a lame way for a South Africa side to bow out of a tournament they were capable of doing much better in. "I guess you run out of excuses, it was just not good enough again," South Africa skipper Graeme Smith told reporters. "AB was the only one who really played -- and it has been the story of our tournament -- we have struggled to get it together in all three disciplines." The South African bowlers started well as Pakistan were restricted to 19 for three after the opening six powerplay overs. But Umar Akmal and his brother Kamran (32) added 51 runs to get Pakistan's momentum going. After Kamran departed, skipper Shahid Afridi (30 from 18) contributed to a 61-run partnership in just 5.3 overs. For South Africa, Charl Langeveldt made the important breakthroughs and completed impressive figures of four for 19 from his four overs. The target should have been within reach for South Africa but they lost both openers cheaply and Jacques Kallis, so often the mainstay of their batting, made a solid 22 off 21 balls before falling to a brilliant diving catch by Umar Akmal off the impressive Ajmal. De Villiers showed how it could be done, hitting the only two sixes of South Africa's innings, but once he went the lower middle order failed to rise to the occasion. While there was acute disappointment on the South African bench, the Pakistanis celebrated an unlikely win after their defeats by England and New Zealand. "I just played my positive game. The wicket was good and the ball went where I wanted it to go," Umar Akmal
