 KHAYELITSHA, South Africa, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of excited township dwellers gathered in Cape Town's sprawling Khayelitsha on Friday to catch a glimpse of soccer's World Cup trophy at the start of its South Africa tour. Construction workers, civil servants and the unemployed thronged to be photographed with the gold trophy in the city's largest black township before the world's most-watched sporting spectacle kicks offs on June 11.

"The sales are going well ... definitely the 95 percent sales will be reached soon," Valcke told reporters, adding that 55,000 tickets were sold over the last two days. He said the trophy would be locked in a safe for the duration of the one month event. Its last public appearance, before the new world champions hold it aloft on July 11, will be at the 90,000 seater Soccer City stadium at the start of the tournament, when South Africa plays Mexico in the opening match. "This trophy is unique, it has no value ... some say that the value of this trophy is the equivalent of Mona Lisa and I think that's right," Valcke said of the trophy which has been used by FIFA since
