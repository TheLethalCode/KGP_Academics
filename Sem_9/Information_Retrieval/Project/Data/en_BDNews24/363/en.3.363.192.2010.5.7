 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)--BNP has deferred Saturday's agitation programme for Dhaka to Sunday. The demonstrations will be staged to protest the attacks on party leaders and activities on their way to Wednesday's rally in Rajshahi which Khaleda Zia addressed. The attacks by pro-government adherents left a union-level leader in Bogra, Zakir Hossain, dead and more than a hundred injured. "The agitation programme planned for Saturday in Dhaka will now be held on Sunday," party office secretary Rezvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Friday. He said programmes in other parts of the country on Saturday would remain unchanged. Party leaders blamed ruling Awami League cadres for the attacks. BNP also called a general strike at Bogra on Sunday in protest against killing of Zakir. Zakir was in a BNP convoy from Bogra that came under attack at Singra of Natore on its way to the rally. Critically injured in the attack, he died on the way to a hospital in Bogra town. The opposition party held special prayers at the Paltan headquarters on Friday, which was attended, among others, by party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain.
