 NEW DELHI, May 10 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Suspended Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi on Monday sought more time to answer corruption charges that have sparked a government investigation into the cricket tournament, sources said. Modi was due to respond to the allegations by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which suspended Modi as head of the IPL two weeks ago pending its own probe into corruption, tax evasion and money-laundering. He was also stood down as a BCCI vice-president and as chairman of the T20 Champions League, a separate club tournament organised jointly by India, Australia and South Africa. "He wants five more days," a BCCI source told AFP, adding that the extension was likely to be granted. Modi has run the IPL as a virtual one-man show since its inception three years ago, creating a heady and lucrative blend of star-studded Twenty20 cricket, big business and Bollywood glamour.

He embarrassed a high-profile member of the government, junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoor, by leaking on the Twitter micro-blogging site how Tharoor's girlfriend had been given a free stake in the new team. Under pressure from the opposition, which accused Tharoor of misusing his office to secure benefit for himself, the minister was forced to resign. The charges faced by Modi include rigging IPL bids, holding proxy stakes in teams, taking cash from companies in return for broadcasting deals, and having a dictatorial management style. Modi faced another scandal last week when it emerged he tried to divide world cricket by proposing a parallel event in England. The plan, revealed by England's cricket chief Giles Clarke in an email to Indian officials, involved English county sides playing an IPL-style tournament. Modi held a secret meeting with officials from three counties -- Warwickshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire -- in New Delhi in March to discuss the proposal without the knowledge of the concerned boards, according to the e
