<TITLE> Khaleda's 'No-trust' plea does another round </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader Khaleda Zia's counsels on Tuesday pleaded once again to shift the writ petition regarding her cantonment house from the current High Court bench. The bench of justices Iman Ali and Obaidul Hasan are dealing with the writ petition. This is the third such petition, filed within a month, although the previous two had been turned down. Led by senior lawyer T H Khan, a group of pro-BNP lawyers submitted the application to the acting Chief Justice Md Abdul Matin filling in for Justice Md Fazlul Karim, who is abroad. Justice Matin directed the lawyers to place the application before Karim after he resumes work. On April 11, the bench of justices Iman Ali and Obaidul Hasan rejected an appeal by Khaleda's lawyers to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and two days later rejected another application in which she expressed 'no confidence' in the bench. The same bench, on Apr 5, rejected the second plea. bdnews24.
