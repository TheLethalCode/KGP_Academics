 Chittagong, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong City Corporation mayor A B M Mohiuddin Chowdhury says he will seek an unprecedented fourth term in office. Chowdhury, chief of Chittagong metropolitan chapter of the ruling Awami League, declared his candidature at a press meet at his residence at 9.30pm on Tuesday. Awami League has yet to pick their man for the polls slated for June 17. Chittagong-10 MP and Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry president M A Latif as also declared his intention to contest the election. Responding to a media query, Chowdhury said that he declared his candidature based on his contact with the party's high command. But he also said that he will accept his party's decision if they nominate someone else. "Many party members have given various types of statements against me in the media. I have put up with them as I can take criticism." Asked about conflicts and opposition from within the party regarding the nominations, the three-time elected mayor said, "There will be conflicts in a big party. However, the differences will be settled automatically in the party's forum." He also challenged allegations of corruption leveled against him by the 10 ward councillors recently. "I am not bound to respond to the allegations made on the streets instead at the general meetings. I will answer them at the meetings." The mayor also said that whether or not he will be running under the banner of Nagorik Committee, like the last time, will be decided by his party. He also said that the implementation of the 'City Government Concept' will top his agenda if he is re-elected as the city's development otherwise is impossible. Chowdhury was swept to office for a third time in 2005 with a landslide against BNP's contender Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin. The press conference was attended by Chittagong Metropolitan AL's general secretary Kazi Imdadul Haque Danu and former army major Mohammed Imdad. A large number of party supporters and members of associate organisations gathered in front of the mayor's residence. b
