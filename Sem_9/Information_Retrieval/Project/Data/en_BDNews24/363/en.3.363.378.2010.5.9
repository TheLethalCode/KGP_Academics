 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  Two cases were lodged on Sunday against chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at Distict Judicial Magistrates Court at Chandpur and Kishoreganj on charges of hurting religious sentiment. According to the cases, newspapers on Apr 16 quoted Huda as saying at his residence regarding the Bhola by-elections, "The armed forces are not divine beings that can fix everything. Forget the army, not even God can do everything." The cases allege that Huda had intentionally made this statement to challenge the Almighty's authority and hurt the religious sentiments of millions of Muslims living in the country. The case at Chandpur was filed by resident of South Balia village Muhammad Sheikh Shah Alam. Magistrate Mojammel Haque took the complaint into heed and asked the police to investigate the matter. The plaintiff's lawyer Salim Ullah Salim said the police can even arrest the accused for sake of the investigation. Former army member Kari Masudul Haque Masud, a resident of Ekrampur village under Kulirchar Upazila, filed the case at Kishoreganj. Magistrate Muhammad Ali Ahsan fixed May 18 for giving the court order on the complaint. A similar case was earlier filed by Mohammad Hossain Akand, a businessman of the capital's East Basabo area, with Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Apr 25. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque accepted the case but did not pass any order. The case was later rejected. bdnews24.com/corr/mus/ln
