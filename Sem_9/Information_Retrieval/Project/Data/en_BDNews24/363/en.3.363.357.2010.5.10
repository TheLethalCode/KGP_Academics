 Chittagong, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  At least five students were injured on Monday when two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League fought each other at Government Commerce College in Chittagong. Among the injured four have been identified as 'Evan', 18, Rajib Roy, 22, 'Ripon', 22, Rubel Dey, 20. All of them received first aid in a private hospital in the city. Supporters of former Chittagong city Awami League leader A J M Nasir Uddin and followers of BCL leader Abdul Kader chased each other and fought over intrusion of the outsiders onto the campus, Double Mooring police chief Ainul Haque said. The situation is now under control, he said and added additional police members have been deployed on the campus to avoid further untoward incidents. Both the groups traded blames for the brawl. Sumon Chowdhury, vice president of Nasir Uddin-backed faction, told bdnews24.com that Kader's men and outsiders had attacked them as they protested admission of their (Kader's) own people. Jahangir Hossain Shanto, president of Kader-backed group, denied the allegation. "None of us forced the college authorities for admission. They attacked us."
