 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  A special BDR court in Dhaka has set Dec 5 as the date to frame charges against 187 members of the signals sector who stand accused of involvement in the Feb 25-26, 2009 mutiny. Outgoing Bangladesh Rifles director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who heads the panel of judges, set the date on Saturday. The special court-6, set up at the Darbar Hall at the paramilitary force's Pilkhana headquarters, began at around 9 am and ended two hours later. The trial began on May 6. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people killed, 57 of them army officers deputed to the border force. On Nov 15 last year, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. Special tribunals in Rangamati, Satkhira, Feni, Panchagar and Thakurgaon have already given verdicts. In the event of a conviction, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts.
