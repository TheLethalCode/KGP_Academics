 Chittagong, May 9 (bdnews24.com)--The main opposition BNP marched towards the Election Commission office in Chittagong on Sunday demanding cancellation of the results of the Bhola by-elections and resignation of three election commissioners. BNP had recently announced a demanding cancellation of the results of the Bhola by-elections and resignation of three election commissioners. As part of the party's scheduled countrywide programme, the northern and southern chapters of Chittagong BNP took part in the programme but the followers of the party's vice chairman Abdullah Al Noman did not join. Hundreds of party leaders and activists gathered at the party office at around 11am and marched towards the Election Commission office at Rahmatganj in the port city. The demonstrators faced police obstruction in Jamalkhan, some 100 yards away from the election office where they held a brief meeting. BNP leader Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury said the programme would pave the way for a movement to bring down the Sheikh Hasina-led government. He demanded that the government step down as it is failing to run the country. "We will overthrow the government through a united movement." He called on BNP leaders and workers to prepare for tough times. Traffic ground to a halt in the bustling Jamalkhan area and its surroundings due to the rally. Rezaul Masud, assistant commissioner (Panchlaish zone) of Chittagong Metropolitan Police, told bdnews24.com that no untoward incidents took place during the programme. He said three platoons of police, including female police, were deployed on the spot to avoid any unpleasant incident. bdne
