<TITLE> Modi planned IPL-style event in England: BCCI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, May 7 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Suspended Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi faced further trouble on Friday after it emerged he tried to divide world cricket by proposing a parallel event in England. The plan, revealed by England's cricket chief Giles Clarke in an email to Indian officials, involved English county sides playing an IPL-style tournament featuring the world's top stars. Modi held a secret meeting with officials from three unnamed counties in New Delhi on Mar 31 to discuss the proposal without the knowledge of the concerned boards, according to the email. A statement by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said it had asked Modi to explain the move, which was "detrimental to Indian cricket, English cricket and world cricket at large". In the five-page notice to Modi, BCCI secretary N Srinivasan listed the details of the plan, which included attracting counties to the parallel league by offering them huge sums of money. "You have allegedly discussed this as a commercial proposition... that the IPL would guarantee each county a minimum of three-five million dollars per annum plus a staging fee of 1.5 million dollars," Srinivasan wrote to Modi. He said that under the alleged deal, returns would be shared 80:20 between the franchises and the counties, with a player model based on the IPL. "You have allegedly planted a seed of thought of players' revolt if the governing bodies of respective cricket boards do not allow them to participate in this extended version of IPL." Srinivasan added the plan not only challenged the authority of the BCCI and the England Cricket Board, but that both governing bodies would be "forced to watch helplessly while the game and the power of administration are hijacked." Modi had been given 15 days to answer the charge, Srinivsan wrote. Meanwhile, the English counties have rubbished the claims that they were involved in conversations with Lalit Modi to start a parallel IPL type event. Speaking to the Guardian, the Yorkshire chairman Colin Graves said, "This is totally overblown. It was a fact-finding mission. Lalit Modi did not put a proposition on the table. There were no secret proposals, no secret agenda, nothing underhand." Yorkshire's chief executive, Stewart Regan, told Cricinfo: "We attended that meeting in an educational capacity, as we wished to learn more about how the IPL has gone from nowhere to being one of the biggest sporting businesses in the world inside two years." "The success of the IPL proves that cricket is a product that people want to buy and that sponsors want to get involved with, and those were the key learning areas that we were interested in. It would not be appropriate to comment any further," he added. Graves agreed with Regan on the success of the IPL model and said the English Cricket Board could learn from the same. "IPL has been extraordinarily successful and we can learn a lot from it. There was a proper business discussion about how things might develop in the future, the sort of discussions that can benefit the whole of English cricket," he said. "Stewart Regan took notes of the meeting and forwarded them to all the Test grounds. I then passed those notes to Giles Clarke. Lalit Modi invited all representatives of the Test grounds to be his personal guests at the IPL final. We turned the invitation down as we were not in a position to discuss anything in detail," he added. Graves also mentioned that nobody has proposed any kind of revenue sharing model as claimed by the BCCI letter to Lalit Modi. "We have not been guaranteed anything, but if anybody puts anything on the table we will discuss it. We have nine Test grounds and only seven Tests a year. We have to find ways to fill these grounds outside the England team," said Graves. "The nine Test grounds are united in the belief we cannot allow the status quo to continue. There is no future in us creating another Twenty20 competition for all 18 counties. It is not attractive enough to fill the Test grounds. We have to create something new and exciting, a tournament with the appeal of IPL, a British version. We will continue to put these ideas to Giles," Graves a
