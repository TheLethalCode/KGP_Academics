 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has announced that the Chittagong City Corporation polls will be held on Jun 17. According to the schedule announced on Tuesday, the last date for filing nominations is May 20, with the deadline for withdrawals set on Jun 1. The elections to the port city council were last held on May 9, 2005 with the tenure of the elected officials expiring on June 25. EC deputy secretary Jasmine Tuly has been appointed as returning officer for the CCC polls. At the last election, current mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, an Awami League leader, beat BNP's Mir Mohammad Nasir Udidn. The CCC will be the only one of the six city corporations holding elections before its current term expires. According to the Local Government (City Corporation) Law2009, elections have to be held within the 180 day period before the tenure of the elected members expires. MONDAY'S ANNOUNCEMENTS On Monday, the CEC said decisions were made to deploy army at a limited scale for five days. "They will be on the field to assist the other law enforcing agencies from three days ahead of the elections till the day after the election." He said check posts will be installed at different entrances of the port city. There will be executive and judicial magistrates, striking forces and members of RAB and police outside the polling centres. The EC will have its own observers at the centres too, he added. The EC is considering the introduction of electronic voting machines in one ward, though no decision has yet been made. Huda said that no minister, state minister, or deputy minister would be able to take part in the election campaign in support of a candidate. Stern measures will be taken against those violating election regulations, he warned. The CEC urged cooperation from everyone towards conducting a free and fair election. Commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir were also present at the briefing. VOTERS AND POLLING OFFICIALS According to the latest voter list, there are 1,694,955 voters under 41 wards, of which 14 are reserved. Of the total voters, 877,790 are male and 817,165 are female voters. There will be 4,748 polling booths in 674 polling centres around the city. 1,137,368 voters cast their votes during the previous election at 3,211 polling booths under 577 voting centres. A total of 14,918 officers, led by a returning officer and seven assistants, will be engaged with the CCC polls, of who 674 presiding officers, 4,748 assistant presiding officers and 9,496 polling officers. CONCERN OVER LEGAL COMPLICATIONS Despite the newly enacted law for the local governments, the CCC election is likely to be held in line with the old demarcation. Regarding this, the CEC told bdnews24.com on Monday: "We don't see any legal complication that might rise. The EC could not arrange the DCC elections, to be held in May, as the delimitation process was not finished. The same process is also taking place in Chittagong. A letter from the EC, signed by EC deputy secretary Syed Md Khurshid Anwar, informed the local government division that the division had only fixed the number of wards, but that the separation and delimitation of the wards was not done yet. According to the EC, it can only announce the election schedules if the processes are done properly in line with the Sections 27-29 of the City Corporation Act. So complications might rise if the schedules are declared without completing the process. EXPIRED DCC AND OTHERS Elections of four city corporations and nine municipalities have been held under the current EC, led by Huda. The four city corporationsRajshahi, Khulna, Barisal and Sylhetsaw elections on Aug 4, 2008, though after the terms of the elected officials had been expired. Terms of Rajshahi and Khulna had ended in June 2007 and those of Sylhet and Barisal had expired in May 2008. The DCC's term expired on May 14, 2007. The EC, during the tenure of the current government, conducted upazila parishad elections in Jan 2009 after a long hiatus of around 18 years. bdn
