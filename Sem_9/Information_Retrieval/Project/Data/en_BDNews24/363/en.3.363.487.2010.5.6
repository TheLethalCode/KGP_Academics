 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  The local government division will prepare a policy in 15 working days to streamline the functions of Upazila chairmen and Upazila Nirbahi Officers, a top government official says. The local government secretary has been tasked to implement the initiatives, cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz told reporters on Thursday. He was speaking to the media after a regular meeting of the national committee on upazila administration. Home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder and local government secretary Manjur Hossain were also present at the meeting. The government has decided to streamline the functions of Upazilla administration, which are now being hampered because of the simmering rift between the chairman and the Upazilla Nirbahi officer over who should have the real authority in running the local government. To address the issue, initiatives have been taken to transfer offices of 13 ministries and departments to Upazila Parishad and formulate a development action plan. Aziz  who as the cabinet secretary is the head of the national committee for monitoring the transfer of the offices to the upazilla - said the duties of Upazila chairmen and the UNOs have been clearly specified in the Upazila Act. The local government ministry has also formulated quite a number of rules and procedures regarding this and taken initiatives to streamline the functions in a coordinated way, he said. Admitting the stagnancy of development activities at Upazila level, Aziz said these activities cannot be mobilised without proper development plans and specific policies. "So, directions were given to the local government secretary to formulate a policy within 15 working days and to submit it to the cabinet," he added. Aziz also said the income sources of Upazila Parishads have been specified. "Two percent of the land development tax, moveable and immoveable property transfer fee and land registration fees shall be given to Upazila Parishads." The law ministry has already been written in this regard, he added. He said that previously Upazila executive officers managed Hat-Bazar, but now it had been changed. In line with the new Act, UNOs would recommend to Upazila chairmen on leasing Hat-Bazaars and they could be leased out only after the chairmen had approved their recommendations. He hoped that it would ease the tension between the elected representatives and the UNOs and strengthen mutual trust between them. In addition, the ministries concerned have been ordered to ensure the presence of Upazila level officers at important state ceremonies. bdnews24.c
