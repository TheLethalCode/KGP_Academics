 Dhaka May 10 (bdnews24.com)--Textile millers have demanded that the government allow yarn to be imported through land ports. President of Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA), Abdul Hai Sarker, said at a press conference on Monday that they would accept the same conditions that apply to knitwear exporters. Importing yarn through land ports from India has been stopped for the last few years - but the knitwear producers are allowed to import under certain conditions and bonds. Hai claimed that the high price of yarn was a result of high cotton prices in the world market. "The yarn producers are being blamed for the price hike." But the price has increased due to rising cotton prices, Hai said. "Shortage of gas and electricity has also raised production cost." He said that yarn costs $3.9 to $4 per kg on average and price was now decreasing because of reduced demand "The demand decreases during June, July and Aug." But, M Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), opposed the claim made by BTMA. He told bdnews24.com that currently cotton cost $4.20 to $4.25 per kg. "But the price should be between $3.60 to $3.65 per kg if it is to match the world market." In a press conference on Apr 24, Hoque claimed that orders worth millions of dollars had been cancelled as the cost of production increased due to high yarn price. Hai, the BTMA president, on his part, rejected the BKMEA president's claims too. "It is not correct that the high yarn price is responsible for losing buyers. "It is the failure of timely delivery because of gas-electricity crisis has turned the buyers away," he said. The knitting, weaving and other industries related with weaving have been demanding the reduction of yarn price which has been high for the last few months bdn
