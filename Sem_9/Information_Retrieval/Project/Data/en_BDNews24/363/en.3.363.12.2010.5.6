 PARIS, May 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Dismissed as a 'water carrier' by Eric Cantona during his playing days, Didier Deschamps' title success with Marseille confirms that he is one of the brightest coaching lights in the modern game. Born in the Basque Country city of Bayonne in France's extreme south-west, Deschamps came through the ranks at the legendary Nantes training centre and made over 100 league appearances for the club between 1985 and 1989. After a season each at Marseille and Bordeaux he returned to Marseille in 1991 and it was in his second stint at the Stade Velodrome that his career took flight.

He began his managerial career at Monaco, leading them to the French League Cup in 2003 and the Champions League final the year after, before guiding Juventus out of Serie B following their demotion for match-fixing. Marseille was Deschamps' next port of call in 2009 and, after a steady start, he brought their 17-year wait for a trophy to an end with victory in the French League Cup before securing their first Ligue 1 title since 1992. "When the referee blows the whistle, they (the players) don't hear me anymore," said Deschamps, 41, earlier this season. "On the pitch, the protagonists are the players.
