 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)The police recovered a schoolgirl's body at Mohakhali in Dhaka on Thursday. The girl, Sumaiya Islam Jui, 18, was a student of O levels at the Oxford International School in Dhanmondi. Md Fakrul, a sub-inspector of the Gulshan Police Station, said that the body was recovered from a room of the sixth floor of a building (GP Cha 20) at Mohakhali. The body was sent to Dhaka Medical college Hospital for post mortem, the police officer said. Jui's uncle Mozammel Hossain said that Jui's father, Mozammel's brother, Jahidul Islam had died on December in 2005. Then her mother Rehana Begum married her lawyer Jahangir Alam. Since then Jui has been having problems with her mother and step-father over Jahidul's wealth. Rehana wanted Jui to marry her cousin Ripon. But she did not agree to the proposition. Mozammel claimed that Jui might have committed suicide due to the strained relations and because she was unwilling to marry Ripon. The police primarily suspected that Jui had committed suicide.
