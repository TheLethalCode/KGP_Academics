<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, May 6 (bdnews24/Reuters) - South Africa smashed 62 off the last five overs against New Zealand to pile up an impressive total of 170 for four in their Twenty20 World Cup Super Eight match on Thursday. A partnership of 72 between Albie Morkel, who hit 40 from 18 balls including five sixes, and AB de Villiers (47 not out) was crucial in taking the South Africans to a big score with Morkel smashing three sixes off one over from Tim Southee. Openers Jacques Kallis and skipper Graeme Smith got the Springboks off to a rapid start, rattling up 40 inside five overs before Smith was caught by Martin Guptill off Southee for 14. Herschelle Gibbs made 30 but it was Morkel's magnificent hitting that made the difference between an average total and the daunting target they have set Daniel Vettori's side.
