 Dhaka May 10 (bdnews24.com)Anti-graft investigators on Monday questioned ex-BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home in a case involving approval many years ago of a communications ministry project. A three-strong ACC team met the former LGRD minister and questioned him about his role in approving the Bhairab Bridge project during the 2001-2006 BNP-led coalition government. "They had come to inquire about a project. I was a member of the cabinet committee on purchase, which cleared the communication ministry project," Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com. "All decisions of the committee were unanimous and taken legally. I have explained all these things to the (ACC) officers," he said after the one and a quarter hour session with the investigators. "Mr Bhuiyan is sick. That's why we came to his home," ACC assistant director Harunur Rashid told reporters. "The matter is confidential and I cannot divulge any details." Bhuiyan, later expelled as the party's secretary general, is one of the 10 alliance ministers including prime minister Khaleda Zia who had been served with ACC notices. Former communications minister Nazmul Huda went to the ACC offices on Wednesday and answered questions from the officers. The other ministers were: Khondoker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, M K Anwar, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, Aminul Huq, former state ministers Salahuddin Ahmed and A K M Mosharraf Hossain. A lawyer for Khaleda Zia handed a statement in response to the notice to the ACC officers on Sunday. bdnew
