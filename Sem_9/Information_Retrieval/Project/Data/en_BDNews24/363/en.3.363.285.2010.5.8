 LONDON, May 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Britain's Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, will seek backing from senior party members on Saturday for a possible deal with the Conservatives that may give them their first role in government for decades. The centre-right Conservatives won most seats in an election on Thursday but failed to secure an overall majority, meaning they need the support of smaller parties to form a stable government that can tackle Britain's record budget deficit. Clegg must overcome scepticism among a significant number of Liberal Democrats, who fear that Britain's third party would be forced to sacrifice too many cherished policies for a deal. But financial markets, already rattled by a debt crisis in Greece, want a new government to be formed quickly so it can set about reducing the deficit swiftly and decisively. The pound, gilts and stock market all fell on Friday when it became clear the Conservatives would not have a parliamentary majority, despite beating the incumbent Labour Party soundly. Conservative leader David Cameron appealed to the centre-left Liberal Democrats on Friday, saying he would consider some kind of formal agreement with them. This could include a coalition, a rarity in Britain, but is more likely to involve a pact whereby the Lib Dems agree to support a Conservative-led minority government implementing an agreed legislative programme and in return for concessions. The biggest hurdle is agreement on the pace of lowering the budget deficit. The Conservatives have pledged to start cutting it immediately but the Lib Dems warn this could harm Britain's recovery from a deep recession in 2008-2009. Electoral reform, along with immigration, Britain's role in the European Union and defence, are also likely to be stumbling blocks. The Lib Dems have long pushed for a change to Britain's first past the post voting system in favour of proportional representation. Clegg has to persuade Lib Dem members of parliament that it is worthwhile to make concessions, even though many party members are sceptical. "I will never consider voting for the Lib Dems again if a Conservative/Lim Dem pact is the outcome of this election!" one supporter said on Liberal Democrat Voice, a web site for party activists. If the Liberal Democrat/Conservative talks fail, a deal between the Lib Dems and Labour is possible, but unlikely as the two parties combined would not have enough MPs to form a majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. Labour leader Gordon Brown has said the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats had the right to try to form a government first even though he is allowed as sitting Prime Minister to have the first try under Britain's constitut
