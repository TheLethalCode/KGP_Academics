 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com) The sudden surge in power outage, triggered by the shutdown of two power units, is likely to continue for a few more days. Two power plants that recently went out of order  a 200 MW unit of the Ghorashal plant and the 450 MW Meghnaghat plant  are expected to resume operation on Wednesday and May 14 respectively. The 650 MW shortfall happened as the units had to be shut down on Saturday noon for technical difficulties, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) spokesperson told bdnews24.com Monday. The shortfall was further compounded by the severe heat on Monday, spokesperson Saiful Islam said. Water crisis in the capital has also worsened, triggered by the power shortage. The PDB official said the sudden shortfall would be addressed by May 14 as the units were being fixed. The Ghorashal unit came into operation 15 years back, while the Meghnaghat plant was commissioned in 2002. With these two, at least 10 units of the country's power plants are down, creating a shortfall of 1089 MW in generation. Maximum power generation on Monday was 3784 MW against a peak hour demand of 5000 MW. Total production capacity of the country's 47 power plants stands at 5376MW, according to BPDB.
