 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia's tax advisor Ahmed Azam Khan claimed on Monday that the BNP leader had not whitened any black money, as claimed by the Awami league. UPDATES Earlier on Sunday, the ruling party's acting general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif had claimed that Khaleda had whitened Tk 13.31 million between 2002-03 and 2006-07 fiscal years and paid almost Tk 3.4 million as tax and fine. Khan, who is also a BNP advisory council member, explained at a press briefing at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters that there was a significant difference between black money, which has no legitimate source, and undisclosed money which had a legitimate source. "Khaleda possessed no black money, so whitening money was out of the question," he said Admitting that the tax figures given out by Hanif was correct, he explained that the undisclosed money includes Tk 10 lakh received from the government as Ziaur Rahman's pension and gratuity and rental fees collected from her Gulshan house. He also said, "Income tax information is confidential information. It should not be revealed. In bringing out Khaleda's income tax information from the revenue board, Hanif has violated the constitution." Opposition secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, also present at the briefing, said the ruling Awami League was intentionally airing false information on Khaleda's income tax to mislead the people and hide their own failures in running the country. "Hanif's statement is false. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has paid taxes on her undisclosed money deposited in several banks." "Khaleda revealed this money and paid taxes under a military-installed interim government project named 'white money whitening' in Aug, 2007. This money is no way black," Delwar said. bdnew
