 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Khaleda Zia has said "enough is enough" and that people want a change in the government, vowing to launch a countrywide campaign. The BNP chief said she would announce a series of programmes from a grand rally in Dhaka on May 19. "We cannot give this government any more time," she told a grouping of pro-BNP lawyers Saturday. "Sixteen months is a long time." Arriving at 10:25am at the Supreme Court premises for the "grand conference", organised by the Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Samity, 63-year-old former prime minister heard dozens of lawyers speak before making a fiery speech lasting over an hour. Starting at 3:15pm, she first read out a four-page text and then extemporized for a much longer period. It was not until 4:30pm when she had to eat lunch on the first floor at the Supreme Court Bar Building where she was joined by hundreds of lawyers including those from the Jamaat-e-Islami. The leader of the opposition in parliament said the government had failed to do "anything for the welfare of the people" and "so people want a change in the government". But she added: "We are ready to give the government more time if it is keen on resolving the problems." "It is signing anti-state deals. The government has not fulfilled any of the pledges made to the people. Rather it is working to fulfill the pledges made to the foreigners." She said the government must not manipulate its majority in parliament and sign anti-state deals. "Don't think the opposition is weak. People are with us." She warned against any government attempts to obstruct the BNP campaign, saying such efforts would only backfire. A BNP man died on Wednesday when supporters of the ruling party allegedly attacked BNP activists bound for a Rajshahi rally. Speaking as chief guest at the rally, the BNP chairperson said nothing but corruption and plunder had marked the past 16 months. "People are scared of hooliganism of the Chhatra League and Juba League activists," she said. "Democracy is not safe in Awami League's hands." In one of her oft-repeated diatribes against the government, Khaleda said: "Awami League's majority in the parliament came as a gift from the chief of the illegal care-taker government Fakhruddin Ahmad and (the then) army chief Moeen U Ahmed." The opposition leader also claimed that the former army chief forced president Iajuddin Ahmed to declare the state of emergency in 2007. Khaleda said, "Moeen U Ahmed misguided the army with a fake UN letter and then threatened the president with a gun." Former UN Resident Coordinator Reneta Dessalien, Khaleda said, made the matter clear while she was leaving the country. However, the opposition leader did not give any further details about the former UN official's alleged statement. "Today it is clear that Moeen U Ahmed's proclaimed state of emergency was illegal," she said, reiterating her demand for putting the former army chief behind bars. Khaleda warned that her party, if voted to power, would revive the cases against the Awami League ruling party leaders. "We will revive the cases which you are now withdrawing manipulating power," she said and warned that "nobody will be spared". "We (the alliance government) did not indulge in corruption. We have documents of the corruption of the ruling party." War crimes trial Khaleda lent support to the demand for war crimes trial. "We also think that war criminals should be tried." But she added: "First publish the names of your partymen who were involved in war crimes and acts against humanity before starting the trial." The opposition leader, in response to speeches by some leaders who referred to "murders" during the 1972-75 Awami League government, said the BNP would try "all the political murders" committed in the three years after independence as well as during the current regime. The BNP chief claimed that there had been irregularities in appointing High Court judges. Responding to a comment by Rafique Ul Haque, she said, "The ghosts of Fakhruddin and Moeenuddin are haunting the Supreme Court. Get them out of here." The lawyers greeted the octogenarian barrister Haque with applause when he arrived at the venue. Khaleda, too, stood up and had him seated beside her. Rafique Ul Haque said, "Judiciary has fallen apart. The ghosts of 1/11 are haunting the Supreme Court." Rafique called for investigation into the Jan 11, 2007 proclamation of the state of emergency. He said: "I have no political affiliation. But politicians must do something about the post 1/11 events so that no one dares repeat the same in future. "The government or opposition can set up a commission to record the post-1/11 activities." Supreme Court Bar Association president Khandaker Mahbub Hossain vowed to "protest and resist" what he called "farce in the name of justice". The conference, chaired by Jatiayatbadi Ainjibi Forum president TH Khan, was also addressed by former BNP ministers Moudud Ahmed, Jamiruddin Sircar and Nazmul Huda. bdnews24
