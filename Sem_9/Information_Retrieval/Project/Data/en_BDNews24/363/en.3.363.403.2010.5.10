<TITLE> Real's Pellegrini confident of future </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 10 (bdnews24.com) -- Real Madrid coach Manuel Pellegrini insists he is still confident he will be in charge of the club next season despite the possibility that Madrid could end the season empty-handed. Real beat Athletic Bilbao 5-1 on Saturday to stop Barcelona from winning the title but Madrid trail Barca by one point going into the final day of the season and must win at Malaga and hope the champions slip up at home to Valladolid. It makes Barcelona, who beat Sevilla 3-2, strong favourites to retain the trophy and casts a dark cloud over Pellegrini's future. "You will have to ask the board. I have one more year left on my contract and no one has told me that I am not going to continue next season," said Pellegrini.

"We have all said over the course of the season that we are happy with Pellegrini. We hope he stays on," said defender Alvaro Arbeloa. Real have shown in the past that they are not afraid to chop and change coaches and there has been increased speculation that Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho could take over in the summer. Former Chelsea coach Mourinho, 47, saw his popularity in Madrid rocket after masterminding Barcelona's downfall in the Champions League semi-finals and has been coy over his future. Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has already come out and praised his compatriot Mourinho who used to work as a translator for Bobby Robson at arch rivals Barce
