<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government will establish a university in the same spirit as that of Rabindranath Tagore's famous Shantniketan University in the Indian state of West Bengal. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina also said there will be campuses in Shilaidaha and Shahjadpur  two locations associated closely with the Nobel prize winning poet. She was speaking at a programme marking the 149th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore on Saturday. Hasina said that she had learnt from a political leader of Shilaidaha that Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, her father, in his speech in 1972 wanted to set up a university there like Shantiniketan. She said that Tagore introduced Bengali to the realm of world literature and is also the writer of Bangladesh's national anthem. Tagore's works envelope the Bengali mind in all its hope and despair, frustration and fear, Hasina said. "His poetry seems to remain evergreen." The premier said that people are running after money nowadays and going in a wrong direction. There is no alternative to immersing into culture and heritage to bring them back to the right path, she said. Different social and cultural organisations have chalked out extensive programmes to mark the birth anniversary of the great poet. Having left an indelible impression on the psyche of the Bangalees as well as on world literature, Tagore's birth anniversary (25th day of Baishakh) falls on May 8. He was born to an eminent landowning family of Jorashanko in Kolkata, West Bengal in 1861. A poet, playwright, novelist, social reformer, nationalist, business manager, artist and composer, Tagore became Asia's first Nobel laureate when he won the prize for literature in 1913. bdnews24.com's Sirajganj correspondent reported that a three-day fair began in Shahjadpur from where Rabindranath Tagore used to run his estate. The fair includes discussion sessions and cultural functions. A two-day programme began in Shilaidaha's Kuthibari, Kushtia correspondent reported. bdnew
