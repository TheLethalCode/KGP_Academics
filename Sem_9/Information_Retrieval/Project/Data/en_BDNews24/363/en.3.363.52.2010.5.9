<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)The politics of Bangladesh Chhatra League -- the student wing of the governing Awami League -- is earning a bad name for the government, the state minister for law has admitted. At the same time, Quamrul Islam has said action will be taken against ministers, state ministers and MPs if they used Bangladesh Chhatra League for their own purposes. His comments came at a discussion programme organised by Bangabandhu Academy at the National Press Club on Sunday, marking the first death anniversary of Dr Wazed Miah, eminent nuclear scientist and husband of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Those who are truly engaged in sound politics cannot do these kind of misdeeds, he said. He said that though Dr Miah was involved in student politics, he was not confused about his studies or career. "That is why he had good results and became famous as a world renowned nuclear scientist," said Quamrul. Pointing to the criminal activities of the BCL, the former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru said that those who are involved in these activities are either infiltrators or have lost their way. "They are not activists of the Chhatra League," he added. Khasru urged the home minister to arrest these people in 24 hours and suspend those sub-inspectors and superintendent of police who would fail to arrest them. He said that the current student leaders are polluting the politics of BCL. State minister for home Shamsul Haque Tuku said that Dr Miah was involved in politics of principle and this has to be up held. Minister for jute and textile Abdul Latif Siddiqui was also present at the discussion. bdne
