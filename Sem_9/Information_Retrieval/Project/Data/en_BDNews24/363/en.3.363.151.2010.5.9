 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Petrol pump owners have suspended their strike for a month after the government agreed to meet some of their demands. Mohammad Nazmul Haque, convener of the petrol pump and tank-lorry owners' and workers' union, said Sunday that they had decided to suspend the indefinite strike following a meeting with government representatives. "We have called off the strike for a month as the government assured us that they would address our demands by then." Energy advisor Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury told reporters after the meeting that a number of the problems can be resolved easily and the ministry would promptly act to end the crisis. "But there are some issues that involve other ministries. These issues will have to be resolved in inter-ministerial meetings." He said that a government committee, headed by the additional secretary of the energy ministry, had been formed to look into the demands of petrol pump and tank-lorry owners. The advisor also said that the committee has been asked to find solutions to the problem and submit its recommendations within one month. "The government will decide on the next course of action based on the recommendations", Chowdhury said. Nazmul said the government has agreed to give firearms license to pump owners for their security, meeting the primary demand for suspending the strike. Nearly 9,000 petrol pumps across the country remained closed and tank-lorries stopped operating from 6 am Sunday due to the strike. The strike was called to press for acceptance of their 13-point demands including increasing the commission they receive from fuel sales. CNG filling stations were not part of the strike. Earlier on Mar 14, the association called a symbolic strike for six hours across the country. Their demands include  increasing commission for fuel sale from 2 percent to 7 percent, implementation of policies for setting up petrol pumps, establishment of testing laboratory in every depot, initiating accident insurance of Tk 500,000, construction of lorry terminals and rest-houses near the depots, increasing tank lorry charge and bringing an end to the police harassment in the name of examining papers. bdnews24.
