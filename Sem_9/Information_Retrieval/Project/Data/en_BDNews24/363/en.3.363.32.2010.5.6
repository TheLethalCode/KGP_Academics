 LONDON, May 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Controversial politician Nigel Farage, who has upset colleagues across Europe with his anti-EU rants, was injured when his light aircraft crashed on Thursday as he campaigned in Britain's general election. Farage, a Member of the European Parliament for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), had been planning to fly across parts of central England towing a giant banner exhorting voters to back his party. Police said his plane had crashed shortly after taking off at 8 a.m. local time at an airfield in Northamptonshire.

Officials said he had minor facial injuries and was undergoing checks in hospital. The pilot was taken by air ambulance to hospital with more serious but not life-threatening injuries. "It's one of those grace of God things that he is still alive," Chris Adams, the UKIP candidate for Aylesbury told BBC TV.

"He was going to be doing a couple of hours with the banner." Air accident investigators will carry out an inquiry into what led to the crash, police said. UKIP, which wants Britain to pull out of the EU, stunned the political establishment last year by beating Labour into third place in European parliamentary elections, taking more than 16 percent of the vote in the process. Farage himself then shocked his European colleagues in February when he described Belgian Herman Van Rompuy, the new President of the European Council, as "a damp rag" with the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk. "If the entire political class are united in their disgust of me, I must be getting something right," the 45-year-old former commodities broker told Reuters in Mar
