 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)The president has called for quick disposal of the trial of those facing charges for committing crimes against humanity in the 1971 war of independence. Zillur Rahman was speaking a day after Abdul Matin, the head of the war crimes investigation unit, resigned. He made the call when the tribunal members, led by its chairman Justice Mohammed Nizamul Huq, called on the president at the Bangabhaban on Thursday. A statement from the president's office said the tribunal chief informed the president about different aspects of the tribunal, which was constituted on Mar 25, in line with the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973. The government had also declared the investigating agency and the prosecution panel on that day. Without referring to any particular grouping of people, the president's statement said, "Those criminals against humanity killed some 3 million people during the Liberation War which has never happened anywhere else in world's history. "The trial of those criminals is a demand of the country's people." The statement also said that the, "Highest possible care should be taken so that no innocent person is punished during the trials." Nizamul is quoted to have responded, saying that they "were pledge-bound to carry on the responsibility... with the highest levels of honesty and fairness." The tribunal chief also told the president that the tribunals had some limitations including the lack of manpower, logistical support and transport. The president promised to provide the necessary assistance. Matin's resignation came a few days after a government advisor alleged that Matin Matin had run for a college election position backed by the defunct Islami Chhatra Shangha, a student wing of fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. ICS members have been accused of taking part in war crimes during 1971, in particular relating to the abduction of intellectuals mainly on Dec 14-15, 1971 just days before the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16. Matin has however strenuously denied any involvement in Islamist politics. bdne
