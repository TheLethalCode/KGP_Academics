<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com) State minister for law Quamrul Islam says the resignation of war crimes probe chief Abdul Matin, who was mired in controversy, has ended confusion over the investigation into the crimes against humanity in 1971 independence war. He said the probe now will get renewed impetus. "A confusing situation arose over the member of war crimes probe agency, which came to an end through the resignation of Matin," he said at a discussion on Friday on the emergence of war criminals and, communal politics. Bangabandhu Sanskritik Jote, the cultural wing of the ruling Awami League, organised the discussion at Dhaka Reporters' Unity office in Segunbagicha in the capital. On May 5, Matin stepped down, a few days after a government advisor alleged that Matin had run for a college election position backed by the defunct Islami Chhatra Shangha, a student wing of fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. ICS members have been accused of taking part in war crimes during 1971, in particular relating to the abduction of intellectuals mainly on Dec 14-15, 1971 just days before the surrender of Pakistan army on Dec 16. Home minister Sahara Khatun, however, defended the appointment and said Matin resigned to avoid the embarrassing situation he has been through since the comment of the advisor and media reports. Quamrul blamed the BNP and one of its founder former president Ziaur rAhman forn the rise of war criminals in society. He said Zia, himself a freedom fighter, introduced communal politics in Bangladesh through the induction of Jammat-e-Islami into politics. Former home minister Mohammad Nasim said a scope was created for 'war criminals' to escape the trial through the appointment of a man who is linked to Islami Chhatra Shibir. He called for caution against similar moves in future. ""The government has gained more public support and trust by removing Abdul Matin from his post." On Bangladesh Chhatra League, he said what the government had so far gained is being tainted by some students and so they should be identified and strictly punished. b
