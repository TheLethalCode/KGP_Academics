 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)--South Korea will make a huge investment in Bangladesh generating 3.5 lakh jobs. The workers will be employed in the Korean Export Processing Zone in Chittagong, which is now under construction, Korean envoy Taiyoung Cho told a press conference on Tuesday. "When completed, the Korean EPZ will generate 350,000 jobs. It will see an investment of US $ 1 billion," said Cho. The envoy said the KEPZ would contribute to transforming Bangladesh into one of the major industrials hubs in South Asia. Cho said his country would also be increasing the quota for Bangladeshi workers coming into Korea from this year. Last year the quota for Bangladeshi workers was 3,800. "This year it will be increased," said Cho though he did not give any figure. According to a Korea and Bangladesh signed memorandum of understanding on recruitment of skilled and semi-skilled workers, the Korean embassy and the Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited administer a Korean language test for the preliminary selection of candidates for appointment. The Korean government places the preliminary selection list to the Korean companies which recruit workers. The ambassador stressed that Bangladesh should produce more skilled workers so that Dhaka could utilise its quota. The press conference was arranged ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's upcoming three-day Korea visit starting on May 16. Cho said Sheikh Hasina is expected to meet Korean president Lee Myung-bak in Seoul and the two countries are likely to reach an understanding on economic cooperation. He did not elaborate the nature of the agreement
