 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP on Friday rejected the allegation that its chief Khaleda Zia had legalised undisclosed wealth. "It is false, motivated and unsubstantial," Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the party's secretary general, said at an urgent press briefing at the party's central office in the city's Naya Paltan. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday at a public meeting in Barguna said that BNP chief Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman had legalised huge undisclosed money. "Where did they get the money if they had not engaged in corruption?" Hasina asked. Delwar termed the prime minister's comments 'incoherent' and 'objectionable', saying, "It is a representation of her narrow mindedness. We bitterly protest comments like this." Ahmed Azam Khan, who was Khaleda Zia's lawyer during the state of emergency in 2007-8, also spoke, among others, at the briefing. Azam Khan also rejected the allegations about whitening black money. "Khaleda Zia has never whitened any black money. The National Board of Revenue has no record of this. The prime minister is delivering such false statements to tarnish the image of [Khaleda]." Former state minister for power Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku also criticised the prime minister for her comment that not a single megawatt of electricity had been generated during the 2001-2006 BNP-led alliance government. He claimed that a total of 1271 MW had been added to national grid during their last tenure. Referring to the results of the economic survey of 2008-09, Mahmud said that the total power production stood at 4,005 MW in 2001-02 when they came to power and the electricity production reached at 5275MW when they handed over power. He questioned, "If there was no growth, how did the increase occur?" BNP standing committee member Nazrul Islam Khan, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and AZM Zahid Hossain, one of Khaleda Zia's advisors, were present at the press briefing.
