 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)-- Students of the Arabic department at Dhaka University have demanded resignation of three teachers including its chairman alleging that they have provided facilities to Islamic Chhatra Shibir, student wing of fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. They locked the rooms of chairman ABM Siddiqur Rahman Nizami and two student advisers Prof AKM Faqruddin and Md Rafiqul Islam on Tuesday. The teachers were not in the rooms at the time. The students started their demonstration at the department from 8am - though some claimed that they were forced to take part in the demonstration. The Arabic department students alleged that the teachers are involved with Jamaat-e-Islami and assist the students who are involved with Shibir by giving money from the department fund. They said that they had submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor about the matter on Apr 25. The department chairman Siddiqur Rahman denied the allegations. He also claimed that he was not a Jamaat supporter. Rahman said the students had never previously talked to him about the matter. The university proctor AKM Saiful Islam said that they would consider what next steps to take after consulting with the VC. bdnews24.c
