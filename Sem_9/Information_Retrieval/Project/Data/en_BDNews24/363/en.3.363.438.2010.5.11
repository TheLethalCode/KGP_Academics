 Dinajpur, May 11 (bdnews24.com)All of the three workers trapped after a tunnel caved in at Barapukuria Coal Mine on Tuesday morning has been rescued. Jahangir Alam was dug out around 3pm and Mohammad Ali around 7pm. Chinese worker Swing,the last of those trapped, was pulled out around an hour later. They have been rushed to Rangpur Medical College with critical injuries. Mohammed Kamruzzaman, general manager (mining) of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited, earlier in the day said a portion of a tunnel 1300 feet underground had caved in at 10am, killing one and trapping 19 workers. Robiul Islam, president of Barapukuria Coal Mine Workers' Union, told journalists that around 10.30am, the roof of phase no. 3 of shaft 1108 caved in. Workers came up the lift and informed authorities. A rescue mission was immediately launched to rescue workers. Kamranuzzaman had earlier said that the body of one miner, Ranjit, had been recovered. Injured miners, Abdur Razzak and Manik told journalists that three Chinese and 29 Bangladeshi workers went down the shaft in the 6am shift. While working near the conveyer belt 800 metres from the lift point, the roof of the tunnel caved in. The tunnel was clouded with dust and they lost their senses after a while. Nine of the miners were immediately admitted to Rangpur Medical College Hospital. Two were taken to the Phulbari Upazila Health Complex and seven others to the mining company's medical centre. The Barapukuria coal mine was discovered by the Geological Survey of Bangladesh at Parbatipur in 1985. The mine has an estimated 390 million tonnes of coal reserve stretched over 5.25 square kilometres. The government entered into a contract with China for technical and financial assistance to set up the mine, and commercial coal production began in September 2005. In 1998, a sudden onrush of water flooded the mine resulting in the suspension of mine development for two years. The revised mine design reduced both the recoverable reserve and mine life. Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited supervises coal production by over 1,000 miners in 35 tunnels. bd
