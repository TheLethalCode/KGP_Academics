 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has withdrawn a tax evasion case against Awami League leader Obaidul Kader. Judge Jasmine Anwar of special court-4 on Monday ordered withdrawal of the case filed during the tenure of the military-backed interim government. According to case documents, Kader paid his dues to Sonali Bank in January this year. Earlier on July 21, 2009, the government approved withdrawal of the case terming it politically driven to persecute the former state minister. The National Board of Revenue filed the case against the AL presidium member for evading Tk 6.36 lakh in income tax in August 2007. The High Court stayed the case in September 2007.
