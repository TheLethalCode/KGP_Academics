 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal president Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal was barred from catching a London flight on Saturday. He went to Shahjalal International Airport at around 8am. Immigration officials stopped him saying that they had received 'orders from the top' not to allow him going abroad. The former MP told bdnews24.com that he was scheduled to fly to London with a Biman flight to see his ailing wife, who is under treatment there. He said that he does not have any cases or general diaries against him. "I don't understand why I was stopped." An immigration official preferring anonymity said that Alal was prevented from flying as they were asked to stop him. He, however, did not explain anything further. Many opposition leaders have previously been stopped at the airport - but later received court orders allowing them to leave. bdn
