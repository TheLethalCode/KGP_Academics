 YANGON, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has lodged an appeal with Myanmar's top court, seeking to overturn a guilty verdict for her breach of a draconian security law last year, her lawyer said on Tuesday. Her legal team submitted the appeal on Monday to a special three-judge panel of the Supreme Court and hopes to have the 18-month extension to her house arrest term scrapped on the grounds that the Aug. 11 verdict was unlawful.
