<TEXT>
 Bandarban, May 08 (bdnew24.com)  Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, has alleged that the government's actions in the hill districts are contrary to the peace accord. Santu Larma, chief of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS), made the comment on Saturday noon at a meeting held at Balipara Union Parishad arena. The meeting, organised under the banner of 'local people', was presided over by UP Chairman Kyasau Marma. Santu Larma, also chairman of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council, alleged that sections of the peace accord, signed during the last tenure of the Awami League government, had not yet been implemented. "Rather the current government is acting in such a manner that the agreement will never be implemented." The Land Dispute Settlement Commission (Land Commission) was formed without consulting the regional council and the PCJSS and so its formation contradicts with the peace accord, Santu said. The regional council chief also claimed that this would make establishment of peace in CHT difficult. PCJSS central organising secretary Shaktipada Tripura, council member KS Mang and PCJSS chairman of Thanchi upazila Chasathoai Marma spoke at the meeting among others. Earlier on Mar 31 the PCJSS, at their party council, made a number of demands including making the council effective, resolving land disputes effectively and in line with the peace accord's stipulations. They also demanded pull-out of all temporary army camps, including suspension of Operation Uttaran. bdnews24
