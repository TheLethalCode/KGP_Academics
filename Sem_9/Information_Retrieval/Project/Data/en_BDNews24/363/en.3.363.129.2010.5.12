<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com) The FBCCI wants ACC take its permission to sue businessmen, just as the graft-busters need advance clearance from the government before filing a corruption suit against public servants. Its president Annisul Huq aired the demand on Tuesday at a meeting of the consultative committee on budget, co-organised by the National Board of Revenue and the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The move from the apex business body comes in response to the cabinet's recent approval of a proposal on change the anti-graft law that will make it legally binding for the Anti-Corruption Commission to seek government permission before suing public servants. Finance minister A M A Muhith was to be there as the chief guest, but his absence, due to a sudden illness, took away much of the flair from pre-budget discussion, billed as the defining session ahead of June 10 budget placing in parliament. Muhith was taken to the city's Square Hospitals in the morning as his blood pressure rose. However, he is out of danger now. The FBCCI, on their part, came up with a 100-page compilation of budget proposals, and a booklet to be submitted to Muhith evidently. The FBCCI's set of budget recommendations, prepared by three advisers  all of them former NBR members  almost touched upon all the aspects of income tax, customs and VAT. The prime minister's economic affairs adviser Mashiur Rahman replaced Muhith at the discussion, co-organised by the National Board of Revenue and the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry. But he declined to respond to any of the demands that were put forward by the participants that included the country's chambers of commerce and industries. He told the session, in his concluding speech, that as an adviser he gets to take part in all the discussions of the finance ministry and the prime minister's office. "But only on condition that I do not share them publicly." Anticipating the importance of the session, the press corps had also showed up in great numbers. FBCCI also suggested bringing all state and government functionaries including the president, prime minister, ministers, lawmakers, judges and bureaucrats under the tax net according to their salaries and fringe benefits. Highlighting on some of the other major demands, Huq reiterated that the income tax threshold be raised. "It has been proven that raising the limit yields more revenue." He also suggested lowering the rate of corporate tax, setting up the National Tax Tribunal and widening the net of VAT collection. Investments, both local and foreign, were not looking up, according to Huq. Infrastructure, especially power, was the major obstacle, he observed. "The government needs to be over attentive on the matter of power or else industrial growth will fall on its face." He urged for a quick decision on the coal policy and subsidy on diesel for the power sector as an interim measure in the wake of acute power crisis. "The government needs to adopt some mid-term and long term polices which should be reflected in the next budget." More than a hundred representatives from district chambers across the country and different trade bodies, ranging from packaging and accessories manufacturers to steel re-rollers, voiced their demands at the session. b
