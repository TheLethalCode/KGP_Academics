 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com) The ongoing strike by a section of water transport workers is threatening airline operations in Dhaka's international airport. Shahjalal International Airport had notified all operators that it would not be possible to refuel aircraft after midnight Tuesday given their low stock. Director of the airport, Wing Commander Sahidur Rahman told bdnews24.com citing a notice of the Padma Oil, the main supplier of jet fuel, that the suppliers had indicated their inability due to a strike of the Noujan Sramik Federation (water vessels workers federation).

"They have enough but the aircraft does not have the emergency fuel," said the wing commander. He said that airport's stock of fuel was very low and insufficient. A high-level meeting was underway until 10.30pm in Narayanganj trying to resolve the situation, where aviation secretary Shafik Alam Mehedi, chairman of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh Air Commodore Sakeb Iqbal Khan Majlish were said to be present. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com that it was not possible to unload the fuel into the depot although there were four tankers anchored at the Godnail oil depot. "Out stocks are almost nil. Whatever we have will not be sufficient for the airport." "Accordingly, the airport authorities have virtually stopped refuelling aircraft," said the Dhaka airport director. Karim said that 70 tank-lorries had already been despatched to fetch jet fuel from Chittagong. "They should reach Dhaka by [Wednesday]." Apparently a navy tanker has also been despatched to transport jet fuel to Dhaka. Karim said that the navy ship is also expected to reach Dhaka within a day. However, the BPC chairman said that the problem would continue into Wednesday. "We should be able to resolve it by Thursday thoug
