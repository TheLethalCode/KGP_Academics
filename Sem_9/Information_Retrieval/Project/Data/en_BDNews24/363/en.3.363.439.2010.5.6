 LONDON, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britons voted on Thursday in a knife-edge election, with opinion polls suggesting the Conservatives will win the popular vote but fail to secure an outright parliamentary majority. With the result too close to call, Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour Party retains a chance of staying in power, perhaps in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Whoever wins will have to deal with a record budget deficit running in excess of 11 percent of national output, and demands for political reform following a parliamentary expenses scandal last year which left Britons disgusted with lawmakers. "This election has been more exciting, more than I expected," said lawyer Lorraine Mullins, voting at a busy polling station in central London. The Conservatives, led by former public relations executive David Cameron, have seen a commanding poll lead dwindle since the turn of the year, with voters seemingly reluctant to embrace the change they say they offer after 13 years of Labour rule. Markets want a clear-cut result and fear that a stalemate could lead to political paralysis, hampering efforts to tackle the nation's spiralling debt and secure recovery from the worst recession since World War Two. The equation has been made more complex by a surge in support for the LibDems, energised by strong performances in TV debates by leader Nick Clegg, who shares Cameron's relative youth -- they are both 43 -- and easy manner. After weeks of frenzied campaigning, the three main party leaders cast their votes early, smiling and waving to the gathered ranks of media. The likeliest outcome is a "hung parliament" in which no party wins an outright majority in the 650-seat house. Britain has not had an inconclusive election since 1974 and does not have a tradition of coalition-building like its neighbours in continental Europe. The pound hit a near nine-month high on Wednesday against a euro weakened by the crisis in Greece. However, analysts say the markets could turn their fire on British assets should efforts to form a government prove protracted and messy. BROWN AND OUT? Brown's Labour party has shown some improvement in the latest polls and the quirks of the British parliamentary system mean it could finish third in terms of vote share and still remain the largest bloc in parliament. That scenario could leave the LibDems holding the balance of power and certain to press their case for electoral reform to a more proportional system. Other minor parties could also find themselves playing a significant role. Clegg has said he would find it hard to do a deal with Brown if Labour does finish third, but has not ruled out working with an alternative Labour leader, or with the Conservatives. The LibDems share Labour's concern that spending cuts should not be imposed until economic recovery is established and Labour are more open to electoral reform than the Conservatives. The Conservatives have promised to cut the deficit harder and faster than Labour and to squeeze out 6 billion pounds in efficiency savings in the current year. Labour has warned voters that this could cost jobs and jeopardise the recovery but independent commentators say the figures are tiny compared with a forecast deficit this year of 163 billion pounds. Independent think-tanks have accused all the parties of failing to be open with voters about the scale of cuts that will be needed to restore public finances. Bookmaker William Hill made a hung parliament its 4/7 favourite for the election outcome, with a Conservative majority the second favourite at 6-4. The six latest newspaper polls put the Conservatives between six and nine percentage points ahead of Labour, making them the largest party, but denying them outright control, with the LibDems slipping to third in some surveys. Britain's tabloid newspapers were emblazoned with bold headlines. The Sun hailed Cameron as "Our Only Hope" in a front page decked out in the style of Barack Obama's posters for his victorious US presidential campaign. Only the Daily Mirror pledged support for Brown, 59. It asked voters if they could really picture Cameron as prime minister, describing his hobbies as "cutting public services; rewarding rich and privileged" and "fox hunting". Polls close at 2100 GMT and exit polls broadcast immediately afterwards will give the first indication of the outcome, with results coming in from up and down the country through the night and well into Fri
