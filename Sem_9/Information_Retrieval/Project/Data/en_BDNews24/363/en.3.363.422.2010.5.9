 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia will spell out the party's anti-government programmes from the Dhaka rally on May 19, spokesperson Mirza Fakhrul Islalm Alamgir has confirmed. Addressing a protest rally at Muktangon in the capital on Sunday, the senior joint secretary general said that the people would reject the government outright in future unless it stopped persecuting opposition and telling lies. "We will announce the campaign from Dhaka's Grand Rally to give the people relief as the government has failed." "People have no confidence in the government. The more this government stays in power, the more the people will suffer," he said. Mirza Fakhrul said, "I want to tell the prime minister that there is still time. Read the writings on the wall. Try to feel the pulse of the people." "Strike was observed in Bogra on Sunday. People there have already voiced their opposition," he said. "If the government does not change itself, the whole country will give a fitting reply," he warned. The rally was held in protest against the murder of Bogra BNP leader Zakir Hossain and injuries of scores of its workers bound for a grand rally in Rajshahi. BNP alleged that armed activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League, student wing of the ruling Awami League, swooped on the BNP motorcade at Singra in Natore on their way to Rahsahi. In the ensuing clash, one was killed and scores were injured. Dhaka mayor and BNP vice-president Sadeque Hossain Khoka said, "Awami League does not believe in democracy. If they were democratic, they would investigate the murder of Zakir Hossain." "The government has resorted to oppression which will end badly," he said The protest rally chaired by Khoka was also addressed among others by BNP organising secretary Fazlul Haque Milon.
