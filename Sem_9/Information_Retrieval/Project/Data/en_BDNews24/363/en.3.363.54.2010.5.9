<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League on Sunday revealed how much money BNP chief Khaleda Zia had paid as fines to whiten undisclosed money. Awami League's acting general secretary Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif said Khaleda had whitened Tk 13.31 million between 2002-03 and 2006-07 fiscal years and paid almost Tk 3.4 million as tax and fine. The opposition party leader had paid fines to legalise her undisclosed income on Aug 6, 2007, Hanif said. The Awami League leader made the statement at a press conference at Awami League's party office at Dhanmandi, Dhaka in reply to comments of BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Thursday, when he claimed that Khaleda had never whitened 'black' money. According to the figures that Hanif presented, Khaleda had paid Tk 3,031,044 in 2002-03 fiscal, Tk 1,17,168 in 2004-5, Tk 82,790 in 2004-05, Tk 83,356 in 2005-06 and Tk 72000 in 2006-07 as tax and fine to the government. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had said last Wednesday that Khaleda and her son Tarique Rahman had whitened a large amount of 'black' money and questioned about the source of the their massive wealth. But Delwar and other BNP leaders refuted the claims the next day. Hanif said on Sunday that Delwar had lied when he made the claim. Ahmed Azam Khan, who was Khaleda 's lawyer during the state of emergency in 2007-8, had also said: "Khaleda Zia has never whitened any black money. The National Board of Revenue has no record of this." Referring to Delwar's comment, the ruling party leader said, "Be careful when you speak. We have proof that [Khaleda] whitened her black money." He claimed that Saifur Rahman, the finance minister of BNP-led alliance government, had also whitened black money. "A common man may say,' I have not paid tax by mistake.' But how can the head of the government or a responsible person like the finance minister say this?" "On one hand, the BNP secretary general says his leader did not whiten even a single taka, and on the other, BNP's senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir says black money was whitened in a legal way. Therefore, they may as well say who is lying." Hanif also said the BNP activist had not died from the wounds he had sustained allegedly in the attacks by pro-government activists on May 5. Zakir Hossain, a union-level leader of Bogra BNP, died on his way to hospital as he, according to witnesses, had sustained injuries in a clash with Bangladesh Chhatra League activists at Singra Upazila in Natore. Hossain was bound for BNP's rally in Rajshahi. Hanif said the BNP man died as followers of BNP's former MP for Singra in Natore Gazi Golam Morshed and Ruhul Kuddus Talukder Dulu clashed. BNP, however, blamed the death on ruling Awami League-backed activists and enforced a half-day strike the same day in protest. On Bhola by-polls, he said, BNP wanted to make the by-polls of Bhola an issue but they failed. b
