 Dhaka, May 07 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party has countered that it was the Awami League which was responsible for creating the anarchic situation in the country that led to the declaration of emergency on 1/11. BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir made the assertion in an apparent effort to counter prime minister Sheikh Hasina's claim made in Borguna on Thursday that the then ruling party alliance's excesses paved the way for declaration of emergency. Hasina said "1/11 arose because of corruption, looting and vote rigging plans committed by the alliance government (BNP-led alliance government preceded the former caretaker government)". Alamgir claimed that the prime minister's allegations were a travesty of truth, saying "They (Awamis) brought about 1/11 through creating anarchy by killing people with their 'oars' and 'sticks'." He also said that the ruling party had earlier claimed that the caretaker government was a product of their movement and that the prime minister's current stance on the matter was a ruse to shift the blame on her opponents. Alamgir was speaking to reporters after laying wreaths at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman at Dhaka's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the morning along with the leaders and workers of Zia Shishu-Kishore Sangathan. Hasina on Thursday at a public meeting in Barguna questioned about the source of the huge undisclosed money that opposition chief Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman had later legalized, saying "Where did they get the money fromif they had not engaged in corruption?" She also said BNP had looted people's assets after coming to power and that the opposition leader would have to account to the people for this. Asked about this, Mirza Fakhrul said, "Black money was whitened in a legal way. Everyone is equal in the eye of law. There is no scope to see it differently. Everyone including the opposition party will have to account for this." Referring to the factional clash of JCD in Sylhet, Alamgir termed the incident as 'unfortunate'. He also said that such incidents were commonplace in a big party like BNP and that steps would be taken against any party member who would be found guilty for the clash. Responding to queries about the anti-government movement, he said, "The government is torturing opposition party leaders and workers. If the highhandedness and repression continue, there will be no other option but to go for tougher movements like Hartal, along with people." He claimed that BNP believed in systematic and positive politics and that the party did not wage movement against the government in the last 16 months considering that it would harm the country. bdnews
