 Natore, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bhetorbag High School management committee chairman has beaten the school's head-mistress with a stick at Bagatipara upazila. The incident occurred at the office of the head mistress, Mahmuda Begum (52), on Saturday. She is now under treatment in the Puthia upazila health complex. Mahmuda told bdnews24.com that the chairman of the management committee, Abdul Kuddus (32), went to the school with some people at 8:30am Saturday. They told the peon Abdus Sattar to immediately ring the bell signalling the end of school. When she tried to stop them, they made the other teachers leave. Then holding her by the hair they pushed her on the floor and started beating her with sticks. The companions of Kuddus, Sohan, Mintu, Alimudin, Anowar, Riaz and Enamul also assaulted her, said Mahmuda. The local MP sent a letter of approval for Abdul Kuddus and Abdur Razzak at the election of the management committee in March. But as the head mistress, Mahmuda had discarded the name of Kuddus and sent a list of three including Razzak to the Education Board. As the board appointed Kuddus as chairman, she submitted a writ petition with the High Court. Razzak was angry at her action and had been insulting her in the school and on the roads. He also told her to resign, said Mahmuda. Sub inspector of Bagatipara Police Station Habibur Rahman said that they had received the written complaint. "We went to the place. It is true. But the case has not been filed yet." The locals have asked us to wait a day or two, he said. If they come to a compromise no case will be required, he added. The sub-inspector said that that the officer in charge is on leave and thus the accused had not been arrested. "Actions will be taken when he is back." Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Goutam Kumar said that the head mistress had informed him of the incident. He assured her of cooperation, he added. The accused, Kuddus, said that the head mistress does not listen to anybody. "I am an Awami Lague leader. I will contend in the next Union Parishad elections. So I have to look after the welfare of the area". He also said that the local MP had selected him as the chairman. "But she refused to accept. So we have thrown her out. I had no other options" bdnews24.co
