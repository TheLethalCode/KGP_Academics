<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)--Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has announced that the government will provide every college in Dhaka city with at least two buses to facilitate easy and safe transport of the students. She made the announcement at a ceremony marking the launch of 100 buses of state-owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation on Tuesday. Procured from China, the buses will hit different Dhaka city routes on Wednesday. The prime minister said 600 more buses will join the BRTC fleet in phases under a plan taken to improve the public transport system and ease the traffic gridlock in the capital city. Hasina said her government was modernising the loss-making corporation, ignoring suggestions to wind up it, to facilitate safe, easy commute for city dwellers. "Loss is not the only issue to be always considered. We've to consider the convenient transport of the people too," she added. The prime minister hoped the corporation will become profitable if it delivered professional services. "Any business organisation can make profit if corruption is stopped and the people there work with utmost sincerity and honesty and with the mentality of serving the people." The premier asked the BRTC management to fix bus timings taking into consideration the school-college hours so that the students can avail themselves of the services. Listing her government's plans to ease traffic congestions, Hasina said they are "working relentlessly" to build elevated expressway, waterway, subway, more flyovers and ring-roads. Steps have also been taken to decentralise the administration for lowering the pressure of people on the city and controlling pollution, she said. She urged all to abide by the traffic law. The prime minister handed over keys of eight buses to the vice-chancellors of Dhaka, Jahangirnagar and Jagannath universities and principal of Eden Girls' College. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain, roads and highway department secretary Md Mozzammel Haque Khan and BRTC chairman MM Iqbal, among others, spoke on the occasion. b
