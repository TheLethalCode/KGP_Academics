<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May11 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting Awami League general secretary Mahabub-ul-Alam Hanif says he wonders how BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia had run the government without understanding income tax issues. He raised the question while addressing a press conference on Tuesday following a statement of Khaleda's lawyer and BNP advisory council member Azam Khan pleading the former prime minister's ignorance of income tax procedures. Hanif on Sunday told another press conference that Khaleda had paid Tk 33.87 lakh as fines from 2002-03 to 2006-07 fiscal years to whiten black money worth Tk 1.33 crore. In reply to Hanif's statement, Azam said in a Monday press conference: "Ten percent of the money deposited with banks is deducted as income tax at the end of the year. But she (Khaleda) did not know that the deposit again needed to be shown on the tax return and taxes had to be paid on that money too." He said: "In no way can that money be termed black money. Because, the money whose source is not disclosed is called black money. Awami League leaders are calling it black money since they don't know the difference." Hanif told Tuesday's conference convened at Awami League chief's office at Dhanmondi: "We ask how she had carried out the responsibility of a prime minister without knowing such a simple matter. Is Azam's explanation acceptable?" He said any sort of undisclosed money is black money. "Whatever may be the source, black money is illegal." Earlier, on Wednesday prime minister Sheikh Hasina in a public meeting in Barguna on Wednesday alleged that Khaleda Zia and her son Tarique Rahman had whitened a large amount of black money by paying fines. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain denied the allegation. He told the press on Monday that Awami League leaders were trying to tarnish the image of BNP chief by resorting to falsehood. At Tuesday's press conference, Hanif suggested Delwar and Azam should consult a business dictionary to find out what is black money and what is not. Awami League leaders BM Mozammel Haque, AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Khaled Chowdhury and Asim Kumar Ukil were also present at the conference.
