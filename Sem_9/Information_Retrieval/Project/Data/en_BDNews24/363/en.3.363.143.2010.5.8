 PARIS, May 8 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Former World Cup-winning France coach Aime Jacquet said on Friday that Franck Ribery's private life had been 'thrown to the dogs' after he was identified in an under-age sex scandal. The Bayern Munich winger was interviewed by police in April and admitted to having had relations with a call-girl when she was 17 without knowing she was under the legal age for prostitution in France, which is 18.

Ribery has been at the centre of a media storm since revelations about the human trafficking case, in which he and his France team-mate Sidney Govou were called as witnesses. The 27-year-old, who is married with two children, could face a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros if charged and found guilty. He is nonetheless likely to be named in France's squad for the World Cup, which will be revealed by coach Raymond Domenech on May 11.
