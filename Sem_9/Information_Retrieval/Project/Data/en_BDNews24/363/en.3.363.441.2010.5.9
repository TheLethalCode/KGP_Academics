<TEXT>
 Dhaka May 9 (bdnews24.com)  The shipping minister claimed that the strike called by a section of the water transport workers has failed. The Noujan Sromik Federation called a general strike from Friday midnight as they were unhappy with the increased pay scale that the minister had announced earlier that day. But Shahjahan Khan claimed on Sunday, "There is no strike going on." The federation had called for a work stoppage, pressing for their 22-point charter including acceptable wage structure for labourers. The minister made the statements in a press conference at the ministry which was the third on this same issue. The government has arranged special security for launch movements, he said. The minister also provided information on launch movements at the conference. According to his information, on Sunday until 12pm, three launches were scheduled to leave from Khulna port but did not. But launches from the other ports sailed as scheduled: 25 from Paturia, 55 from Mawa, three from Patuakhali and seven from Rangamati. In addition, eight launches out of the scheduled 11, sailed from Dhaka, four of 11 sailed from Chandpur, six out of 29 sailed from Barisal and 28 of 32 sailed from Narayanganj. The strike was called for political gain of a single person in spite of the declaration of new wage structure, said Shahjahan. But he did not reveal the name and evaded questions from the journalists. The government will take legal actions against those who called the strike illegally, said the minister.
