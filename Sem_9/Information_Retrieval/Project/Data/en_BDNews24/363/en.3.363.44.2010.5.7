 Chittagong, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a seminar on Friday emphasised the need for public-private partnership as well as people's participation in building an information technology (IT) -based education system. The seminar titled 'Moving toward IT-Enabled Education System' also noted that the government has already taken steps to make it a success. The seminar was organised to mark the three-day laptop fair in the gymnasium beside M A Aziz Stadium. Bangladesh Computer Association president Mustafa Jabbar presented the keynote address at the seminar. "Our country has never had any technology-based education. No IT-based education system has been built in the country since our independence. Each government was busy with their five-year plans", he said. He called for building an IT-based education system as opposed to the existing system in which IT education is an insignificant part. Advisor to the information and technology ministry Munir Hasan said it is currently not possible to bring the education system totally under technology. Despite that, the government is working. Defining digital education, he said "Digital education doesn't mean computer education, rather it points toward education through computers." Hasan commented that the government doesn't need to spend money on formulating information-technology enabled education, including digitalization of text books, as that could easily be done through public-private partnership and participation of the people. He also expressed hope that the country will make unprecedented development in the information and technology-based sector in the next 10 years. bdnews24.com editor-in-chief Toufique Imrose Khalidi, who moderated the seminar, said, "The government will chiefly have to take responsibility for educating the country's population. However, public-private partnership as well as people's participation is also necessary to achieve that goal". He also pointed out that money is currently not an issue for the information-technology education sector, saying, "Educated businessmen are coming forward to invest in this sector. Money can also be collected from capital market."
