 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)  Weavers have called an indefinite strike from May 12 demanding resumption of tax free yarn import from India through Benapole land port. Bangladesh Handloom and Power-loom Owners' Association made the announcement from a press conference held at the National Press Club on Saturday. Bangladesh's top body of knitwear manufacturers and exporters (BKMEA) has expressed solidarity with the call. Weavers have long been demanding permission to import yarn through Benapole land port following dramatic rise in yarn price. But yarn import through the land port remains banned. Leaders from the press conference also demanded prime minister's intervention to meet their six point demands. Local yarn producers say that resumption of its import through the land port would bring down yarn prices and eventually ruin the industry. Some of them say it will be a 'boomerang' for the local manufacturers. Association president Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan on Saturday said the price of yarn started to go up from Oct lat year following the ban on imports through Benapole. "One pound of 40 count yarn was available at Tk 65, which has been increased to Tk 115 now," Lokman, who is also the mayor of Norshingdi municipality, added. He said the loom owners could not afford the increased price as they could not sell their products for a higher price. Some 60 percent of the looms had been taken off operation due to this, he said. He alleged that the minister for jute and textiles did not keep his word about opening up of the land port. "Price of goods have increased in the international market. That is usual. But not to the extent that it is made out to be." "In our country prices jumped thrice a day." Lokman also termed president of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) Abdul Hai Sarker a 'yarn syndicate leader'. The BTMA president, however, rejected the allegation. "I do not have any relation with syndicates. The allegation is baseless," he told bdnews24.com. He further said, "We don't produce yarn for our local industries. They are all exported." Price of yarn has been increased in line with the production costs, which was caused by gas and power crisis, he said. Besides, Hai also admitted that some traders wanted to make more profits. BKMEA vice president Zahidul Huq Bhuiyan, at the press conference, said there was a huge demand of yarn in the country due to low production capacity. According to Zahidul, country's annual yarn demand is 10 lakh tonnesseven lakh tonnes for the knit sector and the remaining for the weaving industrywhereas, the production capacity of the 266 spinning mills is only six lakh tonnes. bdnews24.
