<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com) -- EU envoy Stefan Frowein on Saturday called on the government to allow the Anticorruption Commission and the judiciary work independently without any political interference. Whilst addressing a press conference to mark Europe Day 2010 at Hotel Sheraton on Saturday, he also asked that parliament be made more effective in order to improve the political environment. Frowein said the "ACC can not work independently as the government interferes in its functions in different ways." "The ACC should be let to work independently for the sake of democracy," he said. Frowein suggested strengthening the ACC financially and making it free from political interference. On the parliament, Frowein said, "The present parliament is working better than the last parliament, with the Parliamentary standing committees working well." But it could be made more effective, he said. Regarding the fund set up to finance projects combating the effects of climate change, Frowein said, "The fund is being disbursed through the World Bank as Bangladesh lacks financial management capacity." "Bangladesh is playing a leading role amongst the least developed countries on the climate issue," Frowein said, adding that efforts will be made to give Bangladesh more funding. Frowein congratulated Rushanara Ali, the Bangaldeshi born British citizen in becoming an MP in the Parliamentary election in Britain. On the Chittagong Hill Tracts, he said the situation of CHT might improve with the full implementation of CHT Peace Accord. The EU hosted an art competition, and a fashion and photography show on the occasion of EU Day. Envoys of other EU countries attended the press conference. b
