 Syed Nahas Pasha, bdnews24.com London Correspondent London, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Rushanara Ali made history on Friday when she became the first Bangladesh-born Briton to make it to the House of Commons. The Labour Party candidate took Bethnal Green and Bow, the seat previously held by George Galloway. In the east London constituency, all of the main parties had put forward Bangladeshi-Muslim candidates. The 35-year-old Oxford graduate won with 21,784 votes, an 11,574 majority over Liberal Democrat Ajmal Masroor, who got 10,210 votes. Respect Party's Abjol Miah got 8,532 votes. To tumultuous applause, Ali, who has been subjected to attacks by Galloway, said: "You, the voters, decided it was time to pay our final respect to Respect. This is a victory for people here who chose hope over fear, unity over division. "To millions of Bangladeshis around the world, it will mean so much to them that somebody of their background has been elected to the mother of all parliaments." She told bdnews24.com: "We've to shun the politics of division and be engaged in mainstream politics." Ali said her first tasks would be to create employment for the youths in the constituency, work for their better future, and help the people solve their residence problem. Masroor congratulated Ali, calling it an "historical moment" and admitted he had only found out a few days before that she was his cousin. Born in 1975 in Burki village under Biswanath of Sylhet, Ali came to London with his parents when she was seven. She studied politics, economics and philosophy at Oxford University
