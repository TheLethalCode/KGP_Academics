<TITLE> Oil from Gulf spill creeps ashore in Louisiana </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VENICE, La, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The first oil from a massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico came ashore on a Louisiana island beach on Thursday as BP engineers prepared to start lowering a 98-ton metal chamber over the ruptured seabed well. A sheen of oil washed ashore on uninhabited Freemason Island in the Chandeleur chain, a spokeswoman for the US response team said. It was the first confirmed report of oil reaching a US shoreline from this Gulf spill. "We have teams that have confirmed oil on the beach," Coast Guard Petty Officer Connie Terrell told Reuters from the Unified Command operation in Robert, Louisiana, which brings together BP, the Coast Guard and other agencies. "It's largely just sheen. There is no evidence of medium or heavy oil," she said. Maps from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the concentration of heavy oil remains much farther off the coast for now, close to the site of the leak. But the Mississippi Delta, Breton Sound, and Chandeleur Sound continue to be threatened by shoreline contacts over the next few days, NOAA said. By late Saturday night into Sunday morning, winds in the Gulf region could pick up to 15 to 20 knots (17 to 23 mph). That may make efforts to battle the slick more difficult. "We're coming out of a period of relatively calm weather, with light winds and flat seas. There's going to be a little bit of change here over the weekend," Tim Destri, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in New Orleans, said. Oil workers, volunteers and the military have battled desperately to shut off the gushing leak and stop the huge spreading oil slick from reaching major ports, tourist beaches, wildlife refuges and fishing grounds on the Gulf Coast. A barge carrying the massive white containment box arrived at the spill site where a BP-owned well blew out two weeks ago 40 miles (64 kilometers) off the Louisiana coast, causing the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon rig. Once the four-story-tall metal dome is lowered to the seabed in an operation that could take two days, it is supposed to capture leaking oil and channel it to a drilling ship on the surface. BP said the dome, the best short-term option for containing the leak, could begin operations by Monday. "We'll be lowering this containment vessel within the next 24 hours, weather permitting," Robert Dudley, a BP executive vice president, said after giving a speech in Boston. The Gulf spill will "change the offshore industry forever, around the globe," he said. NEVER TRIED BEFORE But company officials, facing enormous pressure to limit ecological and economic damage from the accident, cautioned the device had never been used in water nearly 1 mile (1.6 km) deep. Several more days of calm weather were forecast for the area, giving crews a window of opportunity to fight the leak. About 270 boats deployed protective booms on Thursday to block the slick and dispersants to break up the thick oil. "We have all hands on deck for a potentially unprecedented disaster," Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters in Biloxi, Mississippi. "It's an evolving situation ... we are preparing in advance for all potential events." The weather allowed a series of "controlled burns" of the massive slick on Wednesday, burning nearly 1,000 gallons of fuel. It was the first burn since a 28-minute blaze on April 28 that removed thousands of gallons of fuel. Scientists monitored the impact on marine and coastal wildlife of the giant oil slick, estimated to be at least 130 miles (208 km) by 70 miles (112 km) in size. "It has already hit some of the fishing areas further out," said Leonard Ball, a resident of Biloxi, Mississippi, adding he feared damage to oyster bays and the fishing community. "There's already a lot of devastation as far as the fishermen go," he said. Ships entered the Mississippi River unhindered despite the spill, and ports on the central Gulf coast prepared cleaning stations for vessels that pass through the spill. No cleaning has been needed yet. Alabama Governor Bob Riley met with Coast Guard and BP officials on Wednesday about a plan to protect Mobile Bay, the ninth busiest US harbor, with a series of containment booms. A gateway would allow ships through. BP has capped one of three leaks in the ruptured well, but oil is still flowing at an unchanged 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons/795,000 litres) a day. The company has started drilling a relief well, but that could take two or three months to complete, making the containment dome the centerpiece of the short-term fight against the slick. SLOWLY LOWERED TO OCEAN FLOOR The dome will be slowly lowered to the sea floor by cable from a support vessel. It will be aimed at a leaking riser, or pipe, where most of the oil is coming out, BP said. Undersea robots known as ROVs, or remotely operated vehicles, will assist in the slow, tricky operation to lower the chamber and find the riser in the inky black waters. BP shares closed at 565 pence in London, up 0.4 percent, on Thursday as bargain hunting continued after weeks of declines wiped more than $32 billion from the company's market value. In New York, the company's American Depositary Receipts fell about 1.3 percent. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar planned to meet with BP officials in Houston on Thursday, and a bi-partisan Congressional delegation will visit the Gulf region on Friday. The attorneys-general of Gulf states threatened by the spill -- Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas -- sent a letter to President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder seeking to establish a group to prepare for any damage assessment initiatives, enforcement or litigation relating to the spill. "We must make every effort to ensure that our states and our citizens receive full restitution, damages, and costs from any and all parties responsible for this spill," the state officials wrote. A federal statute caps damage recoveries from oil spills at $75 million, if no negligence is established. Lawmakers on Capital Hill, though, are working on a measure to increase that to $10 billion. Florida statutes provide no cap on such recoveries. BP has said it will pay all "legitimate claims," but Alabama Attorney General Troy King called this a "lawyered up" answer and said the company should provide "plain-spoken" specifics. Driller Transocean Ltd, which operated the rig that collapsed, said the U.S. Justice Department asked it to preserve records related to the well's drilling and the deadly blast on its rig two weeks ago that killed 11 workers. Fallout from the disaster may already have started to change the trajectory of US offshore oil drilling. The Interior Department on Thursday postponed a comment period and canceled a series of public meetings planned this month on a proposal to sell oil and gas leases off the Virginia coastline. The move was cheered by environmentalists. "Our ability to prevent and contain spills has not kept pace with our ability to access oil below ocean waters," senior campaign director Jacqueline Savitz with the group Oceana said in a statem
