<TITLE> Vettel fastest in F1 practice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BARCELONA, May 7 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- German tyro Sebastian Vettel continued his habit of clocking fastest lap times as he and his Red Bull team-mate Australian Mark Webber dominated Friday afternoon's second free practice for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix. But both men were quick to say they felt wary of their team's major rivals, notably McLaren, and the unpredictable weather ahead of the first European race of the season. While Vettel said he was concerned about more rain and another wet race, Webber warned that McLaren, for whom defending champion and championship leader Jenson Button and fellow-Briton Lewis Hamilton were fastest in the morning, were holding back later in the day. Webber said: "I haven't seen a huge amount of what happened in that session, but, for sure, McLaren probably weren't showing everything." Webber said he was pleased with his and the Red Bull team's day of progress with no problems. He explained: "It was certainly a smooth one from both sides of the garage. That is a nice positive for the team. They have done a huge amount of work over the last few months, as all the teams have. "Particularly last night, the guys worked like hell. It was a very, very late night for our team and the boys deserved a smooth Friday. We have some stuff to go through tonight and hopefully will be well prepared for tomorrow." Vettel, who has taken three poles in four races this year, while Webber has one, said he was less worried about other teams and drivers than he was about facing another wet weekend. He said: "The weather! That is my biggest worry! I think it was quite chaotic especially at the last race, so we try to execute a clean Sunday and a clean race. It doesn't help when it starts to rain and stops raining every five minutes. "Even then you have to do a good job and last time we didn't succeed the way we wanted to, but here we will see what we can do..." He added that he did not want to spend time looking back and worrying about the Red Bull team's missed chances this season. But, he conceded: "On Saturdays, we were always looking good, but Sundays probably not so much. "But that is history and what, could or should have happened - it doesn't matter. We are looking forward to this race. I am trying to show everyone how strong we are, and let's see how we do. "For this race it is the same for everyone. You try to bring new parts and try to bring a step forward. We have some new parts and we need to confirm it is the step we think it is, and then we go from there." Vettel's caution was balanced out by Webber's pleasure in a job well done by the team. "It was a good day," he said. "We had a smooth run and it was nice to have a good P1 and P2 with no interruptions from the weather. The guys worked faultlessly in the garage - and the driver did a little bit of his work as well!" Vettel's failures to make the most of his poles in Melbourne and Shanghai resulted in two victories - thanks to excellent strategic decisions - for Button. Vettel said: "McLaren, Ferrari and Mercedes, all three teams look very strong. It has been very close. In some races we were stronger than others, but in other races it was much closer, then sometimes McLaren was strongest and fastest. "So it is tough, it is tight. We will make a step here, but it depends how big your step is compared to the others. If you find half a second then great, but if others find one second then it is rubbish." Vettel and Webber set the pace ahead of seven-time champion German Michael Schumacher who followed his impressive morning run by clocking the third-best time again for Mercedes in the afternoon. Local hero Spaniard Fernando Alonso of Ferrari was fourth ahead of Hamilton who was fifth for McLaren followed by Pole Robert Kubica of Renault and German Nico Rosberg, in the second Mercedes. Brazilian Felipe Massa wound up eighth quickest ahead in the second Ferrari ahead of Button and German Adrian Sutil, who completed the top ten for Force I
