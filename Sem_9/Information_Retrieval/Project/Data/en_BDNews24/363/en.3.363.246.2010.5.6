 NYON, Switzerland, May 6 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bayern Munich's French international playmaker Franck Ribery lost his appeal to UEFA against a three-match ban, European football's governing body said after a hearing here on Wednesday. Ribery is set to miss the Champions League final against Inter Milan on May 22 after the ban was imposed when he was sent off for a foul in the semi-final first leg clash with Lyon.

It in principle upheld the decision in the first instance, that is a three game ban," said Rummenigge. A stony-faced Ribery - who has experienced a difficult few weeks as he has also been linked to an underage prostitute in France - did not comment as he emerged from the basement meeting room at UEFA's lakeside headquarters. "He is of course disappointed and very sad, but as we said... we will appeal," Rummenigge explained. The French player was shown a straight red card for treading on Lopez's foot in the first-leg semi-final against Lyon last Wednesday, which Bayern won 1-0 in Munich. He then missed last week's 3-0 second-leg win while serving the first part of his
