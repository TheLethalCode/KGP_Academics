 Mymensingh, May 6 (bdnews24.com) The police arrested five men for pretending to be Bangladesh Television journalists, and seized a micro bus at Phulpur in Mymensingh on Wednesday night. The police arrested the fake journalists at around 11pm who were identified as Aminul Islam Mahin, Jewel Rana, Imran, Jashim Uddin Sarkar and the driver Dhanu Mia. SI Abdul Matin, a sub-inspector of the Phulpur Police Station said that the so called journalists were investigating different government projects of different areas of Phulpur since March 22 this year with video cameras pretending to be from Bangladesh Television. Matin said that they had been taking money from the project people assuring them that the reports on these projects would be telecast on BTV and had gone off to Dhaka after taking the money. The local upazila chairman and the project people suspected the men when they went back to Phulpur without video cameras on Wednesday, the police officer said. The police went to the spot and brought them to the Upazila Nirbahee Officer's office, talked to the UNO and finally arrested the frauds and took them to the police station, Matin added. The police officer said that Mustafizur Rahman, a local businessman related to a government project, filed a case against the five for cheating with the Phulpur Police Station. bd
