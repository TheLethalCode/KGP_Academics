 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Stock Exchange turnover touched an all-time high after topping Tk 18 billion on Monday. The key index, DGEN, however, slightly fell through the day. The daily transactions surged to Tk 18.66 billion on Monday, increasing by Tk 3 billion from the previous trading session. The previous turnover peak was recorded at Tk 16.99 billion on February 2 this year. The premier bourse's benchmark index fell by 13.48 points or 0.24 percent after slumping more than 37 points on Sunday. Brokerage house officials said media reports of the government agreeing to the market regulator's proposal of a uniform face value of Tk 10 had increased market participation. "Prices of banks and financial institutions started to gain from the morning which induced sell-offs in other sectors," said an official of Latif Securities. According to him, clients sold off holdings to buy shares of financial institutions, which are considered among the safest bets in the market. Monday's high was backed by a huge trade in shares of Beximco and EXIM Bank, whose turnover crossed the Tk 1 billion mark, as well as Titas Gas, Summit Power and South East Bank with each seeing share trades worth more than Tk 600. Of the traded 241 issues, 131 lost, 111 gained and two remained steady. Share prices of banks and financial institutions gained while the day turned out to be a bad one for mutual funds and insurers as most of them lost value. Most of the fuel and power shares lost except Titas Gas, while the pharmaceuticals sector which houses some of the market bigwigs ended on a mixed note. Market heavyweight Grameenphone, the lone telecoms issue, lost 4.97 percent. Banks and financial institutions dominated the top gainers board
