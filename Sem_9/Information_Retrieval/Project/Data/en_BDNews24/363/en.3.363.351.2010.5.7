 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  Class-three employees of Dhaka University have given authorities 15 days to start the construction work of a multi-storied building planned at Nilkhet, shelving a recent finance committee decision. They gave the ultimatum on May 2 at a meeting with the vice-chancellor after the university's finance committee on April 24 decided to send back the project proposal to the site selection committee for review. Employees said the review would prolong implementation of the project, taken four years back to mitigate their severe housing problem. "We'll go for movement unless the authorities cancel the finance committee decision and start the construction work by May 17," said DU Employees' Association general secretary Sanowar Hossain. He said only 10-15 percent of the around 1500 class-three employees are residing in university quarters at Nilkhet and Azimpur. Sanowar said, to mitigate their housing problem the authorities undertook the multi-storied building project in 2005 and the site selection committee on Dec 28, 2005 approved a plan to build it at Nilkhet. After the site selection committee approval, the syndicate finalised the project on Feb 5, 2006, he said. "Now the finance committee has irrationally decided to send the already finalised project again to the site selection committee." When asked, university treasurer Mizanur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the project was taken against no specific fund allocation. "At that time it was decided that the building would include a commercial portion and work of that portion would be completed first. Then the work of the other portion will be completed with the money collected from the commercial space users. "But the finance committee thinks there is no scope for commercial use of the building where it has been planned." That is why the finance committee has decided to sent it back to the site selection committee, he said. "It's not to prolong its implementation." DU vice-chancellor A A M S Arefin Siddique, however, said initiatives will be taken soon to resolve the problem. bd
