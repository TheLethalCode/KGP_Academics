 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court has sent Awami League lawmaker Sheikh Helal Uddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury to jail. They turned themselves in to the court and had their bail petition in a corruption case rejected on Sunday and were sent to prison around 6pm However, the couple were taken to Shikdar Medical College Hospital in Gulshan for medical attention in an ambulance around 8:15pm, said a high prisons official wishing to remain anonymous. Sheikh Helal is the first cousin of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) lawyer Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told bdnews24.com on Sunday night that Helal and his wife had surrendered to judge Mojammel Hossain of the Special Judges Court in a case for amassing wealth illegally and concealing related information. "The judge ordered them into prison after that." He also said that the court has rejected Helal's bail petition in another case of extortion where he was given a jail sentence of seven years. A special court, formed at the parliament compound during the tenure of the former military-backed interim government, on Feb 24, 2008, sentenced Helal to 13 years in prison and fined him Tk 50 lakh. He was given another two years in prison in case of failure to pay the fine. The same court sentenced Rupa Chowdhury, for assisting her husband in his corruption, to three years in prison, a fine of Tk 50,000 and a further year in jail for failure to pay. The couple were absconding then and the court order mentioned that the jail sentence would be counted from the day of their arrest or surrender. On Feb 12 of the same year, Helal was sentenced to jail for seven years in another extortion case. Helal, still 'absconding' at the time, contended in the national polls of 2008 and was elected from Bagerhat. He later surrendered to the High Court on Jan 11, 2009 and appealed for the cancellation of the case. He was awarded a three-month bail by the High Court bench of justices Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Mohammed Afzal Hossain on the next day. At the same time, the bench asked the government to show cause why the sentences should not be stayed and the case withdrawn. The same bench gave Rupa Chowdhury a two-month bail. A report published by Daily Amar Desh newspaper on Sunday said that the ACC did not progress with the matter. As a result, the case was left hanging in an incomplete state. bdnews24.c
