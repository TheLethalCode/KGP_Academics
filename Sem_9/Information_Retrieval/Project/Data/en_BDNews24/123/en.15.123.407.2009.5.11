 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)  Hosts GP-BCB National Cricket Academy were on the back foot on the second day in the second four-day game against the Sri Lanka Development squad in Chittagong on Monday. The hosts were 118-6 at stumps in the first innings, trailing by 305 runs after the visiting team posted a healthy total of 423 all out in 128.1 balls. Bangladesh still need another 155 runs with only four wickets in hand to avoid the follow-on on the third day at the Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. After losing the wicket of opener Nasiruddin Faruque (0), opener Jahirul Islam and one-down Sagir Hossain repaired the early setback adding 61 runs for the second wicket, but the latter with 31 gave a return-catch to Suroj Mahmud, who also removed Jahirul for 32 to make the hosts to 72-3 by 27.4 overs. The departure of Sagir and Jahurul triggered a collapse in the middle order and the Academy side were reduced to 84-6 by 37 overs before Farhad Hossain (13) and Arafat Salahuddin (18) denied further damage to remain unbeaten. The visitors had earlier resumed the day on 306-3 to finish 423 all out riding on a well-composed 51 from captain Muthumudalige Pushpakumara, whose innings watched six fours and one six. Overnight centurion Mahela Udawatta added only five runs to his overnight 122 before being removed by Robiul Islam. Off-spinner Saqline Sajib grabbed five wickets for 97 runs. bd
