<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  Nafis Iqbal followed his semi-final performance with another half-century in the final to help Brothers Union clinch the inaugural Port City Twenty20 Cricket League title with a six-wicket win over Dhaka Sports Club in Chittagong on Sunday. Brothers raced to 147-4 with 11 balls to spare after Dhaka Sports posted a fighting total of 146-9 in the stipulated 20 overs at the MA Aziz Stadium. Brothers' run chase began horribly as they slipped to 15-2 in just 4 overs with Sri Lankan opener Jehan Mubarak (4) and one-down Mehrab Hossain Jr (8) returning cheaply. Captain Nafis along with Tushar Imran tried to ease the pressure, but the latter fell short of the crease for six, leaving Brothers wobbling at 45-3 in 8.3. However, the scenario changed once Sri Lankan Chamara Kapugedara, batting at number five, took charge. He hammered 61 off just 32 balls that included three sixes and six fours before being the third victim of Pakistani Rashed Hanif, who returned 3-15 in his four-over quota. Nafis, who struck unbeaten 70 in the semis, remained unbeaten on 53 off 43 balls studded with six fours and a six while Abdur Razzak was five not out. Earlier, Dhaka Sport Club opted to bat and they posted a reasonable total thanks to a fifty by Ansiur Rahman, who made a 48-ball 56 after Dhaka Sports were 42-3 by five overs. Apart from Anisur's fifty, Pakistani opener Wasim Nayeem and middle-order batsman Ziaur Rahman, hero of the semi-final, scored 34 and 14 respectively to take Dhaka Sports near the 150-run mark. Abdur Razzak, Jehan Mubarak and Dollar Mahmud took two wickets each. bd
