 BRUSSELS, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UEFA will decide by the end of next week whether to open disciplinary proceedings against Chelsea or any of their players over their actions following the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. "We have got the match delegate and referee's reports, but are accumulating additional evidence and hope to make a decision on whether to start disciplinary proceedings by the end of next week," a UEFA spokesman said.

If found guilty the club or individual players could face hefty fines or suspensions for a number of games at the start of next season's competition, the spokesman said
