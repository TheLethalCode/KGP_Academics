 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The ambassadors of European Union member states have backed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's policy of evaluating the performance of ministers but said they will "observe" how the Awami League government delivers on its campaign promises. At a press conference marking the Europe Day on Thursday, European Commission mission head Stefan Frowein said the Awami League government could not perform faster than the caretaker government. He said the EU countries would inject more development aid into Bangladesh despite economic recession in Europe. "We have said to the government representatives and the prime minister that we are very supportive of what is intended by this government to implement. And the manifesto is the reference," Frowein told reporters at Hotel Sheraton. "This government says that the manifesto is reference and what is in the manifesto should be implemented. And the performance of the ministers will be evaluated comparing to what is in the manifesto as the objectives and what they deliver. "So, we are fully behind this idea and we will be observing further how this is going in practice," he said. He said four months were too little to judge a government. Swedish ambassador Britt F Hagstorm, Danish ambassador Einar H Jensen, German ambassador Frank Meyke and acting British high commissioner Duncan Norman had similar views on government's performance. Frowein said the caretaker having no parliamentary accountability performed faster than the elected government that must follow some procedure in its works. "So things are naturally slower," he said. "There is much on the plate. There have been starts, there have been certain things that did not start as fast as others. "But we're cautiously optimistic that certain things can be done. And we are very supportive of the objectives that are in the manifesto," he said. Dutch ambassador B M (Bea) Ten Tusscher, Italian ambassador Itala Occhi, French ambassador Charley Causeret and Spanish ambassador Arturo Perez Martinez also attended the press conference.
