 Rangpur, May 10 (bdnews24.com)After three Namaz-e-Janaza, one in Dhaka and two in Pirganj, Rangpur, Dr M A Wazed Miah was buried beside his parents' graves in Fatepur in Rangpur with state honour at around 3:15pm on Sunday. The qu'ul khwani of prime minister Sheikh Hasina's husband will be held at the prime minister's official residence next Thursday after the Asr prayer. Hasina accompanied by her sister Sheikh Rehana went to the grave of Dr Miah, a nuclear physicist, and paid their respects. The second janaza of Dr M A Wazed Miah was held at Pirganj High School grounds. His body was taken to Fatepur Primary School compound, where a third Janaza service was being held. The coffin was covered with a national flag before Janaza and a guard of honour was accorded. The bugles rendered a plaintive tune. Prior to the third janaza, Wazed's nephew Shameem, Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, minister Mosharraf Hossain and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad spoke to the assembled people. The body arrived at his ancestral home in Pirganj at 1pm for burial in the family graveyard after a second Namaz-e-Janaza. After the first Janaza of Dr Miah, husband of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, at the Baitul Mokarram in the morning, an air force helicopter carrying his body flew out of Dhaka after 11:30am. The prime minister had arrived in Pirganj by another helicopter at around 12:15pm and put up at her in-laws' house. A third helicopter carried 10 VIPs including former president Ershad, JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Howladar and Hasina's cousin Sheikh Helaluddin. Sajib Wazed Joy, the US-based son of Dr Miah, may return home early Monday, said AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam. Islam also said that their daughter Saima Wazed Putul, a resident of Canada, gave birth to a child last month and so cannot take the long journey back home at the moment.
