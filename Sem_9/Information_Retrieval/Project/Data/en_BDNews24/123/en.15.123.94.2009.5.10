 KATHMANDU, Sun May 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's President Ram Baran Yadav asked the Himalayan nation's parliament on Sunday to elect a new leader to replace Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda who resigned last week after failing to sack the army chief. The move came hours after a deadline for political parties to form a national unity government with the consensus of all parties, including the Maoists, expired.

"They have not even consulted us nor held any talks with us on how to run the parliamentary business," said Maoist spokesman Dinanath Sharma. The Maoists ended their conflict three years ago, locked up their arms in containers and confined fighters to U.N. monitored camps under the landmark deal.
