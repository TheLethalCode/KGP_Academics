 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)Gas crisis can be eased in industries to some extent through load management, the state-run gas exploration authority Petrobangla chairman said on Wednesday. Muktadir Ali said the gas pressure according to demand of the industries was not being maintained. "We can generate 1800 million cubic feet gas as demands are less on holidays and 1900 on working days." "So, it is possible to ease gas crisis to some extent through load management at various places," he said at a view-exchange meeting titled 'Gas Crisis at Various Industries' at BGMEA auditorium iin the capital. Another 100 million cubic feet gas will be produced every day from December and a further 200 million will be added by 2011. "So it will help resolve gas crisis to some extent." Electric meters, instead of manual ones, will be used to supply gas in industries, he told the meeting. Titas Gas (Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd) has already bought 600 meters with its own financing, he told reporters after the meeting. Petrobangla will buy a further 600 with the ADB support. These 1200 meters will be supplied within this current year and electric metres will be set up in 5000 industries, he said. Abdul Aziz Khan, managing director of Titas Gas, suggested setting up coal-fired industries in areas with no gas supply. The work on installation of compressors in places, including Ashuganj, was on-going to raise gas pressure across the country, he said. Business leaders asked for uninterrupted power supply to increase production in industries. The entrepreneurs demanded separate meters for broilers and captive power plants and cancellation of minimum gas bills for industries. Quazi Moniruzzaman, former president of Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters' Association, suggested that the government shut down fertiliser plants and import fertiliser to meet gas demand. Salman F Rahman, former FBCCI in the 1990s and the Awami League chief's private sector development adviser, said it needed to be seen how much money, gas can be saved by importing fertilisers, paying workers and shutting down industries. He urged the stakeholders to do research on the possible gains from the proposed measures. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy asked authorities not to snap gas lines in factories but warn them of any outstanding bills. The views-exchange meeting also decided to constitute a committee with stakeholders to devise ways to face gas crisis in the industries. Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Annisul Huq, Beximco Group chairman Sohel F Rahman, BKMEA president M Fazlul Hoque, BTMA president Abdul Hye Sarkar and officers of various gas distribution companies also attended the meeting. b
