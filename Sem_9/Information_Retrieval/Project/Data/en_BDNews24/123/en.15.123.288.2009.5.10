 Dhaka , May 10 (bdnews24.com)The chief justice has constituted a new High Court bench to hear on the writ petition challenging the legality of the government notice asking former prime minister Khaleda Zia to vacate her cantonment residence. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin on Sunday afternoon formed the bench composed of justices Md Anwarul Haq and Farah Mahbub after a third bench felt embarrassed to hear the petition earlier in the day. The bench of justices Jinat Ara and justice A K M Abdul Hakim feeling embarrassed sent the file to the chief justice "If the writ petition is placed in the High Court for hearing on Monday, we will pray for some more time" said T H Khan, Khaleda's laywer. "As a supplementary notice has been served regarding the house, a supplementary petition will be have to submitted to the court," he added Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said a supplementary notice had been served as earlier one was not elaborate. The first notice became obsolete after the issuance of the second, he added. Khaleda's lawyer, barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan said, a legal notice would be served to cancel the supplementary notice. On May 3, the bench of Hustices Ara and Hakim had admitted the petition and adjourned the hearing until Sunday on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier two other benches declined to hear the appeal. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui had felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal felt, also felt embarrassed. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house. In a modified notice on May 7, it asked the opposition BNP chief to leave the house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's first notice with a legal notice of her own on Apr 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981 during a military uprising, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision to cancel the lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdne
