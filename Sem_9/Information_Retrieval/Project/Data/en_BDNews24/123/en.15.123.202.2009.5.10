 MOSCOW, Sun May 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin warned in an interview published on Sunday that NATO military exercises in Georgia did not help efforts to rebuild Moscow's relations with the United States. Putin, speaking in an interview with Japanese media before a trip to Tokyo, said the NATO war games were a signal of support for the Georgian authorities which last week clashed with protesters demanding President Mikheil Saakashvili resign. When asked about Washington's efforts to reset relations with Moscow, Putin said: "As to the NATO military exercises in Georgia, this is of course a signal in the other direction. "We really hope that today's leaders of the United States will hit the pedal properly to put a brake on the negative trends in our ... ties and take the necessary steps to make sure they really gain new substance."

Moscow says the NATO war games send the wrong signal to Saakashvili, who has faced weeks of protests by domestic opponents demanding he resign for blundering into the war with Russia and crushing democratic freedoms. Saakashvili, who is reviled in Moscow, has refused to resign, though he faced a mutiny at a Georgian military base on the eve of the NATO exercises, which started on May 6. "Against all this they decide to hold military exercises. It cannot be seen as anything but support for the ruling regime," said Putin, according to a transcript of the interview supplied by the Russian government. "Even if you take the traditional approach of our Western partners -- the United States and Western Europe -- to democratic problems then no such standards are being adhered to today in Georgia," Putin said. "So why hold military exercises there which give such a clear signal of support to the ruling regime? We consider this is movement in the opposite direction." NATO says Russia was fully informed about the war games in advance and had been invited to partici
