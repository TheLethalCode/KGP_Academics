 LONDON, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ian Bell and Ryan Sidebottom have been recalled to the England squad for the second test against West Indies in Durham starting on Thursday. Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar was not included in the 13 named on Sunday, however, with Graeme Swann preferred again after his impressive performance with ball and bat in the first test at Lord's, which England won by 10 wickets. "Both Bell and Sidebottom have been in form in the early part of the season and have been a part of the England set up in recent years," national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Bell was dropped from his spot as number three batsman on the recent tour of the West Indies and with Ravi Bopara scoring a century in the first test at Lord's in that position it is unlikely Bell will go straight back into the team. Bowler Sidebottom returned home early from the Caribbean to undergo surgery on his Achilles tendon. "Sidebottom has recovered from surgery after the Caribbean tour and reports that he is now bowling pain free," Miller said. "The inclusion of Bell and Sidebottom in the squad gives the selectors, the coach and the captain several options going into this game. Panesar is unlucky but it was always highly unlikely that we would play two spinners at Chester-le-Street." Graham Onions retains his place in the squad after taking seven wickets on his test debut at Lord's but there is no place for his Durham team mate Steve Harmison. England squad: Andrew Strauss (captain), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad, Paul Collingwood, Alastair Cook, Graham Onions, Kevin Pietersen, Matthew Prior, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Sw
