 TEHRAN, Thu May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than 100 people have so far registered to contest Iran's June presidential election, including one vowing to ban soccer and another showing little knowledge about the Islamic state's disputed nuclear programme. "This is what we eat," the Siyasat-e Rouz newspaper quoted a 35-year-old presidential hopeful as saying when asked for his opinion about "yellow cake", or raw uranium, a key material in nuclear work. The daily only gave his first name, Nemat. He was among a motley crew of individuals who have flocked to the Interior Ministry since registration for the June 12 vote began on Tuesday, even though most of them face probable disqualification by a conservative clerical watchdog body. None of the main contenders -- including hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his moderate challenger Mirhossein Mousavi -- have so far officially signed up for the race. They have until Saturday to do so, after which candidates will be vetted by the Guardian Council, which has strict moral and other criteria, requiring them to be established statesmen. In the last vote in 2005, only about 10 were cleared. Another little-known man who registered said he would not tolerate any dissent in his government if he were elected president but he also held out the prospect of better ties with the West, which fears Iran is seeking to develop nuclear bombs. "Whoever resists me, I will sack from my cabinet. I will ban soccer and I will shake hands with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel," 57-year-old Abdolali told the Etemad-e Melli daily. He would also talk to arch foes the United States and Israel. The United States and Germany are among six major powers seeking to convince the Islamic Republic to halt sensitive uranium enrichment, which can have both peaceful and military uses. Tehran says it only aims to generate electricity. A third man seeking elected office said he had been banned from running before and vowed God's revenge if it happened again. "Since I was disqualified in 1988 the country has faced drought and earthquake problems," said the man whose first name was given as Rasul. Siyasat-e Rouz said some women also registered, even though the constitution says candidates must be "rejal", an Arabic word for men. Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani criticised media coverage of the registration process, the official IRNA news agency reported. "This harms the position of the president ... publishing news about the registration of those hopefuls who are not political and religious figures," IRNA quoted him as saying. Ahmadinejad, who says Iran will never back down in the nuclear dispute with the West, won the 2005 election on a pledge to share out Iran's oil wealth more fairly and to revive the values of the country's Islamic revolution three decades ago. But reformists and some conservatives have criticized him for his economic policies and accused him of isolating Iran with his fiery speeches against the
