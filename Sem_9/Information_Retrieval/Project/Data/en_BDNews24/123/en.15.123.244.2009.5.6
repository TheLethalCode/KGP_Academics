 NEW YORK , May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US first lady Michelle Obama told the US mission at the United Nations on Tuesday that millions of people around the world who seek a better life are counting on them. "Your work links the world to America and American ideals that are beacons of hope," Obama said in her first visit to New York City since her husband became president. Child soldiers, girls barred from studying, mothers without access to clean water and fathers who leave their families for years at a time to find jobs are among those who benefit from the work that the United States does through the United Nations, she said. "Social and economic development programs give millions of people hope and a chance at a brighter future, paving the way for a more peaceful and prosperous world for us all," she told some 150 staff workers at the mission. "In my role as first lady, what I hope to do is to work with you in some way, shape or form to help build that mission, and I am looking forward to joining you in this endeavor," she said. Her visit was part of a tour of US federal agencies around the country. "I've been to about 10 agencies and really trying to shine a bright light on all of the hard work done by our nation's employees," she said. Obama said her husband had received a letter from the son of US mission staff member Scott Turner. She read the letter out loud, in which Turner's son Jack, a first grader, urged Obama to move out of Washington. "Dear Mr. Obama -- Can you move to New York, because people like you in New York. I will help you come to New York. And people are doing bad stuff in New York. I will help you get the bad people and when I catch the bad people I will put them in jail. That's why I want you to move to New York. From Jack." To which the first lady replied, "I think we have identified the new future New York police commissioner. Jack is on the case.
