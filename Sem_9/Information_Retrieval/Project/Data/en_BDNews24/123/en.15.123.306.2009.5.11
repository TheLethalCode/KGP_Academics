<TITLE> Japan opposition in narrow pre-election lead: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party kept a razor-thin lead among voters ahead of an election, but more than two-thirds of the public questioned the party leader's decision to stay on after a scandal, a poll showed on Monday. Surveys before the opposition leader's scandal had shown the opposition Democratic Party with a clear lead, raising expectations they would end more than 50 years of nearly unbroken rule by Prime Minister Taro Aso's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the election this year. But a funding scandal that ensnared a close aide of Democrat leader Ichiro Ozawa has clouded the chances of a decisive election outcome that would break a parliamentary deadlock stalling policies to deal with a recession. In the poll by the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, 30 percent of respondents said they would vote for the Democrats in proportional representation districts for the next election, while 27 percent said they would vote for the LDP. The Democrats have vowed to reduce bureaucrats' meddling in policy-making, stress consumer and worker rights over corporate interests and adopt a diplomacy less subservient to security ally the United States
