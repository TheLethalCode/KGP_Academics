 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)No militants are there in the country, the chairman of Jatiya Party, the ruling Awami League's key ally, said on Saturday. The ministers and MPs were smearing the country by saying that there were militants, H M Ershad said at a views-exchange meeting in Chittagong Press Club in the evening. Earlier in the afternoon, the former president spoke at the district conference of Jatiya Women's Party at a community centre in the city. Replying to a reporters' query, he said the 'grand alliance'-led government succeeded in achieving food security in four months, but the law and order drastically fell. "Power situation is also very grave," he added. However, it is not possible for a government to do everything by the end of four months, he observed. Ershad declined comments on the legal battle between the BNP and the government over the fifth amendment to the constitution and the cantonment house of BNP chief Khaleda Zia on the grounds that the matters were sub judice. Asked whether BDR mutiny case was being covered up, he said time was needed to investigate such a big incident. The JP chief dismissed as 'rumours' a media reports that he was marrying again. He said there were conspiracies and propaganda against Jatiya Party in the past but it moved ahead despite "hundreds of setbacks."
