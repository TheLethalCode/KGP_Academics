 SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, Fri May 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The suspected leader of a Singapore radical Islamist group linked to the 2002 Bali bombings has been arrested in Malaysia, ending a manhunt of over a year for the city-state's most wanted man. Security experts said the capture of Mas Selamat Kastari was important as it showed cross-border co-operation and stopped the risk he could hook up with militants in Indonesia to plan attacks such as the one that killed over 200 in Bali in 2002. Malaysia's government said the arrest came through intelligence from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, and the possibility of extradition would depend on discussions with Singapore. Mas Selamat was captured in Malaysia's Johor state, just across a narrow strait from Singapore, intelligence sources told Singapore's Straits Times newspaper. "He was planning something, which allowed us to arrest him," said Malaysia's Home Minister Hishammuddin Hussein at a press conference. "We are becoming an expert on him. Hopefully, this time he will not escape us." Mas Selamat was the alleged mastermind of a plot to hijack a plane and crash it into Singapore's Changi Airport. His escape through the toilet window of a prison in Singapore in February 2008 sparked a huge manhunt and an Interpol alert. Officials have said Mas Selamat was a leader of the Singapore cell of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a pan-Asian radical Islamic group linked to al-Qaeda and responsible for several attacks across Southeast Asia, including the Bali bombings. Singapore is a strong U.S. ally and a major base for Western businesses and sees itself as a prime target in the region. Deputy prime minister Wong Kan Seng said after the escape that Mas Selamat could return to strike Singapore. "I don't think that Singapore has been at risk of an attack for a long time. What we were worried about was whether Kastari would join forces in Indonesia," said Sidney Jones, a JI expert at International Crisis Group in Jakarta. Singapore authorities have also accused him of planning truck bomb attacks at several sites across the island state, including the American Club and U.S. Embassy. He has not been formally charged with any crimes and was held under Singapore's Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without trial. The escape, in which Mas Selamat tricked guards while changing and fled without his trousers, was seen by some experts as highly embarrassing for Singapore, which prided itself on tight security. Singapore sacked or disciplined several officials but no ministers resigned, and the government came under fire from internet bloggers as army gurkhas combing forests and photo posters all over Singapore failed to unearth Mas Selamat. "Of course I feel safer now that Mas Selamat is captured," said Haniff, a driver who ferries people between Singapore and Johor. "I also hope that with his capture, the tight security measures at the immigration checkpoints can be gradually lif
