 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com) Former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain on Wednesday questioned the authority of the parliamentary standing committee headed by Fazle Rabbi to issue summons. Delwar, now opposition BNP secretary general said, told reporters at the party's central office in the capital that the committee in question had no jurisdiction to summon him.

The committee convened to investigate former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has now been deployed to look into the doings of the ex-deputy speaker and chief whip, which is not right. "Because the committee doesn't have the required authority to do that," he asserted. Trashing the graft charge pressed against him, Delwar said, "This has been a political moveill conceived and purposely done to ruin my political career and the image of my family." "In 2005, a section of the mass media had published baseless reports maligning me. They were so vindictive that they did not publish my protests." About Rabbi, the BNP secretary general said, "I know Fazle Rabbi very well. Instead of verifying the complaints raised against me, he is blindly accusing me himself." "How can the person who is pressing charges can assume the roles of investigator and judge too?" The committee convened to investigate the corruption charges brought against Sircar Tuesday decided to summon the former speaker, former deputy speaker and former chief whip of the eighth parliament also to defend themselves before the committee. During the tenure of the first parliamentary session of the ninth parliament, speaker Abdul Hamid convened the committee
