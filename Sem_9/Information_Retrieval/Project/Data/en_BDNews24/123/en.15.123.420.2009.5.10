<TITLE> Lawyer `optimistic' on US-Iranian reporter's case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Sun May 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Iranian court heard the appeal of US-born journalist Roxana Saberi against her eight-year jail sentence for espionage on Sunday and her lawyer said he was optimistic it would be fundamentally changed. Lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi said the appeals court had ended a one-day session and would issue its verdict in the coming days. Saberi was convicted by a lower court on April 18 of spying for the United States, Iran's arch-foe. He said he had asked for his 32-year-old client, who looked thin and tired when she entered the court room, to be released on bail but the court had yet to decide on the request. Paris-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders has said Saberi's conviction was a warning to foreign journalists working in Iran ahead of its presidential election in June. The case could complicate Washington's efforts toward reconciliation with Iran after three decades of mutual mistrust. "The court session was held under good conditions and me and my colleague ... were given adequate time to defend our client," Khorramshahi told reporters. Saberi had also been given "sufficient opportunity" to defend herself. "I'm hopeful and optimistic that there will be fundamental changes in the sentence," he said. The lawyer earlier said he expected it to be "substantially" reduced. Saberi's father Reza was not allowed in to follow the proceedings. Last week, he said she had ended a two-week hunger strike in Tehran's Evin jail and was "very weak." The judiciary denied she had refused food and said she was in good health. Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has said Saberi's case would be reviewed based on "human and Islamic kindness." PRESS FREEDOM "I hope the court will find my daughter innocent," Reza Saberi said outside the court building. The 68-year-old moved to the United States in the early 1970s but returned with his Japanese wife Akiko last month to follow their daughter's case. Saberi, a citizen of both the United States and Iran, was arrested in late January for working in the Islamic Republic after her press credentials had expired. She was later charged with espionage, a charge that can carry the death sentence. Wearing a chador, she smiled as she arrived at the court accompanied by two security guards. But the freelance journalist, who has worked for the BBC and US National Public Radio, appeared uncertain about what was taking place. "Is it today?" she asked, in apparent reference to the appeal session, which was closed to the public. The United States says the espionage charges against Saberi, a former Miss Dakota who moved to Iran six years ago, were baseless and has demanded her immediate release. Tehran, which does not recognize dual nationality, says Washington should respect the independence of Iran's judiciary. The two countries are locked in a dispute over nuclear work that the West fears is aimed at making weapons, an allegation that Iran denies. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders last month said seven journalists were imprisoned in Iran, which it said was ranked 166th out of 173 countries in its latest press freedom index. Iran denies Western allegations it is seeking to stifle dissenting voices. The government says it welcomes constructive criticism and upholds the principle of free sp
