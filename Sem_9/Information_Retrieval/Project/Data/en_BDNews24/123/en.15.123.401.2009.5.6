 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)  The GP-BCB national cricket academy suffered a crushing nine-wicket defeat to their Sri Lankan counterparts in the first four-day match with a day to go at the Bir Shrestha Shahid Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong on Wednesday. The Sri Lankan academy side reached 81-1 in 16.3 overs after the hosts set the visitors a meagre 79 runs to chase. Trailing by 129 runs in the first innings, the GP-BCB academy started their second innings on the wrong foot with openers Nasiruddin Faruque (7) and Imtiaz Hossain (26) returning to the dressing room cheaply. Faruque shouldered arms to a delivery from left arm pacer Isuru Udana, who has been called up in the Sri Lankan squad for the ICC World Twenty20, and was wrapped on the pads. Imtiaz made the same error of judgment against the left-arm spin of Pushpakumara and was caught plumb in front. Jahurul Islam (4), batting at number three, then showed a total lack of concentration by stepping out against Siriwardena and was stumped to leave the side tottering at 42-3. Shuvagoto Hom (40), playing his first-ever four-dayer, produced some resistance along with wicketkeeper Arman Hossain (33), but their efforts were not enough to take the match into the final day as the hosts were bundled out for 207. Earlier, the visitors having started their first innings on 373-8 ended up with 385 losing the remaining two wickets. The second and final four-day game begins on May 9 at the same venue. bd
