 LOS ANGELES, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dom DeLuise, the US comic actor who gained fame on television and in movies such as "Blazing Saddles" and "Smokey and the Bandit II," has died at age 75. DeLuise died on Monday night at a hospital in the Los Angeles community of Santa Monica, his agent Robert Malcolm said. "It's easy to mourn his death, but easier to remember a time when he made you laugh," DeLuise's family said in a statement issued by Malcolm. No cause of death was given, but Malcolm said DeLuise had health problems including high blood pressure and diabetes. In December 2008 the actor told TV show "Entertainment Tonight" that he had been fighting prostate cancer. "I'm still here. I'm 75 and here. I feel very blessed," he said. Dominick "Dom" DeLuise was born August 1, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York. He began his career in movies and on TV in the 1960s, and he gained widespread fame on the Dean Martin Show as "Dominick the Great," a magician whose act routinely went wrong. For a brief period in 1968, he was given his own TV program, "The Dom DeLuise Show," and he later proved to be appealing as a guest star in sketch comedy and other shows. "I loved him from the moment we met. Not only did we have the greatest time working together, but I never laughed so hard in my life as when we were together," Doris Day, who starred with DeLuise in the 1966 movie, "The Glass Bottom Boat," said in a statement. WORKED WITH BURT REYNOLDS In the 1970s, DeLuise became a regular actor in Mel Brooks' comedies. He appeared in the wildly popular Western spoof "Blazing Saddles," as well as "Silent Movie," "History of the World: Part 1," and "Robin Hood: Men in Tights." "Dom DeLuise was a big man in every way. He was big in size and created big laughter and joy, Brooks said in a statement. DeLuise also made films with Burt Reynolds, a major star at the time, including "The Cannonball Run" and its sequel "The Cannonball Run II." Reynolds told "Entertainment Tonight" that he "never heard him say an unkind word about anyone. I will miss him very much." In the 1980s and 1990s, DeLuise worked on a wide range of movies and TV shows such as "Beverly Hills 90210" and "3rd Rock from the Sun," and he hosted a version of "Candid Camera" from 1991 to 1992. His voice was used in animated programs such as "All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series." An avid cook, DeLuise wrote several cookbooks including "Eat This" and "Eat This Too!" In recent years, he appeared on the home improvement radio show "On the House with The Carey Brothers."
