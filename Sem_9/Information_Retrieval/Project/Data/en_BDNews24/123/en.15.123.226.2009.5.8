<TITLE> Common history can reconcile Russia, Georgia: Medvedev </TITLE>

 MOSCOW, Fri May 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Loyalty to a common historical heritage could help mend ties between ex-Soviet Georgia and Russia damaged by a brief war last August, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told Georgian World War Two veterans Friday. In a special message to the veterans, Medvedev recalled the Soviet Union's role during the war in defeating Nazi Germany, at a cost of almost 27 million military and civilian lives.

Medvedev has said Russia will never talk to Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili but would be interested in discussing ways to improve relations with any future government. "In spite of the fact that interstate relations between Russia and Georgia are now facing serious challenges, contacts between people and public organizations have not stopped," Medvedev said.
