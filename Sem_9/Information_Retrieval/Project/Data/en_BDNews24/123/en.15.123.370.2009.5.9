 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)Threats from Islamist militants from Malaysia on Thursday night to blow up the US embassy and three other missions in Dhaka have prompted the government to shore up security in diplomatic zone, police said. Dhaka city police chief AKM Shahidul Haque said on Friday the US embassy and UK, Australia and Canada high commissions had received the threat from 'Jemaah Islamiyah al-Qaeda'. It is believed to be a pan-Asian radical Islamic group linked to al-Qaeda responsible for several bomb attacks across Southeast Asia, including the Bali bombings in which 202 people were killed. Authorities deployed 200 police men, including plain-clothes, on top of regular 600 members in the sensitive Baridhara neighbourhood. Two additional patrol cars and different intelligence agencies were also working, he said. In the message, Jemaah Islamiyah, believed to have links with the Al Qaeda core group led by Osama bin Laden, asked them "to shut their activities within seven days and leave the country". Gulshan Zone deputy police commissioner AKM Hafiz Akter has been tasked to get into the basis of the organisation, Shahidul said. Police, however, have only managed to collect the faxed copies from the US embassies. Shahidul said the message demanded $100,000 from the missions through Western Union Money Transfer to fund the release of a forensic expert of the group, who is now in a Malaysian prison. bdnews2
