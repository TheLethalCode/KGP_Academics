 KABUL (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An economist serving as senior minister under Afghan President Hamid Karzai registered on Friday to stand against him, but several other leading figures believed to have contemplated bids decided to sit the election out. Friday was the final day to register for the country's second democratic presidential election, to be held on Aug 20. Electoral commission spokesman Noor Ahmad Noor said 42 candidates had signed up by the time the commission shut its doors, and another five still waiting outside would be allowed to submit documents after hours. But with the opposition failing to unite behind a single leader, Karzai seems to be in a strong position to stay in power. Senior Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala, who worked at the World Bank for 18 years and also once served as vice president under Karzai, became the third current or former member of Karzai's government to register to stand against him. Former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah and former finance minister Ashraf Ghani registered earlier this week. All three are urbane, fluent English-speakers and may have difficulty building enthusiastic support in the hinterland of a country that is 70 percent rural. Other high-profile figures thought to have been contemplating bids -- former Interior Minister Ali Ahmad Jalali, former finance minister Anwar ul-Haq Ahadi and the Afghan-born former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq and the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad -- failed to register by the deadline. Those three had yet to say who they would support but other leading opponents have already indicated they will back Karzai. Powerful regional governor Gul Agha Sherzai dropped out of the race last week apparently to back Karzai. Another opposition leader, Mohammad Qasim Fahim, quit Abdullah's National Front group to stand as one of Karzai's vice presidential nominees. Karzai, who has ruled Afghanistan since being installed in an internationally brokered agreement in 2001 and was re-elected in the country's first democratic presidential election in 2004, has acknowledged that his own popularity has waned somewhat. Violence in the country has worsened dramatically in the past two years despite the deployment of rising numbers of foreign troops to fight a worsening insurgency by Taliban militants. Many Afghans say Karzai's government is incompetent and corrupt. But none of Karzai's main opponents is seen as having the support of the rural south's large Pashtun tribes, a key to an election victory. Some Afghans view Karzai as a pawn of Washington. But the three challengers who have served in his government may have trouble exploiting this perception to campaign against him. The new U.S. administration of President Barack Obama was initially cold to Karzai, accusing him of tolerating weak government and corruption. But U.S. criticism has grown quieter in recent months, seen by some as a sign that Washington accepts Karzai is likely to win re-election comfortably.
