 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)Sajib Wazed Joy, elder son of Dr M A Wazed Miah who died on Saturday, is likely to fly in early on Sunday from the United States, a minister said. "Joy is trying to fly home as early as he can. He is most likely to reach home within the shortest possible time," communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told bdnews24.com in the evening. Miah, 66, prime minister Sheikh Hasina's husband and a nuclear physicist, died after prolonged illness at Square Hospital in Dhaka. Hossain also said Saima Wazed Putul, the daughter, is unlikely to come because of her illness. Putul is a Canadian immigrant. Her father-in-law overseas employment and expatriates welfare minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told bdnews24.com," Putul can't come right away because she is sick." Early this month, Joy arrived in Dhaka to see his ailing father for the last time. He was among the entourage of the prime minister during her tour to Saudi Arabia. He returned to the US after performing Umrah. bdnew
