 NEW YORK, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US private-sector job losses slowed much more than expected in April, hitting their lowest since November last year, according to a report by ADP Employer Services on Wednesday. ADP said private employers cut 491,000 jobs in April versus a revised 708,000 lost in March, originally reported as a loss of 742,000 jobs.

He cautioned, however, that it was too early to conclude that the job market had made a decisive turn, though April's improvement was apparent broadly throughout the report.
