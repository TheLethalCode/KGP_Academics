 MILAN, May 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Serie A ahead of the weekend matches (times GMT): Hernan Crespo is expected to make a rare start for Inter Milan at Chievo on Sunday (1300) because main striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is suspended. Crespo and fellow Argentine forward Julio Cruz have said they will probably leave Inter in the close season with media reports linking the champions with Genoa striker Diego Milito and Udinese's Fabio Quagliarella. Jose Mourinho's side can seal their fourth straight scudetto on Sunday if they beat Chievo and second-placed AC Milan lose at home to Juventus (1830). Alessandro Del Piero will make his 600th appearance for Juve if he plays against Milan. Under-pressure Juve coach Claudio Ranieri, who has been confirmed only until the end of the season, has defensive problems with Olof Mellberg suspended and others carrying knocks. Napoli striker Marcelo Zalayeta has returned to the club in time for Sunday's match at relegation candidates Lecce (1300), having been out of contact for two days. The Uruguayan has apologised for going missing and said he misinterpreted comments by coach Roberto Donadoni. AS Roma's outside chances of snatching a late Champions League berth will not be helped by left back John Arne Riise being suspended for the trip to Cagliari on Sunday (1300). Goalkeeper Doni, defender Cicinho and midfielder Alberto Aquilani are also long-term injury absentees. Genoa, a point behind fourth-placed Fiorentina, visit Atalanta on Sunday (1300) without suspended duo Thiago Motta and Matteo Ferrari. They face striker Sergio Floccari, who media reports have said will join Genoa in the close season if Milito goes to Inter. Fiorentina are still missing injured striker Adrian Mutu for Sunday's match at Catania (1300)
