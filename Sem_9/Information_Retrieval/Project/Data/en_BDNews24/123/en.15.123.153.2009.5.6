<TITLE> Syria alliance with Iran a force for stability: Assad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAMASCUS, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syria's President Bashar al-Assad defended its long-standing alliance with Iran on Tuesday and said a "strategic" relationship between the two countries contributed to Middle East stability. Syria has re-enforced its alliance with Iran in recent years after they came under pressure from the United States for suspected nuclear programs and providing backing for militant groups in the Middle East. "We have strategic ties ... which don't constitute an axis as some suggest, but serve the stability and strength of this region," said Assad, after meeting Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the Syrian capital. "Our duty is to strengthen these kinds of ties." The two countries, which are under different levels of US sanctions, support the Lebanese movement Hezbollah and the Palestinian movement Hamas, whose exiled leaders live in Syria. Hezbollah, the lynchpin of the relationship between Tehran and Damascus, is also the main opposition party contesting Lebanon's parliamentary elections next month. The two countries want to see the Shi'ite group fare well in the poll, which could further enhance their regional influence. The sustainability of their alliance, however, is under some doubt as Syria pushes for a resumption of peace negotiations with Israel and the United States talks to Damascus after boycotting Syria for several years. Ahmadinejad's trip comes two days before two senior US officials arrive in Damascus. The visit, the second since President Barack Obama was inaugurated in January, marks a further thaw in ties. IDEOLOGY The United States and Israel want to see Damascus distance itself from Tehran. US officials point to the different ideologies of the two countries, with Iran an Islamic republic and Syria's political system monopolized by the secular Baath Party since 1963. But Syrian officials have made it clear the political map of the region could only change once there are peace deals and Israel withdraws from occupied Arab land. Assad did not address the peace issue. He said he discussed with Ahmadinejad efforts to achieve a Palestinian unity government and national reconciliation in Iraq. "These people (the Palestinians) cannot remain steadfast and resist while there is political division on the Palestinian scene," he said. Assad said Syria backed Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy and the West could not accuse Tehran of having an illegal program without scrutinizing Israel, widely believed to have a formidable nuclear weapons arsenal amassed with Western help. "Those who accuse Iran must tell us what they are going to do about Israel's decades-long nuclear military program to have a modicum of credibility," he said. Referring to newfound US willingness to talk to Iran, Ahmadinejad said: "Those who have been pressuring Syria and Iran now need Syria and Iran and want to develop ties to solve and their issues in the region." Ahmadinejad also met separately in Damascus with Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, and Ramadan Shallah, who heads Islamic Jihad, a smaller Palestinian organization seen as having even closer ties with Tehran. Syria's alliance with Iran surfaced in the 1970s, when Damascus cultivated relationships with Shi'ite clerics in Lebanon who had links to Tehran. Syria, alone in the Arab world, backed Tehran during the 1980-1988 war between Iran and Iraq
