 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Lawyers for two top Jamaat leaders Tuesday petitioned for three cases to be dropped, saying the charges were false and politically motivated, and were meant to harass them. Both party ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami and secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed were facing charges of murder and graft. The cases are Paltan killings, Barapukuria coal mine graft case and GATCO graft case. Nizami is one of those accused in the Oct 2006 Paltan killings case. The other accused are Mojaheed, assistant secretary general Md. Kamaruzzaman, Makbul Ahmed, ATM Azaharul Islam, Md. Rafiqul Islam Khan, ATM Shirajul Haque, Shafiqul Islam Masud, Md. Hajidur Rahman and Shishir Monir. They are all senior leaders of the party and party's student wing. In the Barapukuria Coal Mine case, Nizami, a former industry minister in the 2001-06 BNP-led government, has been charged along with former prime minister Khaleda Zia, former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, former social welfare minister Mojaheed and 11 others. Nizami is also a co-accused in the GATCO case, the others being Khaleda, her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, and 21 others. They were charged with illegally awarding container-handling job at two depots in Dhaka and Chittagong to GATCO. The office of the Dhaka deputy commissioner said 1100 such petitions had been filed until Tuesday. Of them, more than 500 were sent to the public prosecutor. The public prosecutor commented on 95 cases until Tuesday. Officials say petitions for withdrawal of the so-called 'politically motivated' cases will be received until May 17 at the DC's office. bdnew
