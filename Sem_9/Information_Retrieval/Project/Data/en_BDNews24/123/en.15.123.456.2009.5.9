 Dhaka May 9 (bdnews24.com)The central bank chief believes the GDP will grow at 6 percent in the ongoing 2008-09 fiscal year despite the global economic downturn. "All crops, including rice, have seen a good harvest for the last few seasons," Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said to justify the optimism. He spoke to journalists about the economic growth after presenting a key-note speech at the national conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Bangladesh at Sonargaon Hotel in the city. The financial meltdown was yet to impact remittance inflow from the expatriates, one of the major benchmarks of economy, he said.. "Growth has also been maintained in the export sector. Considering all these factors, I believe the GDP growth will be six percent this time," said Rahman, a former development researcher who became governor on May 1. His predecessor Salehuddin Ahmed had also made a similar prediction about the economic growth. The GDP growth has been targeted at 6.5 percent in the current budget. Donor agencies, including the World Bank, IMF and ADB had predicted that Bangladesh would have less-than-forecast GDP growth in the current fiscal year because of the meltdown. Until Till now, main indices of the economy have been doing well, but nothing can be said about what will happen in 2009-10 fiscal year, the Bangladesh Bank chief said. The next budget should be designed keeping the recession in view. "Most employments are created in agriculture, small and medium enterprises and export-focused apparel industry." "That is why, we have to give special attention to these sectors," Rahman added. bd
