<TITLE> Upazila chairs get 'guideline' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)The government Tuesday unveiled a brief guideline stating the responsibilities and duties of newly-elected Upazila chairmen as well as the rules of business for the local council. A circular said the guideline was published as the formulation of a code of conduct was being delayed. The guideline says all activities of Upazila Parishads will have to be resolved in general or special meetings and that there must be one meeting every month. It says the local MP will have to be informed of the meeting agenda and deliberations. The guideline came in the wake of deep discontent among the elected local leaders over a recently passed law that made consultation with the MPs mandatory. The first meeting will be convened by Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) in consultation with the newly-elected chairman. The UNO will convene meetings in absence of UP chairman or his/her representative. Minutes of all meetings must be sent to the MPs, DCs and the local government division. If necessary, says the guideline, the chairmen may delegate their authority to the UNOs. Any matter needing the chair's approval will be placed before them by the UNOs-- a junior civil servant deputed to the local authority from the central government. Both chairman and the UNO will be signatories in matters of spending, but the chairman will be responsible for management and maintenance of all files. bdnews24.
