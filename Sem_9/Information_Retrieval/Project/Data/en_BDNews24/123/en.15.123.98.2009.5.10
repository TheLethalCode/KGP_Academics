 New Delhi, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Popular social networking site Facebook has launched an Indian interface that will help members in the region connect with peers in six different languages. "Do you speak Hindi, Punjabi, Bengali, Telugu, Tamil or Malayalam? Now you can use Facebook in any of these languages to connect with your Indian friends all over the world," a welcome message on the homepage greeted users on Friday. Members can now opt for any of the six languages through option tabs on the homepage. As of now Facebook does not allow transliteration or copying of English script into any another in online chats or messages. With the new feature, the fast-growing site with an active user base of over 200 million, expects to capture a burgeoning and tech-savvy Indian market. In addition to the six languages, more than 40 translations are available on the site. Most of India's young population are active users of social networking sites like Orkut and Facebook and often promote social causes through them.
