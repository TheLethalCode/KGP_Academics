<TITLE> Panel slams dismal Biman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com) A parliamentary watchdog has come down hard on the flag carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines for its poor operation. Biman earned over Tk 56 lakh in 2007 in Dhaka-Bangkok-Singapore route while it paid Tk 8 crore as landing fee to Thai authorities to run flights in that route, the parliamentary standing committee on civil aviation said at Wednesday's meeting. It expressed anger at the "forceful" retirement of the Biman officials in 2007 and recommended the reinstatement of the "skilled officials" from retrenched people. "We are frustrated and angry at the poor performance of Biman. There is nothing pleasant in Biman's report," Mosharraf Hossain, chairman of the committee, told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building. "Biman's management lacks patriotism," Moniuddin Khan Badal, a committee member, told bdnews24.com. He said Biman operated flights on many routes incurring huge losses. "In November 2007, it carried 955 passengers on 108 flights in Dhaka-Bangkok-Singapore route, averaging nine passengers on each flight. "It earned only Tk 56 lakh 36 thousand, but paid Tk 8 crore as landing charge to the Thai airport authorities in 2007," Badal said, reading out from Biman's official report. "Can anyone believe it? Why did they run it?" "This practice went on and on for years," he said. Hossain said the 2007-2008 military-installed caretaker government retired some 1955 Biman officials and employees in the name of voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) after it turned the airlines into a public limited company on July 23, 2007. "The committee has recommended reinstating the skilled officials who have been sent into retirement forcefully in the name of the VRS," said Mosharraf, a former civil aviation minister. The prime minister has sympathies for the retrenched Biman officials, he added. He categorised "skilled" as those not completing 25 years in service. "Those who passed 25 years can be sent into retirement," he said. The caretaker government in 2007 decided to reduce Biman's manpower to 3400 from 5355 through constituting a public limited company to make it profitable. Those who went into voluntary retirement got hefty amount of money in compensation. "They (the caretaker government) gave Tk 100 crore in compensation to those going into voluntary retirement. But later they appointed some of the retrenched officials and employees on contractual basis. Even they appointed some of them as permanent staff. "If Biman needed them, why did they retrench them in the first place giving huge financial benefits?" Badal asked. Mosharraf said the committee had decided to summon Abdul Momen, a former managing director of Biman, to know the causes of voluntary retirement scheme. Biman has counted over Tk 8000 crore in losses since it came into being in 1972. With 10 old aircraft and four leased planes, it operates flights on 18 international and three domestic routes. All governments earmarked corruption, huge fuel consumption, excess human resources, bad selection of routes as the main causes for the staggering loss. The standing committee also formed a three-member sub-committee, headed by Badal, to probe the alleged irregularities in allocating lands to the private entrepreneurs near Cox's Bazar sea beach. Committee member G M Quader, the civil aviation minister, Md Mujibul Haq, Md Mahbubur Rahman, Syed Mohsin Ali, Shafiqur Rahman Chowdhury, Md Faridul Haq Khan and Md Mezbahuddin Farhad also attended the meeting.
