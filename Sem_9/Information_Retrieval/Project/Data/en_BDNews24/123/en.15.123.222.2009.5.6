<TITLE> Govt to see why BRTA modernisation stalled: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)The government will investigate why the modernisation of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, initiated back in 1998 during the previous tenure of Awami League government, stalled, the communications minister said. BRTA chairman Kamrul Hasan told a meeting of communications ministry on Wednesday alleged that the modernisation process was hindered by the interference of the previous BNP-Jamaat coalition government's so-called alternate powerhouse Hawa Bhaban. Syed Abul Hossain, the minister, told reporters after the meeting that he had asked the BRTA to enlarge on the allegations in writing for the ministry to investigate them. Kamrul said the equipment including computers purchased for the modernisation had not been installed. In 2005, the Daffodil Computer started setting up computers at the BRTA centres but then abruptly withdrew, he added. They could not operate those computers as they did not have the 'source code', he said. Hossain said the government was mulling over ways to digitalise the service of the BRTA, but it would take long. He said the government planned to leave the BRTA centres barring those at Mirpur and Ikuria to private management, to introduce a positive competition between public and private managements. The BRTA chairman and the secretary to Roads and Highways Department will submit a report on the plan and a team will visit Singapore to witness such activities there, Hossain said. Asked about tentative time to complete the task, he said it might take more than three months. bd
