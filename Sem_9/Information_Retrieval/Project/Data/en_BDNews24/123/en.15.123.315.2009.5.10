 Dhaka May 9 (bdnews24.com)Saima Wazed Putul, the daughter of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, cannot come to see father Dr MA Wazed Miah for one last time because she and her newborn are sick, a family friend told bdnews24.com on Saturday. Nijam Uddin, friend of Khandaker Masrur Hossain, Putul's husband, said she had told him by phone that her newborn was also unwell. He said called her at around 8:30pm BdST. Putul, who lives in Toronto, Canada, gave birth to a baby girl late last month and has two school-going daughters and a 21-month old boy. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was scheduled to visit them late this month. Earlier, Putul's father-in-law, overseas employment and expatriates welfare minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, told bdnews24.com after coming out of Sudha Sadan, "Putul can't come right away because she is sick." Sajib Wazed Joy, the son, is likely to fly in early on Sunday from the United States, a minister said. "Joy is trying to fly home as early as he can. He is most likely to reach home within the shortest possible time," communications minister Syed Abul Hossain told bdnews24.com in the evening. Miah, 66, a nuclear physicist, died after prolonged illness at Square Hospital in Dhaka. Joy was among the entourage of the prime minister during her tour to Saudi Arabia. He returned to the US after performing Umrah. bdsnews24
