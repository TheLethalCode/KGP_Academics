 DURBAN, May 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Delhi Daredevils went top of the Indian Premier League (IPL) table after crushing the Kolkata Knight Riders by nine wickets on Tuesday. In the first game of a Durban double-header the Rajasthan Royals swept past the Kings XI Punjab by 78 runs largely due to a stand of 135 between Graeme Smith and Naman Ojha, the highest of the tournament. Chasing Kolkata's 154 for three, an unbeaten half-century from Gautam Gambhir powered Delhi to 157 for one with six balls to spare. The result leaves Kolkata bottom of the table with three points from nine games while Delhi hold a one-point lead over Chennai and Rajasthan with a game in hand. Delhi made a good start to their run chase as openers Gambhir and David Warner (36) put on 60 from 43 balls. Gambhir (71 not out) and Tillakaratne Dilshan (42 not out) then shared a second-wicket stand of 97. Kolkata's innings was based on a knock of 74 in 48 balls from South African wicketkeeper-batsman Morne van Wyk. Captain Brendon McCullum also hit 35 in 29 deliveries. Earlier, third-placed Rajasthan amassed 211 for four, the highest total in this season's IPL, before restricting Punjab to 133 for eight. Smith smashed 77 in 44 balls while fellow opener Ojha hammered 68 in 51 deliveries. Punjab then slumped to 39 for five in reply before Yuvraj Singh hit back with 48 in 37 balls. Seamer Amit Singh shone for the Royals, taking three for nine in four overs
