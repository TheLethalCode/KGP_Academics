 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  A group of cricket organisers under the banner of Dhaka Metropolis Clubs on Thursday demanded holding of 2011 ICC World Cup matches at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. "There are less than two years to go before the Cricket World Cup in Bangladesh but we are still not sure where the opening ceremony and the matches will be held," said Abid Hossain, Brothers Union executive committee member, at a press conference at a city hotel. After the ICC stripped Pakistan of the right to stage matches, Bangladesh along with India and Sri Lanka are scheduled to host the 2011 ICC World Cup and Bangladesh were allotted 8 matches including two quarter-finals. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Cricket Board has already proposed to stage the opening ceremony of the mega event in the BNS and hold matches at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium and at another venue, which is yet to be decided. Referring to the announcement of the sports minister, Abid said that the government wanted to stage the opening ceremony of the tournament at the BNS, but the minister was yet to announce where the matches will be held. "Not only the opening ceremony we also want to watch World Cup matches at the country's first Test venue Bangabandhu National Stadium," said Abid. The then BNP-led four-party alliance in March 2005 shifted cricket to Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium from the BNS, triggering bitter criticism among the cricketers as well as the organisers. Many thought that then government did it for political reasons. To hold cricket matches at the BNS, would be a massive project that involves digging up the Taka 10-crore athletic track. But more importantly it will affect football, which many believe is regaining its popularity through the activities of Kazi Salahuddin-led Bangladesh Football Federation. "We are not against any game and we are only demanding holding the World Cup matches and the government will decide about it," said Moshiur Rahman Tutul of Indira Road KC. After the conference, a memorandum was scheduled to be submitted to the sports minister. bd
