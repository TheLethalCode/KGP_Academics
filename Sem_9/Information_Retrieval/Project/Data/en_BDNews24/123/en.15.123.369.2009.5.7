<TITLE> Drogba likely to suffer ire of UEFA after berating ref </TITLE>

 LONDON, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea, and particularly striker Didier Drogba, are likely to be in big trouble with UEFA after chaotic scenes marred the end of Wednesday's Champions League semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. Andres Iniesta's stoppage-time equaliser for a 1-1 draw sent Barcelona through on the away goals rule and sent Drogba round the bend. Having been taken off injured after 72 minutes, the Ivorian stormed back onto the pitch after the final whistle and charged aggressively towards Norwegian referee Tom Henning Ovrebo. Gesticulating wildly as he complained about the penalties Chelsea felt they should have been awarded, Drogba was booked before being dragged away by stewards. He was not finished, however, returning for another go at the tunnel and even shrugging off the efforts of manager Guus Hiddink to calm him. With angry spectators throwing flags and other items at the celebrating Barcelona players and the technical area in total chaos in the final few minutes, Chelsea can expect an early knock on the door from UEFA's disciplinary committee. Hiddink, however, refused to condemn Drogba's histrionics. "I can fully understand his reaction," he said. "He was full of emotion and full of adrenalin but he was in control. If he went beyond that and started hitting he should go, but I fully understand his behaviour after the game and I will protect him.
