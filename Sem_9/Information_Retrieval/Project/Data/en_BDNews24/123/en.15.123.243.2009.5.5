<TITLE> Clocks to move an hour ahead to save power </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh is switching to daylight saving time, with clocks moving forward an hour possibly as early as from June 16 this year or next April to ensure maximum use of daylight to deal with crippling power crisis. An interministerial meeting provisionally decided to introduce the daylight saving system for an 'extra hour' of daylight, state minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku said on Tuesday after the meeting. The switch will remain in effect from June 16 to Oct 1 but if implemented the next year, it will come in force from April 1, he added. More meetings will further discuss the issue before a final decision is made, he added. Electricity supplies to homes, businesses and factories across Bangladesh have been cut for several hours a day over the past few months as the country grapples with a power deficit as much as 7000 MW, by some estimates. On Apr 5 he said the government wanted to introduce daylight saving because it was much easier to conserve 1MW power this way than it was to produce an extra 1MW. The matter was discussed with all official stakeholders and their opinion was solicited, said Tuku. An official of the Power Division, who attended the meeting, said they sought opinions from 18-19 ministries and divisions. Labour, planning, industry, foreign affairs, telecoms, information, shipping, law, civil aviation, tourism and education responded positively. Representatives of establishment, health, local government, and primary and public education ministries approved of the decision at the meeting, said the official who did not want to be named as he was not authorised to brief the media. He added those ministries have been asked to give their opinion in writing by Thursday. The Meteorological Department in its opinion said that the 9am-5pm office hours can be adjusted to 8am-4pm from Apr 1 to Sept 30. The University Grants Commission, however, said the issue needed to be given more thought before reaching a final decision. bdnews
