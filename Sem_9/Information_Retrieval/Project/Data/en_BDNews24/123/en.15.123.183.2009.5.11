 Dhaka, May 11 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to import five essentials through the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh to keep their prices under control in the upcoming Ramadan, the finance minister said on Monday. The cabinet committee on economic affairs relaxed public procurement rules to import edible oil, sugar, lentil, onion and peas directly through the government's trading arm, AMA Muhith told reporters after a cabinet meeting. The TCB from now would import commodities directly like the private entrepreneurs with easing of the rules for one one year without tender, the minister said. Muhith added that the public procurement rules would be amended. "A review is underway. There will be declaration in the upcoming budget on the matter." Commerce minister Faruq Khan, who also attended the meeting, said Bangladesh needed about 16 lakh tones of edible oil every year and the demand was met through import. It was not possible for the government to import such huge amount of oil now though it is importing a small amount, he said. "We have to encourage the private sector to fulfil the remaining demand," the minister said. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, planning minister AK Khandaker and expatriates' welfare and employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain were among those present at the meeting. bdne
