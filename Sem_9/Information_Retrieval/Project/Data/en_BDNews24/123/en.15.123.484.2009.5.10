 Bandarban, May 10 (bdnews24.com)Over 100 border guards, including a deputy assistant director of Rifles Battalion-10 in Bandarban, were sent to jail after police arrested them in BDR mutiny case. The mutiny that had taken place on Feb. 25 in BDR headquarters spread to various sectors and battalions in the country the following day. Rifles Battalion-10 of Baliapara was also among the places where the border guards had mutinied. "They were arrested in a case filed by the officer in charge of Thanchi Police Station," Mohammad Shamsuddin, superintendent of police of Bandarban, told bdnews24.com. The 108 arrestees were charged with mutiny and looting armoury and assaulting army officers, he said. He, however, would not say how many of the border guards detained were facing charges. "Those who have been primarily proved to have been involved with the mutiny only face cases," he added. Thanchi police chief Wahidul Haque had filed the case as part of the government's move to file cases in 37 districts, he also said. The arrested BDR men were brought to Bandarban Sadar in army and police escort in the afternoon before they were sent to jail. Army officer major Rabbi told journalists in front of the gate of the district jail that they had been held on the basis of specific charges. Of them, one is deputy assistant director. He, however, declined to go into details in the interest of investigation. The BDR members, who were arrested in the morning, had been kept under tight surveillance, Rabbi added. The carnage at the BDR headquarters in Dhaka left 60 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, killed. bdnews2
