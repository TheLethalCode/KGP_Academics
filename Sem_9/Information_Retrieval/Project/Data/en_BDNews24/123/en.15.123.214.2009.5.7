 NEW DELHI, Thu May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "Rann", a new Bollywood film, delves into the highly competitive world of television news reporting in India, putting the spotlight on the media industry's insatiable appetite for advertisers and viewers.

The 47-year-old filmmaker, an acknowledged Bollywood master at making gangster movies, is no stranger to controversy.
