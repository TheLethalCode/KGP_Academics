 CONAKRY, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guinean security forces fired on rioters in the capital Conakry Saturday, wounding at least two people, in the first major public disorder since a military junta seized power in December, a police source said. A police station and several police vehicles were attacked in the riot which was sparked by an armed robbery on a local shop by thieves dressed in military uniform, a senior police official who declined to be identified told Reuters. At least two people were injured when security forces fired at the crowd, the sources said. Witnesses said several were wounded. "The local population came out on to the streets this morning when they found out what had happened," the official said about the overnight robbery in which thieves made off with two safes. "The people were joined by trouble-makers and they violently attacked a police station and some police cars." Captain Moussa Dadis Camara came to power in a bloodless December coup following the death of former President Lansana Conte. He is battling to maintain stability in the world's top bauxite exporter. Popular anger at his junta has risen after reports of human rights abuses by Guinean soldiers, including accusations of robbery, extortion and rape by witnesses cited in a Human Rights Watch report last month. Analysts say stability could ultimately hinge on Camara keeping his promise to hold elections in December
