 JUYUAN, China, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A year after Juyuan Middle School came crashing down in China's May 12 earthquake, parents wrestle with grief, protests, marriage breakups and anger that defies government calls to put the past behind. Junior Secondary Year 3, Class 5, at Juyuan was settling down to a lesson when the quake convulsed southwest Sichuan province, tearing the main building into concrete slabs that killed up to 60 or more of its nearly 70 students, said parents. On the anniversary of the quake, the emotional aftershocks still grip the bereaved parents of class 3(5) students, 30 of whom spoke to Reuters. Many said the government had compounded their bitterness by curtailing collective mourning. Some parents said they want to defy official warnings and grieve together at the razed site of the school on Tuesday. "We just want to remember our children and what happened. But we can't even do that. So how can we put this behind us?" said Cai Song, one of the parents who spoke by telephone or in face-to-face interviews away from watchful police and officials around the town. The Chinese government recently sought to end public disquiet about thousands of children killed in the quake, issuing official fatality numbers and vows of safer schools. But interviews with parents in Juyuan, where most said about 450 children died at the middle school, showed the deaths remain a wound likely to fester long across the region. Some parents continue to protest against the collapse of the school building, claiming it and many others were blighted by corruption that bred shoddy construction. Some have already given birth to children they hope will fill the void left in their lives. Others have had miscarriages. Some are mired in despair, their emotions or marriages broken by the loss of children whose futures made sacrifices worthwhile. "I don't care any more. Whatever we say does no good," said Lin Changzhen, whose daughter died in the class. "I feel I have no future, nothing." Lin said she gave away the 60,000 yuan ($8,800) that the government has given each bereaved family of a student here. "Many people said I was mad, but I couldn't touch that money," she said. "It's dirty." LIFETIME OF EXPECTATIONS Juyuan lies off the highway between the provincial capital Chengdu and the smaller city of Dujiangyan, and its ragged rows of farms and workshops are the kind of place where the children of farmers and small traders dreamed of a better future. Class 3(5) on the building's second floor cradled such hopes. Parents said its students yearned to reach senior high school, maybe even university, escaping the rice and wheat fields to become doctors, singers and entrepreneurs. Anything but farmers. Parents gave varying estimates of the children in the class, but most said about 68 or so were packed into the room, squeezed into desks designed for when children were poorer and smaller. "It looked like a crowded plane," said Dong Tianqun, a mother whose daughter, Dong Yang, died in the classroom. Many of the 14- and 15-year-olds had bedrooms decorated with posters of pop stars. To parents' alarm, some were also trying out fashions and rebel attitudes from the nearby big city. But the teenagers also carried the burden of parental hopes. Nearly all were their parents' only child, the limit for most families under Chinese population control policies. In the countryside, as well, state-backed old-age care and pensions are rudimentary, and traditional expectations that children will support their parents run especially deep. So in Juyuan and other quake-hit areas, the deaths tore at the conviction that parents should sacrifice much for their children's futures to have that loyalty returned in later life. Here and elsewhere, too, parents were enraged that schools fell, while apartments and government offices stayed intact. The fury has stoked protests and petitions blaming corruption for weakened schools, with builders paying off officials so they could skimp on materials and skirt standards. When one Juyuan builder who parents accused of shoddy work celebrated his birthday, about 50 sent him a wreath as tall as a man, festooned with the names of dead children and white flowers, said Dong Tianqun. White is the Chinese colour of mourning. "He said, 'I'd like to take responsibility, but the government won't let me. It's not just my head that would roll'," said Dong, wearing red lipstick and bright new clothes she said reminded her to stay strong. But those who protest face detention and neighbours are paid 50 yuan ($7) a day to report on them at sensitive times, said several parents. China's ruling Communist Party has long sought to turn citizens' memories away from sensitive and contentious memories to brighter hopes, and the quake is no exception. Last week, a Sichuan official said 5,335 school students died in the quake, lower than many critics have claimed. But parents said what they wanted most was what the government has not given -- an open reckoning with claims that corruption lay behind some of the toppled schools. "We don't necessarily want compensation or trials, but we want a fair, just answer," said Zheng Chenglong, whose son Zheng Jiajie died in the class. He was not hopeful. For some, however, the weight of grief is unlikely to lift whatever the government does. Chen Lin, a farmer whose daughter, Chen Zijun, died, said the woman he married after the quake fled a month ago, afraid of his temper, and called last week to demand a divorce. Chen divorced the mother of his daughter several years ago. "She just left me a letter saying that she was sorry for being unable to have a baby, and that I was bad to her, and she disappeared," Chen Lin said, slumped next to a bedroom still keeping his daughter's things
