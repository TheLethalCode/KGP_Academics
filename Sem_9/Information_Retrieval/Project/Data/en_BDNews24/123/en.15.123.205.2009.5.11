 MILAN, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With Inter Milan a win away from the Serie A title, talk after AC Milan's 1-1 draw with Juventus on Sunday inevitably focused on the futures of coaches Carlo Ancelotti and Claudio Ranieri. Inter were also held, 2-2 at Chievo, but with a seven-point lead and three games left their fourth successive scudetto is all but sealed. Ancelotti, who has a year left on his Milan contract, has been continually linked with Chelsea for next season despite his denials and club bosses saying they would like him to stay.

"A coach is used to criticism and he must accept it." Forward Alessandro Del Piero only came on as a late substitute to rack up his 600th Juve appearance. Ranieri denied speculation the pair had fallen out. "At the moment I look most at physical fitness. I have seen the captain a bit under par," he said. Ranieri added that he had been consulted on plans for next season with Juve poised to announce the signings of Werder Bremen's Diego and Fabio Cannavaro from Real Mad
