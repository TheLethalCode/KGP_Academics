 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)Warid Telecom has set its sight on tripling its subscribers in the next three years, the mobile-phone operators said on Sunday. Chief executive Muneer Farooqui said at a media conference at Hotel Sheraton in celebration of the second anniversary of its operations in Bangladesh that despite the global financial downturn they were investing to optimise technical network to provide optimal coverage. He pointed out that Tk Tk 800 tax on for every SIM is slowing down the growth of the industry. "Under the prevailing tight economic conditions, such taxes act as an impediment to ensuring financial viability of our company." "Digital Bangladesh', the ruling Awami League's election pledge, is an important part of Warid's business vision, he added. He also announced 50 percent discount on all Warid to Warid voice and non-voice services for two days. Farooqui handed over special gifts to top 22 prepaid and as many post-paid customers in a separate function. Warid Telecom, a subsidiary of UAE-based Abu Dhabi Group, launched its commercial operation in Bangladesh in May 2007 as the sixth mobile-phone operator. The company presently boasts around 2.5 million active subscribers. Since the launch, Warid has invested around $ 600 million to build a network based on next generation network technology. It has deployed over 1700 base stations in all 64 districts and has over 200 international roaming partners connecting Warid and its customers to more than 115 countries. At the beginning of the press conference, the management observed one minute's silence to condole the death of nuclear scientist Dr. M A Wazed Miah, husband of prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The press conference was also attended by Warid's chief financial officer Amyn Merchant, general manager, government and operators relations, Ashraful H Chowdhury, chief commercial officer Marius M Voinea, acting chief technical officer Saad Ahmed and general manager, logistics, retired brigadier general Ismat Ahmed Chowdhu
