<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)Former caretaker government adviser Akbar Ali Khan has suggested the government reset diesel price in line with the global market and increase allocation for infrastructure by reducing spending on unproductive sector in the upcoming budget. "The government should consider it with priority to reset the price of diesel in the budget," he told a roundtable on national budget 2009-10 organised by Association for Law Research and Human Rights on Saturday at National Press Club. "Cutting fertiliser price only is not enough for the development of agriculture; the price of diesel should also be reduced for irrigation." Akbar also emphasised administrative amendment and decentralisation for a dynamic public administration. "The administration will not be accelerated or efficient without its decentralisation. We cannot get expected outcome from them without it." The government should pay attention to generate employment to implement its election pledges, the former adviser said. He was unhappy that there was no constructive discussion in parliament on budget. "There is no discussion on budget as the MPs do not have the right. They only approve of the budget as a rubber stamp." He said the current parliament would also be like the previous ones; after the declaration of the budget the ruing party would say it was a public-focused budget, while the opposition would say the opposite. The MPs were more concerned about Upazila budget rather than the national budget, Akbar said. Among others journalist Motiur Rahman Chowdhury, United International University teacher Mohammad Musa, Bangladesh Fertiliser Association vice chairman Shahjahan Hossain, City Bank deputy director general DH Chowdhury spoke. b
