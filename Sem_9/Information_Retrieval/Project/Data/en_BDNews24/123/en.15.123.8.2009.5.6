 BEIJING, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it was "concerned" after a standoff in the Yellow Sea between a US Navy surveillance ship and two Chinese fishing vessels, saying the US vessel was in contravention of international laws. The incident, the fifth of its kind in two months, occurred last Friday in international waters about 170 miles from the Chinese mainland when the fishing vessels approached the USNS Victorious, US defense officials said. The Chinese vessels came within 30 yards (meters) of the Victorious at one point, they said. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said in a statement the ship was operating in China's exclusive economic zone without permission and had not respected Chinese or international rules and laws. "We express our concern about this and demand the US side take effective measures to ensure a similar incident does not happen again," Ma said in a brief statement posted on the ministry's website (www.mfa.gov.cn). The Pentagon, which accused five Chinese fishing vessels of harassing another US surveillance ship in the South China Sea in March, cited the incident as an example of unsafe Chinese seamanship. The Victorious, a 3,384-ton (3,069-tonne) ocean surveillance ship designed for anti-submarine warfare and underwater mapping, was conducting what the Pentagon called routine operations in the waters between China and the Korean peninsula when the two fishing vessels appeared. The Victorious operates under the US Navy's Military Sealift Command with a crew of 24 private contractors and eight military personnel, according to a Navy website. The Pentagon said the intentions of the Chinese fishing vessels remained unknown. The Victorious sounded an alarm and turned on its fire hoses to ward off the vessels. But they did not withdraw until a Chinese military ship, identified by the Pentagon as WAGOR 17, arrived in response to the American assistance call and shined a light on the fishing vessels. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement made no mention of the Chinese naval ship. The Pentagon in March accused Chinese vessels of harassing the ocean surveillance ship USNS Impeccable in the South China Sea, about 75 miles south of Hainan Island, the reported site of a Chinese submarine base. At the time, US officials lodged a protest with Beijing and said Chinese actions in the region were becoming increasingly aggressive. US Defense Chief Robert Gates later played down the incident by saying he hoped the problem could be addressed through diplomatic excha
