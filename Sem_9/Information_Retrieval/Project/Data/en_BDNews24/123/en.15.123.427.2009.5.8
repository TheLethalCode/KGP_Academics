<TEXT>
 MADRID, May 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches (times GMT): Real Madrid will carry on battling to defend their title despite last week's 6-2 humbling by visiting Barcelona that put the Champions League finalists seven points clear with four matches left, midfielder Fernando Gago said. "Last Saturday's match was ugly and things are more complicated for us but it's mathematically still possible and we have to keep fighting," he told the club's website (www.realmadrid.com). Pep Guardiola's Barca, still coming to terms with Wednesday's stunning win over Chelsea, could secure the first of three possible titles if Real lose or draw at Valencia on Saturday (2000) and they beat visiting Villarreal on Sunday (1700). Andres Iniesta's dramatic late strike at Stamford Bridge gave them an away-goal victory that put them in the Champions League final on May 27 and they play the King's Cup final against Athletic Bilbao in Valencia next Wednesday. Sevilla midfielder Adriano Correia said Inter Milan had shown interest in signing him but he was happy at the Andalusian club, who are in third place on 60 points, four ahead of fourth-placed Valencia and 18 behind Real. "Whether I stay or go depends on my agent and the club but I really am happy in Seville," the Brazilian told the club's website (www.sevillafc.es). "I have a contract until 2014 and I am delighted with that." Sevilla host in-form Real Mallorca on Saturday (1800). Valencia striker David Villa said it was vital for the club to take three points at home to Real to help them secure the lucrative fourth Champions League spot. The club are one point ahead of Atletico Madrid and Villarreal and three in front of Deportivo Coruna. "Clearly we are playing one of the strongest sides in the league but the prize is three points," Spain international Villa, who has 25 league goals this season, said on the club's website (www.valenciacf.com). Villarreal striker Joseba Llorente said it was a good time for the sixth-placed side to be playing Barca as they were bound to be distracted by their exploits in the Champions League and next week's King's Cup final. "The Barcelona players will be very tense and worn out," he told the club's website (www.villarrealcf.es). "We can take advantage of the situation." Atletico Madrid are in fifth with the same number of points as Villarreal (55) but a much healthier goal difference and host Espanyol on Sunday (1900). Winger Simao Sabrosa said he was sure the players would get a better reception this time from their disgruntled fans. "We have lost a lot of points at home and now is the time to do the talking on the pitch," he said on the club's website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). Relegation-threatened Getafe host fellow strugglers Osasuna on Sunday (1500) and defender David Cortes urged the Madrid-based club's fans to get behind the players. "We have to give our all and I expect the same from the fans at this crucial moment for Getafe," he told the club's website (www.getafecf.com)
