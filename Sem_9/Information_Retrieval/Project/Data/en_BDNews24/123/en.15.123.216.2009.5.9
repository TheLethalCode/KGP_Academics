 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  B. League champions Abahani are all set to host the fifth edition of the AFC President's Cup that gets underway on May 12 with Turkmenistan's FC Ashgabat, Sri Lanka Army and Abahani fighting it out. All the matches will be held at the Bangabandhu National Stadium with state-owned Bangladesh Television telecasting them live from the venue. As many as 11 clubs from the third-tier nations of Asia, divided into three groups, will play the league-basis matches and the group champions along with the best runners-up in three groups will qualify for the semi-finals. "Abahani have been granted responsibility to host the Group B matches of the AFC President's Cup following the recommendation of the Bangladesh Football Federation and we have taken the necessary steps to make the meet a success," Abahani chairman Salman F Rahman said at a press conference at the club premises on Saturday. Abahani directors Kazi Nabil Ahmed and Mominuddin Ahmed were among others present on the occasion. "It is a great honour for us to host this international competition under the direct supervision of the AFC and we promise that Abahani will try their best to play a good brand of football to impress the soccer millions of Bangladesh," said Rahman. Sri Lanka Army were the first time to arrive Dhaka on Saturday and FC Ashgabat are due in the capital on Sunday. Besides, the match officials have also started to reach the city. Abahani will be given $45,000 to host the six-day meet while only the visiting two teams will also get $15,000 as travel subsidy from the Asian football governing body. "We have made a budget to cover the expenses of the event and hope to manage it properly," said Rahman adding that some companies had assured them to buy the billboards, which would be set up outside the playing area. Abahani also decided to publish a souvenir to commemorate the event. They also revealed the ticket prices with the VIP tickets for Tk 50, western galleries for Tk 20 and eastern galleries for Tk 10. There will be free entrance for the school students with identity cards. It is the second time Abahani are competing in the international club-level tournament organised by the AFC after they finished third in their group in the previous edition. Abahani began with a miserable 4-0 defeat to Nepal Police, went 2-1 down to two-time champions Regar Tadaz of Tajikistan before ending the campaign with a 1-0 win over Pakistan WAPDA. "Abahani are participating in this competition with a full strength squad and will try to play a good brand of football," said the club chairman. Abahani manager Sattyajit Das Rupu, who is interim coach following the illness of regular Amoles Sen, briefed reporters about Abahani's preparation. He said that they had started the camp on April 7, 10 days after the Citycell Super Cup final and their national star players Jahid Hasan Emily, Wali Faisal, M Sujan, Mamunul Islam, Jahed Parvez Chowdhury and goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya joined the camp on April 1. He also said that they had chosen two out of their three foreign players, who played in the B. League as well as the Super Cup, as per regulation of the tournament. Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim will be up front with fit-again Jahid Hasan Emily, who had played in the AFC Challenge Cup as a substitute after recovering from his muscle cramp, but this time Emily is expected to play a full 90-minute game. Besides, Ibrahim's compatriot Samad Yousuf will protect the backline along with Wali Faisal, Nazrul Islam, M Sujan and Ibnul Siraji. Nigerian Emeka Christina, who had struck 17 goals in the B. League, was not considered as the Abahani manager thought that the local players were good enough to control the midfield that is comprised of Mamunul Islam, Abul Hossain, Prantos Kumar, Arif Khan Joy. bd
