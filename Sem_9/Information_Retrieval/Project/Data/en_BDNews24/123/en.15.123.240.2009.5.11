 MILAN, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan will retain the Serie A title with a home win over Siena next weekend after second-placed AC Milan drew 1-1 with battling Juventus on Sunday. Jose Mourinho's Inter were also held, 2-2 at Chievo, but kept their seven-point lead with three games remaining. Milan midfielder Clarence Seedorf opened the scoring at an electric San Siro when he tapped in Massimo Ambrosini's scuffed effort following a quick break after 57 minutes. Juve, whose poor recent run has left coach Claudio Ranieri clinging to his job, responded quickly through Vincenzo Iaquinta's diving header from a Mauro Camoranesi cross. The visitors had the better chances in the first half with Milan's Paolo Maldini, making his final appearance against Juve before retiring, needing to be at his best. His central defensive partner Giuseppe Favalli was sent off for two bookings late on. Inter striker Hernan Crespo, making a rare start with Zlatan Ibrahimovic suspended, gave his side the lead after three minutes in Verona but Michele Marcolini hit back with a superb 25-metre strike midway through the first half. FIORENTINA BOOSTED An equally well-struck goal from Mario Balotelli put the champions back in front in the second period only for Luciano, a former Inter player, to volley in at the far post. "I dont like this result," Mourinho told Sky television. "Chievo played well but when we were 2-1 ahead we should have had the capacity to defend better." Inter would have secured their fourth straight scudetto if they had won and Milan lost. The point meant Chievo moved six clear of the drop zone where little changed after fourth-bottom Torino drew 1-1 at home with third-bottom Bologna and Lecce were held 1-1 by Napoli. Fiorentina strengthened their grip on the fourth Champions League spot with a 2-0 win at Catania, Stevan Jovetic and Luciano Zauri scoring either side of the break. Genoa, in fifth, slipped three points behind after drawing 1-1 at Atalanta while sixth-placed AS Roma's Champions League hopes ended after a fiery 2-2 draw at Cagliari Roma, whose coach Luciano Spalletti has been criticised by fans, have a two-point advantage over Palermo in the race for what is likely to be the final Europa League berth via Seri
