<TITLE> Pope to visit mosque in Jordan, address Muslims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AMMAN, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict makes his second visit to a mosque on Saturday in another bid to wipe away the residual bitterness in the Muslim world over a speech in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor who linked Islam to violence. Benedict, who began his first trip to the Middle East on Friday, will visit the King Hussein Bin Talal mosque and address Muslim religious leaders, the diplomatic corps and Jordanian intellectuals. Prince Ghazi Bin Talal, a cousin of Jordanian King Abdullah who is a leading figure in dialogue between Christians and Muslims, will address the pope. Ghazi is one of the principal signatories of the Muslim manifesto, known as "A Common Word", which called for dialogue based on shared principles of love of God and neighbour. The Common Word project, started in 2007 by some 140 Muslim scholars, says Christianity and Islam share two common core values -- love of God and love of neighbour. The group says discussions on this among experts can help defuse tensions between the faiths. Benedict's trip is taking place in the long shadow of his Regensburg speech in 2006, in which he quoted a Byzantine emperor as saying Islam was violent and irrational. The pope visited a mosque in Turkey in 2006. The Regensburg speech still rankles in the Islamic world and Jordanian Islamist leaders have denounced the visit, saying he should apologise for it first. Benedict is at pains to put the speech, which he says was misinterpreted, behind him, and the mosque visit will give him yet another chance. RESPECT FOR MUSLIMS "My visit to Jordan gives me a welcome opportunity to speak of my deep respect for the Muslim community," Benedict said in his arrival address on Friday, praising King Abdullah for his work in promoting a better understanding of the virtues proclaimed by Islam. "We welcome Pope Benedict's expression of respect and hope his positive statement will be reciprocated by leaders and ordinary people throughout the region," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the U.S.-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). The pope starts his second day in Jordan on Saturday with a visit to Mount Nebo, the site where the Bible says Moses saw the Promised Land before he died. Benedict is due to remain in Jordan until Monday, when he moves on to Israel to start the most delicate part of his trip. The Vatican supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But since being sworn in as head of Israel's new, right-leaning government on March 31, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not specifically discussed establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, a U.S. and Arab priority. Anything the pope says on the subject will echo around the region, particularly when he visits a Palestinian refugee camp within sight of the barrier Israel has built near Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank. Speaking to reporters on the plane taking him to Jordan, the pope said the Catholic Church would do everything it could to help the region's stalled peace process. "Certainly I will try to make a contribution to peace, not as an individual but in the name of the Catholic Church, of the Holy See," he told reporters on the plane taking him to Jordan. "We are not a political power but a spiritual force and this spiritual force is a reality which can contribute to progress in the peace process," he said
