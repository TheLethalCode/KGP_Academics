 CENTURION, South Africa, May 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Matthew Hayden's swashbuckling knock of 89 helped propel the Chennai Super Kings to a 12-run victory over Kings XI Punjab that put them top of the Indian Premier League standings on Thursday. Chennai joined Rajasthan Royals, who had thrashed the Bangalore Royal Challengers by seven wickets in the first match at Centurion, on 11 points but they lead the table with a superior net run rate. Rajasthan produced an excellent bowling display with seamer Amit Singh and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja ripping through Bangalore to claim seven wickets between them. Singh (four for 19) and Jadeja (three for 15) helped skittle out Bangalore for just 105 before rookie wicketkeeper-batsman Naman Ojha stepped forward to hit 52 not out off 38 balls to guide Rajasthan home with five overs to spare. In the second match, Hayden and Suresh Raina (32) wasted little time in piling up the runs for Chennai after opener Subramaniam Badrinath was out first ball. The duo added 76 off 55 balls for the second wicket. Hayden shrugged off a 95-minute rain break to continue his run spree and frustrated Punjab's bowlers by hitting eight fours and six sixes during his 58-ball knock. Hayden and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni added 100 for the third wicket off just 47 deliveries before the Australian left hander was finally caught at long-on off Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Dhoni was unbeaten on 56 off 27 deliveries as Chennai amassed 185 for three in their allotted 18 overs. Punjab were set a revised Duckworth-Lewis target of 187 and hopes of a victory were raised with Australian opener Simon Katich lashing 50 off 25 balls. After Katich was dismissed in the 10th over with Punjab still needing 103 for victory, Yuvraj Singh and former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene kept them in the hunt by taking them to 144 for three after 14 overs. But off-spinner Raina was then brought into the attack and he gave away just eight runs in his two match-winning overs. Yuvraj ended unbeaten on 58 off 36 balls and Jayawardene was scored 44 not out off 25 deliveries
