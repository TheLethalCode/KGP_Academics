<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The government has received some ten names for BDR as the government reorganises the mutiny-hit border guards, the commerce minister said on Thursday. "Opinions of about seven thousand people were received about reorganising the BDR. Of these, eight to ten names came for BDR. Five proposals on the design of their uniform were also received," Faruq Khan told reporters. Changes to the name, laws and uniform will be discussed in parliament, he added. He said BDR will submit a report to the committee on reorganisation 'in a few days'. The committee in turn will send recommendations to the government. On Wednesday, BDR director general major general Mainul Islam briefed the minister coordinating the government probes on the reforms progress after the bloody Feb 26 mutiny at the headquarters in Dhaka. Mainul had later told journalists that public opinion was being elicited on the reorganisation and, after collating all information, the report will be presented to the committee this month. He said they had collected information from five target groups including the army, police, ansars, and deputy commissioners at district level. Mainul Islam heads the sub-committee on reorganisation. Faruq again said on Thursday that the mutiny would be fairly investigated to bring the perpetrators to justice. bd
