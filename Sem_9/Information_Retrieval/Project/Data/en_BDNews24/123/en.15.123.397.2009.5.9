Delhi's victory was built around a third-wicket stand of 61 between AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan (17). De Villiers hit an unbeaten 50 off 38 balls, the South African's second half-century of the tournament standing alongside one century. Delhi also received a solid start thanks to a first-wicket partnership of 42 between David Warner (21) and Gautam Gambhir (19). Warner fell to off-spinner JP Duminy, who returned the economical figures of one for 15 off four overs. After winning the toss and electing to bat Mumbai slipped to 33 for four following two run-outs and a wicket apiece for left-arm swing bowler Dirk Nannes and seamer Rajat Bhatia. West Indies all rounder Dwayne Bravo and left-handed Indian batsman Abhishek Nayar (18) then shared a fifth-wicket stand of 57 before the former was caught behind off Nannes for 35.
