 Zurich, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - H1N1 flu has infected 3,440 people in 29 countries, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Saturday. In its latest tally, which tends to lag national reports but is considered more secure, the U.N. agency said 45 people in Mexico have died from the new flu strain that is a genetic mixture of swine, bird and human viruses. Its previous toll said there were 44 Mexican deaths. The Mexican government has said the worst is over and eased restrictions on commercial and public activity in the country that has been at the epicentre of the outbreak. The WHO's latest flu tally increased the number of confirmed infections in the United States to 1,639 from 896 reported on Friday, while the number of reported deaths remained at two. It increased the number of infections in Canada to 242, from 214, and added one reported death. European countries with cases confirmed in WHO laboratories include Spain (88), Britain (34), Germany (11), Italy (6), France (12), Portugal (1), Ireland (1), Netherlands (3), Austria (1), Denmark (1), Sweden (1), Switzerland (1) and Poland (1). The WHO also confirmed the following infections in the rest of the world: Israel (7), Brazil (6), New Zealand (5), South Korea (3), El Salvador (2), Hong Kong, China (1), Guatemala (1), Colombia (1) and Costa Rica (1). Countries with cases added to its list for the first time were: Argentina (1), Australia (1), Japan (3) and Panama (2). Evidence that the disease, popularly known as swine flu, has taken hold in communities outside the Americas would prompt WHO Director-General Margaret Chan to declare a full pandemic. Chan raised the global pandemic alert level last week to 5 out of 6 in response to the spread of H1N1 flu. Phase 5 means a pandemic is imminent. The WHO also repeated its guidance that international travel should not be restricted as a result of the outbreak.
