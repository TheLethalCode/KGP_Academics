<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies captain Chris Gayle conceded his team had lost the plot after a rash of dropped catches and some feeble batting led to a 10-wicket defeat against England within three days at Lord's on Friday. The two sides meet at Chester-le-Street in north-east England next Thursday in the second and final test which West Indies must win to retain the Wisden Trophy they regained this year. "We lost the plot," Gayle, who contributed only 28 and a duck after arriving in England on Monday from the Indian Premier League, told a news conference. "Obviously we are very disappointed in the manner in which we lost the game in three days. Having said all of that we have to give credit to England. They played some good cricket and they held on to their chances." Gayle's decision to ask England to bat on Wednesday appeared a defensive move after his batsmen had struggled with the unfamiliar conditions in the English spring during in the three warm-up matches. It was initially justified by some wonderful fast bowling from Fidel Edwards who threatened to run through the England batting after dismissing Kevin Pietersen with his first ball. But West Indies then dropped six catches in the final session, including three off Edwards, and all momentum was lost. Although Edwards eventually finished with six wickets they already looked a beaten side on the second morning. "Fidel Edwards bowled brilliantly," Gayle said. "We only have ourselves to blame. It does make a lot of difference batting in these conditions "But having said all these things we have to have the self-belief to go out there and get the job done. You just have to tough it out.
