 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)The government has backed the law-enforcers in drives against armed terrorists, but it never supported killings in so-called crossfire, the state minister for home said on Wednesday. "Our government has never backed any crossfire or extra-judicial incident," Tanjim Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat. "However, police and RAB will do everything they need to to defend themselves against armed terrorists," he added. The Constitution gives the law-enforcers the right to self-defende, he pointed out. The junior minister agreed to local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam's comments on Tuesday that the government would no more allow the law-enforcing agencies to use "crossfire" killings without trialas a tool. Home minister Sahara Khatun, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad, RAB director general Khandaker Hasan Mahmud, earlier in the day, had an unscheduled meeting on law and order. An alleged top gangster was killed in Dhaka early on Wednesday in an 'encounter' with RAB in Shahidnagar Beribadh Kamrangirchar. Delwar Hossain Dilu, 35, also known as Alamgir Hossain in the neighbourhood, had seven cases including manslaughter filed against him. Killings in so-called crossfire have being been widely criticised for years by national and international rights organisations and countries. A number of ministers of the Awami League-led government have promised to stop the extra-judicial milling by law-enforcing agencies, mainly by the Rapid Action Battalion, since the new government took office on Jan. 6 . But a number of such killings took place in the meantime. On Monday, another man was killed in the alleged crossfire with the RAB. bd
