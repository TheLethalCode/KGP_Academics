 Chittagong, May 7 (bdnews24.com)A court on Thursday gave police another six days to question a former director of the National Security Intelligence, retired wing commander Shahabuddin, in custody the much-talked-about 10 truckloads of arms haul case in Chittagong. Investigation officer of the case CID senior assistant police superintendent Maniruzzaman Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that Shahabuddin avoided many questions during the three-day remand, promting them to appeal for another 10-day remand. Chittagong metropolitan judge Mahbubur Rahman granted six days, though. Shahabuddin may be interrogated by the Taskforce for Interrogation in Dhaka, if necessary, Maniruzzaman said. Earlier, a CID officer had said on the condition of anonymity that Shahabuddin was being questioned about who directed him to order NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan to hire the trucks, his relationship with India's separatist ULFA leader Paresh Barua, and the role of then the home minister in the arms haul. The CID arrested Shahbuddin at his Green Road house Saturday. The 10 trucks with huge arms, ammunition and explosives were unloaded at the Chittagong Urea Fertiliser Limited jetty on the night of April 1, 2004. bdnews24.
