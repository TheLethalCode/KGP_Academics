 Dinajpur, May 8 (bdnews24.com)The 250MW Barapukuria thermal power plant is reeling under technical glitch, as one of its units has been down for 17 days, while the other unit is producing around half the capacity, officials said. "Technicians are trying to fix the problems of the Unit 2, which has a 125 MW capacity. It went out of order due to overwork," Bhagabari power plant managing engineer SM Akhtaruzzaman said. He could not say when the Unit 2 will be get up and running. The Unit 1, running continuously from Jan. 1, has also developed technical faults, resulting in a 65 MW-70MW cut-down in production. Experts predicted that the production of the unit may come to a halt at any time. Each unit requires "shutting down" once every two months, they said. bdnew
