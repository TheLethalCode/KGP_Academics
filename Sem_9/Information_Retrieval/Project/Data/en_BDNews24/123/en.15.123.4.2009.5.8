 KABUL, Fri May 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Residents of two villages hit earlier this week by US air strikes have prepared lists with the names of 147 people killed in the attacks, the deputy governor of the province where the strikes took place said. Farah Province deputy governor Yunus Rasooli told Reuters residents of the village of Geraani had provided 90 names and residents of neighboring Ganj Abad village another 57.

The US military plans to more than double its troop numbers in Afghanistan to 68,000 by year's end. Officials are still investigating the incident in the two villages and trying to confirm the names, Farah's Rasooli said. If the civilian toll is confirmed it would be the deadliest single incident for non-combatants since U.S.-led forces first started battling the Taliban in 2001. Rasooli said the lists included eight school children whose names were provided by the Ministry of Education. Abdul Basir Khairkhah, a member of the provincial government's investigating team, confirmed that the villagers' lists contained 147 names.
