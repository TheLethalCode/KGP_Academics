 LONDON, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ravi Bopara staked his claim as the solution to England's number three headache with an unbeaten century against West Indies at Lord's on Wednesday. With the start of the Ashes only nine weeks away, England are using the two-test series against West Indies to decide who is the best man for a key position in the batting order. Bopara, who turned 24 this week, justified his selection ahead of former captain Michael Vaughan, Ian Bell and Owais Shah with a composed performance to reach 118 not out in his fifth test match. "I hope I go into the next test batting at three and hopefully for the summer and the Ashes," the Essex all-rounder told a news conference after helping England to 289 for seven on the opening day of the first test. "It's a big thing for me and I'm looking forward to it." His two most recent performances contrast with his miserable tour of Sri Lanka at the end of 2007, where he made three ducks. Bopara's critics have questioned his technique but against some formidable pace bowling by Fidel Edwards, he showed the required temperament in his first test appearance at Lord's. He was also helped by some fielding fumbles, having been dropped by Brendan Nash on 76 and by Devon Smith on 102. After the Sri Lanka tour Bopara found himself out of the England test reckoning until this year. Drafted in for the fourth test in West Indies, when England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff went home for treatment on a hip muscle injury, Bopara grasped his chance by making his maiden test century. He was dropped for the next test when England opted to bring in an extra bowler but has remained in the selectors' minds and turned in some good Twenty20 performances in the Indian Premier League over recent weeks. "If you come from a place where you try to play positive, as a batsman you get into better positions," he said. "It worked in my advantage to be coming from the IPL. "Going out and batting at three in test cricket is the biggest test I've had so far and I've really enjoyed it.
