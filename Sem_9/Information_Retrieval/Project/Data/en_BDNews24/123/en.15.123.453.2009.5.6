<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Barapukuria Coal Mine workers demonstrated and vandalised the offices of Chinese contractor 'XMC' Tuesday morning, demanding a hike in their pay and allowances. They went berserk at around 8am when they came to know they would not get the salary and allowances they expected, said Abdul Matin, general manager (mining) of Coal Mining Company Ltd. The workers relented after the authorities said at around 2pm that the increased salaries and allowances would be paid, the general manager said. Several people were injured in the violent acts attributed to workers. A leader of the workers denied the charge. "No worker was involved in vandalism. A certain quarter was plotting to close down the coal mine," said Rabiul Islam, convenor of Boropukuria Coal Mine Workers' Rights Movement. XMC employs around 700 Bangladeshi workers and 250 Chinese. Police were guarding the 'XMC' offices.
