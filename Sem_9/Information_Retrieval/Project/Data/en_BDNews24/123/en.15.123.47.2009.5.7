<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, India, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Millions of Indians began voting in the fourth round of a general election on Thursday, including the possible swing state of West Bengal where the ruling Congress-led alliance hopes to win crucial seats. The Kashmir valley, the flashpoint of a 20-year insurgency, also goes to the polls watched over by thousands of security forces amid a boycott call by separatists. More than 94 million people are eligible to cast ballots as part of a month-long vote in which Congress alliance appears to have a slight edge over the Bharatiya Janata Party. Congress hopes to gain the upper hand over the BJP by winning some key seats in the communist bastion of West Bengal where its former communist allies are facing a backlash from poor farmers over their policy of seizing land for industry. "I think the results in West Bengal in this round of the poll are crucial for the Congress if they want to form government at the centre," said Sabyasachi Basu Roy Chowdhury, a political analyst from the Calcutta Research Group. The left helped swing the last election in 2004 when its support gave Congress a majority in parliament. But the communists quit the coalition last year angry at a civilian nuclear deal with the United States. Two key areas vote in the state, Singur and Nandigram, where the communist government tried and failed to set up industry complexes after protests, including a Tata Motors factory to produce the world's cheapest car, the Nano. Tata Motors pulled out in a big blow to the communists' attempt to woo investors and industrialise a state which for decades had been a byword for heavily unionised industry and pro-farmer policies. West Bengal accounts for 42 seats, the third-biggest source of seats in the 543-seat parliament. A tight race across India has sparked fears of a weak coalition government coming to power as the country grapples with the global economic crisis, a spate of militant attacks last year and heightened tensions with neighbour Pakistan. Both main parties may need the support of regional players to form a government. There is also an outside chance a coalition of smaller parties outside India's two giant blocs, known as the "Third Front", could win power. This worries many investors who see the group as an unknown quantity at the helm. Exit polls in the five-phase election are banned, and the results are out May 16. FRUSTRATED FARMERS Farmers in West Bengal could turn their backs on the communists, who have dominated the state for more than three decades, frustrated at the state government's policy to convert agricultural land into industrial hubs. "This is the first time a big dent will be made in the left's bastion," said political analyst Amulya Ganguli. The tussle reflects India's wider teething problems in its rise on the world stage, which has been fuelled by years of economic boom that left hundreds of millions living below the poverty line. Congress and the state's main opposition Trinamool Congress party (TMC) have tied up to fight the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) party. Congress is expected to do well in Delhi and in Rajasthan, a state which the BJP swept in 2004 but lost at state level to Congress in elections last year
