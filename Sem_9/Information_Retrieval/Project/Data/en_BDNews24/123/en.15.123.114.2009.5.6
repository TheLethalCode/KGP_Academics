 CAPE TOWN, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's parliament is set to choose Jacob Zuma as state president on Wednesday after his ruling ANC's resounding election victory, capping a remarkable political comeback.

Critics of South Africa's political system say the country is effectively a one-party state because of the ANC's dominance since the end of apartheid in 1994. The party is still widely respected for its struggle against white-minority rule so voters in the election overlooked its policy failures. But it will come under mounting pressure to deliver on 15 years of promises to help millions of blacks still living in grim townships.
