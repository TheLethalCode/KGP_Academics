 Dhaka May 6 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister's husband Dr M A Wazed Miah is still not out of danger as he is suffering from multiple complications, a doctor has said. Dr Sanawar Hossain, director of medical services and consultant surgery, of Square Hospital, where Dr Miah is being treated, told bdnews24.com at 6:15pm his condition was stable. "But he is not out of danger yet." "[However] such strain of a disease bears risks." Dr Hossain said, "His arrhythmia developed this [Wednesday] morning." "No medicine was reacting to this. [So] He was immediately given temporary pace-making." "His condition has been improving since then." Dr Miah was being given cardio respiratory support in Cardiology Surgical ICU, Dr Hossain added. The nuclear physicist has been undergoing treatment at Square Hospital since Apr 7, he said. The former chairman Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission has long been suffering from heart and kidney problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. Dr Hossain had earlier told bdnews24.com that he was taken to the operating theatre after his condition had worsened. Dr Miah recently had angioplasty at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore. He underwent a bypass surgery in 1997. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina drove to the hospital just before 3pm to see him. She spent around an hour at the bedside of her husband. She was looking dejected as trudged out of the hospital corridor, helped by her sister, Rehana, at around 3:45pm. bdnew
