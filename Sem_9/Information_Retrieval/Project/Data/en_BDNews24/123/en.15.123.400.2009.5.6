<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Wednesday sent graft case convicts Anwar Hossain Manju and Shahjahan Omar to jail pending trial after they turned themselves in. Judge AK Arifur Rahman of the Special Judge's Court-9 rejected their petitions for bail after their lawyers moved them. He ordered authorities to accord the Manju, a former communications minister and splinter Jatiya Party chairman, and Omar, a former BNP state minister for law, 'first division prisoner' status in jail. Justice Md Iman Ali of the High Court third bench last Sunday ordered all absconding VIP convicts to surrender in court within two weeks. On Feb 23, a two-member High Court bench had given a split verdict on the appeals submitted by the absconding convicts praying for bails and quashing the cases. The two judges differed on whether the absconding convicts could go to the higher court seeking justice. Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haq, the senior judge, had ordered the VIPs to surrender to trial court within eight weeks but they would not have to go to jail. Disagreeing, Justice Mainul Islam Chowdhury, the other judge, ordered the VIPs to surrender to trial court first and then appeal against the trial court verdict from jail. The bench then sent the split verdict case files to the chief justice for necessary order. The chief justice handed over the responsibility to the third bench for disposal of the case. The VIP convicts, whose petitions for bail and quashing cases were disposed of by the third bench Sunday, were Manju, Awami League leader Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Mockbul Hossain, Hajj Selim and Md Mohiuddin and BNP's Nadim Mostafa, Abu Hanif Patwari, Md Babul Chowdhury, Saria Chowdhury, Mafruza Sultana, Masudur Rahman and Sofiur Rahman Babu. b
