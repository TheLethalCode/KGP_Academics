 Dhaka, May 6 (bdnews24.com) An alleged top gangster of Lalbagh in the capital was killed early on Wednesday in a so-called encounter with RAB in Shahidnagar Beribadh Kamrangirchar, a day after the local government minister said no more extra-judicial killing will be allowed. Delwar Hossain Dilu, 35, also known as Alamgir Hossain in the neighbourhood, had seven cases including manslaughter filed against him. RAB said its corporal Joy Gopal Das and lance corporal Nasir Uddin sustained injuries during the skirmish. RAB legal and media wing director AK Azad told bdnews24.com that being tipped off about a terrorists' meeting, a RAB-10 contingent reached Shahidnagar at 3:15am on Wednesday. The terrorists opened fire on them and the elite force retaliated and the gun-battle continued through 20 minutes, he said. Eventually the criminals fled the scene and RAB recovered the body of Dilu and two pistols including six rounds of ammunition from the spot. The locals identified the dead body as Dilu's, Azad added. Syed Ashraful Islam, the minister and ruling Awami League spokesman, on Tuesday said the government will no more allow the law-enforcing agencies to use "crossfire" killings without trialas a tool. "The crossfire and extra-judicial killings are not related to general law. The law must be allowed to take its own course." Killings in so-called crossfire have being been widely criticised for years by national and international rights organisations and countries. A number of ministers of the Awami League-led government have promised to stop the extra-judicial milling by law-enforcing agencies, mainly by the Rapid Action Battalion, since the new government took office on Jan. 6 . But a number of such killings took place in the meantime. On Monday, another man was killed in the alleged crossfire with the RAB. bdne
