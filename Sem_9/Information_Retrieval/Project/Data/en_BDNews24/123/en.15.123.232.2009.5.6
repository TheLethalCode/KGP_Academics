 KATHMANDU, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 1,000 stone-throwing Maoist protesters chanting `we are ready to fight'clashed with police in Nepal on Wednesday as political parties struggled to form a new government. Nepal's major political parties tried to woo the former rebels to help form a new government after their leader, Prachanda, quit on Monday because Nepal's president had stopped him from removing the Himalayan nation's army chief.

"We'll hold talks with them and try to form the government as soon as possible," he said. Writing the country's new constitution, a key part of a 2006 peace deal that ended the civil war three years ago, without the Maoists would also be difficult. "Without the participation of the Maoists in the government or their strong commitment to the peace process the writing of the new constitution will not be possible," political analyst Yubaraj Ghimire said. UML officials said their leader Jhal Nath Khanal met Prachanda on Wednesday, but no more details were given. The Maoists have said they would disrupt the parliamentary sittings until army chief General Rookmangud Katawal was sacked. They accused Gen. Katawal of undermining the authority of the civilian government. Business officials say the uncertainty would only deepen economic woes in a country already facing crippling power cuts, high inflation and food short
