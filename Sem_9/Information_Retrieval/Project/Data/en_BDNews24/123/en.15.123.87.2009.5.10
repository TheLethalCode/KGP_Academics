<TEXT>
 Kuala Lumpur, May 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)Malaysian authorities will investigate a suicide bomb threat issued from within the country by a terror group against four foreign missions in Bangladesh, the country's police chief said. Reuters news agency reported that an unknown terror group, Jameaah Islamiyah al Qaeda, had threatened the U.S. embassy and the British, Canadian and Australian high commissions in Dhaka. The threats were contained in letters faxed from a number in Malaysia. "Upon being notified, we will have to investigate this matter, to see whether the (fax) number really is genuine," Malaysia's inspector general of police, Musa Hassan, told Reuters on Saturday. Asked whether the matter would require any increase in security for foreign embassies, Musa said security arrangements for foreign embassies in Malaysia were adequate. A Kuala Lumpur-based foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said Malaysian authorities had not stepped up security for foreign embassies or issued any alerts to them. Dhaka police chief A K M Shahidul Haque said the group, which claimed to have close ties with outlawed Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), had asked the diplomatic missions in Dhaka to close down their operations within a week or face suicide bomb attacks. Threats from Islamist militants on Thursday night to blow up the embassies prompted the government to shore up security in the diplomatic zone. In the message, Jameaah Islamiyah, believed to have links with the Al Qaeda core group led by Osama bin Laden, demanded $100,000 from the missions through Western Union Money Transfer to fund the release of a forensic expert of the group, who is now in a Malaysian prison. Malaysia announced on Friday that the suspected leader of a radical Islamist group linked to the 2002 Bali bombings had been arrested in the country 15 months after he escaped from a high security prison in Singapore. The government deployed 200 police men, including plain-clothes, on top of regular 600 members in the sensitive Baridhara diplomatic zone and its neighbourhood. Two additional patrol cars and different intelligence agencies were also working. bdn
