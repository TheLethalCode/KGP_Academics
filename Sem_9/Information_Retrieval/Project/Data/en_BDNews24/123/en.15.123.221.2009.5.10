 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)A 15-year-old boy died when he and his elder brother were shot by gunmen early on Sunday at North Kajipara in the capital over extortion for a under-construction building. They were shot after the extortionists had burst into the building at 6am, said Ashraf Uddin, sub-inspector of Kafrul Police Station. The boy, Md Sharif Mia, was declared dead when both of them were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, he said. Supervisor Md Abdullah, 22, used to stay at the building and Mia had come to visit him from Chandina in Comilla. Underlings of 'Raja', were demanding Tk 20 lakh from the construction firm working at the site for some time, said Biplob Hossain, engineer of the company. They were probably behind the attack, Hossain said. He added the criminals called up an official of the realtor after the incident and said more killings will follow if the money was not paid. A general diary has been lodged at the police station, he added. b
