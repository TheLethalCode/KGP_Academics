 Kishoreganj, May 6 (bdnews24.com)The chief election commissioner said on Wednesday no more election would be held under the existing law. "Other elections including city corporation and municipality will be held after the passage of the new law in parliament," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters as he visited Alormela in Kishoreganj to select server station there. The present server system of the Election Commission is totally centred on Dhaka, Huda said. "We want to decentralise the server system at upazila levels so that the server station can work as people's service station in preparing national identity cards and updating voter lists," he said. Asked whether the commission could stage elections properly if the caretaker government provision was repealed, he said: "The commission will give its opinion after getting such proposal from the government." The CEC visited two venues for service stations at Alormela. He later visited Tarail, Karimganj, Katiadi, Nikli and Bajitpur. bdn
