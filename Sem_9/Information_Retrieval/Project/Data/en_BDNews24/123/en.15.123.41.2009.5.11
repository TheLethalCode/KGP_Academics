<TEXT>
 JUYUAN, China, May 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A year ago on Tuesday, an earthquake in China's Sichuan province brought down Juyuan Middle School, crushing to death hundreds of students. Reuters spoke to 30 parents of students killed in Class 5 of Junior Secondary 3rd Year. Here is what some of them said: ZHENG YUFANG, 37, MOTHER OF ZHU YONG "I used to do some business. But now I just stay in my room passing the days ... It's been hard on my family. My son is dead, my husband was injured, and we have my husband's 90-year-old grandmother at home with us." "My boy's marks weren't great. Boys at that age do like to play ... Last night I dreamt of him ... I dreamt he called on the phone and I asked, 'Who's that?' he said, 'Ma, it's me your son.' I asked him where he was and he said, 'I've gone away'." ZHOU HUIFANG, 40, MOTHER OF GAO LI "Nowadays I feel a bit better but it's hard ... Many families have already had another child, but my health may not be up to it. I'd like to have one but I don't know. "The money (government payment) is enough, but what about responsibility? It fell because of corruption ... Ninety percent of the parents were complaining and protesting, but in the villages it's harder for us to organise." YU CHUNLIN, 40s, FATHER OF YU JIHONG "We're getting ready to have another child. It should be in late May. That will take a load off my mind. "I still care about the school problem, but there's nothing we can do ... We can't solve this problem on our own. If we want to prosecute someone, who? It's not that easy. "Slowly you have to learn to look ahead. It's hard, but you have to." DONG TIANQUN, 40, MOTHER OF DONG YANG "Dong Yang loved to sing. Her father was a Tibetan and she always fancied herself as a star ... But she told me she wanted to be a doctor, because I've got so many sick people in my family. "We've tried petitioning, but the road is blocked, so we can only complain and complain. That doesn't help much ... I want to see them get to the bottom of the school quality problem. It's not about compensation, it's about telling us the truth." "I divorced in 1994, and after that it was just me and Dong Yang ... I'd like to have another child, but I have to find a husband first. I've told myself I won't find one until I avenge Dong Yang.
