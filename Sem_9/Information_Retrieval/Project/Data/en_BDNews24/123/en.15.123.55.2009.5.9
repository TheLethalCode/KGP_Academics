<TEXT>
 Bandarban, May 8 (bdnews24.com)River traffic has ground to a halt for three days after a 700-feet high hill collapsed into the Sangu river at Galenga on Wednesday, the Ruma Upazila chairman said. The hill slide near an army camp in Ruma Upazila cut off river links between Bandarban Sadar and Ruma and Thanchi, Aungthoaiching said on Friday. The slide, believed to have been caused by hill cutting, has created a barrage in the river, he added. The slide filled up at least 10 feet of the 25-feet wide length river. As the depth of the river was less in the other part, vessels could not move through. A local businessman, Badshah Mia, told bdnews24.com that they saw a barrage in the river as they went there the day after the hill slide had taken place. River transport operators were without work and traders in Thanchi and Ruma counting losses, he also said. The hill might have collapsed because of a loss of geographical balance due to cultivation by hill cutting, a local forest department officer, Monirul Islam, said. However, nothing can be said without survey, he added. Ruma Upazila agriculture officer Mohammad Altaf Hossain said it might have happened as earth cracks developed from indiscriminate felling of trees. bdnews2
