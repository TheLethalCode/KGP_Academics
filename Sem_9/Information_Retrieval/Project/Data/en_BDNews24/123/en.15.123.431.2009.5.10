 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court sent graft convict former foreign minister M Morshed Khan to jail after he had turned himself in to the court on Sunday afternoon. The Special Judge's Court-7 had sentenced him to 13 years in prison in 2008 for hiding information on illegal assets after the Anticorruption Commission sued him on Dec 10, 2007. Khan, adviser to the BNP chairperson, came to the court at 11:30am and surrendered through Rafiq- Ul Huq, senior lawyer of Supreme Court. Judge Sirajul Islam asked the jail authorities to grant him first-division status in line with the prison rules. ACC lawyer Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told bdnews24.com that Khan was sent to jail because the court did not have the jurisdiction to grant bail. Former communications minister Anwar Hossain Manju and former state minister for law Shahjahan Omar surrendered at the special court on Wednesday after the High Court had recently ordered 12 convicted VIP persons to surrender to the trial court. bdne
