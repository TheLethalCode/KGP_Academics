 TBILISI, May 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's opposition agreed to talks with the government on Friday after month-long street protests spilled over into violence in the former Soviet republic, the focus of tensions between the West and Russia. The agreement followed the intervention of Georgia's influential Orthodox Church leader and an appeal from the European Union to defuse tensions in the country, which is hosting NATO military exercises to the consternation of neighboring Russia. Opposition leaders demanding the resignation of President Mikheil Saakashvili said representatives would meet parliament speaker David Bakradze for "preparatory" talks. "This meeting should very quickly prepare a meeting with the president," opposition leader Salome Zurabishvili said. The opposition says Saakashvili should quit over his record on democracy and a disastrous war with Russia last year, when Moscow crushed a Georgian assault on the breakaway pro-Russian region of South Ossetia. A brief, bloodless mutiny at a tank base outside Tbilisi on Tuesday, and clashes between police and protesters at a police base on Wednesday that injured 28 people, have raised fears of a wider anti-government rebellion. Georgian Orthodox Church Patriarch Ilia II warned after the violence that the situation was "in danger of exploding." REBELLION The opposition said it had canceled plans to widen the roadblocks from Tbilisi to the main east-west highway. The meeting looked likely to go ahead late on Friday. The turmoil has cast a shadow over the start of month-long NATO war games this week in Georgia, a gesture of solidarity by the 28-nation Western military alliance after last August's war slammed the brakes on Georgia's NATO membership bid. Russia has condemned the exercises as "muscle-flexing" in the South Caucasus, a region Moscow considers part of its traditional sphere of influence but which has become vital for oil and gas transit to Europe. Saakashvili came to power on the back of the 2003 "Rose Revolution" on a promise to consolidate Georgian democracy. Critics say instead he has monopolized power, but a month of roadblocks has failed to unseat him and analysts say the opposition lacks sufficient support. The government dispersed the last mass demonstrations against Saakashvili in 2007 with tear gas and rubber bullets. Saakashvili accused Moscow of fomenting rebellion in Georgia on Tuesday, when authorities said battalion commanders at a base near Tbilisi had refused orders and several serving and former military officers were arrested. Russia said the accusation was "insane" and that Saakashvili was trying to shift blame for his own domestic problems.
