 LONDON, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England go into the second test against West Indies with fresh conviction after their bold selections paid dividends at Lord's this week. Ravi Bopara fully justified his promotion to number three with 143 and debutant pace bowler Graham Onions captured five for 38 in the visitors' first innings. England won by 10 wickets within three days on Friday. "We were in some trouble on the first day (at 109-4) but the way in which Ravi in particular stood up and showed his temperament under pressure was really encouraging," captain Andrew Strauss told a news conference. "He was crucial to the outcome of this test match." Onions, who picked up seven wickets in the match, had been selected ahead of his Durham team mate Steve Harmison, who had a disappointing tour of the Caribbean this year. "What a great start that is," said Strauss. "He bowled with a lot of hostility and straight and with some good pace. It shows there's some good talent in English cricket." Man-of-the-match Graeme Swann took six wickets, including the West Indies' leading batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul for nought and four, and scored his maiden test fifty. Strauss said the 30-year-old off-spinner, who made his test debut at the end of last year, had benefitted from a late entry to the test set-up. SMART BOWLER "Obviously he is an excellent bowler at left-handers in particular," said the England opener. "I haven't seen a left-hander play him with real confidence yet. He troubles everyone, he has good variety, he's a smart bowler. "Possibly the fact he's come in quite late in his career means he's had more time to think about his variation. We're excited about what he's going to offer us in the future." With the start of the Ashes two months away, England could not have timed their first win in the opening test of a series for four years at a better time. "There were fresh faces and they all came to the party," said Strauss. "You need some decent depth in an international squad if you are going to do well, it looks like we're building some decent depth. "You can't underestimate how important it is to win cricket matches. It lifts the spirit of the team, it makes people feel part of something slightly special. "It gives everyone confidence. The more you do it the more you believe you can win when the chips are down. We won here and we need to win another next week." The second and final test starts next Thursday at Chester-le-Street
