 Dhaka, May 8 (bdnews24.com)The war crimes trial is being delayed as the perpetrators have been planted deep into the administration, the chief of a forum for secular Bangladesh on Friday. Agents of Jama'at-e-Islami party lying low in the administration were creating barriers to starting the trial process, Shahriar Kabir, president of Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee, said. "Bangladesh will face the fate of Pakistan if the trial process was delayed, Kabir said at a public meeting, held by Rajshahi district unit of Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee, at historical Bhubanmahan Park in Rajshahi. He demanded speedy constitution of tribunal, prosecution team and investigation agency to start the trial process of war criminals swiftly. Anti-liberation people are intimidating witnesses to war crimes cases across the country and damaging evidence taking advantage over the delay to start the process, he alleged. "The Jamaatis consider Pakistan as a house of Allah. It is actually a house of devils." Rajshahi mayor AGM Khairuzzaman Liton said those who were doing religion-based politics were real war criminals. "They should be put on trial first." bdne
