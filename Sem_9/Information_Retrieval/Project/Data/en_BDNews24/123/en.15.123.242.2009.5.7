"President Obama spoke with Chinese President Hu this morning and discussed ways to enhance cooperation on the global economy and health issues," the statement said, without giving further details. "President Obama described to President Hu his concerns over recent actions by North Korea and threats to Pakistan by militant extremists and terrorists."

Earlier on Wednesday China said it was "concerned" about the incident and accused the US vessel of contravening international laws. The fifth incident of its kind in two months occurred on Friday in international waters about 170 miles (274 km) from the Chinese mainland when the fishing vessels approached the USNS Victorious, US defense officials said. Obama hosted the leaders of Pakistan and Afghanistan at the White House on Wednesday, winning a fresh promise from them to work together to defeat al Qaeda. Last month, the UN Security Council condemned North Korea's launch of what the United States and Japan said was a long-range missile but North Korea insisted was a rocket carrying a peaceful satellite.
