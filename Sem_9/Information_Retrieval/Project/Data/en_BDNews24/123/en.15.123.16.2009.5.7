<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Malaysia has taken a "political decision" to lift the visa ban on Bangladesh workers soon, labour and manpower employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has said. On March 10, Kuala Lumpur cancelled 55,000 visas for Bangladeshi workers because of a "politically sensitive" statement made by a Bangladeshi diplomat. "The ruling party discussed the issue (on Bangladeshi workers) in parliament to lift the ban," Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "Withdrawal of the ban is a matter of time, I think." The minister, however, said Malaysia had not "formally" inform Dhaka of the decision In March, Bangladesh labour counsellor Talat Mahmud had told a Malaysian TV channel that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs despite the economic slowdown in Malaysia. The counsellor told the same to Malaysia's state-run news agency, angering people and politicians in Malaysia, hard hit by the global economic meltdown. The far-eastern country sent hundreds of Bangladeshi workers empty-handed. Foreign minister Dipu Moni and Hossain last month visited Malaysia and had talks with the leaders of the new government there for lifting the ban. The diplomat was later withdrawn. Around 500,000 Bangladeshis live in Malaysia.
