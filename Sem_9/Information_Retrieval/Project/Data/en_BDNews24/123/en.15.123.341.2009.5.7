<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7, (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will receive $ 200 million in emergency aid from the Asian Development Bank to cushion the impact of the current economic meltdown, the finance minister said. Abdul Mal Abdul Muhith told journalists on Thursday that the aid, in addition to regular assistance, was likely to arrive by December. Speaking at a press briefing on his return from the 42nd annual general meeting of ADB in Bali, Indonesia, he said ADB had formed a $3.4 billion dollar fund to cushion the impact of current worldwide recession. The countries badly hit by the global recession would get assistance from the fund, added Muhith, who flew to Indonesia on the night of May 1 and returned home on the midnight of May 6. Asked which sectors would get the aid, he said, the fund would be used as budgetary allocation especially for social security, industry preservation and development of infrastructure. "After attending the meeting, I have realised that the next 2009-10 fiscal year would prove a critical time for all the countries." He dismissed the possibility of expected GDP growth in all countries. "I hope the global recession will take leave from 2011." bdnews24.com
