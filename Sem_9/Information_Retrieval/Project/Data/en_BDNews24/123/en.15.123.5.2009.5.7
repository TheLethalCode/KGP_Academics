<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal forward Nicklas Bendtner apologised on Wednesday to the club and their fans after being photographed outside a nightclub following the Champions League semi-final defeat by Manchester United. "I love this club and was so disappointed to lose against Manchester United last (Tuesday) night," the Dane, who came on as a second-half substitute, said in a statement on Arsenal's website (www.arsenal.com). "Reaching a Champions League final is one of my biggest dreams and getting knocked out was a massive blow," he said after Tuesday's 3-1 loss and 4-1 aggregate defeat. "However, no matter how disappointed I was, it does not excuse my behaviour later in the evening. I may be young but my actions were a poor error of judgement and something I deeply regret. I want to apologise to the club and the fans for letting them and myself down." The 21-year-old Danish international has struggled to win over the club's fans this season despite scoring 14 goals in all competitions
