 TBILISI, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgia's government and opposition opened talks on Friday after month-long street protests spilled over into violence in the former Soviet republic, the focus of tensions between the West and Russia. The encounter followed appeals from the EU and Georgia's influential Orthodox Church leader to defuse racing tensions in the Caucasus country, which is hosting NATO military exercises to the consternation of neighboring Russia. There was no breakthrough. The opposition has been protesting and blocking roads in Tbilisi for a month, demanding President Mikheil Saakashvili resign over his record on democracy and last year's disastrous war with Russia. An opposition delegation met parliament speaker David Bakradze. The opposition emerged saying they wanted face-to-face talks with Saakashvili so they could tell him to quit. "Our only demand is Saakashvili's resignation," said opposition delegate Gubaz Sanikidze. "We told them that we want a meeting with the president to take place." Bakradze said Saakashvili was "in principle" ready to meet, "but we need to discuss issues before this meeting." A brief, bloodless mutiny at a tank base outside Tbilisi on Tuesday, and clashes between police and protesters at a police base on Wednesday that injured 28 people, have raised fears of a wider anti-government rebellion. REBELLION Georgian Patriarch Ilia II warned the situation was "in danger of exploding." The opposition canceled plans to widen the roadblocks from Tbilisi to the main east-west highway and agreed to talks. But protests were due to resume on Saturday. The turmoil has cast a shadow over the start of month-long NATO war games this week in Georgia, a gesture of solidarity by the 28-nation Western military alliance after last August's war slammed the brakes on Georgia's NATO membership bid. Russia has condemned the exercises as "muscle-flexing" in the South Caucasus, a region Moscow considers part of its traditional sphere of influence but which has become vital for oil and gas transit to Europe. Saakashvili came to power on the back of the 2003 "Rose Revolution" on a promise to consolidate Georgian democracy. Critics say instead he has monopolized power, but a month of roadblocks has failed to unseat him and analysts say the opposition lacks sufficient support. The government dispersed the last mass demonstrations against Saakashvili in 2007 with tear gas and rubber bullets. War last August, when Russia crushed a Georgian assault on the breakaway region of South Ossetia, has galvanized Saakashvili's opponents. Saakashvili accused Moscow of fomenting rebellion in Georgia on Tuesday, when authorities said battalion commanders at a base near Tbilisi had refused orders and several serving and former military officers were arrested. Russia said the accusation was "insane" and that Saakashvili was trying to shift blame for his own domestic problems
