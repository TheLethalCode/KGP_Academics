 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)  Riding on an unbeaten century from opener Mahela Udawatta, the Sri Lanka Development squad ruled the first day of the second four-day match against hosts GP-BCB National Cricket Academy at the Bir Shreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong on Sunday. The visitors were 306-3 at the close of play with Udawatta, who played nine ODIs for Sri Lanka, remaining unbeaten on 122 off 272 balls studded with 17 fours and one six. The Sri Lanka Development squad, opting to bat, got off to an impressive start with the opening stand adding 72 runs before off-spinner Saqlain Sajib made the first breakthrough for the hosts, who suffered a massive nine-wicket defeat inside three days in the first match. Sajib had K Gunawardene caught by Kamrul Islam for 41 and that was the lone success for the host bowlers in the first session and then they struggled to separate the 80-run second wicket stand between Udawatta and L Thirimanne. Sajib again came to remove Thirimanne (36), leaving the visitors at 152-2 in 47.2 overs, but Udawatta and two-down batsman G Rupasinghe gave the hosts bowlers another tough time. Rupasinghe, who was a bit fast compared to Udawatta, was unlucky not to have completed his ton after falling six runs short of what would have been a deserved century. Occasional Marshal Ayub had Rupasinghe stumped by wicketkeeper Sahagir for stoke-filled 96 off 148 balls studded with nine fours and four sixes. Sajib took two wickets for 68 while Marshal took the other for 21. bd
