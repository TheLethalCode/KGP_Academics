<TITLE> Egypt brushes off reports on nuclear traces </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, May 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egypt said on Thursday media reports that U.N. nuclear inspectors found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Egyptian reactor complex addressed an old issue that had already been resolved. A restricted International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report, obtained by Reuters on Wednesday, said the inspectors found the traces but did not specify if they were weapons-grade -- enriched to a high-enough level to make a bomb. Diplomats said the traces were not enriched to that grade but their fissile concentration was higher than the level normally suited to fuelling civilian nuclear power stations. The report said Egypt had explained to the IAEA that it believed the highly enriched uranium (HEU) "could have been brought into the country through contaminated radio-isotope transport containers." Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hossam Zaki said in a statement the media reports were "mistaken and old" and led to questions about the motivations behind such a leak. "Egypt previously explained to the agency the circumstances of this issue and the officials in the agency agreed with the Egyptian explanation," he said, adding that the IAEA had always affirmed Egypt's nuclear plans were peaceful. He said the issue had been first raised in 2007. The report, dated May 5 this year, said HEU was discovered alongside particles of low-enriched uranium, the type used for nuclear power plant fuel, at Inshas, near Cairo, where there is a research reactor complex. The report said the U.N. watchdog's inspectors had not yet determined the source of the particles, and more testing in the area was planned to draw conclusions, but the IAEA had no indication Egypt's clarification was not correct. The report said Egypt in 2004-06 turned over information to the IAEA about previously undeclared nuclear activity and submitted design information about the Inshas facility. The IAEA is sensitive to possible nuclear proliferation in the Middle East because of inquiries into allegations of weapons-related nuclear activity in Iran and Syria, which both countries deny. Israel, Egypt's neighbor, is the only Middle East state believed to have nuclear weapons. An IAEA spokesman declined comment, saying the report was solely for the eyes of the agency's 35-nation governing board which next convenes in June. A diplomat familiar with IAEA inspections work said it was "not that unusual for the Agency to find traces of nuclear material in environmental samples at nuclear sites in a country. As needed, these are followed up by Department of Safeguards."
