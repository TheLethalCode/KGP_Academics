 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com) A collective effort from the Bangladesh U-19 boys helped them clinch the five-match one-day series with a match to go after inflicting a slim two-wicket defeat on Sri Lanka on Thursday. Bangladesh, who lost the first match to their visiting counterparts, reached 198-8 in 49.4 overs after bowling out the Sri Lankans for just 197 in 47.4 overs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The hosts who lost to the first match by 38 runs but bounced back in the second and third matches, will play the fifth and final match on Friday at the same venue. Chasing the easy total, Bangladesh were 92-6 at one stage before Abul Hasan and Shaker Ahmed took the host home with an 55-run partnership for the unbroken ninth wicket. Pacer Abul Hasan, who had earlier grabbed two wickets, was also smart with the bat as he top-scored with an unbeaten 30 off 51 balls studded with two fours while Shaker was 26 not out off 42 balls. Opener Saikat Ali (24), Irfan Shukkur (27), Sabbir Rahman (28) and Noor Hossain (22) also made good contributions in their series winning match. Earlier, the Sri Lanka U-19s were bundled out for 197 after some tight bowling from the hosts. However, middle order batsman K Perera made a fine 68 off 85 balls that included five fours and one six. Ekanayake, B Rajapaksa and Udayanga chipped in with 39, 27 and 26 respectively while Abul Hasan, Noor Hossain and Sabbir Rahman took two wickets each. bd
