 KABUL, Thu May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A second former member of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's government registered on Thursday to stand against him for president, a sign that opposition is struggling to unite behind a single contender. Former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani submitted his registration documents a day after former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah. Other candidates have one more day to sign up for the Aug. 20 poll. Karzai, who has held office since 2001, registered on Monday, before departing for the United States where he met President Barack Obama and Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. The final days of the registration period have seen Karzai solidify his stance as the front-runner to remain in office. One of his main rivals pulled out on Saturday apparently to back him, while other opposition figures failed to agree a united front. Ghani said he was registering even though he believed the playing field was not level. "Presently all the governmental power, authority and influence is being used for the interest of a particular candidate," he told reporters, alluding to Karzai. "The law is being violated on a daily basis by this government," he said. Ghani, like Karzai, is a Pashtun from Afghanistan's largest ethnic group. He is a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institute and served as finance minister under Karzai between 2002 and 2004. But as a technocrat who long lived abroad, he is not seen as having a strong tribal support base in rural areas back home. When asked if his nomination would lessen the opposition's chance of ousting Karzai, Ghani said he had a 10-year plan for Afghanistan and would welcome anyone's help for a national programme and national consensus. Ghani had been one of the candidates believed to be in talks with other contenders about uniting behind a single candidate who could gain support across the country's ethnic divides. Another was Abdullah, who is half Pashtun and half Tajik but mainly linked to the Tajik minority through his long-term association with late Tajik guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Masood. Although the candidates have signed up to run against each other, it is still possible that one or more could withdraw later on, helping to shrink the field. One of the main Pashtun candidates, regional governor Gul Agha Sherzai, pulled out of the race abruptly on Saturday, apparently to back Karzai. Another opposition leader, former Tajik guerrilla chief Mohammad Qasim Fahim, has abandoned the opposition to stand as one of Karzai's two prospective depu
