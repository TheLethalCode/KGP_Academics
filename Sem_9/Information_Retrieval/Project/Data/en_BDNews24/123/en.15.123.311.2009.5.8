Dr Miah is under close observation at the ICU of Square Hospital. "The condition of the patient is unchanged. He is being given liquid food," said Dr Hossain. Dr Miah had been suffering for many years past from a number of diseases including blood pressure, blood sugar, cardiac complications, a failed kidney and respiratory problems. Former chairman of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Dr Miah has been under treatment at Square Hospital for the last one year. Earlier, he received treatment in Delhi and Singapore also. In the most recent spell, Miah was admitted to the hospital on April 7, said Dr Hossain, also director of medical services and consultant surgery. "His heart beat became irregular Wednesday morning.
