 GENEVA, Thu May 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of investigations by members of the World Trade Organisation into unfairly priced imports jumped by a fifth last year as the financial crisis gathered steam, WTO data published on Thursday showed. The WTO said the number of anti-dumping investigations rose to 208 in 2008 from an 11-year low of 163 in 2007, returning to levels seen in 2004-2006. International trade rules allow countries to impose compensatory duties on imports that are "dumped" -- sold for less than they cost in the exporting country -- provided they are shown to injure businesses in the importing nation. These trade measures rise and fall with the health of the economy, with the number of probes initiated peaking in 1999 after the Asia crisis and again in 2001 after the dotcom bubble. "You see the dramatic drop in anti-dumping activity since 2001 because the going was good in the world economy," said one trade expert. They are therefore a lagging indicator -- reflecting what has happened in the world economy rather than pointing to the future -- and meaning it is too soon to say to what extent the current recession will boost trade measures. The fact imports have fallen faster than exports in many countries makes it harder for businesses to claim injury, but the measures are also a harbinger of trade disputes to come. "If there's an increase in anti-dumping activity you'll see a year or two later an increase in disputes," the expert said. Whether the increase indicates a sharpening of trade tension amid worries over protectionism, or conversely growing readiness to work within the rules of the international trading system is hard to say. SAFEGUARDS At a WTO meeting on Wednesday on another trade measure, safeguards -- which allow countries to raise duties or impose quotas to cope with a sudden flood of imports -- the European Union complained that India had not notified recent safeguards and called on it to exercise restraint in using the instrument. In the second half of the year, which typically sees most new anti-dumping cases, the number of investigations rose to 120 by 15 members in 2008 from 103 by 14 members a year earlier, according to the data, prepared for a semi-annual report to a meeting on Friday of the WTO's anti-dumping committee. India reported most new initiations in the last half of 2008 with 42, followed by Brazil, with 16 and China with 11. China itself is by far the most frequent target of new investigations, accounting for 34, down from 40 in the second half of 2007. Until then China had been a steadily increasing subject of new investigations. The sector most affected by new investigations in the second half of 2008 was base metals, mainly steel, accounting for 43 new cases, of which 24 were initiated by India. Chemicals followed by 22 and textiles with 19. The WTO data show the number of anti-dumping measures imposed after investigations by national authorities rose to 138 in 2008 from 107 in 2007. Anti-dumping investigations last 12-18 months, so measures imposed in 2008 mostly date back to cases raised in 2006. The number of anti-dumping measures imposed in the second half of 2008 rose to 81, imposed by 11 members, from 56 imposed by 14 members a year earlier. The United States accounted for 21 of these new measures, up from only 2 it imposed in the second half of 2007, followed by India with 13 and Turkey wit
