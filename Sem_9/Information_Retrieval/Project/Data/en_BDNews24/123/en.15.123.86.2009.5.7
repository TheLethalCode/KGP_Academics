 CENTURION, South Africa, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A hat-trick by off-spinner Rohit Sharma propelled the Deccan Chargers a 19-run victory over the Mumbai Indians in their Indian Premier League match on Wednesday. Sharma, who took four wickets in five balls and finished with the remarkable figures of 4-6, was named man of the match as Mumbai, chasing 146, collapsed from 97 for three after 14 overs to 126 for eight in their 20 overs. The Chargers, who ended a run of three successive losses, share first place in the standings with the Delhi Daredevils, who have a game in hand, after scoring a modest 145 for six. Sharma also shone with the bat, top-scoring 38 off 36 balls for the Chargers. His fellow spinner Tirumalsetti Suman took two key wickets and conceded just 14 runs in his four overs. Mumbai had been cruising, needing 49 runs in six overs with leading internationals JP Duminy and Dwayne Bravo at the crease. Suman struck a telling blow with the first ball of his second spell when he had Bravo (13) caught on the long-off boundary by Australian Ryan Harris. Duminy went on to score a top-class half-century off 45 deliveries but, with some rash strokes being played at the other end, Mumbai found themselves needing 38 in three overs. Sharma was brought into the attack in the 16th over and dismissed Abhishek Nayar and Harbhajan Singh with successive deliveries in his first over. Duminy (52) then edged a sweep into the gloves of wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist off the first ball of Sharma's next over and Saurabh Tiwary was stumped in the same over
