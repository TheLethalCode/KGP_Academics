 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Even if the fifth amendment to the constitution is repealed, the word 'bismillah' will be retained, the law minister said on Thursday. "The word 'Bismillah' will not be dropped; it will stay as it were. No one will tamper with it," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat. He said main opposition BNP and its long-time ally Jama'at-e-Islami were misleading the nation with false statements on the fifth amendment to the constitution. The amendment that had given constitutional legitimacy to military governments after the 1975 assassination of independence hero president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a military coup. Referring to the former law minister Moudud Ahmed's comment that the nation would face anarchy if the amendment was annulled, Shafiq said, "Only those who opposed the liberation war and the 1972 constitution are raising questions of anarchy." The High Court in a landmark ruling on Aug 29, 2005 declared the fifth amendment to the constitution illegal. The then BNP-Jamaat government on the same day appealed to the Supreme Court to stay the verdict and the judgement has been halted since. The Awami League-led government on May 3 moved the Supreme Court to cancel the government petition against the High Court judgement. The next day, the court granted BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three other lawyers permission to appeal in four weeks against that verdict. If the High court verdict was finally upheld, the law minister said, it would only revive the four basic principles on which the war of independence from Pakistan had been fought and which constituted the four basic principles of the constitution. "Through it the ideals and the conscience of the liberation war will be revived," he added. The judgment had said all the regimes from Aug 15, 1975 to 1979 headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman were illegal. The court had also ruled that the martial law promulgation was entirely illegal and unconstitutional, and hence all deliberations, laws and regulations made during the period stood automatically cancelled. b
