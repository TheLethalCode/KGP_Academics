<TEXT>
 LONDON, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libya has applied to the Scottish government for former Libyan agent Abdel Basset al Megrahi, who was convicted and jailed for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, to be sent back to his homeland. Megrahi was sentenced to life in jail for blowing up a Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town of Lockerbie as it flew from London to New York on December 18, 1988, killing all 259 people on board, including 189 Americans, and 11 people on the ground. "An application has been received for a prisoner transfer on behalf of Mr Megrahi from the Libyan authorities," a spokeswoman for the Scottish government said. She said the application would be considered in a process that could take around 90 days. Megrahi, 57, is suffering from terminal prostate cancer and has previously been denied bail on humanitarian grounds to be allowed to go home. If he is sent home, it would be the latest milestone in Libya's Muammar Gaddafi's transition from international pariah once accused by the United States of building banned weapons to a leader with increasingly normal relations with the West. Some Libyan commentators believe there could be a price to pay for Megrahi's return: awarding lucrative contracts to Western companies which want to develop the North African country's oil and gas reserves. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed in the bombing, told Reuters he would be "delighted" to see Megrahi go home, since he had never been convinced of the Libyan's guilt. "It's a tragedy that a man who is dying is being forced to remain in a prison in an alien country away from his family," Swire said. "I'd love to see him back in his own country. It would be fantastic if he went home." TRANSFER AGREEMENT The application for Megrahi to be allowed to go home was made under the terms of a Prisoner Transfer Agreement between Britain and Libya which was ratified last week. "The application will be considered by officials who will provide information and advice to Scottish ministers for decision on this matter," the spokeswoman said, adding that the process could take 90 days or more if further information is required. The PTA, which was drawn up in 2007 but had to be ratified before it could come into force, sets a framework for an application to be made, but any decision will be made by the Scottish government, since Megrahi was convicted under Scottish law. Four years after Megrahi's conviction in 2001, Libya accepted responsibility and agreed to pay some $2.7 billion in compensation to the victims' families -- a move that helped clear the way for the lifting of sanctions and the restoration of Libya's ties with Western states. Megrahi's lawyers opened a second appeal against his conviction in a Scottish court last week. The lawyers said on Wednesday they had received no instructions to drop the appeal, and it would therefore continue, but sources close to the case say it may now be withd
