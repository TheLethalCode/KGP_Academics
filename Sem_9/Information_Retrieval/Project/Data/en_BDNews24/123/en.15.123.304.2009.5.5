<TITLE> No more using ACC for political gains: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafiq Ahmed on Tuesday said the Anticorruption Commission will no more be used to score political gains. "We are trying to make sure that no-one can pull strings behind the scenes," the law minister said and added that the activity of the antigraft body in last two years under the caretaker regime gave rise to many questions in the public mind. He said the government may ask for repeal of the cases the ACC filed in last two years. "Most of the cases were filed against the political leaders during the period. Later, it was found that the cases were baseless. These cases aimed at political persecution should be withdrawn. He, however, said those cases that have ground will continue. The commission has the authority to withdraw baseless cases. There is no obstruction to continuation of the cases which have enough ground. About the cabinet approval of amendments to the anticorruption laws, the minister said: "Section 408 of the penal code was deleted from the amendment proposals raised in the cabinet meeting on Monday. "As a result, the commission will not investigate cases relating to misappropriation of money by officials in private organisations. Besides, the government has been made a party to such cases. With the amendments, the commission itself will be a party," Shafiq said. As suggested by the commission, amendments to the law were brought to reduce the backlog of cases. Section 409 of the penal code will allow the commission to investigate the cases on misappropriation of money by government officials. He said new commission chairman Golam Rahman was honest and efficient. "We think he will work in a transparent manner." On war crimes trial, the minister said: "Formation of investigation agency, prosecution cell and tribunal will take more time. The processes will be over in May-June." The law minister said the process was consuming time because the government is plugging loopholes in the trial process. The foreign observers who may come to witness the trial should have no questions about the trial, he added. bdne
