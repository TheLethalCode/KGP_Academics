<TITLE> Obama administration renews sanctions on Syria </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Friday he had renewed sanctions against Syria because it posed a continuing threat to U.S. interests, despite sending two envoys to Damascus this week to try to improve ties. In a letter notifying Congress of his decision, Obama accused Damascus of supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and missile programs, and undermining U.S. and international efforts in trying to stabilize Iraq. "For these reasons I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect the national emergency declared with respect to this threat and to maintain in force the sanctions," Obama said in the letter to Congress. The sanctions, imposed by former President George W. Bush and which are up for renewal annually, prohibit arms exports to Syria, block Syrian airlines from operating in the United States and deny Syrians suspected of being associated with terrorist groups access to the U.S. financial system. While the United States has made clear it wants better ties with Syria, which appears on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, the renewal of the sanctions shows it is not yet ready for a dramatic improvement. "We need to see concrete steps from the Syrian government to move in another direction," State Department spokesman Robert Wood told reporters. Obama signed the executive order extending the sanctions on Thursday, shortly after two U.S. envoys met Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem in Damascus. The visit by senior State Department official Jeffrey Feltman and White House National Security Council official Daniel Shapiro was their second since Obama took office in January and started talking to Damascus. TOUGH WORDS The two officials discussed Syria's role in Iraq, where Washington has accused Damascus of allowing fighters to cross into its neighbor, and Lebanon, where the United States says Syria plays a destabilizing role. "Part of Feltman's trip to the region was trying to get the Syrians to take some steps that will move us toward a better relationship," Wood said. "But there is a lot that Syria needs to do." The United States wants a commitment from Syria that it will not interfere with a June election in neighboring Lebanon, which U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited last month to show U.S. support. The administration hopes direct talks with Syria, which will continue despite the sanctions, will weaken its ties to Iran. Syria and Iran are the main backers of Hizbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim political and guerrilla group that fought a war against Israel in 2006 and has representatives in the Lebanese government and parliament. Syria's President Bashar al-Assad indicated this week he did not plan to change course. After meeting Iran's president in Damascus, he said their strategic relationship contributed to Middle East stability. The administration is reviewing whether to send back an ambassador to Damascus but a senior U.S. official said this week a decision had not yet been taken. The U.S. ambassador was pulled out of Syria after the February 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. Syria denies any involvement in the killing but the United States pointed fingers at Damascus.
