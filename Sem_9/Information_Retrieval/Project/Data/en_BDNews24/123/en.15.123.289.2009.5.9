 Yangon, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest, is suffering from low blood pressure and dehydration, her party spokesman said on Saturday. The assistant to Suu Kyi's doctor, Phone Mo Ei, was allowed to visit her at her lakeside residence on Friday and had put her on a drip, National League for Democracy (NLD) spokesman U Nyan Win told Reuters. "It took about three hours to give her necessary drips. We now have a reason to worry not only about her security, but also her health," Nyan Win said. Tin Myo Win, personal doctor of the 64-year-old Nobel laureate, was picked up by security personnel from his residence on Thursday, citing the need for questioning, he said. They did not allow Tin Myo Win to visit Suu Kyi for a monthly check-up, but allowed his assistant to do it on Friday, he said. Neighbours said they noticed more than a dozen police officers entered Suu Kyi's compound on Thursday, when an American was arrested after he had swum across a lake to her residence. Suu Kyi won an election in 1990 but never took power after the country's generals nullified the vote. She has spent more than 13 of the past 19 years under one form of detention or another.
