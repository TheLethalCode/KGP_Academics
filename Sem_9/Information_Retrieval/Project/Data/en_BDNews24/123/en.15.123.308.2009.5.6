<TITLE> High-enriched uranium traces found in Egypt: IAEA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, Wed May 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN nuclear inspectors have found traces of highly enriched uranium at a reactor complex in Egypt, according to a restricted International Atomic Energy Agency report obtained by Reuters. It did not specify whether the particles were actually weapons-grade -- enriched to a level high enough for use as fuel for an atom bomb, as opposed to fuel for some nuclear reactors. An IAEA official reached by Reuters said this was being checked. The May 5 report, describing IAEA work in 2008 to verify compliance with the Non-Proliferation Treaty, said the traces of highly enriched uranium (HEU) turned up in environmental swipe samples taken at the Inshas nuclear research site in 2007-08. The HEU was discovered alongside particles of low-enriched uranium (LEU), the type used for nuclear power plant fuel, at Inshas near Cairo where there is a research reactor complex. Egypt explained to the IAEA that it believed the HEU "could have been brought into the country through contaminated radio-isotope transport containers," the report said. It said the U.N. watchdog's inspectors had not yet verified the source of the particles but had no indications Egypt's clarification was not correct. An investigation would in any case continue to clear up the provenance of the traces, with further test sampling planned in the area. The report said Egypt in 2004-06 turned over information to the IAEA about previously undeclared nuclear activity and submitted design information about the Inshas facility, a hydrometallurgy pilot plant and a radio-isotope production site. Egypt's statements were judged consistent with IAEA findings and there were no more outstanding questions, it said. The IAEA is sensitive to possible nuclear proliferation in the conflict-ridden Middle East because of ongoing inquiries into allegations of weapons-related nuclear activity in Iran and Syria, which both countries deny, and the 2003 exposure of a covert atomic bomb program in Libya, since scra
