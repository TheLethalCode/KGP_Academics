Dr Sanawar Hossain, director of medical services and consultant surgery, of Square Hospital, where Dr Miah is being treated, told bdnews24.com at 10:15am his condition was unchanged. "He is not out of danger yet," Dr Hossain said on Wednesday night. "[However] such strain of a disease bears risks." Dr Hossain said, "His arrhythmia developed this [Wednesday] morning." "No medicine was reacting to this. [So] He was immediately given temporary pace-making aid." "His condition has been improving since." Dr Miah was being given cardio respiratory support in Cardiology Surgical ICU, Dr Hossain added. The nuclear physicist has been undergoing treatment at Square Hospital since Apr 7, he said. The former chairman of Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission has long been suffering from heart and kidney problems, high blood pressure and diabetes.
