 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, May 5 (bdnews24.com)The government has commissioned a Tk 487 crore project for a feasibility study to reduce air pollution and traffic gridlock in five cities including Dhaka, the planning minister said Tuesday. A meeting of the Executive Committee of The National Economic Council (ECNEC) chaired by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina approved the project for Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet and Barisal city corporations and northern Bogra municipality, AK Khandker told reporters after the meeting. The Fresh Air and Sustainable Environment Feasibility Study project is expected to start from July and complete by June 2014.
