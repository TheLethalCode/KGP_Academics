 HEBRON, West Bank, May 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli troops killed an unarmed Palestinian at the entrance to a contested biblical shrine in the occupied West Bank Wednesday, a military spokesman said. The Palestinian drew the attention of paramilitary policemen guarding the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron by trying to avoid a security checkpoint at the entrance, he said. "They (troops) ordered the suspect to halt for inspection, and when he didn't stop, they went through the arrest procedure," the military spokesman said. "When that didn't work, they opened fire at the suspect. He was killed." This account could not be independently confirmed. The West Bank is under nominal control of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who has instituted a security drive and tried to advance peace talks with Israel since breaking with Islamist Hamas over its 2007 seizure of the Gaza Strip. Diplomatic progress has been stymied by continued Israeli-Palestinian fighting in Gaza and the advent of a right-leaning government in Israel that has balked at the US-endorsed vision of establishing a Palestinian state. Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has proposed focusing on security and economic issues. He announced Wednesday the formation of a ministerial panel to encourage economic projects in the West Bank cities of Jericho, Jenin and an ancient baptism site on the Jordan River. Palestinians say such measures would be merely palliative if there is no progress toward their national independence. THIRTY SHOTS The Palestinian shot in Hebron was not immediately identified and there was no comment on the incident from armed factions who keep a relatively low profile in the West Bank. Palestinians at the Cave, a site holy to Muslims and Jews, reported hearing some 30 shots but there were no Palestinian eyewitness accounts immediately forthcoming. "Initial indications are that the suspect was not armed," the military spokesman said. An Israeli policeman was lightly wounded by a bullet fragment. Hebron is the second-largest Palestinian city in the West Bank, which Israel captured along with Gaza in a 1967 war. It is also home to several hundred hardline Jewish settlers whose tiny enclave abuts the Cave and is closely guarded by Israeli forces. Using an army-issued rifle, a settler massacred Palestinians at prayer in the Cave in 1994, prompting Israel to step up security precautions and the segregation of Muslims from Jews. In Gaza, Israeli aircraft bombed three tunnels used to smuggle in arms from neighboring Egypt Wednesday, the military said, calling the sortie a response to a spate of cross-border mortar and rocket attacks by Palestinians. Palestinian witnesses said no one was hurt in the Israeli air strikes
