 LONDON, May 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief Premier League news ahead of the weekend matches (times GMT): Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso will miss Liverpool's away game against West Ham on Saturday (1630) with bruising he sustained when Newcastle United's Joey Barton clattered into him at Anfield last weekend. Striker Fernando Torres (hamstring) and Javier Mascherano (ankle) have recovered sufficiently to make the squad for Liverpool, who must win and keep hoping leaders Manchester United slip up. Manchester United will be without defender Wes Brown for Sunday's derby against Manchester City (1230). Manager Alex Ferguson said Brown, who had surgery on his foot in January, would not play again this season. United, who booked their place in the Champions League final in midweek, need only seven points from their last four games to clinch the league title. Fourth-placed Arsenal have also had bad injury news, losing French fullback Gael Clichy, absent since April 7, for the rest of the season with a back problem. There is some doubt over Andrei Arshavin's fitness ahead of their home game with Chelsea on Sunday (1500) as the Russian was sent home with flu on Friday. Newcastle United manager Alan Shearer has hinted at a recall for striker Michael Owen, praising his attitude in training as "fantastic". With three games remaining, Newcastle are in 18th place, three points adrift of Hull City in the safety of 17th and with goal difference keeping them ahead of fellow north-east strugglers Middlesbrough, their opponents on Monday (1900). "Owen has certainly given me something to think about because we need to win the game," Shearer told the club's website (www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk). Hull captain Ian Ashbee will miss the club's remaining three fixtures after rupturing his knee at Aston Villa on Monday. Hull host Stoke City on Saturday (1400). Tottenham Hotspur's midfielder Jamie O'Hara will undergo knee surgery, forcing him out for the club's final three games, starting away to Everton on Saturday
