 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Two Awami League MPs have proposed constitutional changes to make it mandatory to display the portrait of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at all government offices. Imaj Uddin Pramanik, MP from a Naogaon constituency, and Aslamul Haq, the Dhaka-14 MP, in two separate private member bills proposed an amendment to the article 4 (a) of the constitution to that effect. The parliamentary standing committee on private members' bills and resolutions on Thursday at its first meeting discussed the two bills but did not approve them. Shajahan Khan, a committee member, told bdnews24.com after the meeting that all the members had agreed in principle to make a constitutional provision to display Sheikh Mujib's portraits. Haq in his constitution amendment bill also proposed deleting the article 58 (c) (6) of the constitution to debar the president from assuming the office of caretaker head after an elected government ran its term. In another proposal, he said the article 58 (D) should include a provision to hold general elections in 90 days since the assumption of the caretaker government. "We have decided to invite the two MPs at the next meeting to hear them about the justification of the bills," Abdul Matin Khasru, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "We will discuss the bill thoroughly at our next meetings," said Khasru, a former law minister. "Though we have not made our final recommendations today, I think the bill will eventually be endorsed by the committee and parliament," Khan, the meber, told bdnews24.com. "All ruling party MPs and the committee members are in favour of displaying Bangabandhu's portraits at all government offices," he said. The proposal says it will be obligatory to display his portrait along with the heads of state and government at the offices of president, prime minister, speaker, Bangladesh missions abroad, all government, semi-government, autonomous bodies and educational institutions. The Awami League government in its 1996-2001 term passed a private member bill, initiated by its MP Dewan Farid Gazi, in 2001 to make a provision of displaying the portrait of Sheikh Mujib in the offices. But the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami government in 2002 passed the only private member bill in the last parliament, initiated by BNP MP Shamsul Alam Pramanik, to repeal the law. Shamsul Alam Pramanik and Imaj Uddin Pramanik hail from the same constituency. The BNP in 2004 amended the constitution and inserted the article 4 (a) which stipulated that the portraits of the incumbent president must be displayed at the offices of president, prime minister, speaker and Bangladesh missions. The law made it compulsory to display the prime minister's portrait at all government, semi-government, autonomous offices, and educational institutions in addition to the offices of president, prime minister, speaker and the missions abroad. The Awami League government after winning the Dec 29 general elections issued an executive order for the display of Sheikh Mujib's portrait. Elections in three months Aslamul Haq in his proposal said former president Iajuddin Ahmed had assumed the office of the caretaker government head in Oct 2006, violating the constitution. "Therefore, the provision of article 58 (c) (6) should go," he said justifying his bill in the preamble. He also said the 2007-2008 caretaker government stayed for about two years instead of its mandated tenure of three months. "So, the article 58 (D) of the constitution should make it clear that the caretaker government must not stay more than 90 days," he said. In another amendment proposal, Haq said the article 123 (4) of the constitution had not mentioned that the MPs after their death or resignation would lose their posts. "That is why, the article should read that MPs would lose their membership after their resignation or death," he added.
