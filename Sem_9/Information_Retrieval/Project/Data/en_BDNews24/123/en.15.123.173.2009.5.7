 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)Call to make thalassaemia screening compulsory in marriage registration came from a group on the eve of World Thalassaemia Day on Friday. Bangladesh Society of Haematology aired a 17-point charter of demands at a discussion meeting at the National Press Club in Dhaka on Thursday Thalassemia is genetically transmitted blood disorder that prevents production of haemoglobin, the blood protein that carries oxygen in the body. According to the World Health Organisation, around 4 percent people are carriers of beta thalassaemia in Bangladesh., said Dr Salahuddin Shah, general secretary of the society. Each year around 6000 children are born with the disease, he said. Thalassaemia causes iron deficiency in the body like anaemia which can be cured by taking medicine or iron-rich food but it cannot be cured by taking medicine. Its treatments include regular blood transfusion and bone marrow transplantation, among others. A person who has one thalassaemia gene is said to have the thalassaemia trait. He remains healthy but can pass the gene on to his children. If both parents carry thalassaemia trait then the chance of having a child with thalassaemia, then the chance of having a child with thalassaemia trait is 50 percent. If only one parent carry thalassaemia trait then the chance of having a child with thalassaemia trait is 25 percent and the chance of normal child is 50 percent. The other demands are introducing haematology department in all government medical colleges, modernising blood banks, setting up DNA lab in at the BSMMU, setting up bone marrow transplantation centre, giving subsidy on medicines used for removing excess iron from the body and forming a thalassaemia federation. Tourism minister GM Quader put emphasis on starting a social movement for having mandatory thalassaemia certificate in marriage registration. Prof Md Jamilur Rahman, president of the society, and ABAM Yunus, professor of the haematology at BSMMU, were present also attended. b
