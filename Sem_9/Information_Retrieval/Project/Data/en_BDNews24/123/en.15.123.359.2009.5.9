 Dhaka, May 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Saturday followed in the footsteps of the Board of Control for Cricket in India in announcing a general amnesty to those Bangladeshi cricketers who joined the unapproved Indian Cricket League last year. "The board has decided to allow Bangladeshi cricketers under contract with the Indian Cricket League to participate in domestic cricket subject to their termination of the contract with the ICL by 15 June 2009," BCB spokesman and media committee chairman Jalal Younus told reporters after emerging from the board meeting at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. He also added that the players who would terminate the contract had to formally apply to the BCB for permission for making themselves available for the forthcoming domestic season. However, the players would not be considered for selection in any international match until 31 December 2009, he added. Some 14 Bangladeshi cricketers, including Habibul Bashar, Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed joined the rebel ICL in September, 2008 scrapping their contracts with the BCB who then banned all of them from domestic as well as international cricket for 10 years. Apart from the decision on the banned cricketers, the meeting also decided that the Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium and the Narayanganj Osmani Stadium in Fatullah will be the nominated venues for holding matches of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011. Meanwhile, the Bangabandhu National Stadium will stage the opening ceremony of the ICC World Cup while alternate venues for the ICC CWC 2011 would be developed in Chittagong and Khulna from the BCB's own resources. The Board also approved the constitution for the Divisional Cricket Association and sanctioned a grant of Tk 3 lakh for ailing former national cricket coach Syed Altaf Hossain as well as Tk 2 lakh for the family of late Sajjadul Alam Setu, a first class cricketer who died in a tragic road accident in Khulna on 16 March 2009.
