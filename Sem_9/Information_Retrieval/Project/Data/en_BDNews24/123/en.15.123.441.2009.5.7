<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Thursday declared the detention order of former deputy speaker Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui illegal and directed authorities to release him immediately if he is not indicted in other cases. The verdict from the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam came on writ petition of Siddiqui . During the final hearing of writ, additional attorney general MK Rahman represented the state while lawyer Afzal H Khan defended Siddiqui. After the ruling, Khan briefed reporters on the judgement. On Apr 5, on the writ petition filed by Faria Tajin Siddiqui, the court asked the government to explain why the detention order was not illegal. Police filed a sedition case against Siddiqui, also an opposition BNP leader, taking the number of cases against him to five since his arrest on Mar. 21 by the Detective Branch at his home under the Special Powers Act. Naogaon district's Mahadevpur police chief Ilias Fakir charged Siddiqui with conspiring against the government, predicting deaths of scores of Awami League supporters, spreading rumour on BDR mutiny, among others. He was ordered into a month's detention, without being charged, under the Special Powers Act. Later the government extended his detention for three more months on Apr 16. Fakir had quoted Siddiqui as telling him: "This government will fall within the next two months and lakhs of Awami League supporters will die." The OC claimed Siddiqui had made the statement and personally threatened Fakir after inviting him to his home on Mar. 19. By Mar 29, four cases and two general diaries ranging from physical assault to extortion were filed against the former deputy speaker. Fakir also quoted Siddiqui as saying. "After the Peelkhana incident, don't you see where the country is heading to? You will understand if you hear 'the CD'." bdn
