 Dhaka, May 10 (bdnews24.com)Hundreds of students of private-run North South University on Sunday took to the street on its Banani campus against semester fee hike and clashed with police. They started staging protests at around 10:30am and blocked the Kemal Ataturk Avenue for half an hour, said Gulshan zone assistant police commissioner Harun-ar-Rashid. The protesters vandalised the administrative building. Police fired tear gas shells to disperse the demonstrators who retaliated by hurling stones, triggering sporadic chases and counter-chases. Later police clubbed the students. Gulshan zone deputy police commissioner Hafiz Akter said three policemen were injured in the clashes. Later they blocked the street on the campus and locked up teachers inside the building. The authorities hiked each credit fee to Tk 5,500 from Tk 4,000, said Ashfaq Alam, a student of the last semester. University's public relations officer Masudur Rahman said the credit fee for the existing students was hiked to Tk 4,500, while it will be Tk 5,500 for those who seeking new admission. Masudur Rahman said the university was yet to reach a decision on the demand of the students. Authorities had told students that they would not increase the fees when agitations had started in February. But the hike was announced this month, Alam, the student, said. Students, who came to pay fees in the morning, found the new notice and started demonstrations without depositing the money. The authorities then sought one and a half hours from the students to resolve the issue but failed, prompting the students to pour out onto the streets. bdnews24.
