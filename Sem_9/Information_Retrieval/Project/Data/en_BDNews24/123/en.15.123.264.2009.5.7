 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Sports Club set up a Port City Twenty20 Cricket League semi-final meeting against Chittagong Abahani after emerging Group B champions with a slim seven-run win over Ispahani SC in Chittagong on Thursday. Dhaka Sports Club led by Rajin Saleh restricted Ispahani to 130-8 in the stipulated 20 after making a modest 137-8 at the MA Aziz Stadium. Chittagong Abahani kept their unbeaten run with a 21-run victory over Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Group B final match but they could not topple table-toppers Brothers Union, who emerged group champions on better run rate. However, the semi-finalist from Group B is yet to be confirmed and it will be decided on Friday before the both semi-finals on Saturday. Opting to bat, Dhaka Sports Club were reduced to 38-2 inside six overs before opener Wasim Nayeem, who struck a blazing 43-ball 79 in the previous match, came to the rescue again with 42 off 43 balls leaving the side at 72-3 in 11.4 overs. Dhaka Sports slipped to 104-6 in 16.4 overs before Ziaur Rahman gave the bowlers something to defend with a cameo 36 off 21 balls that included four sixes. Ispahani, in reply, got off to a fine start with a 44-run opening partnership before being reduced to 56-3 in 9 overs following double strikes from Wasim Nayeem. Despite the collapse, it seemed Ispahani were on course with Jeevan Mendis (35) and Sagir Hossain (15) at the crease but pacer Sahadat Hossain Razib removed both batsmen in the 17th over to slow Ispahani's progress, who then were reduced to 104-6 after Ejaj Ahmed fell short of the crease in the same over. Shahadat was adjudged man of the match for his double strike that changed the fate of Ispahani, who finally ended up with 130-8. In the other match, Abahani posted a fighting 153-8 in 20 overs thanks to a 63-run knock from C Silva, who put on 57 runs along with one-down Hannan Sarkar after openers Tamim Iqbal (10) and Robiul Islam (2) returned cheaply. Hannan played a 26-ball 36 hitting three fours and two sixes while Silva's innings was studded with six fours and one six in 50 balls. In reply, Mohammedan faced a top order collapse to be reduced to 18-3 inside four overs and never recovered from the damage. Only middle order batsmen Istiak Ahmed (36), Qaser Abbas (41) and Nayyer Abbas (22) produced some resistance. Frank D Kapunarathne (3-30) and Talha Jubair (3-21) shared six wickets to restrict Mohammedan to 132-9 in the stipulated 20 overs. bd
