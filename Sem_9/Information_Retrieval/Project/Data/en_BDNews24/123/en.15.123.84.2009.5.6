Brothers Union bundled Top Sports out for 88 in 15.5 overs after posting a fighting total of 148-8 in the stipulated 20 overs. The triumph of Brothers also enabled Chittagong Abahani to enter the last four though Abahani still have a match against Chittagong Mohammedan on Thursday. Dhaka Sports Club also brightened their semi-final chances with two successive victories after handing a six-wicket defeat to Pirates of Chittagong in the day's first match, thanks to fireworks from Pakistani Wasim Nayeem. Chasing Brothers Union's 148, Top Sports lost the wickets of Nazmus Sadat (1), Sanwar Hossain (5), Roqibul Hasan (0) and Lokuarachchi (7) before Weeraratha and Mahmudullah produced some resistance putting on 26 and 37 respectively. At one stage, Top Sports were tottering at 86-7 in 15 overs and Younus came to bowl his third over and trapped Mahmudullah with his third delivery and them picked up the remaining two batsmen with successive deliveries to achieve a rare feat as well as wrap up the opponents innings.

In the second match, Pirates of Chittagong, who chose to bat, put up a challenging total of 156-4 in 20 overs but could not defend it as Wasim was at his destructive best to steer Dhaka Sports home with eight balls to spare. Wasim faced 43 balls to crack 79 that featured six sixes and as many boundaries while Anisur Rahman and Rashed Hanif came up with 29 and 15 respectively to reach 161-4 in 18.4 overs.
