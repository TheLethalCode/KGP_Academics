 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)The two-day Supreme Court Bar Association polls began Monday, with advocate Asadullah casting the maiden vote at 10 am, followed by presidential candidate advocate Mujibur Rahman. The SCBA has introduced transparent ballot boxes for the first time. The bar association and its election committee said the elections kicked off as scheduled at 10am Monday to continue through Tuesday. On both days, vote casting and other electoral activities will continue from 10am to 5pm. The election earlier scheduled for March 24-25 was deferred by about five weeks in the face of a government ban order, subsequently lifted after a MoU executed between the SCBA and the government. The candidates contesting for president's chair are barrister Shafique Ahmed, advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, AK Mujibor Rahman, Humayun Hossain Khan, Sirajul Islam Khan and Saifur Reza. Barristers Abdullah Al Mamun, barrister Badruddoza Badal, advocates Sheikh Ausafur Rahman, Nurul Islam Sujan, ABM Bayezid, AKM Zahirul Haque and ASM Abul Hossain are contesting for SCBA post of secretary. There are six candidates contesting for two posts of vice president, two for a treasurer, five for two deputy secretary positions and 14 candidates against seven member chairs. Some 1,780 lawyers have registered as voters for the election. Security measures have been tightened in and around the Supreme Court premises in view of the two-day elections. bdnew
