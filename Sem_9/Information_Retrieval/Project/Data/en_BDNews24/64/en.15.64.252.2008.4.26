<TEXT>
 NOVO-OGARYOVO, Russia, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda met Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday for talks that were likely to focus on climate change and a decades-old dispute over a group of Pacific islands. A senior Japanese official said Fukuda will urge Russia to accelerate talks aimed at resolving the territorial row over the islands, a running sore in relations that has prevented the two states from signing a peace treaty ending World War Two. "Over the past two to three years we have been able to qualitatively change the character of our relations," Putin told Fukuda at the opening of talks at the Russian presidential residence in Novo-Ogaryovo, outside Moscow. "We are continuing dialogue on the peace treaty and will create the necessary conditions for advancement along this path," Putin said. The Russian leader said bilateral trade had soared although "there still exist many unresolved problems". Fukuda will have talks later with Dmitry Medvedev, who will be sworn in as head of state on May 7. Putin, who is stepping down after eight years as president, will stay on as prime minister and leader of the biggest party. The main aims of Fukuda's visit are to "establish a personal relationship of trust with President Putin and president-elect Medvedev, and second, to prepare for the upcoming G8 summit", said a Japanese foreign ministry official. The islands, known in Russia as the Southern Kuriles and in Japan as the Northern Territories, were seized by Soviet troops in the last days of World War Two. They lie just north of the northern island of Hokkaido where Japan will host this year's Group of Eight summit. Japan has placed finding a more effective replacement for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which expires in 2012, at the top of the summit agenda. Tokyo hopes the G8 summit will help draft a climate change agreement that would embrace the biggest polluters such as the United States, China and India. None of these has signed up to the Kyoto Protocol's limits on emissions. Russia, a G8 member, was one of the biggest emerging economies to sign up to Kyoto commitments. Japanese officials hope Moscow will support a successor agreement in Hokkaido. PERSONAL RELATIONS Fukuda will urge the Russian leaders to accelerate talks aimed at resolving the territorial row, a senior Japanese government official said. "Prime Minister Fukuda is expected to tell them that it is indispensable for the two countries to advance negotiations in a concrete fashion in order to elevate bilateral ties to a higher dimension," the official said. Russia has said it is ready to talk about the dispute, but has given no sign it is prepared to give up the islands. "There is no change in our position. We do not expect any breakthroughs (in the talks with Fukuda)," said a Kremlin official. Trade between Russia and Japan was worth $20 billion in 2007, fuelled by automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp which has set up a factory to tap into the booming Russian market. But trade is far smaller than the volumes between Russia and its biggest trading partner, the European Union. Japanese firms have taken stakes in vast oil and gas projects on Russia's Pacific Sakhalin island, and a pipeline is under construction that will eventually deliver oil from eastern Siberia to the Pacific coast.
