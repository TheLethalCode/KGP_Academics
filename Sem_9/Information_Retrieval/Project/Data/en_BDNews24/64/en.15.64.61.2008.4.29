 Bagdad,Tue Apr 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces killed 34 militiamen in fierce clashes in and around a Baghdad stronghold of Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr on Tuesday, the US military said. Lieutenant-Colonel Steven Stover, a spokesman for the US military in the Iraqi capital, said the gunmen had been killed in a series of battles that began just after midnight and which raged for hours. Stover did not immediately have details on the latest clashes or say if there were US or Iraqi troop casualties. Security forces have been battling militiamen loyal to the anti-American cleric in his Sadr City slum bastion for weeks. Fighting flared up on Sunday when gunmen used the cover of dust storms to launch attacks on US and Iraqi positions. The attacks indicate some fighters claiming allegiance to Sadr are ignoring his call for a truce to be observed, raising questions about how far he controls them and whether he is sincere about wanting to defuse the conflict. The deaths brought the number of militants the US says it killed since a flare-up of violence on Sunday evening to 79. Sources in Sadr City's two hospitals, who declined to be identified, had earlier said they had received the bodies of 10 people and treated 50 others wounded in clashes since Monday night. They could not confirm whether the casualties were all men or if women and children were among them. Militants who claim loyalty to Sadr have stepped up attacks against US forces in Sadr City under cover of blinding desert sand storms that first enveloped the capital on Sunday. The storms have grounded US Apache attack helicopters which hunt rocket and mortar teams, enabling fighters to fire salvoes of rockets at targets in Baghdad, including its heavily fortified Green Zone government and diplomatic compound. Four US soldiers were killed in rocket or mortar attacks in Baghdad on Monday, the military said. Stover also said US troops recovered three 81 mm Iranian-made mortars on Tuesday. The US military accuses Iran of supplying weapons and training to rogue elements of Sadr's Mehdi Army militia, a charge Tehran denies. US and Iraqi troops have been locked in a month of fighting with militiamen since Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shia, ordered an offensive in the southern oil city of Basra. After early setbacks, the militiamen appear to have been driven from the streets in Basra. But fighting has continued in Baghdad, mostly around Sadr City. Also on Tuesday, a roadside bomb killed Dhiyaa al-Judi, director-general of projects at the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in eastern Baghdad, police said
