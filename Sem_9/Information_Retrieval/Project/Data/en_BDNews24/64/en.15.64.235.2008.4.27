<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)US energy firm Chevron put on hold its seismic survey in the reserved forests of Lauachhara in Moulavibazar, a director of the company said Sunday. "Work on the three-dimensional survey in Lauachhara has been suspended because of a fire in the forests," Chevron director (external affairs) Naser Ahmed told bdnews24.com. He denied an allegation of locals that Chevron was responsible for the fire. "I think the matter should be investigated. Chevron formed an investigation to look into the matter," he said. Chevron began the six-month survey in Moulavibazar gasfield. Over 100 houses close to Lauachhara Jatiya Udyan developed cracks after the US company started its survey, locals said. They blamed the cracks on the seismic survey saying the company was making underground explosions. Many animals entered the neighbourhoodscared of big bang and mild quakes. bdnews24.com's Moulavibazar correspondent found at least 35 houses in Dilbar area and 20 in Madhabpur with cracks. Chevron's chief executive of Bangladesh Steve Wilson said the company was conducting the survey ensuring all necessary measures to protect the environment as it was aware of the environmental sensitivity of the area. Jalal Ahmed, chairman of the Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation or Petrobangla, told Reuters on Sunday: "We have sent a team to determine the real causes and extent of damages of the forest and until they come back can not say anything." Officials of Chevron said there was so far no evidence the fire was connected to its seismic activities. "From initial reports, it appears that the fire had no major impact on the wildlife or the environment with superficial damage on the ground and limited impact on trees," the company said in a statement. Wilson added: "We are shocked to hear about the fire. At this stage we do not know the cause of it and there is no evidence to link it to Chevron activities, but we have launched an investigation to determine the cause. "In the meantime we have suspected all activities in the forest until we hear preliminary finding from the investigation. We are committed to protect people and the environment everywhere we work, particularly in sensitive areas like the Lauachhara forest in Bangladesh." Chevron produces 70 million cubic feet of gas a day from the field. Chevron has invested $820 million in Bangladesh, making it the biggest investor in the country's energy sector.
