<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 28 (bdnews24.com)  The deep depression over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining southeast Bay moved slightly northwards, concentrated into a cyclonic storm "Nargis", a special weather bulletin issued early afternoon Monday said. The depression was centred at 12 noon Monday about 1245 kms south west of Chittagong port, 1175 kms south west of Cox's Bazar port and 1130 kms south-southwest of Mongla Port. It is likely to intensity further and move in a northerly direction. Maximum sustained wind speed within 54 kms of the storm centre is about 62 km per hour, rising to 88 km per hour in gusts/squalls. The sea will remain rough over the north Bay and very rough near the system centre. Maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been asked to lower distant cautionary signal number 1 and hoist distant warning signal number 2 instead. All fishing boats and trawlers plying in the north Bay and in deep sea have been asked to stay near the coast and proceed with caution until further order. bd
