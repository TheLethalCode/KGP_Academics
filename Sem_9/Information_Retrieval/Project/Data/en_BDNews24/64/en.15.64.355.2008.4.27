 MOSCOW, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vera Zvonareva beat Vania King 4-6 6-3 6-2 in the first reverse singles on Sunday to give Russia an insurmountable 3-0 lead over the United States in their Fed Cup semi-final and send the holders into the final. Russia will appear in their fourth final in the last five years in September when they take on Spain, who beat China in Beijing. The 115th-ranked King stunned Zvonareva, a late addition to Russia's line-up, by winning the opening set after breaking the world number 14 in the ninth game. It was the first set won by the U.S. team against the hosts in the two-day tie on the red clay of Moscow's Luzhniki arena. The Russian, who replaced world number four Svetlana Kuznetsova for the match, broke in the sixth game of the second set to level the match. After regaining her confidence, Zvonareva broke the American to love in the third game of the final set, then repeated the trick four games later to win the match after one hour 52 minutes. "It was my first match on red clay in almost two years," Zvonareva, who has battled various injuries in the past year but reached the final of last week's Family Circle Cup on green clay in Charleston, told reporters. "That's why I was a little nervous at the start of the match but I was able to overcome the early nerves and score the winning point for our team.
