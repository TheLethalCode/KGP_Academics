<TITLE> Premier Hockey League begins Tuesday </TITLE>

 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Green Delta Premier Hockey League gets underway Tuesday with most of the participating clubs demanding foreign umpires to conduct the matches. "We had a meeting with the eight club representatives Sunday and they had demanded foreign umpires, but we told them that we were trying to bring them and hope that two Indian umpires will arrive in Dhaka in the first week of May," Ehtesham Sultan, general secretary of the league committee, told a press conference Monday. It is nothing new for the clubs to demand foreign umpires in the league, but the clubs' claim this time has been strengthened following two chaos-filled semifinals of the season's curtain-raiser tournament of the Club Cup Hockey. It was seen that the players, including giants Abahani, Mohammedan, Usha and minnow Sonali Bank, surrounded the umpires and even roughed up the umpires whenever the decisions went against them during the Club Cup semifinals. Besides, clubs' officials also blamed the chaos for poor refereeing. "We have no professional umpire. That's why we have been suffering," Ehtesham said, "Most of the existing umpires have even not shown their interest in umpiring and the problem will not be solved unless the number of umpires is increased." Asked why they had not taken proper action against those players found guilty in line with umpires' reports, Sultan said, "They could not take action against the players because of the protest of the clubs, who threatened to boycott the tournament." The league committee secretary, however, said they would take tough action against the players if they are found guilty in the league. Bangladesh Hockey Federation general secretary Sajed AA Adel said they are going to frame a code of conduct to keep the players away from the disarray during the matches. Joint champions Abahani will take on newcomers Wari Club in the inaugural match at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. Adel said that there would be no relegation this season as the governing body of the federation had earlier decided not to demote any team considering the financial problems. A total of 10 teams will play the round-robin league and top five teams will qualify for the Super League. The standing will be decided on the basis of points earned from both the rounds. The league committee has decided that each club could play three foreign players in each match against three registrations. BHF treasurer Kazi Moinuzzaman Pila and the Green Delta Insurance Company general manager Nazim Tazik Chowdhury were also present. The sponsor company has given the federation Tk 20 lakh to conduct the premier, the first and the second division hockey leagues for three seasons, and this will be the second season as the 2007 season saw no league held.
