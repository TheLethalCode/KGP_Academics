 MANCHESTER, England April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said he was delighted it had fallen to Paul Scholes to score the matchwinning goal as the Old Trafford club booked a place in the Champions League final on Tuesday. Scholes missed United's 1999 European Cup triumph through suspension, but Ferguson confirmed the long-serving midfielder would be the first name on his team sheet for the final in Moscow after he secured a 1-0 aggregate win over Barcelona. Scholes' superb long-range strike was only the second goal the 33-year-old has scored this season but it was enough to secure United a third final. "It was a fantastic goal. I don't think we can expect Paul Scholes to score 10-15 goals a season as he used to when he was younger but he certainly delivered one for us tonight," Ferguson told reporters. "It makes up for all the goals he can't score because of his age now. It was a marvellous moment for him. "He has come through the ranks here and is one of the great players this club has had." Team-mate Michael Carrick agreed. "It was an awesome strike. It's got to be up there with his best. In a game like this and on a night like this to cap it with a goal like that is something special." Ferguson paid tribute to the way his side secured a priceless clean sheet on a tension-filled night to set up an all-English final against either Liverpool or Chelsea on May 21. "We are delighted. We needed a fantastic performance tonight and we got one. There were several things that won us the game, obviously the concentration at the back and up front we could have scored three or four goals. "We are in the final. That's the important thing and I think we've got a fantastic chance, no matter who we play. This club deserves to be in the final with its history. It's fantastic." United were led to victory by captain Rio Ferdinand, who gave an outstanding defensive display in front of England coach Fabio Capello. "We had to dig in so deep but we managed to get there," Ferdinand said. "We had discipline and a moment of quality from a fantastic player in Paul Scholes. What a goal it was and then we were resilient and stayed together. "I don't care who it is in the final. We will be waiting and whoever comes we will be ready
