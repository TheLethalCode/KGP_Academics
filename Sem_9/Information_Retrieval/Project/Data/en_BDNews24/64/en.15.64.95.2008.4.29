 Rome, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gianni Alemanno, a close ally of Prime Minister-elect Silvio Berlusconi, won a run-off election for mayor of Rome on Monday, becoming the first right-winger to run Italy's capital since the fascists in 1943. Alemanno, 50, a member of the right-wing National Alliance party who ran on a law-and-order campaign, won with 53.7 percent, according to preliminary results. Francesco Rutelli, a former Rome mayor from the centre-left Democratic Party, took 46.3. The win was an unexpected bonus for Berlusconi, whose centre-right overwhelmingly won an April 13-14 national election and already holds power in the financial capital, Milan. Berlusconi hailed it as a "historic victory" that "cemented our success" at the national election. The National Alliance, one of Berlusconi's two main allies, has tried to ditch its fascist roots over the past decade and turn into a mainstream conservative force. But Alemanno has come under attack for wearing a Celtic cross round his neck -- a symbol of the far right in Italy, where a 1993 law compared it to the Nazi swastika. "I'll be the mayor of all Romans," Alemanno said after his victory over the centre left, which has run Rome for most of the past 30 years and continuously since 1993. "A system of power that seemed perfect has collapsed and disappeared," said Alemanno, who served as Agriculture Minister in Berlusconi's last governments. CENTRE LEFT IN DISARRAY Commentators say losing the city of 2.5 million after 15 years leaves the centre left in disarray, compounding its defeat in the national election. With its wealth of archaeological treasures, Renaissance art and churches, Rome is a tourists' paradise that attracts millions of visitors every year. But residents complain about its traffic jams, poor public transport, pot-holed and dirty streets, high housing costs, neglected suburbs and immigrant shacks mushrooming as slums on the banks of the Tiber River. In the past few months, a string of crimes blamed on immigrants has also shot to the top of the political agenda, playing into the hands of the centre right. The last days of campaigning for the run-off on Sunday and Monday were dominated by debate on safety after the widely publicised rape of a student from Lesotho on Rome's outskirts on April 17. A Romanian immigrant has been arrested. Alemanno has pledged to reinforce law and order and crack down on immigrants.
