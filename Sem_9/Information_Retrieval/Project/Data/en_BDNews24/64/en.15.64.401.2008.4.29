<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court Tuesday ended hearing the government appeal against a High Court verdict that scrapped the extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The Supreme Court full bench led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin heard the final arguments in the hearing that went on for eight days. The court did not set a date for the verdict, though the judgement is expected any day. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed told the court during the hearing: "A writ petition was filed challenging the legality of taking the case under the emergency powers rules (EPR); the petition did not appeal for scrapping the case, but the High Court did so beyond law." The Appellate Division approved the government appeal filed against the High Court order on Feb 26. The apex court also ordered freezes on the execution of the High Court verdict and proceedings in the trial court. The government filed a regular appeal against the verdict on Feb 18. On Feb 6, the High Court scrapped the case and declared illegal the inclusion of the case under the EPR. Businessman Chowdhury filed the case alleging extortion worth Tk 3 crore with Gulshan Police Station against Sheikh Hasina and her cousin former health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim on June 13 last year. Later Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana was made an accused in the charge sheet. According to case details, the accused took bribes of Tk 3 crore at different times in 2001 from the businessman in exchange for awarding contracts of Siddhirganj power station when the Awami League was in power. Hasina, the Awami League chief, was arrested on July 16 last year and the case was taken under the cover of the EPR the same day. bdne
