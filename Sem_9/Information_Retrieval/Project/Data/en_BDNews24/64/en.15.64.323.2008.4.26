 Chittagong, April 26 (bdnews24.com)The Chittagong Port Authority has invited tenders from the private sector for the handling of Chittagong Container Terminal. CPA chairman commodore M Faruque said Saturday that the bids were being sought to hand over responsibility for operating the terminal, including a temporary expansion of the New Mooring Container Terminal, in a coordinated way. At a views' exchange meeting at the Chittagong Development Authority training centre, on the occasion of the 121st anniversary of Chittagong Port, the port authority chairman said tender papers would be issued from Apr 27 to May 21. Notices inviting bids from interested firms have already been posted, Faruque said. The last date for submission of tenders is May 22, with the tenders being opened on the day. "A single firm will be given the responsibility to operate the terminal for the next seven years on condition of employing its own machinery and equipment in phases," the CPA chairman said. "The days of doing business using the port's machinery and equipment were over," he added. "From now on any firm interested to do business in the port will have to come forward with its own investment." The CPA will gradually hand over port management including machinery and manpower to the private sector, Faruque said. "The port authority will retain the responsibility for monitoring the overall activities." At present, Saif Powertech Limited is conducting the coordinated activities of container supply along with loading and unloading of goods from ships at the Chittagong Container Terminal. The agreement with the private firm expires on Aug 6. Operations at the terminal will be handed over the following day for a seven-year term. The potential profit over seven years for a private handler is considerable, around Tk four crore per month on an average, Faruque said. "This is why we are making the condition that the winning firm also invest in new machinery and equipment." "If the formalities of the tender process can be completed by June, and sent to the shipping and commerce ministries for scrutiny and approval, the work order for operating Chittagong Container Terminal could be issued on time," Faruque said. The CPA chairman said that if competition in the sector increased, port authorities would also be benefited. He mentioned that transparency would be maintained at every level from invitation and scrutiny of tenders to awarding the contract, adding that no irregularities in this regard would be tolerated. In reply to a question, he said that there would be no scope of resorting to unfair means in awarding the contract, as in the case of GATCO. "Only those who participate in the tender process accepting the conditions on protecting the interest of the port will be given the opportunity to compete," the port authority chief said. bdnews
