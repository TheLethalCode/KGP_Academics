 WASHINGTON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House said on Monday there was no short-term fix to record-high gasoline prices and the United States should try to increase domestic production and seek alternative fuel sources.

Perino said it will take time to develop technologies that will allow for vehicles to travel farther on a gallon of gasoline. "It's going to take a while to get those technologies changing, but we're trying to move farther and faster, especially in regards to SUVs, light trucks and passenger cars in the meantime," she said.
