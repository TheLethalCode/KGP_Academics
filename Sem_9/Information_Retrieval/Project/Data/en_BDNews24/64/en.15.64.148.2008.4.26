<TITLE> Russia strips Storchak of some duties: Interfax </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has stripped jailed Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak of his duties as a deputy governor of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Interfax news agency reported on Saturday. Storchak, a close ally of Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, is currently awaiting trial on suspicion of attempting to embezzle $43 million. He denies the charges. Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov signed a decree stripping Storchak of his EBRD duties, Interfax reported. A decree published on the government's website www.government.ru said another deputy finance minister, Dmitry Pankin, had been appointed in his place. The Storchak case is being watched by investors who say his arrest could be part of an attempt by a hardline Kremlin clan to undermine the position of Kudrin, who as finance minister has fought for tight fiscal discipline and market reforms. Storchak, who also oversaw Russia's $144 billion state stabilisation fund, faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted. His boss, Kudrin, has offered to vouch personally for Storchak if he is released and has taken the unusual step of casting doubt on the charges.
