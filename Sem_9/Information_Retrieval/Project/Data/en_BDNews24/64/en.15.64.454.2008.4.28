<TEXT>
 MILAN, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunday's Milan derby will be like a Champions League final because of its importance to both teams, Inter president Massimo Moratti said on Monday. Inter will retain their Serie A title with two games remaining if they beat AC Milan, who are also desperate for a win in their attempts to reach the Champions League. Milan, in fifth, are two points behind fourth-placed Fiorentina, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot. "This is a derby that has a particular significance because of the objectives of the two teams. It is difficult to think of another one like it," Moratti told reporters. Asked if it was like a Champions League final, he said: "Yes, in a certain respect. It is a little bit more important than the usual derbies." Inter coach Roberto Mancini had played down the significance of the derby after Sunday's 2-1 win over Cagliari. He said it was just another game and hinted he would prefer to win the title at the home game with Siena in two weeks' time so the squad could celebrate with more of their fans. Milan are designated as the home side for the derby at their shared San Siro stadium
