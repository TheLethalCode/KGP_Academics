 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government caps pre-dialogue informal talks with the political parties, professional bodies and civil society Monday, a day before the deadline, by holding talks with pro-Khaleda Zia faction of BNP at 5pm. Housing, public works and communications adviser Ghulam Quader made the disclosure to reporters Monday noon after meeting separately with the law, justice and parliamentary affairs adviser AF Hassan Ariff and commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. The three advisers responsible for holding informal talks with the political parties also held a meeting Sunday at the communications ministry. "The pre-dialogue talks will end today. The recommendations emerging from the informal talks along with a report on the talks process will be presented to the chief adviser on April 30," Quader said. Asked about the contents of the recommendation package, he said, "That's confidential. How do I share it with you?" He added that another pre-dialogue meeting of the business community leaders with the advisers is ongoing in the afternoon, to be followed by some more meetings with a number of other political parties. Asked if the advisers will sit with Khaleda-nominated secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain Monday, the commerce adviser said, "We'll complete all meetings which happened to be left out so far." Hossain Zillur told reporters Sunday that the pre-dialogue talks would end on April 29 and after that the chief adviser will announce the final dialogue schedule. In the backdrop of the political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, the pre-dialogue informal talks began early this month, with the five advisers tasked to hold the consultations. The advisers sat with the Awami League first and subsequently they met with a faction of the BNP, Jatiya Party and others. bdnews24.c
