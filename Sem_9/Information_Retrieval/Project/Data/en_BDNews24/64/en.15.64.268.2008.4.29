<TITLE> Bhuiyan calls for power balance between president and PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan said Tuesday that there should be balance in the powers of the president and the prime minister. Speaking at a discussion meeting, Bhuiyan said the issue should be part of the agenda during the upcoming formal dialogue between the government and political parties. The BNP leader, loyal to the party's pro-reform faction, urged the caretaker government to fix agenda before dialogue, adding: "Success will come if dialogue is held after fixing the agenda." The agenda must include the issues such as an election schedule, an election code of conduct, legitimising the caretaker government's activities by ruling and opposition parties after the election and release of political detainees, he said. The pro-reform BNP organised the discussion at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh on the eve of May Day. Acting secretary general of the faction Hafizuddin Ahmed presided over the discussion. Bhuiyan demanded quick introduction of a rationing system through the army to save marginal farmers and workers from the effects of rising food costs. "Prices of foods have gone beyond the tolerable level. The government will have to take proper steps to save the working class so that employments are created for the people on the margin." Bhuiyan said: "The election has to be held by the roadmap announced by the Election Commission." "The sooner the election the better." "It's not possible for an unelected government to solve the problems of the country," he said. Hafizuddin came down hard on the pro-Delwar faction for "not forging unity in the party". "Disunity has created a divide in the BNP. It's questionable why the other stream is not responding to the call for unity," he said. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's advisers ZA Khan and AHM Mofazzal Karim also spoke. bdnew
