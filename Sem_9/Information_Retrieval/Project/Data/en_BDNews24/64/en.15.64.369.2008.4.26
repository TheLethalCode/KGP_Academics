 Dhaka, April 26 (bndews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Saturday if Sheikh Hasina was not released by Apr 29 a new protest programme would be announced. Speaking at the conclusion of a mass signature campaign organised by Awami League, Amu said: "If Sheikh Hasina is not released by April 29 new programmes will be announced in future. The demand for release of Sheikh Hasina is not confined to the leaders and workers of Awami League; it is now a demand of the nation." Fellow presidium member Abdur Razzak said: "There is no alternative to Sheikh Hasina's release for overcoming the national crisis." He alleged that there was a "conspiracy" to defer the national election. "The people of Bangladesh will not accept it. The Jatiya Sangsad election has to be held according to roadmap with immediate announcement of a specific date." Expressing concern at the price hike of essentials, Razzak said: "The people are suffering. The poor are becoming poorer. The middle class is facing destruction." Suranjit Sengupta said if Sheikh Hasina cannot be freed through the legal process, the party's central leadership will divert its course and take to struggle. "Without Sheikh Hasina's release political dialogue will be of no use and the election will not be meaningful. If the dialogue fails Bangladesh will face a serious crisis." Motia Chowdhury also claimed there could be no election in Bangladesh without Sheikh Hasina. "Awami League will participate in the election with Sheikh Hasina among us." bdnews
