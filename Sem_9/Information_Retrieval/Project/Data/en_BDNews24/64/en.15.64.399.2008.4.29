 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks finished nearly flat Tuesday with indices closing slightly lower from the previous day. Turnover and the trading volume on the country's twin bourses also recorded a decrease. Investors opted for market majors instead of specific sectors, according to brokerage house officials. "We dealt with orders for market favourites," an official with brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com. Dividend declarations of some insurers and financial institutions enjoyed buying pressure, added the official. Market watchers termed the day's trading normal, saying that the market closed flat due to mixed buying and selling. "The mixed trend led to a nearly-flat close. The indices would have fallen further but dividend declarations of quite a few issues reversed it," Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of Dhaka Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com. The benchmark DGEN or general index rose in the first two hours of trade only to fall afterwards to finish 7.77 points, or 0.25 percent lower at 3053.91. The DSI or all-share price index ended on 2578.76, declining 7.67 points, or 0.25 percent from the previous day. The bourse's blue-chip DSE-20 fell 22.24 points, or 0.93 percent, to close at 2357.93. Turnover slipped to Tk 2.46 billion from Monday's Tk 2.65 billion, with 11,769,203 shares changing hands. Losers beat gainers 159 to 82. Ten issues held steady. AB Bank topped the turnover board, rising 1.05 percent to Tk 3817.25. Heidelberg Cement ended on Tk 1352.75, down 2.87 percent. Profit-taking led Square Pharma to finish 0.50 percent lower at Tk 4547.75, while People's Leasing & Financial Services gained 7.18 percent to Tk 440 on reports of dividend declarations of 35 bonus shares against 100 shares. IFIC Bank eroded Monday's gains to end 0.36 percent lower on Tk 2968.50. Among the other scrips on the turnover board, UCBL, ACI, DESCO and BATBC declined after investors locked in profits. Delta BRAC Housing rose on buying pressure. Indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange ended upbeat, except the port city bourse's blue chip. The CSCX or selective categories index fell 8.67 or 0.15 percent to 5554.47 while the CASPI or all-share price index ended on 8599.75, up 8.67 points or 0.15 percent.
