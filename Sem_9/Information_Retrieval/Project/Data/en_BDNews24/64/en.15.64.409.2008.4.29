 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Association of Bus Companies has asked bus operators not to charge hiked fares on city routes on the excuse of a rise in the CNG fuel price. The call came Tuesday from an emergency meeting of the organisation held at Dhaka Reporters Unity (DRU). The association's president Khandaker Rafiqul Hossain Kajal told bdnews24.com: "We have urged the bus owners to stick to the previous rate." He said they had taken time until May 2 from the government to settle the fare issue through discussion. Earlier at a press conference at DRU, the organisation cited problems in the CNG sector to demand a hike in the fare. Khandaker Rafiqul Hossain, a leader of the association, said, "We demand the government fix fares at Tk 1.26 per kilometre." The leaders of the organisation faced a barrage of questions from reporters about why they had been charging enhanced fares without an announcement. State-run Bangladesh Road Transport Authority Monday took action against more than 100 CNG-run autorickshaws on charges of raising fares. A government handout said the BRTA had filed cases and fined those vehicles through mobile courts. The CNG-run vehicles started realising enhanced fare after the government Thursday doubled the CNG price. The government on Sunday reset the fare of CNG-run autorickshaw and taxicabs but said the bus fare should not increase. The bdnews24.com correspondent on Monday afternoon on a spot visit found that passengers were being charged enhanced fares at National Press Club and Shankar bus stands. CNG-fuelled vehicles Maitree, Midway, Megacity, Rajdhani Express and Aloka Paribahan charged Tk 2 more than the previous fare for the distance from the National Press Club to Shankar. bdnews24
