<TITLE> Zambia`s opposition chief stable after heart attack </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambia's main opposition leader Michael Sata is stable in a South African hospital after suffering a heart attack, a hospital spokeswoman said on Saturday. "He has been admitted to the cardiac care unit, which is a cardiac intensive care unit," said Amelda Swartz, spokeswoman for Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg. "He is in a stable condition," she said. Swartz said Sata had suffered a heart attack before coming to the hospital, and would have an angiogram on Saturday afternoon as part of his treatment. Sata, 70, was narrowly defeated by Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa in a presidential election in 2006. He is a vocal critic of the president. In the September 2006 poll, former government minister Sata had looked set to sweep Mwanawasa from power on the back of strong support from Zambia's poor, who were angry that the country's economic reforms had not translated into a better life for them. But Mwanawasa streaked ahead in the vote count and Sata finished as runner-up. He accused Mwanawasa's ruling MDD of stealing the vote.
