<TITLE> Britain's Brown says guiding economy main priority </TITLE>

 LONDON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who faces his first major electoral test this week, said on Monday that shepherding the British economy through its current difficulties was his chief priority. Trailing in the opinion polls, facing industrial unrest and simmering discontent within his Labour Party, Brown's leadership was questioned on Sunday by a former party fundraiser and close ally of former Prime Minister Tony Blair. "The issues ahead of us are making sure that not only can Britain come through these very difficult economic times that we face, but also that we are better prepared for the future," Brown told the BBC. "I'm going to concentrate on the job ahead, on the priorities that matter for the British people and not on gossip or rumour, or statements made by one or two people," he said. Former party fundraiser Lord Levy said Blair believed Brown could not defeat opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron in a national election. Blair's office has denied the claims. Peter Mandelson, EU Trade Commissioner and a Blair ally, also weighed in at the weekend saying while Brown should remain in charge, the Labour Party must pull itself together and focus on getting its message across to voters. Brown's party risks a bruising in elections on Thursday for seats on 160 local authorities in England and Wales. The high-profile contest for London mayor will be a key battleground for both major parties. Opinion polls published on Sunday showed Labour would lose office if a national election were held now and Brown is hoping the economy will have emerged from its current difficulties before a poll must be held by mid-2010. The local elections come against a backdrop of slowing economic growth, declines in house prices and worsening consumer confidence following the fallout from the global credit crunch -- all damaging Brown's reputation for economic competency. Labour controls just 50 councils in England, many in northern urban districts, while the Conservatives have more than 200. Brown, who became prime minister last June after a decade as finance minister, was also forced last week to make concessions on tax reform to avert a rebellion by members of his own party which had threatened to undermine his authority. The concessions offered to people worst affected by the abolition of the lowest income tax band mean Brown will now avoid a potentially humiliating defeat in a parliamentary vote on the budget later on Monday. Several senior ministers, including Foreign Secretary David Miliband, defended Brown over the weekend. Miliband said disloyalty to Brown would be "fatal" and the party must stick by its core convictions
