<TEXT>
 Barisal, April 26 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Krishi Bank has decided to partially waive agriculture loans disbursed to farmers in the Sidr-hit southern region, BKB's chairman said Saturday. The decision will come into effect after government approval, Krishi Bank chairman Khondoker Ibrahim Khaled told reporters after a meeting of the bank's board of directors in Barisal Circuit House. He said that the bank's decision would be sent to the government and the government would take a final decision on it. He told reporters that some senior officials of the bank had visited some Sidr-hit areas and talked to farmers and found that farmers were not able to repay loans. They found that many farmers had taken loans more than once from the bank for cultivation. Khaled did not say when the bank would inform the government of its decision. Asked about how much money would be waived, the chairman of the bank said that a final decision would be taken later. BKB's meeting Saturday was the first to be held outside Dhaka. bdnews
