<TITLE> BP says Forties North Sea oil pipeline now closed </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A pipeline carrying nearly half of Britain's oil was closed on Sunday as a strike over pensions began at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, operator BP said. The refinery, owned by international chemical company Ineos, produces a tenth of Britain's petrol and diesel but also supplies vital steam to BP's Kinneil plant that starts to process the crude oil coming ashore from 70 North Sea fields. Unions have rejected pleas to operate the steam plant at the level necessary to keep Kinneil functioning during the two-day stoppage which began at 0600 BST (0500 GMT).
