<TITLE> Israel shells Gaza home, at least 2 dead: medics </TITLE>

 Gaza, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli forces shelled a house in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday, killing at least two Palestinian civilians and wounding four others, Hamas and medical officials said. Hamas put the total death toll from the incident in the border town of Beit Hanoun at five, including children, but said some bodies had yet to be recovered from the rubble. An Israeli military spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the incident. Palestinian militants frequently launch short-range rockets from Beit Hanoun into the Jewish state. Hamas last week offered Israel a six-month Gaza truce if the Jewish state lifted an embargo on the territory that was stepped up after the Islamist group routed the forces of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas there in June. Israel has balked at entering a formal agreement with Hamas, which is officially committed to its destruction. Gazan hospital officials said one of the dead from the shelling was a girl under the age of 15. Palestinian witnesses said the Israeli attack probably came from tanks stationed on the border near Beit Hanoun.
