 RIO DE JANEIRO, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Player of the Year Kaka predicted on Sunday that he would reach his peak in time for the 2010 World Cup. In an interview with the Brazilian sports daily Lance, the AC Milan and Brazil player reaffirmed his wish to play at the Olympic Games in August but admitted the matter was out of his hands. "I think the best is yet to come," said Kaka, who has suffered a dip in form this year. "The year 2007 was marvellous but I still think I can improve technically and physically. "I want to reach a very high level (for the 2010 World Cup). I will be 28, at my peak. It could be a great World Cup for Brazil, a new cycle and new players." Kaka has had some fitness problems recently, which he blamed on too much football. "The biggest problem with injuries, today, is the quantity of games," he said. "There comes a time when your body can't take any more." The 26-year-old said he wanted to help Brazil win their first Olympic Gold medal in Beijing. The Olympic soccer tournament is for under-23 teams but three over-age players are allowed. "Nobody has won the Olympic gold (for Brazil) yet, that's the big motivation," he said. "But, how I get to the Olympics is something which does not depend on me." He was unsure if he would still be playing international football when Brazil host the World Cup in 2014. "I don't know if I will be there," he said. "It depends on how I am physically, if I am still in condition to play football at a high level, with the right motivation to play a World Cup
