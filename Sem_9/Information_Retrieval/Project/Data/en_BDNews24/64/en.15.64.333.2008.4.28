<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)Leaders of a BNP faction loyal to secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Monday demanded the government release former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina from prison before formal dialogue. They also asked the government to lift the state of emergency, hold elections within the shortest possible time and free "political prisoners". The demands were raised at an evening meeting between a 10-member BNP delegation led by standing committee member Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui and five caretaker government advisers at state guesthouse Meghna. After the meeting, Tanvir told reporters: "It will be difficult to hold elections in the country without the two leaders. The corruption cases against them are not acceptable to people." Tanvir has claimed that the BNP chairperson is innocent. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said: "It has to be confirmed that the two leaders (Khaleda and Hasina) are present at formal dialogue to make it meaningful and polls acceptable." Khaleda's adviser ASM Hannan Shah said the BNP leaders told the advisers that the Election Commission had deceived the "mainstream BNP" by inviting Hafizuddin Ahmed to dialogue. "It's not acceptable at all. We represent the mainstream of the BNP," he said. After the meeting, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "Pre-dialogue talks have ended with today's meeting. We will present a report on the discussions to the chief adviser on April 30 and then to the cabinet." "The government believes the pre-dialogue talks helped create a confidence-building environment," he said. The adviser said the political parties expected the election to be held in line with the EC roadmap and agreed to bring qualitative change to politics. The pre-dialogue talks began on March 7. Law adviser Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowhdhury, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman represented the government. The government representatives held 24 meetings with political parties. The government on Sunday said chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed would lead government delegates to the talks slated for a start in the first or second week of May. bdnew
