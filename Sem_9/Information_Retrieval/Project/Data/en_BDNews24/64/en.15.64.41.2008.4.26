<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  The GP-BCB Academy team were in the backfoot against the Pakistani counterparts on the first day of the first four-dayer at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium Saturday. The home side were wrapped up for a paltry 192 in the first innings as Wahab Riaz (3/33), Anwar Ali (2/41) and Sohail Khan (2/47) bowled superbly. The Pakistan Academy team, in reply, were 95 for four at stumps with Asad Shafiq (21) and Sarfraz Ahmed (5) remaining unbeaten. After being put in to bat first, the hosts fell in trouble losing two wickets for 15 runs, and opener Farhad Hossain (39) and captain Mehrab Hossain tried to repair the damage adding 29 runs before the latter was trapped lbw by Sohail for five. However, middle orders Mushfiqur Rahim (32), Shamsur Rahman (40) and Nasir Hossain (28) put some runs on the board before the hosts collapsed to be all out, losing the last four wickets for just 10 runs.
