<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Thomas Rumbaugh, International Monetary Fund's adviser for Asia and Pacific, suggested Sunday that Bangladesh further hike fuel prices to ease the burden of energy subsidies on the government. The advice came at a press conference at Bangladesh Bank Bhaban three days after the government doubled the price of compressed natural gas. However, Rumbaugh suggested, Bangladesh should at the same time help keep prices of commodities within people's reach. Asked if the CNG price hike would likely raise inflation further, the IMF adviser said the organisation advised the government to adjust fuel prices in line with the global market. The IMF adviser asked authorities to remain vigilant in monitoring inflation. "If economic activity and credit demand pick up, a monetary policy response may be required to keep inflationary pressure in check," he said. He said inflation, driven by food prices, would remain a policy challenge for the government. Speaking on revenue, Rumbaugh said: "There is considerable scope to further increase revenue through improved administration, reducing exemptions, expanding the coverage of income tax and VAT, and increasing the number of registered taxpayers." "In the near future, fundamental changes to tax legislation will be needed to establish a simple and transparent tax system," he added. Rumbaugh was optimistic that Bangladesh would have a better than expected GDP growth this year. "While growth slowed earlier in the year, recent improvements in export performance and agricultural production are contributing to a rebound. With exports recovering and a strong boro crop being harvested, real GDP growth of 5.5 to 6 percent appears possible for FY08," he said. On expanding the financial sector, Rumbaugh stressed further development of secondary markets, such as broader bond markets, to drive future growth. "Further improvements in state-owned commercial banks are also needed. Now that the banks have been corporatised, the boards need to be strengthened and staffed with people who have financial sector experience," he said. The IMF adviser said the Saudi prince's refusal to buy state-owned Rupali Bank was unfortunate. He asked the government to take steps to reactivate the bank saying the IMF had some suggestions on the matter. The press conference followed a meeting between Rumbaugh and Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed. After the meeting, the governor told reporters: "We had talks on monetary policy." Salehuddin said the IMF adviser recommended the central bank keep reserves enough to pay for three months of imports. The central bank now has a reserve to cover three and half months worth of imports, he added. Bangladesh Bank had $5.80 billion in reserves Sunday. Rumbaugh arrived in Dhaka on April 22. He held meetings with finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. bdnews2
