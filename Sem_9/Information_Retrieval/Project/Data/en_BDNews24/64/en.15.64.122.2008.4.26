 MOSCOW, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Svetlana Kuznetsova and Anna Chakvetadze recorded straight-sets wins over low-key opponents to give holders Russia a commanding 2-0 lead in their Fed Cup semi-final against the United States on Saturday. World number seven Chakvetadze beat 115th-ranked Vania King 6-4 7-5 in the opening singles before world number four Kuznetsova overpowered Ahsha Rolle 6-2 6-1 in the second rubber. Russia need to win just one of Sunday's three remaining rubbers to book a place in the final for the fourth time in five years. Boasting a much stronger line-up, Russia had been widely expected to easily beat their American opponents and former U.S. Open champion Kuznetsova took her win in her stride. "I've never played her before, I've never even seen her play before, so it was a new experience for me," she told reporters. "It's 6-2 6-1, the result could have been better or worse but that is insignificant." The 145th-ranked Rolle, making her Fed Cup debut, said she was overwhelmed by the experience. "It was tough for me out there, playing the fourth best player in the world in Russia," she said. "But hopefully I will learn from it." Chakvetadze broke King in the fifth game to go on to take the first set. She repeated the trick in the fifth game of the second set to go up 3-2 but then had to work harder after losing her serve in the eighth game when she double-faulted twice in a row. MATCH POINTS Chakvetadze broke back in the next game to lead 5-4. She then wasted two match points before double-faulting once more on a break point, gifting her opponent the 10th game. After breaking King again in the next game, the 21-year-old finally held her nerve by saving two break points in the 12th game before sealing victory after 84 minutes. Chakvetadze, who crushed King 6-1 6-3 in last year's Fed Cup semi-final in Vermont -- their only previous meeting, blamed her nerves for failing to close out the match earlier. "I had two match points at 5-4 40-15 and instead of going for it I started to play more cautious," she told reporters. "And after she saved those match points my nerves got to me and I lost my concentration. But I was able to overcome that problem." King was optimistic despite the defeat. "I'm pretty happy with my play, although I'm disappointed to lose," she said. "Actually I feel like my game has improved from last year and I feel like I can beat almost anyone.
