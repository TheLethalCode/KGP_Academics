<TITLE> No need to renegotiate US-Korea trade pact: USTR </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Trade Representative Susan Schwab on Monday rejected Democratic calls to renegotiate auto provisions of a free trade pact with South Korea that is facing an uphill battle in Congress this year. "Quite honestly, none of the arguments we've heard would justify reopening the agreement," Schwab said in remarks to a broad-based business coalition that supports approval of the Korea-U.S. trade pact. "This is a really, really strong deal when it comes to the automotive sector" and the Bush administration is committed to winning approval of the pact this year, Schwab said. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, has warned the White House to resolve concerns about the auto provisions before submitting the agreement to Congress. Democratic presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also oppose the agreement. They say it fails to adequately address South Korean regulatory barriers to U.S. auto exports, while opening the U.S. market to more South Korean cars. Schwab sharply disagreed, saying the elimination of a 2.5 percent U.S. tariff on auto imports from South Korea "is not going to have an appreciable impact on U.S. auto trade." In contrast, South Korea will have to eliminate an 8 percent tariff on U.S. auto exports and reduce other barriers that have long kept out American cars, she said. The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated the agreement would boost total U.S. exports to South Korea by about $10 billion to $11 billion, while increasing U.S. imports from the Asian ally by around $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion. The panel also estimated that more than half of the relatively small increase in U.S. auto imports from South Korea would take the place of imports from other suppliers. The push to win approval of the South Korea agreement comes as the White House and Congress are involved in a tense fight over a separate free trade agreement with Colombia. President George W. Bush has accused Pelosi of killing that agreement at the behest of U.S. labor groups by pushing through a vote in the House to indefinitely delay action on the pact. Pelosi took that step after Bush ignored her advice and sent the Colombia agreement to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote within 90 days. Schwab said it was possible the White House could employ the same tactic on the South Korea pact, but added that she hoped that would not be necessary. The United States and South Korea recently removed a major impediment to congressional approval of the free trade agreement by resolving a four-year-old beef dispute. That spat had stymied Bush administration efforts to build support in Congress for the pact, Schwab said.
