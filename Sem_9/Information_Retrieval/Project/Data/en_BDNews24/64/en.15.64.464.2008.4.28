 WASHINGTON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Supreme Court on Monday upheld a tough state law requiring voters to show photo identification before casting a ballot, a decision critics say could keep some blacks and poor people from voting in the November 2008 elections.

Those groups are most likely not to have government identification and also tend to vote for Democrats. Supporters, mainly Republicans, defended the law as necessary to prevent voter fraud and to heighten public confidence in the integrity of elections. The Bush administration supported the law. The ruling, ahead of the November elections, comes as front-runner Barack Obama and challenger Hillary Clinton are waging an extended battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. If elected, Obama would be the first black US president and Clinton would be the first woman US president. The decision could have broad national significance because more than 20 states have adopted voter identification laws and other states are considering similar legislation. Three justices held that the evidence in the record does not support an attack now on the law's validity. Three other justices held that the law should be upheld because its overall burden is minimal and justified. Three other justices dissented.

Those without identification may vote using a provisional ballot, which is counted only if the voter travels to a government office to prove his or her identity within 10 days of the electio
