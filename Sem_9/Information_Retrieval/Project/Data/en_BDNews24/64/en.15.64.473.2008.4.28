 NAIROBI, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya charged nine senior prison officials on Monday with inciting thousands of warders to strike for better pay, paralysing the east African country's jails and raising fears of mass break outs. Guards have been manning prison gates and watchtowers, but have refrained from working inside prisons and have threatened to release dangerous criminals if their demands are not met. "You are charged with incitement to disobedience of lawful commands of a prison officer. On April 25 you instigated prisons officers by ordering them not to report on duty," Nairobi Chief Magistrate Gilbert Mutembei said. The nine denied the charges. The warders are protesting against squalid living quarters and poor salaries, and accuse the government of forgetting them in its highly touted prison reforms, instituted by President Mwai Kibaki's government in 2003. They also want a one-off payment of about $160, paid to police officers as a risk allowance during post-election violence, following a disputed election which left 1,200 dead and about 300,000 displaced. "Living standards of inmates are better than those of officers. They have TV, they are being well fed," one unidentified warder said at Nairobi's Kamiti maximum prison. Another said warders wanted to inform the president and Prime Minister Raila Odinga that there was corruption in the service. He said they were forced to buy their own uniforms with their wages of 14,000 shillings ($225), yet money to purchase uniforms was allocated by the government budget on an annual basis. Many of the warders wear tattered, faded uniforms, some with no boots or plastic slippers. "This is the life you live every day. You need food so you have to work here. This used to be a bathroom but now we use it as a toilet because the toilet is full. Look at it," another officer said as he appointed to a filthy stinking latrine. Kenya's prison reforms were spearheaded by former vice president Moody Awori and improved conditions in the country's overcrowded prisons and gave inmates access to better food and luxuries such as television. So popular were the reforms that inmates took to referring to Awori as "Uncle Moody". But some warders are forced to live in crumbling mud huts, with only plastic papers as roofing. In Kamiti Prison, Kenya's biggest maximum jail, some warders are crammed into dormitories with their families, where some have used tattered old sheets to ensure privacy. Current vice President Kalonzo Musyoka was heckled over the weekend when he attempted to speak to striking warders. The government has set up a commission to deal with the crisi
