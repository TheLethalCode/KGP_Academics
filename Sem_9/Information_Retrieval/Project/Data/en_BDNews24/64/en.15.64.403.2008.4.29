 TAIPEI, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Health Organisation has rejected another bid for membership from Taiwan, an application that was seen as a final jab at China by outgoing President Chen Shui-bian, officials said on Tuesday. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 and under its "one China policy" forbids its diplomatic allies from official contact with Taipei. Beijing blocks Taiwan's membership bids on the grounds that only sovereign nations are allowed to join the WHO. The WHO declined to process an April 17 letter from independence-leaning President Chen, effectively saying no to Taiwan's requests for membership or observer status in the global health agency, a government spokesman said. "Every time we apply to the WHO, their attitude is really awful. This is totally something that China masterminded," cabinet spokesman Shieh Jhy-wey said. "We didn't imagine that such a big international network would allow such a big hole. This was a very irrational action." Chen, who steps down on May 20 after two terms of advocating more autonomy for Taiwan, applied to the WHO under the name "Taiwan", rather than the island's legal name "Republic of China", to promote an identity separate from Beijing. Taiwan has applied for the past 11 years for membership in the 193-member Geneva-based organisation that updates members on healthcare issues and helps handle disease outbreak
