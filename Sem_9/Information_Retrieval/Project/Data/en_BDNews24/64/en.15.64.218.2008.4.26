 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was returned to special jail from Square Hospital Saturday, after seven days of treatment. Hasina was taken to the hospital on April 19 for a routine health check, but was admitted as doctors became concerned at her fluctuating blood pressure. Speaking in front of the special jail after Hasina's return, deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told reporters that Sheikh Hasina was now doing well. The DIG said the Awami League chief had been returned to the jail at the Sangsad Bhaban grounds after doctors at Square Hospital had given her the all clear. "With the release letter from Square Hospital and following the advice of physicians, the former prime minister returned to special jail at 4.30 this afternoon," said Siddiqui. "Sheikh Hasina's blood pressure is now under control and a new set of spectacles have been provided for her." A panel of seven physicians treated Hasina at the hospital during her stay. The AL chief was admitted to the same hospital earlier, on Mar 11, where she remained until her return to the special jail on Mar 30. Since her arrest on July 16 last year, the former prime minister has been detained at the special jail located in the Sangsad Bhaban complex. A number of corruption and extortion cases have been filed against Hasina, with some cases currently under trial. bdnews24
