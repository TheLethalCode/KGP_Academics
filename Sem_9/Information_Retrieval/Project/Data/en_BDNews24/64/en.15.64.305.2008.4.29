 KABUL, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Marines have begun moving in to capture a town from Taliban militants in the southern province of Helmand, their first large operation in Afghanistan since arriving to reinforce NATO troops, the force said on Tuesday. The United States, frustrated by the failure of some European NATO allies to come up with combat troops to help out in fighting in southern Afghanistan, sent a force of 3,200 Marines to bolster British, Canadian and Dutch troops there earlier this month. The US Marines' drive into the town of Garmsir in Helmand, the world' biggest opium producing region and a hotbed of insurgent activity, is the first significant fruit of that move. "We launched operations about nine hours ago and right now Marines are securing routes to the district centre," said US Marines spokeswoman Captain Kelly Frushour. "In the end, we're supposed to secure the district centre to enable the extension of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan," she said. "We don't have a set time limit. It's going to go on until we've accomplished what we're supposed to accomplish." British troops began deploying to Helmand in March 2006, before which only a small group of US forces had been present in the vast, mostly desert province and Taliban militants had taken control of most of the towns and villages. Since then, the British force has more than doubled to more than 7,000 soldiers, and helped by Afghan and other NATO troops, have taken control of most of the towns along the Helmand River which brings life to a strip of land through the desert. The town of Garmsir in the south of Helmand has been the scene of frequent raids by Afghan, British and US troops, but has hitherto eluded capture. Of the 3,200 US Marines sent to Afghanistan, some 800 are involved in training Afghan security forces, seen by the Afghan government and the international community as the long-term key to bringing peace to Afghanistan. The remaining 2,400 Marines are a highly mobile force which ISAF can rapidly deploy wherever they are needed. Currently, "a large percentage of them are forward deployed into Helmand," Frushour said
