 LONDON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran have earned two places in the rowing competition at the Beijing Games, their first appearance in the sport at an Olympics. At an Asian qualifying tournament at the weekend, Myanmar also qualified for the first time through Latt Shwe Zin in the women's single sculls. Iranian Mohsen Shadinaghadeh won one of six places available in the men's single sculls and he was joined by Homa Hosseini in the women's single sculls. Iran have hired Romanian Olympic coach Nicolae Gioga and entered teams in all four events at the qualifier. India's Manjeet Singh and Khandwal Devender Kumar qualified in the men's lightweight double sculls and Indian media reported Singh would be the first Indian from a non-military background to row at the Olympics. Compatriot Takhak Bajranglal qualified for the men's single sculls at the competition in Shanghai, where 17 rowing slots were available. Hong Kong earned three and China one with probably the most impressive rower at the competition, Zhang Liang in the single sculls. Rowers from 57 nations have so far won places at the Aug. 8-24 Games in Beijing. A final Olympic qualification regatta will take place in Poznan, Poland, in June
