<TITLE> BTRC to ask operators to launch mobile connectivity for CHT </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)The government will soon ask mobile operators to extend their networks to Chittagong Hill Tracts, said BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam Monday. "Operators will be given necessary instructions on launching mobile connectivity," Alam told reporters at the office of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. The telecoms regulator said the phone operators would have to use the same network infrastructure (base transceiver station) in the CHT. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on March 27 announced a plan to introduce mobile connectivity to the municipal areas of the three CHT districts: Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari. The CA said steps would be taken to improve the quality of telephone services in the CHT. Alam had earlier addressed a call centre licence-giving ceremony at the BTRC office where he said call centres would earn a big sum of foreign currency. "Call centres have a $400 billion market worldwide, which will stand at $650 billion at the end of 2009. If we can grab only 1 percent of the market, we will get $6.5 billion," he said. The BTRC chief called upon all to work collectively to develop the call centre business and remain vigilant against deception. He said the easy process of issuing licences for call centres would help expand the business. "Licences are being given on easy conditions. There is no deadline for it. Licences are given only after a brief review of applications," Alam said. Reazuddin Mosharraf, chief executive of One Call which received a call-centre licence, said call centres could help reduce the unemployment rate in the country by up to 10 percent. "We are heading towards the culmination of our dreams." Harun-or-Rashid, director of Imam Network, stressed the need to allow voice over internet protocol services to cut expenses of call centres. "If the government allows VoIP, we will be able to offer lower costs than in India and the Philippines," he said. Twenty-one companies received licences Monday. Of them, 10 were for call centres, four for hosted call centres and seven for hosted call centre service providers. The BTRC invited applications for call centre licensing early in the year. The authorities have received 60 applications so far. bdnews
