 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)Advisers will submit a report on pre-dialogue talks with political parties to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on April 30, an adviser said Sunday. A timetable for the final dialogue will be announced soon. "The pre-dialogue talks will be rounded off on April 29 and the recommendations of the political parties will be presented before the chief adviser," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said. "The schedule for final dialogue will then be possible to announce," Rahman said, after three advisers had a meeting at the communications ministry. Asked when they will hold talks with the pro-Delwar BNP leaders, Rahman said: "We'll complete the talks by April 29." Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman decided that a report on a synthesis of the issues that emerged during the pre-dialogue talks would be prepared. The agenda for the final round of dialogue may be drawn from the report and the chief adviser may announce the dialogue dates and sit with the political parties to discuss the agenda. In the backdrop of the political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, the pre-dialogue talks were initiated in early April, spearheaded on behalf of the government by Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Hossain Zillur Rahman. The advisers first sat with the Awami League and then with a faction of the BNP, Jatiya Party and other political parties. bdnews24.c
