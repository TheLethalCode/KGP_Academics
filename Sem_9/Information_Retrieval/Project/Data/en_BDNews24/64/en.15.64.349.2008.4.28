 WASHINGTON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Taliban assassination attempt against Afghan President Hamid Karzai underscores the need for the United States and its allies to keep the war in Afghanistan a top priority, the White House said on Monday. Karzai escaped unhurt from Sunday's attack by Taliban fighters who fired guns and rockets at a state parade near the presidential palace in Kabul. Three people were killed and 10 wounded. "Thankfully, President Karzai was not harmed," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said, while expressing sadness for the victims of the attack. "We're very concerned about it," Perino said. "The terrorist threat is real.

Asked whether the attack raised questions about the Afghan government's ability to maintain order, she said, "They will continue to look at how they could have done better in order to make sure this doesn't happen again
