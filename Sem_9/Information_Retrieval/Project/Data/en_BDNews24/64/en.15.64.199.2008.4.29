 Johannesburg, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Human rights group Amnesty International said on Tuesday that police in Mozambique are torturing and killing people with near impunity. "Police in Mozambique seem to think they have a licence to kill and the weak police accountability system allows for this," said Michelle Kagari, deputy director of Amnesty International's Africa programme. "In almost all cases of human rights violations by police -- including unlawful killings -- no investigation into the case and no disciplinary action against those responsible has been undertaken, nor has any police officer been prosecuted," she said in a statement. Several senior Mozambican officials declined comment on the accusations. In a new report on Mozambique, Amnesty said high crime rates, a backlog in the judicial system, occasional violence against police by criminals and public demands to crack down on crime were putting pressure on police. It said police officers had responded to these challenges by using excessive force. The rights group said that on Feb. 5, 2008, for example, Mozambican police fired live ammunition at people demonstrating against increased transport fares in Maputo, killing at least three and wounding 30. It also cited the case of a man who said he was abducted, abused and left for dead by police on Aug. 14, 2007. He told family and police about the incident before dying in hospital, Amnesty said. Amnesty International's report urged the Mozambican authorities to ensure steps are taken to prevent human rights violations, including revising the police codes of conduct to bring them in line with international standards.
