 NEW DELHI, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harbhajan Singh's boorish behaviour again blighted the India spinner's career when he was banned on Monday from a domestic Twenty20 league for slapping a rival player. India's third highest test wicket-taker was suspended from the remainder of the league after being found guilty of hitting paceman Shanthakumaran Sreesanth at the end of a match on Friday. The incident occurred after the Mumbai team captained by Harbhajan in the absence of the injured Sachin Tendulkar lost to Sreesanth's Mohali. Television pictures showed Sreesanth, an international team mate of Harbhajan's, sobbing after the game. Harbhajan's ban comes three months after he was involved in a row on the controversial tour of Australia. The 27-year-old was initially banned for three tests after being found guilty of making racist remarks against Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds in the Sydney test. But the India spinner was subsequently let off with a fine on a lesser charge following an appeal. Harbhajan could face further trouble this time as the Indian board has launched a separate inquiry that could lead to a possible ban from international cricket. PHYSICAL ASSAULT Indian Premier League (IPL) officials found him guilty under clause 4.2 of the International Cricket Council's (ICC) code of conduct rules which refers to a physical assault, with punishment ranging from a 10-game suspension to a life ban. Harbhajan has had a wayward disciplinary record since making his India debut. In 1998, the year of his debut, he was fined and given a suspended one-game ban for clashing with Ricky Ponting after dismissing the Australian in a one-day international in Sharjah. He has been fined four times since then. Harbhajan, who has twice been reported for 'throwing', was also expelled from the National Cricket Academy (NCA) early in his career for poor attitude. He made a superb return in 2001 when he took 32 wickets to spark India's 2-1 home test series win over Australia. Sreesanth, 25, has also been disciplined for on-pitch theatrics and poor behaviour. The worst example came at the Nottingham test last year when he barged into England captain Michael Vaughan at the non-striker's end
