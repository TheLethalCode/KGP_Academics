<TITLE> UK's Conservatives double lead over Labour: poll </TITLE>

 LONDON, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's main opposition party has doubled its lead over the ruling Labour party, a poll published on Tuesday showed, more grim reading for Prime Minister Gordon Brown ahead of local elections this week. The elections in England and Wales will be the first ballot box test for Brown since he took over from Tony Blair as prime minister last June. They come against a backdrop of industrial unrest, party in-fighting and growing concerns over the economy. A poll for The Independent newspaper showed the Conservatives had stretched their lead over Labour nationally to 14 points from seven following a row over Brown's decision to abolish the lowest rate of income tax, a move which left millions of Britain's poorest households worse off.

Last week Brown was forced to make concessions to Labour rebels threatening a revolt over his abolition of a 10 pence tax band, promising more help for the lowest paid. That meant Brown avoided a potentially humiliating defeat in a parliamentary vote on the budget on Monday, although the leader of the rebels, Frank Field, warned they would continue to fight the government if not satisfied with the concessions.
