 MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's season was in tatters after they were beaten by Manchester United at the Champions League semi-final stage on Tuesday. "It is obvious this has been a bad season for us," midfielder Xavi told reporters after the 1-0 second-leg defeat at Old Trafford. "Our effort has not paid off. We don't understand why because we created chances but haven't been able to finish them off." Paul Scholes's goal gave United a 1-0 aggregate win and a place in next month's final in Moscow, leaving Barcelona, who can only watch as Real Madrid head for the Primera Liga title, empty-handed. Goalkeeper Victor Valdes, who was powerless to stop Scholes's 14th-minute shot flying past him, said: "We gave everything but they got lucky with the shot to get the goal and win the game." Manchester United will play either Chelsea or Liverpool on May 21 in the first all-English Champions League final. United defender Mikael Silvestre, who came on as a late substitute for Patrice Evra, said: "It was nerve-racking to be honest. If they had scored we would have had to have scored two. "But it was a good performance, the balance of our team was better and we should be playing like this every week. "We do not mind who we play in the final. We are capable of beating both of those teams as we have done in the past." By the final, the Premier League campaign will be over and United will head to Moscow as English champions if they at least get as many points as Chelsea from the last two league games. Cristiano Ronaldo said the players' attention was now switching to those matches against West Ham United and Wigan Athletic. "The league is the most important thing now and this gives us the confidence for those two games," he said
