 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)Chevron will resume its seismic survey in the reserved forests of Lauachhara in Moulavibazar Tuesday, a director of the US energy company said. "Survey work is going to start again on Tuesday," Chevron director for external affairs Naser Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The company suspended its three-dimensional survey on Sunday in the wake of Saturday's fire. Bangladesh oil, gas and mineral resources company Petrobangla failed to trace a clue to the fire in its primary investigation into the incident. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed told bdnews24.com that one geochemist had been sent to the scene. "A primary investigation did not find any clue to the fire. There may be some other causes." Jalal said the investigation would continue. Petrobangla investigators found cracks on mud houses. Chevron also launched an investigation into the fire incident. In a statement released on Monday, Chevron said the firm had no manpower on the fire site. "There was no survey work there either." "The fire did not have any adverse effect on the environment or wild life. The cause of the fire is yet to be known," it said. Over 100 houses close to Lauachhara Jatiya Udyan developed cracks after the US company started its survey, locals alleged. They blamed the cracks on the seismic survey saying the company was making underground explosions. Many animals entered the neighbourhoodscared of big bang and mild quakes. Moulvibazar gas field was discovered in 1999. It went into production in 2005. Every day 75 million cubic feet gas is being produced from the gasfield. Paribesh Bachao Andolon, an outfit that campaigns for greening and protection of the environment, has urged people to come forward to save the garden affected by the Chevron survey. Sylhet Bibhag Unnayan Parishad in a statement expressed concern over the Lauachhara fire and made calls to save the rare forest of the country. bdnews24.
