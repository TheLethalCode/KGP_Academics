<TITLE> US Episcopal Church sues rebel California bishop </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Fresno, Calif., April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Episcopal Church is suing a rebel bishop to recover tens of millions of dollars worth of property after he led his diocese in seceding from the church, officials said on Friday Bishop John-David Schofield led his 8,800-member Diocese of San Joaquin based in central California out of the Church last December. He and his followers do not accept the Church's decision in 2003 to consecrate its first openly gay bishop. Last month the 2.4 million member U.S. Episcopal Church elected a new bishop to replace Schofield and on Thursday filed a complaint in Fresno County Superior Court over real estate and personal property in the dispute. The complaint demands that within 30 days Schofield surrender his offices, relinquish control of a trust and return financial accounts, money and records. Other defendants include the Episcopal Foundation of San Joaquin, the Diocesan Investment Trust and their officers and board members. Rev. Van McCalister, a spokesman for Schofield, said the bishop has no intentions of backing down as he sees no basis for the lawsuit. "It would be bad stewardship to those he is pastorally responsible for," he said. "There is nothing in church law that prevents a diocese from leaving." The Episcopal Church is the U.S. branch of the 77-million-member global Anglican Communion.
