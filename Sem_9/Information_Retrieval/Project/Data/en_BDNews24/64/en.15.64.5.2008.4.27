 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  The much-anticipated Bangladesh Football Federation election is all set to be held Monday amid hopes of resurrecting the lost glory of the country's most popular sport. It is expected to be the most hotly contested sporting body election in memory with two panels competing for 21 posts president, senior vice president, four vice presidents and 15 members. Former national star Kazi Salahuddin is leading the 'Like-Minded' panel while retired major general Amin Ahmed Chowdhury is directing the opposing 'Combined Parishad' panel. "The lead-up to the election has already surpassed all previous elections in our sporting history in terms of participations, excitement and campaigns," said Sirajul Islam Bachchu, a veteran organiser and South Asian Football Federation's general secretary. "As far as I remember there was a partial election in football in 1974. The two other elections in 1998 and 2003 were one-sided polls, but this one is totally different" said Bachchu. Many expect the election to result in a mixed committee as no panel has unilateral dominance over the councillors. The chief election commissioner, Mesbah Uddin, said the commission has taken all necessary steps for a successful election. Four polling booths have been set up inside the BFF conference room, which will host the annual general meeting (from 11am to 1pm) followed by the voting from 2pm to 6pm. Mesbah Uddin said they have asked authorities to employ an adequate police force to avoid any unwanted incidents. Many think councillors outside Dhaka, already starting to gather in the capital, will play a key role in the electionwith both panels arranging accommodation for their key voters in two separate hotels. On the eve of the election, Salahuddin appealed to the councillors to give him the chance to serve the most popular national sport while Amin Ahmed Chowdhury urged them to elect the most competent candidate to restore football to its former glory. bd
