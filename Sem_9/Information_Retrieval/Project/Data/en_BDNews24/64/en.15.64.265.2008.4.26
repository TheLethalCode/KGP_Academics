<TITLE> Opposition to women's policy a diversionary tactic: CPB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)--The Communist Party of Bangladesh claimed Saturday that a 'fundamentalist clique' was opposing the women's development policy in a bid to draw attention away from potential war crimes trials in the future. Speaking at a discussion meeting on the women's policy at the CPB office in Purana Paltan, CPB general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim complained of the caretaker government's double standards. "We cannot hold a human chain to protest the spiralling cost of essentials, but the government is allowing fundamentalist groups to hold meetings and rallies," said Selim. "Those who said Bangalee women should be considered as war spoils by the Pakistani occupation troops are now opposing the women's development policy." The CPB leader termed the recommendations on the women's policy submitted to the government by the clerics' review committee as 'against the constitution'. "As our national constitution speaks of equal rights between men and women, so the Quran and Hadith speak of the same equal rights between the sexes," he said. bdnew
