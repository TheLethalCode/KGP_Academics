<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com) Khandaker Delwar Hossain termed the Election Commission's electoral reform talks with the pro-reform BNP faction Sunday a "blueprint dialogue". "BNP will not go to any election or dialogue without Khaleda Zia. The two leaders have to be released for a fair election," the Khaleda-nominated secretary general said to reporters at his NAM flat residence. Renouncing the dialogue between the EC and the 'reformists' Delwar said: "They (the pro-reform faction) are isolated from the mainstream BNP and the people. They participated in the dialogue drama under police protection in order to go on and participate in a stage managed election." "They have participated in a 'blueprint' dialogue so that they can stand for election with BNP's sheaf of paddy symbol. But it will not work. They will not be able to go to the constituency using the symbol. The people will give them a befitting reply." The BNP leader said he was thinking of taking action against disputed secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed for violating party discipline. "I am waiting for the decision of the chairperson. Action will be taken against him." Replying to a question, Delwar said: "If we are invited to pre-dialogue talks BNP will go to spell out its stance. However, we have not yet got an invitation." He termed the case filed against BNP leaders and supporters with Tejgaon police on Saturday as false and fabricated. "The leaders and workers cannot be cowed by threats." He alleged that pro-reform elements of the party filed the case to save themselves from public wrath. Delwar criticised Dr Kamal Hossain for his comment Saturday that those calling for release of detained offenders were themselves implicated in criminal activities. "He is speaking wildly. It cannot be so that the accused should not have any defence. It is a kind of terrorism. It is collaboration." BNP joint secretaries general Nazrul Islam Khan and Selima Rahman, acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed, former lawmaker Nazimuddin Alam were among those present at the press briefing by Delwar. bdnew
