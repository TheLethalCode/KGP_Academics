 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Newly-appointed US ambassador James F Moriarty has said he is "confident" that the ninth parliamentary elections would be held by the year-end, the deadline set by the Election Commission. "Absolutely. They (the government) are doing the preparations," Moriarty told journalists Tuesday when asked whether he was confident that the general elections would be staged by December. He took questions from reporters after his first meeting with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry. "The government keeps on expressing its commitment to hold the election by the end of the year. "And I assure you I did not hear anything different from that at all in our meeting," Moriarty told reporters.

He called on the foreign adviser Tuesday as part of his initial courtesy calls in Bangladesh. The two held an open discussion on a wide range of topics of bilateral interest. bd
