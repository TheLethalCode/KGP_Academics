<TEXT>
 MILAN, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri thanked his side for giving him their full backing after Sunday's 5-2 home win over Lazio sealed a Champions League qualifying place. Third-placed Juve have achieved the feat in their first season back in the top flight following their relegation to Serie B for match-fixing and immediate promotion back. Former Chelsea and Parma coach Ranieri, who took over in June after the departure of Didier Deschamps, said the players deserved their success after all the club had been through. "A great thank you goes to the lads because it has not been easy to end up where we are. Compliments to everyone. It was not easy to be third three games from the end of the season. They have had a fantastic season," he told Sky television. "The lads were great to follow me straight away. It was not easy for me to arrive at Juve, build a team and immediately win. Could we have done more? It is fine like this. I feel I have a team that has great personality, they know what they want and are able to achieve it." Juve are five points behind second-placed AS Roma and still have a chance of overhauling them and securing a berth in the full Champions League without needing to play a qualifier. Alessandro Del Piero, who was in the Juve team who won the Champions League in 1996, scored his 18th goal of the league season against Lazio to confound those who thought the 33-year-old would not be able to cope back in the top flight. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni has overlooked him for recent squads but the striker is improving his chances of a call-up for Euro 2008 all the time. David Trezeguet, who nearly left Juve in June having also spent a season in Serie B, is joint top scorer in the league with 19 and has forced himself back into the France squad. Trezeguet's goal on Sunday was one of several created by Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi lately. He is another player who almost quit the club before the season but now looks happy. Inspirational Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved, 35, is likely to sign on for one more season in another boost for the club. The only fly in the ointment for the Turin side is the continuing fall out from the 2006 match-fixing affair. Juve have been charged following the second part of a sporting probe into the scandal, which involves accusations former general manager Luciano Moggi gave foreign mobile SIM cards to match officials to enable secret communication. The club say they have already paid the penalty for the affair and any further serious punishment is unlikely
