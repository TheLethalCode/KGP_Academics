 Washington, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US average retail price for gasoline skyrocketed 9.5 cents over the last week to a new high of $3.60 a gallon, the federal Energy Information Administration said on Monday. The national average price for regular, self-service gasoline is up 63 cents from a year ago due to high crude oil costs, which on Monday reached a record $119.93 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. The pump price has jumped 21 cents a gallon in the last two weeks alone and is expected to keep climbing. The EIA's weekly survey of service stations showed gasoline was the most expensive on the West Coast at $3.79 a gallon, up 5.2 cents. San Francisco had the highest city price at $3.92, also up 5.2 cents. The Rocky Mountain states had the lowest regional price at $3.48 a gallon, up 6.2 cents. Houston had the best bargain at the pump, up 8.1 cents to $3.47. Separately, the average price U.S. truckers paid for diesel fuel reached a new record of $4.18 a gallon, up 3.4 cents in the last week and $1.37 higher than a year ago, the EIA said. The central Atlantic states had the most expensive diesel at $4.38 a gallon, up 0.6 cent. The Gulf Coast region had the cheapest fuel at $4.11, up 3.6 cents, the EIA said. Truckers on Monday drove their big rigs through downtown Washington and held a rally at the Capitol to protest high diesel prices. It costs about $1,200 to fuel up a tractor trailer. Rising fuel costs could increase the cost of goods transported by trucks, including food, retail and manufactured goods.
