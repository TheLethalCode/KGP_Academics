 Kabul, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five suspected Taliban militants blew themselves up in a house close to Kabul's old city on Wednesday, avoiding capture by besieging Afghan security forces, an Interior Ministry official told Reuters. Security forces surrounded a house where the suspected militants were holed up during the night and clashes erupted. The five militants inside blew themselves up as security forces closed in on them, said an Interior Ministry official who declined to be named.
