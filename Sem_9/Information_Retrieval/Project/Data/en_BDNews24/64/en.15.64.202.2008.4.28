<TITLE> Vote to save Berlin`s Tempelhof airport fails </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Berlin, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An attempt to save Berlin's historic Tempelhof airport from being shut down failed on Sunday when not enough of the city's voters backed the measure in a referendum. Tempelhof, which became a symbol of freedom for West Berlin during the 1948/49 Air Lift, was the world's first airport with regular passenger flights in 1923. The smallest of three Berlin airports, it is just five km (3 miles) south of the city centre. The city government plans to close the loss-making airport in October and another west Berlin airport, Tegel, in 2011 as part of an agreement that made possible the construction of a new 3-billion euro airport for the city. Social Democrat Mayor Klaus Wowereit had argued that leaving open Tempelhof, whose losses have totalled 115 million euros over the past 10 years, could jeopardise the new Berlin-Brandenburg International (BBI) airport. Wowereit had also vowed to ignore the results of the non-binding referendum, which was the result of a signature campaign led by conservative tabloid newspapers. Only 350,000 of Berlin's 20 million passengers pass through Tempelhof each year. Wowereit has said the new BBI airport, which will be one of the largest in Europe, will create 40,000 jobs in Berlin, a city suffering from high unemployment. "I can well understand the sentiments of the people who are opposed to closing the airport for emotional or historic reasons," said Wowereit. He said the results showed that more than three-quarters of the voters in Berlin either were against the airport staying open or did not want to participate in the referendum. "So I urge the proponents to respect this majority," Wowereit added. The opposition Christian Democrats tried to whip up support to keep Tempelhof open for nostalgic reasons linked to the Cold War and the Air Lift -- as well as to damage the popular Wowereit -- even though they had at first backed closing it. Just 36 percent of Berlin's electorate took part in Sunday's referendum and the measure failed when only 21.7 percent of eligible voters backed the measure, well below the 25 percent required. About 60 percent of those who did cast ballots said they wanted to keep Tempelhof open while 40 percent voted no. As expected, most of the "yes" vote came from the west while most of the "no" vote from the former communist east. "We didn't reach a quorum but we still won 60 percent of those who voted," said Berlin CDU leader Friedberg Pflueger. "It's a clear message to Wowereit to keep Tempelhof open. The fight for Tempelhof lives on." Wowereit had called the costly maintenance of an inner city airport an "anachronism" that exposed residents to noise and safety risks, and which hurt the economy and environment. Tempelhof critics had pointed to court decisions stating that BBI could only open if Berlin's other airports shut, and argued that keeping Tempelhof would spark a wave of legal proceedings that would delay BBI.
