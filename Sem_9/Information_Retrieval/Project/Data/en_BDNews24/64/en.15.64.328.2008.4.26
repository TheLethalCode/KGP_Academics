<TITLE> Turk warplanes strike PKK targets in N.Iraq: army </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Istanbul, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's army said its warplanes struck Kurdish separatist targets inside northern Iraq on Friday and Saturday, in what army sources called the biggest Turkish air operation in northern Iraq this year. A Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) spokesman said the bombing had caused no casualties. The Turkish military has carried out a series of air attacks on northern Iraq since the end of a February land offensive into the neighbouring country, where rebels have bases. It was the second air strike this week, after an operation on Wednesday. The army tends to step up operations against the PKK in the spring when the snow melts, making it easier to move about in the mountainous region. "Turkish Airforce planes, supported by ground weapons, struck PKK targets in an effective operation on April 25-26," the General Staff said in a statement on its website. Army sources had said on Friday an air operation was carried out at around 1630 GMT. Clashes between Turkish soldiers and PKK guerrillas also continued inside Turkey on Saturday in the mountainous province of Sirnak, which borders Iraq. Army sources said a soldier was killed during the clashes on Friday, bringing the death toll that day to three. The Turkish military staged an eight-day incursion into northern Iraq in February against the PKK, in which the army said 240 rebels were killed along with 27 of its own men. That operation prompted concern in Washington about further regional instability and was watched closely in Turkey's financial markets. Ankara blames the PKK for 40,000 deaths since 1984 when the group took up arms to carve out an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey. The United States and the European Union, along with Turkey, consider it a terrorist organisation.
