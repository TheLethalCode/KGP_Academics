<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A transvestite could face charges of extorting money from Brazil and AC Milan striker Ronaldo and stealing his driving licence, police said on Tuesday. They said Ronaldo, who is recovering from a serious knee injury, had been involved in an altercation with three transvestites late on Sunday in the Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood of Barra da Tijuca. "One of the transvestites said in his interview that the transvestite known as Andreia asked him (Ronaldo) for 50,000 reais ($27,600)," detective Carlos Augusto Nogueira told reporters. "It's very likely that he (Andreia) will be charged with extortion." The transvestites and Ronaldo were interviewed by police on Monday. Nobody has yet been charged. Nogueira said that Andreia, whose real name was given as Andre Luiz Ribeiro Albertino, had taken Ronaldo's driving licence. Ronaldo has not appeared in public since the incident but his spokesman issued a statement on Tuesday. "In light of recent developments, it must be stressed that no criminal complaint whatsoever has been made against Ronaldo, which rules out any possibility of the player being required to appear at the police station," it said. "As a keen supporter of social causes, Ronaldo has never been a drug user and has always taken seriously his status as a role model and idol for children and young people in Brazil and around the world." Ronaldo, 31, suffered a serious knee injury during a Serie A game against Livorno in February but has said he is determined to resume his career. His spokesman said he would continue to have three sessions of physiotherapy a day. His recovery is expected to take at least another seven months
