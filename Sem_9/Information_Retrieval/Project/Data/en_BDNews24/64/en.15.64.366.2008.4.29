 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday stayed proceedings in two more cases against BNP's senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman. An HC bench of justices Md Iman Ali and Emdadul Haque Azad passed the order after Tarique, son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, filed two appeals. The HC has so far ordered freezes on the proceedings in eight cases against Tarique, who secured bail in six. But the latest court order did not clear the way for Tarique to be released from prison as he had not received bail in two cases, Tarique's lawyer barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan told reporters after the hearing. Tarique was arrested on March 8 last year. Mir Zohir Hossain, managing director of Mir Akhter Hossain Ltd, filed a Tk 5 crore extortion case against controversial businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun and six others on April 1 last year. Tarique was later charged in the case following Mamun's statement. Khairul Bashar, manager of Abul Momen Ltd, filed another extortion case of Tk 5 crore with Shahbagh Police Station against Mamun and six others. Later Tarique was brought into the chargesheetagain after Mamun's confessional statement. The government brought the cases under emergency powers rules to scuttle scope for bail to the accused person. Tarique filed two writ petitions challenging the legality of the case proceedings. The court asked the government to explain why the cases filed under the EPR would not be declared illegal. Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokan and advocate AHM Mizanur Rahman stood for Tarique in the hearing. Deputy attorney general Syeda Afsar Jahan represented the state. bdnew
