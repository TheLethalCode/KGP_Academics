<TITLE> HBOS board meets amid rights issue talk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's HBOS Plc is expected to consider asking shareholders for up to 4 billion pounds ($7.9 billion) as the bank grapples with big writedowns and a worsening economic outlook. Britain's biggest mortgage lender through its Halifax brand would follow its rival Royal Bank of Scotland in shoring up its capital base by tapping shareholders for fresh funds as the credit crunch erodes the finances of leading lenders. Newspaper reports said a meeting of HBOS's board on Monday would consider seeking between 2 billion and 4 billion pounds through a rights issue of new stock, though they also said the bank could still decide to ride out the credit crunch without fresh funds. HBOS is due to report on current trading on Tuesday, alongside its annual shareholder meeting. HBOS has refused to comment on the recent speculation and couldn't be reached on Monday. By 1000 GMT its shares were down 0.6 percent 494 pence to value the lender at just over 18 billion pounds. Last week RBS unveiled a record 12 billion pounds rights issue, increasing speculation that HBOS and Barclays, which have among the most stretched capital ratios among UK banks, could raise cash to bolster balance sheets. Analysts have estimated HBOS could take further writedowns of up to 3 billion pounds, hit by the deteriorating value of toxic assets including below-prime Alt-A mortgages. With its full-year results in February, HBOS announced writedowns of just 227 million pounds. HBOS's brokers Morgan Stanley and Dresdner Kleinwort are expected to at least partly underwrite any rights issue. CAPITAL CUSHION HBOS's core tier 1 capital ratio was 5.7 percent at the end of 2007, better that RBS's level of just over 4 percent and 5.1 percent at Barclays but below other rivals. Capital is the cushion a bank keeps to protect depositors against future shocks. The core tier 1 ratio measures equity capital against risk-weighted assets and is a core measure of financial strength from a regulatory point of view. Analysts at Cazenove said a 3 billion pound writedown could cut HBOS's equity tier 1 ratio to 5 percent. "If the 3 billion pound writedown figure is correct (and is taken against the trading book), then in our view the board will consider that a 5 percent equity tier 1 ratio is too low," Cazenove said in a note. But they said a lower writedown may not require the bank to raise capital in the near term. Keeping balance sheets above uncomfortable levels is likely to involve more banks following RBS's lead and rivals could benefit by acting early, said a banker, who asked not to be named. He said a global credit crunch appears set to last at least through this year and regulators are putting increasing pressure on banks to recapitalise. "Six percent is the new 5 percent," he said in regard to the tier 1 capital banks are expected to hold. Some investors are also rewarding banks who build up their capital with a higher rating, partly offsetting the impact of a big dilution of their shares in a rights issue. Shares in Swiss bank UBS AG have jumped by a quarter this month since it unveiled a big rights issue to cover increased writedowns. HBOS Finance Director Mike Ellis said at a conference earlier this month HBOS would mark down asset valuations further in the first quarter given the deterioration in financial market
