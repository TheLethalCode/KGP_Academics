<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Monday Bangladesh exports to Canada had quadrupled in the past five years, paced by the GSP facility. "During the five years, Bangladeshi exports to Canada had quadrupled, growing from $163 million in 2001-2002 to $542 million in 2006-2007," Iftekhar told a meeting in Dhaka. The adviser spoke as chief guest at an event, organised by the Canadian High Commission at Sonargaon Hotel, to mark the fifth anniversary of the access of Bangladeshi manufactures to the Canadian market. "The reason for this is the GSP (generalised system of preferences) facilities extended to us. This reflects Canada's enlightened approach to global issues," he said. Iftekhar added that Bangladesh was looking for similar access to other developed countries. The adviser mentioned that about 70,000 people of Bangladeshi origin are living in Canada and contributing to Canada's progress, "much to our pride". He further added that "today Canada is emerging as a destination for our skilled manpower, which will become another key connection linking our two countries". Canadian High Commissioner Barbara Richardson also spoke. bdn
