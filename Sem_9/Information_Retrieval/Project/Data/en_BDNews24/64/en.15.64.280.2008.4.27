 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)Islamic Development Bank (IDB) has agreed to give Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation $200 million in loan, a top energy official said. Energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com that IDB had agreed to give $200 million at a 1.75 percent interest rate in addition to the LBOR rate. An emergency meeting on April 20, chaired by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, decided to take the emergency loan from IDB to meet troubled BPC's import bill. The government offered to pay a 1.75 percent interest rate plus the LIBOR rate on the loan, but IDB did not agree at the time and bargained for a minimum of a 5.5 percent rate. After a long bargain, the IDB agreed to the government's officer. "IDB loan will ease BPC's financial crisis," another energy official said. BPC chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com: "The financial condition of BPC is not good. Due to the crisis two consignments of energy have been cancelled." But he was hopeful of solving the problem at least for now. "We will import oil from United Arab Emirates." He said the stock of jet fuel has come down. A jet fuel consignment is expected to reach Bangladesh by May 10. bdnew
