<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday a further domestic fuel price hike to match increasing international prices could result in social discontent and fuel inflation. In his speech to the 64th ministerial meeting of the United Nations Economic and Social Council in Bangkok, the adviser also urged oil-exporting countries to provide some "relief funds" to overcome the crisis for least developed countries. The adviser made the comment on fuel prices a day after the International Monetary Fund advised Bangladesh to increase the prices of oil to adjust domestic prices to the international market. The government Thursday doubled the prices of CNG. "Domestic fuel price adjustment to rapidly rising international prices can be a major source of social discontent and cost-push inflation," Mirza Aziz told the meeting, according to a message received from the Thai capital. "The international community should seriously consider how, at least, a part of the windfall gains reaped by oil exporting countries can be mobilised to provide some relief to import-dependent LDCs," the adviser said. Thai prime minister Samak Sundaravej inaugurated the meeting. bdn
