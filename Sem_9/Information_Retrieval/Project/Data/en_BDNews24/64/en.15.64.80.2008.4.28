 HARARE, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A partial recount of Zimbabwe's disputed presidential election has been completed and verification of the results by the candidates will start on Tuesday, an election official said on Monday. The month-long wait for results from the March 29 election has led to a tense political standoff that has raised fears of bloodshed and drawn opposition accusations that President Robert Mugabe is trying to rig the outcome to keep hold of power.

I'm getting the information that they are now collating the results, which will be available tomorrow," Zimbabwe Electoral Commission spokesman Utoile Silaigwana told Reuters. "Once this process has been completed, the process of verification of the presidential ballots will also commence tomorrow." The verification of results by presidential candidates could take up to a week, electoral officials have said. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who says he won an outright majority in the first round of voting and has rejected an expected runoff, urged Mugabe to step down. "Old man, go and have an honourable exit," Tsvangirai told a news conference in Johannesburg in neighbouring South Africa. Mugabe's ZANU-PF lost control of parliament for the first time since he took office after independence from Britain in 1980. Now all eyes are on the presidential vote. A win for Mugabe would deepen the economic collapse of the once prosperous country, political analysts say.
