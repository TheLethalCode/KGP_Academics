Bapetel told the NAN state news agency his party would not challenge the result. Saturday's poll in Adamawa state was generally peaceful and marked by high turnout.

Yar'Adua's challengers in the presidential race -- Abubakar and former head of state Muhammadu Buhari -- have appealed to the Supreme Court after a tribunal dismissed their complaints and turned down demands for a re-ru
