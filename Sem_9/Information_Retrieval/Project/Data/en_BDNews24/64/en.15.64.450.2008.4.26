<TITLE> Shutdown of major British oil pipeline proceeds: BP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A pipeline carrying up to half of Britain's oil was gradually being shut down on Saturday ahead of a strike over pensions that has already closed a major refinery and prompted panic buying. The Grangemouth refinery in Scotland produces some 10 percent of Britain's petrol and diesel but also supplies vital power to the neighbouring Kinneil plant that processes the crude oil coming ashore from 70 fields in the North Sea. Without that power Kinneil cannot operate. In preparation, several of the North Sea fields have begun to cease production. "We have been told that we will continue to receive utilities right up until the strike starts at six a.m. tomorrow (0500 GMT), but by then the pipeline will have to be shut down," a spokesman for operator BP said. "So we are pressing on with preparations to shut the system down and expect that system to be shut down by the time the strike starts tomorrow morning." The strike is the first to close a British refinery in over 70 years. The Forties pipeline carries an average of 700,000 barrels per day (bpd), close to half the 1.5 million barrels the country produces daily. One fifth of Britain's gas supply also relies on the Forties system. The Forties oil alone is worth some 50 million pounds ($100 million) a day and its closure for the two-day strike will make a significant dent in already stretched government coffers because of hefty tax revenues. The government insists there will be no overall shortages of fuel but accepts that there may be some local supply problems, particularly in Scotland and northern England. "There is plenty of petrol and diesel in Scotland to meet demand during this period of time. But of course that is going to be challenged if people change the way that they consume fuel," said industry minister John Hutton. "There is every reason to believe that we will get through this period sensibly, if people continue to buy fuel sensibly too," he told BBC radio. BP said that assuming it got power back as soon as the strike ended and Forties fields resumed production rapidly, the pipeline could be back in operation within 24 hours but might take a few more days to get back to full flow. Management at the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, owned by the international chemical company Ineos, were meeting officials of the UNITE union on Saturday to try to get a deal that would allow the pipeline to continue operating. Ineos said on Friday that it had completed the shutdown at Grangemouth and said the union had refused to maintain power and steam supplies needed to keep the Kinneil plant operating. UNITE officials said that they expected the power station to shut as planned on Saturday. The government has called on Ineos and the unions to cooperate to ensure the power station remains open. Talks to resolve the dispute collapsed on Wednesday evening. European diesel prices have shot up this week on worries about a fuel shortage. British gas prices have also jumped although the National Grid gas supply network said it did not expect gas shortages as warm spring weather has curbed demand.
