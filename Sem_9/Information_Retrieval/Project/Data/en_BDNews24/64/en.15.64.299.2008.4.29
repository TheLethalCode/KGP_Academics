<TITLE> Turkish court releases Kurdish leader from jail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ankara, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Turkish military court released a former leader of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, who is on trial facing charges that a fake health report enabled him to avoid military service, the state Anatolian news agency said on Monday. The court also released 51 other people alongside DTP former chairman Nurettin Demirtas, 35. No explanation was given for the move and Demirtas's trial will continue. Demirtas is not a member of parliament but was elected head of the party in November. The DTP has 20 members of parliament and seeks autonomy for mainly Kurdish southeastern Turkey. Demirtas is being tried on charges of using fake health reports in order to avoid military service, obligatory for all healthy Turkish men. Prosecutors say his party has links with the separatist Kurdish rebel group PKK. Prosecutors are seeking a 2-5 year prison sentence for the former DTP leader, who denies the charge. Turks who dodge the military service usually receive stiff punishment.
