 Miami, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain on Monday will argue the way to improve US health-care coverage lies in lowering costs and increasing competition rather than the "big-government" schemes he says the Democrats advocate. McCain, opening a week-long U.S. campaign swing to focus on his health care proposals, will visit a Miami children's hospital on the first stop on Monday. "America can have a health care system that is characterized by better prevention, coordinated care, electronic health records, cutting-edge treatments -- and lower costs," McCain will say, according to excerpts of his speech provided by his campaign. "We can build a health care system that is more responsive to our needs and is delivered to more people at lower cost. The solution, my friends, isn't a one-size-fits-all big-government takeover of health care." McCain, who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination, is waiting to see who wins the right to be his Democratic opponent in November's election -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama or New York Sen. Hillary Clinton. Both have put health care at the center of their campaigns by setting a goal of universal health care coverage for the 47 million Americans without health insurance. Clinton would mandate some form of coverage for all, while Obama would only mandate coverage for children. Republicans, who did not make health care a major issue in their primary battle won by McCain, have criticized the Democratic approach as a big-government cure-all for the U.S. health care system. McCain's plan, released last fall, would concentrate on reining in costs and expanding access and would include a tax credit of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families. It also would aim to increase competition and innovation and make it possible to buy coverage through any organization or association, reducing but not eliminating the reliance on employer-provided plans. "We must move away from a system that is fragmented and pays for expensive procedures toward one where a family has a medical home, providers coordinate their efforts and take advantage of technology to do so cheaply, and where the focus is on affordable quality outcomes," McCain says in the excerpts. "I am convinced that the wrong way to go is to turn over your lives to the government and hope it will all be fine. It won't," he said. "That route ignores the lessons of other countries where governments pay the bills, but real people pay a deeper cost through long waits for treatment or settling for care that does not take advantage of the latest medical science." McCain's will spend two days in Florida and later hit Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa and Colorado on his health care tour.
