<TEXT>
 Tokyo, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An abused wife who killed her husband, cut up his body and dumped the parts on a street and in a park was jailed for 15 years by a Tokyo court on Monday, a court official and Japanese media said. Kaori Mihashi, 33, killed her husband by hitting him over the head with a wine bottle in the 2006 case, Kyodo news agency reported. Doctors had said Mihashi was insane at the time of the murder but the court ruled that while she had been seeing hallucinations she was mentally capable of making decisions, Japanese media said. "While her married life was like hell and she was feeling desperate, the responsibility for the brutal and abject crime is serious," Japanese public broadcaster NHK quoted the presiding judge, Masaya Kawamoto, as saying. The doctors had said that Mihashi was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after being beaten by her husband, Kyodo said. A Tokyo District Court official confirmed the sentence but declined to give details of the crime.
