 BEIJING, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain booked their place in the Fed Cup final on Sunday after Nuria Llagostera Vives beat China's Peng Shuai 6-4 6-4, giving the five-times champions an unassailable 3-0 lead in their semi-final. "We knew we could win the tie but we've never expected to win three matches in a row," Vives told a news conference. In the first two matches of the five-rubber tie on Saturday at the Beijing International Tennis Centre, Carla Suarez-Navarro defeated Peng and Vives beat Zheng Jie. Peng said she had a few chances in the second set of Sunday's match but that Vives had played better, producing a wider variety of shots and moving around the court faster. "I felt really sorry. I really didn't want to lose," the world number 68 said. World number 76 Vives had a controversial line call ruled in her favour in the final game to give her match point and she then forced Peng to return long to seal victory. "I decided to run a lot and to make her run a lot in order to control the match at my favourite rhythm and used my forehand to put pressure on her," Vives said. Spain will play the winner of the other semi-final between holders Russia and the United States in Moscow. Russia hold a 2-0 lead. Captain Miguel Margets Lobato said it would be tough in the final regardless of the opponent. "I think it's very possible to meet Russia in the finals, who are very strong," he said. "But we have beaten Italy and today China. I believe we are also strong enough to win the final championship.
