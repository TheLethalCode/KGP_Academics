<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)BNP's pro-Saifur faction urged authorities to free Khaleda Zia, lift the emergency and announce an election date during an electoral reform dialogue with the Election Commission Sunday. "The government has to lift the emergency as soon as possible and announce the election date to help create a conducive political environment and dispel people's qualms," said former army chief Mahbubur Rahman, who led the 15-member BNP delegation in the EC dialogue. "Holding the forthcoming elections is a great challenge for the Election Commission. Law and order at the grassroots level will have to be secured further," said Mahbubur. He demanded the former prime minister's freedom, and expressed concern about a "leadership crisis" in the country because of a general lack in the practice of politics. The BNP delegation also called for annulling the provision for 'negative votes' from the electoral law package, relaxing party registration rules, use of transparent ballot boxes if possible and vesting military personnel on duty during the election with power of arrest. Underscoring the need for consensus building over banning 'hartals' and similar unproductive means of demonstrating dissatisfaction, Mahbubur said: "A free and fair election will not be possible unless the unemployed get employed and consumer prices are reined in." "People today want an end to this situation where there is no politics or political leadership." Agreeing with almost all the EC's draft amendments, acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed said: "The proposed amendments in the electoral law package will bring about qualitative change in the country's political arena. My party about fully agrees with the EC proposals." Demanding national polls by the end of 2008, Hafiz said: "The administration will have to work neutrally to hold a free and fair election." He complained at the same time that the present government is working for a particular political party. He also commented that there could be no democracy in the country unless the political parties practice the same. "Measures will have to be adopted so that the ensuing election is held in an environment which is free from muscle flexing, black money and nomination-seeking deals," said Hafiz. "Reforms should ensure that an eligible candidate, though poor, should be able to contest and make it to be a lawmaker in the process of a free and fairly held election." Starting at 10.10am, Sunday's two-hour long talks rounded off the EC's electoral dialogue process with the major political parties. The EC was represented by the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Sakhawat Hussain and commission secretary Mohammad Humayun Kabir. On BNP's demand for announcement of election dates, Huda said the Election Commission would consider the issue after completion of voter registration in June and expressed hope that BNP will stand united in the coming polls. Stressing the need to fortify party registration rules, the CEC said: "The EC doesn't want to control the political parties in any manner through the registration process. The initiative has been launched only to strengthen the political process, which would otherwise allow parties to exist as meaningless entities on paper." On announcing an election date, Huda said: "We'd like to hold a fair election following the roadmap. Once the voter registration is done by June, we'll be in a position to consider fixing the election date. We hope to accomplish the tasks well before our time expires." Wrapping up Sunday's long-awaited electoral reform dialogue with BNP, Huda said: "The multiparty democracy BNP talks about should prove sustainable for a democracy." The CEC assured that the EC would publish all the proposals generated from the dialogue process as 'official records or documents'. Replying to a reporter's query on his way out after the talks, Mahbubur Rahman said: "We are representing BNP, which is a major political party and we'll face any challenge in the future with our supporters." Asked if the delegation had come to Sunday's dialogue representing a united party, he said: "We have invited them at all levels to join hands. Khaleda Zia and Khandakar Delwar Hossain have been informed. It won't be right to say that we're not united. Time will right everything and we'll be united again." Mentioning that their meeting with the EC had been successful, Mahbubur said he expected that a nationally and internationally accepted election will be held within 2008. The EC was scheduled to hold its first round dialogue with BNP on Nov 22 last year, after sending an invitation letter to secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed of the party's reformist faction on Nov 5. The dialogue stalled as Khaleda, also BNP chairperson, filed a writ petition on Nov 18 challenging the validity of the invitation. On Apr 22, the EC again invited Hafizuddin's faction to dialogue following a High Court verdict that went in favour of the reformist leaders, quashing Khaleda's writ petition. The commission started its first round of dialogues with 15 major political parties on Sept 12 last year and the second round on Feb 24. Security was beefed up in and around the EC Secretariat Sunday to prevent clashes between supporters of the two BNP factions. Hundreds of BNP supporters and activists waited outside the secretariat building during the dialogue. No untoward incident was reported. bdnews24.com/sm/mhc/ahd/ra
