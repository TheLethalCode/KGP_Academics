<TITLE> Iran to give nuclear proposals to Russia: radio </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tehran, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will hand over to Russia a package of proposals designed to defuse a nuclear row with world powers, state radio said on Monday without giving details. Iran said this month it would soon unveil ideas to help end the dispute over its nuclear programme, which the West says is aimed at producing atomic bombs, an allegation Tehran has dismissed. Tehran has been hit by three rounds of U.N. sanctions since 2006 for defying the U.N. demand to halt sensitive nuclear work. Sanctions have been backed by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- plus Germany, a group known as the "5+1". "The Islamic Republic of Iran will submit its proposed nuclear package, which is directed to the 5+1 group, during Sobolev's trip to Iran," state radio said referring to Valentin Sobolev, acting secretary of Russia's National Security Council. Sobolev and Iran's chief nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili began talks on Monday, radio added. Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said this month Iran would soon reveal proposals with a "new orientation" to help end international and other problems. He gave no further details about what the ideas might be. World powers are considering enhancing a package of trade and other incentives for Iran if it stops enriching uranium, which can be used as nuclear fuel or, if desired, provide material for bombs. U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown this month pledged a united effort to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, possibly by expanding sanctions. Iran has ruled out shelving its nuclear drive and says it is working on its own proposals to help defuse the standoff.
