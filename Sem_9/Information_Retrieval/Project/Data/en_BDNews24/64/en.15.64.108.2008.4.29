 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Severe cyclone Nargis over the west central Bay and adjoining southwest Bay threatens to whip up speed and intensity. "The cyclone moved slightly northwards and is likely to intensify and move in a northerly direction further," the Meteorological Department said in a special bulletin Tuesday. The April 29 weathercast calls to mind one of the deadliest cyclones in Bangladesh, which killed 143,000 people in 1991. Nargis was centred at 9pm Tuesday, about 1155km southwest of Chittagong port, 1091km southwest of Cox's Bazar port and 1030km south southwest of Mongla port. Maximum sustained wind speed within 60km of the storm centre is about 90kph, rising to 115kph in squalls. The sea will remain "very rough" over the north Bay and high near the cyclone, according to the bulletin. British-based storm tracking service Tropical Storm Risk (http://tsr.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/) rated Nargis as a category 2 storm on Tuesday and it was expected to reach category 4 strength in 36 hours. Category 5 is the maximum category for tropical cyclones. Maritime ports of Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla have been asked to keep hoisted the distant warning signal 2, the weather office said. All fishing boats and trawlers over the north Bay have been asked to stay near the coast and proceed with caution until further notice. They have been advised against going to deep sea. Cyclone Sidr killed nearly 3,500 people last November. It destroyed 1.8 million tonnes of rice in the fields and left around two million people homeless. bdnews2
