<TITLE> Inter say Ronaldinho price too high </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan President Massimo Moratti said on Tuesday Ronaldinho was expensive and the club were unlikely to try to outbid city rivals AC Milan to sign him from Barcelona. "The price of Ronaldinho is a little high," Moratti told reporters on Tuesday. "We are following the affair but I don't think we are the most interested. Others have officially said they are. There is no derby (to sign him)." Barcelona President Joan Laporta said that the player was worth at least 40 million euros ($62.30 million). AC Milan agreed personal terms with the Brazil forward earlier this month but the transfer has stalled over the Spanish club's asking price. Laporta said in an interview Barcelona had received several bids for the twice former World Player of the Year, including from Premier League sides but AC Milan had shown the strongest interest. "I only say that Ronaldinho is worth more than 40 million euros ($62.5 million)," Laporta told Tuesday's Gazzetta dello Sport. He added that the player might stay on at the Camp Nou. "He has never created the slightest problem and I'm sure he will return to how he was before, as soon as he is well. "He just needs to find new motivation but it's no foregone conclusion that he has to leave because he can find this with us, given that his contract runs until 2010." Barcelona, the only non-English side left in the last four of the Champions League, visit Manchester United on Tuesday after last week's goalless draw in the first leg
