 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Ongoing water shortages in the capital are causing misery for thousands as WASA struggles to meet increased seasonal demand in the face of irregular power supplies. Residents from widespread areas of Dhaka have been facing enormous difficulties in maintaining their regular routines. Kazi Azimul Haque, a resident of Badda, said things had got so bad that his family was forced to recycle bath water. "When we manage to collect a little water we pour it into a big bowl which we stand in to bathe. We use a mug to pour the water over ourselves, so that none is wasted. "After finishing our bath we wash our clothes in the same water, finally using the water to pour down the toilet." Haque said WASA had not provided any water to his area for the last 15 days, adding that the family's entire daily routine had been effected. "Our sleep, our eating and many other activities have become disrupted. Sometimes collecting water from far-flung places means we miss work." According to WASA, summer demand for water in Dhaka stands at 200 crore litres every day, although supply falls 20 crore litres short of the target. Midday Saturday bdnews24.com visited the tubewell located by the Gulshan-Badda link road and talked to some of the people gathered there. Nasima Haque, a Dhaka housewife, said she had to brave the midday heat to collect water despite suffering from high blood pressure. "I suffer from high blood pressure, but I still have to walk half a kilometre to collect water from here," said Nasima. "If I don't do this I cant cook, wash up or clean myself," she added. WASA managing director Raihanul Abedin told bdnews24.com that the primary cause of the water crises was a power shortfall. "There is at least three to four hours load-shedding a day, in addition to periods when the voltage level does not allow us to operate our pumps," said Abedin. "If their was no power crisis there would be no water crisis," he added. There are 482 WASA deep tubewells in Dhaka city and 274 generators dedicated to running the pumps, according to WASA. WASA engineer Raihanul Abedin said at least 100 more generators were needed in the city, although he added that 23 new deep tubewells were being installed this week. "There are 920 pipes at different points in the city for the public to use, although many of them are not properly capped and the water gushes out. There has to be a system to prevent water wastage." bdnew
