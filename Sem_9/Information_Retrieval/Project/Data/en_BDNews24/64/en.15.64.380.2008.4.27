 Sydney, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia will withdraw 200 troops from East Timor, sent after the February assassination attempt on the country's president and prime minister, as both countries now regard the security situation to be stable. "This drawdown in Australian forces reflects the improved security situation in Timor Leste," Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said in a statement. Rebel soldiers attempted to assassinate President Jose Ramos-Horta on February 7, seriously wounding the president in a gunbattle in Dili, and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, who escaped unharmed from a simultaneous attack. Ramos-Horta returned to East Timor from Australia two weeks ago, after undergoing extensive surgery, and a state of emergency in the country was lifted last week. "The return home of President Ramos-Horta and the lifting from 23 April of the state of emergency across most of the country have been important developments in Timor Leste's recovery following the attacks," Rudd said. "The security situation is now assessed by both ourselves and the government of Timor Leste as stable," he said. The leader of the rebel soldiers who attacked Ramos-Horta was killed in the gunfight, but other rebel soldiers remain free. The withdrawal will leave about 750 Australian military personnel in East Timor. More than 2,500 foreign troops and police remain in the country to help local security forces maintain stability. Asia's youngest country, East Timor, has been unable to achieve stability since a hard-won independence from Indonesia in 2002. The East Timor army tore apart along regional lines in 2006, when about 600 soldiers were sacked, triggering factional violence that killed 37 people and drove 150,000 from their homes.
