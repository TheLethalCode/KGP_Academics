Nepal, which has not reported any bird flu cases, banned the import of poultry from India in January.

Smuggling of poultry and livestock from India posed an additional threat, officials said. Nepal has declared six eastern districts "high-risk zones" and intensified vigil on farm and backyard poultry. Ninety chicken samples were being tested. Test results of some samples had turned negative for avian influenza, the Himalayan Times said, quoting Surendra Yadav, a livestock official in eastern Morang district which has been classified as an extremely sensitive area. The newspaper said veterinary teams were regularly inspecting poultry and warning people about bird flu. Experts fear the H5NI virus might mutate or combine with the highly contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that could kill millions of people.
