 Acapulco, Mexico, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A moderate earthquake of magnitude 5.8 hit southern Mexico on Sunday, startling tourists and residents on the Pacific coast and shaking Mexico City, but there were no reports of injuries. "It was a bit scary but ... we are kind of used to this," said Alejandro Garcia, a receptionist at the four-star Maris Hotel on Acapulco's famed beachfront. "The tourists are okay, there was no need to evacuate them. Nobody ran out into the street," he added. There was no apparent damage in the resort, witnesses said. The quake's epicenter was in a rural zone in Guerrero state north of Acapulco but much of the area is mountainous and not heavily populated. "We have no reports of any effects," said Roel Ayala, a civil protection official in the state capital Chilpancingo. An earthquake of 5.8 magnitude is capable of causing considerable damage. Some residents of the capital Mexico City, around 100 miles (160 km) to the north, were also shaken but emergency workers said there were no signs of damage or injuries in the capital, home to some 18 million people.
