<TITLE> FA ask for TV footage of Stamford Bridge fracas </TITLE>

 LONDON, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The FA will request CCTV footage of the fracas between several Manchester United players and Chelsea ground staff after the teams' Stamford Bridge Premier League game on Saturday. United players Patrice Evra, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes, Gerard Pique, Park Ji-sung and John O'Shea were going through a warm-down after Chelsea's 2-1 victory when the row developed after ground staff asked them to move to another area of the pitch. Chelsea security staff pulled the gesticulating parties apart and Sunday's newspapers carried pictures of the incident. "We will obviously be asking Chelsea to let us see their CCTV footage of the incident," an FA spokesman told the BBC. "This will have nothing to do with the referee's report. "He would have been in his dressing room, a long way from the incident." The fracas was the final act of a controversial afternoon as Chelsea won with a late penalty to join league leaders United on 81 points with two games remaining. United's Rio Ferdinand apologised to a steward for accidentally kicking her as he lashed out at a wall while leaving the pitch, seemingly annoyed about the decision to award the match-winning penalty following a clear handball by Michael Carrick. The result means the title will not be decided until the final day of the season on May 11, although United's vastly superior goal difference means they could effectively secure it earlier by beating West Ham United if Chelsea lose at Newcastle United. Before those games, however, both teams have European matters to deal with in the second legs of their Champions League semi-finals. United face Barcelona at Old Trafford on Tuesday after a goalless first leg and have injury concerns over striker Wayne Rooney and centre-back Vidic. Rooney, who scored United's goal on Saturday, was substituted with a hip injury while Vidic had stitches in a cut mouth and was dazed after being caught by Didier Drogba's knee. Chelsea entertain Liverpool on Wednesday after a 1-1 Anfield draw. It is not yet know whether Frank Lampard will play after he missed Saturday's game following the death of his mother on Thursday
