<TITLE> Chile Codelco copper strike in day 13, two units shut </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Santiago, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world No.1 copper producer Codelco said on Monday two of its divisions remained shut for a 13th day, as Chilean subcontract miners vowed to push on with the latest in a series of sometimes violent strikes. State-owned Codelco, with annual copper output of about 1.7 million tonnes, on Saturday reopened its Teniente division, home to the world's largest underground copper mine. It had closed the mine after several disruptions, some violent. But its Andina and Salvador divisions have remained closed since subcontractors from the Confederation of Copper Workers launched their company-wide strike over pay and conditions on April 16. The strike is the latest protest by subcontractors demanding a bigger share of windfall revenues from copper prices, which have jumped nearly seven-fold this decade. "Operations at (Salvador) remain paralyzed," Codelco said in a statement. "Codelco did not resume operations at (Andina) today because it is in the process of reviewing its dealings with subcontracting companies." The strike at Codelco has helped push global copper prices to near-record highs of about $4 per lb as markets grow nervous about inventories, already stretched thin. The protest underpinned prices for the red metal on the London Metal Exchange on Monday, though a stronger dollar capped gains. Analysts have estimated lost output so far at around 15,000 tonnes -- a small amount in a market thought last year to have consumed about 18 million tonnes of the metal used widely in the power and construction industries. When Teniente was shut too, Codelco put its daily losses at $10 million. Subcontractors have vowed to push on with their strike. "We are not going to budge and the subcontractor strike remains firm and vigorous," Cristian Cuevas, president of the striking subcontract workers under the confederation, told a news conference. "In the coming hours, we will redouble our mobilization efforts with roadblocks at access to the mines," he added, accusing Codelco of deliberately staging acts of violence blamed on the subcontractors. Codelco says it has fulfilled its end of agreements reached last year with subcontractors, including a deal to absorb some of them into its full-time ranks. The government has called for a speedy end to the feud. "The government has checked the agreements reached last August, and agrees with Codelco that if not all, a huge part of those agreements have been fulfilled," government spokesman Francisco Vidal told reporters. "But the government is nonetheless going to call on Codelco to fulfill the subcontracting law's requirements and that means permanently taking on in the shortest possible timeframe those workers who should be part of Codelco and not subcontracted." Andina, about 50 miles (80 km) northeast of the Chilean capital, produced 218,000 tonnes of copper in 2007. Salvador, 685 miles (1,100 km) north of Santiago, produced 64,000 tonnes of copper last year, Teniente, 50 miles (80 km) south of Santiago, produced 405,000 tonnes of copper last year. Codelco's Norte and Ventanas divisions have run normally throughout the strike.
