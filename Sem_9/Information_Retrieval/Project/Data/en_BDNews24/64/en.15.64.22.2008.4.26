<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea manager Avram Grant described Saturday's 2-1 victory over Manchester United that kept alive the London side's title hopes as "very emotional". The normally stony-faced Israeli, in his 50th game for the club since taking over from Jose Mourinho last September, even cracked a smile when he said he felt optimistic Chelsea could overturn United's lead with two games left in the Premier League. A fiercely competitive game provoked spats between opposition players but also an on-pitch argument between Germany captain Michael Ballack, scorer of both goals, and Chelsea team mate Didier Drogba over who should take a free kick. Grant, who has suffered criticism for Chelsea's dour play in recent months, said he enjoyed the fans' noisy appreciation of an exciting match. "I think they appreciated the commitment and spirit of the players and their energy," he said. Chelsea, level with United on points but with a far inferior goal difference, need to win both their remaining league games and hope United drop points against either West Ham or Wigan Athletic. "But you can't reach this stage without expecting to win...otherwise you would not be in sport. You need to be optimistic. We are optimistic," he said. Grant praised substitute Andriy Shevchenko, for making the "save of the year" off the line in the dying moments of the game. He also said midfielder Frank Lampard, missing after the death of his mother, would decide for himself whether he was ready to return for Wedensday's Champions League semi-final against Liverpool. "We need to leave the decision to him...on the way to excellence you also have to be human," he said. Ballack, named man-of-the-match, after his first-half header and 86th minute penalty said he had felt his responsibility keenly when he stepped up to the spot for the kick normally taken by Lampard. "But for me it was not a problem. I can handle the pressure," he said. Chelsea captain John Terry added the side were convinced of victory from the start. "I think you saw today we want to win this premiership to take it away from Manchester United," he said. "I think we showed people today we can match anybody.
