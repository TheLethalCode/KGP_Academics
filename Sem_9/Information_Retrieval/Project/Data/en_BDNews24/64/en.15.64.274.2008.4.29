 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of CHT affairs Devasish Roy has stressed taking necessary steps for the conservation of medicinal plants in the hill tract regions. Speaking at a seminar in the city Tuesday, he also said the local people should be involved in producing herbal medicines from those plants. "Biodiversity is at stake in the hill tracts as forests are being destroyed," Devasish told a seminar titled "Medicinal plants of Chittagong Hill Tracts: problems and potentials" at Barc Auditorium. The CA's special aide said: "The cultivation of tobacco is ruining the fertility of the farming lands. Different medicinal plants are also being destroyed there." He recommended research and coordinated initiatives to disseminate the traditional herbal medicines and treatments of the hill communities throughout the country and abroad. He urged doctors practicing in the region to cultivate medicinal plants and produce herbal medicines in both public and private initiatives. bdnew
