 Kabul, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai was hussled away from a celebration on Sunday in the capital, Kabul, after gunshots were heard, Reuters witnesses said. Government ministers were also seen leaving the celebration near the presidential palace and state television cut off live transmission of the celebration, which marked the 16th anniversary of fall of Kabul to the Mujahideen. Sounds of gun fire could be still heard after television stopped coverage of the event. It was unclear what prompted the gunfire.
