 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to speak about forthcoming political dialogue, the state of emergency and elections in an address to the nation 'very soon', an adviser said Wednesday. "The chief adviser will make the issues clear in his speech to the nation," communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters after submitting a report on pre-dialogue talks to the chief adviser. Quader could not give a specific date for when Fakhruddin might make his address, saying only that it was expected to be "very soon". "We have reported to the chief adviser on the pre-dialogue talks," the adviser said. The chief adviser will present the report at an advisory council meeting, scheduled to be held later Wednesday, so all advisers may be appraised of the issues raised in the pre-dialogue talks, Quader said. The political parties and the government have agreed on a number of issues, he said but he did not give further details, adding: "The chief adviser will make them clear in his speech." "Both the government and political parties have felt the necessity of reforms within the parties," he said. On recommendations made by advisers in the pre-dialogue talks, Quader said the chief adviser would clarify in his address. Five advisers were assigned to hold the meetings in April in preparation for formal dialogue with political parties scheduled for the first or second week of May. The advisers held pre-dialogue talks with parties, local government representatives, business leaders and non-governmental organizations, wrapped up the talks on Apr 28. bdnews24.c
