 LONDON, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British bank HBOS Plc made a 4 billion pound ($7.9 billion) cash call on Tuesday and said it would trim its dividends, as it grapples with an increased hit from toxic assets and a deteriorating mortgage market. Britain's biggest mortgage lender is the second major UK bank in days to turn to investors with a deeply discounted rights issue, after Royal Bank of Scotland last week made a record 12 billion pound cash call. HBOS's move is expected to add to pressure on other banks to follow suit. HBOS, which said it was working in challenging conditions, also followed RBS in further marking down the value of treasury assets, announcing 2.8 billion pound writedowns for the year to date, almost four times the modest hit taken for all of 2007. The bank said the fully underwritten rights issue would bolster its balance sheet and allow it to target capital ratios at the top of the sector, preparing it for a further worsening in economic conditions, but also to grow through "defined growth opportunities" at home and abroad. "We've taken the firm view that for the next four to five years, given the more uncertain macroeconomic environment, we want to have an even higher target ratio," Chief Executive Andy Hornby told Reuters in a telephone interview. "We want to be well positioned for whatever macroeconomic uncertainties are thrown at us over the next few years." The bank said UK market conditions remained "challenging" and it expected a deterioration of the credit environment in 2008, though margin decline is expected to be lower than last year. HBOS will offer to sell two new shares for every five existing shares at 275 pence each, representing a 45 percent discount to Monday's close of 495-3/4p and a 36 percent discount to the stock's theoretical ex-rights price. At 0827 GMT, shares in HBOS were trading at 496-1/4p, up 0.1 percent. On the credit markets, the cost of insuring HBOS' debt fell slightly, with senior credit default swaps dropping 3 basis points to 90.5 basis points, a dealer in London said. "This is very much an exercise in bolstering capital and being a better capitalised bank, whether that means capturing growth opportunities, or better implications for credit ratings," analyst Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities said. "It's a slightly eye-watering discount, though." Hornby told Reuters he had not faced direct regulatory pressure to increase his balance sheet and said the cash call would be regarded as the "right thing to do", dismissing concern its shares would hit a market already awash with RBS stock. A HIGHER BAR? HBOS follows a general shift in the sector towards stronger capital ratios, with a 6 percent core Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, increasingly seen as a minimum. The bank now aims for a Tier 1 capital ratio of between 8 percent and 9 percent, with a core Tier 1 ratio of between 6 percent and 7 percent. Hornby told Reuters the bank expected to be at the higher end of the targeted range. HBOS's core Tier 1 was 5.7 percent at the end of 2007, better than that for RBS of just over 4 percent and 5.1 percent at Barclays Plc, but below other rivals. HBOS also trimmed its return on equity target to the "mid teens" from 20 percent and Hornby said this would be a "sensible long-term target" for other banks in the sector. After a modest hit in 2007 compared with its peers, HBOS had been expected to announce further writedowns. It took a writedown of 970 million pounds in the trading book, against just 227 million at the full year. It took an additional 1.87 billion pound post-tax hit to its banking book, which does not affect reported profits. Most concern at HBOS centred on the deteriorating value of below-prime Alt-A mortgages and the bank said the portfolio was being marked down 20 percent -- modest compared with 50 percent writedowns at RBS. The bank said it would reduce its dividend payout ratio to 40 percent from 46 percent, to "reflect a prudent view of the expected ongoing capital requirements of the group". It also said it would pay its interim 2008 dividend in shares, though the final dividend for the year is set to be paid in cash. As a legacy of its former existence as a building society, HBOS has the broadest investment base in Britain with over 2 million shareholders, a potential logistical nightmare as the bank's management prepares for the rights issue. News last week of RBS's record rights issue had increased speculation that HBOS and Barclays, which have among the most stretched capital ratios among UK banks, would follo
