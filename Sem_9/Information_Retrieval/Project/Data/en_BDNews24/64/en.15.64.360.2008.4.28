 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com) The first day of Supreme Court Bar Association election ended Monday with 539 out of the 1,780 voters casting ballots. The two-day polling began at 10.00am and continued until 5.00pm with a one-hour break from 1.00pm. After the first day's voting, Nizamul Haque Nasim, convener of a sub-committee on election, said: "Everything was all right. There was a festive mood around. Polling is going on in a cheerful environment although the election is being held after 25 months." Advocate Asadullah cast the maiden vote, followed by presidential candidate advocate Mujibur Rahman. The SCBA has introduced transparent ballot boxes for the first time. The bar association and its election committee said the elections kicked off as scheduled at 10am Monday to continue through Tuesday. The election earlier scheduled for March 24-25 was deferred by about five weeks in the face of a government ban, but was subsequently lifted after a MoU was executed between the SCBA and the government. The candidates running for president are barrister Shafique Ahmed, advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hossain, AK Mujibor Rahman, Humayun Hossain Khan, Sirajul Islam Khan and Saifur Reza. Barristers Abdullah Al Mamun, barrister Badruddoza Badal, advocates Sheikh Ausafur Rahman, Nurul Islam Sujan, ABM Bayezid, AKM Zahirul Haque and ASM Abul Hossain are contesting for secretary. There are six candidates contesting for two posts of vice president, two for a treasurer, five for two deputy secretaries and 14 for seven members. Security measures have been tightened in and around the Supreme Court premises for the election. bdnews24.com/at/ff
