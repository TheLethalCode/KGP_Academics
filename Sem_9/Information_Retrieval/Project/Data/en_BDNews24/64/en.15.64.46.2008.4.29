<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)The Securities and Exchange Commission has revealed that a shady website is offering stock-market consultancy to investors in violations of the securities law. SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed told reporters Tuesday that the website contains information on which issues to rise at what pace in next-day trade and asks investors to buy the scrips to gain windfalls. The SEC official however declined to disclose the name of the website. "I cannot name it now as an investigation is ongoing." In a press briefing, Farhad said solicitation services without the consent of the capital market regulator are illegal. "Even if someone is permitted to operate as a financial analyst, he cannot pass this information on to the public this way. Consultancy must be client-specific," he added. The regulator thinks that those who are behind the initiative have an intention to manipulate the market, said the SEC official. Farhad asserted that SEC would shut such activities. The SEC is formulating a guideline on the branch offices of brokerage houses and decided to lift the "circuit breaker" on the post-record day trading of an issue. The decisions came at a meeting of the commission on Tuesday, according to the SEC official. "The purpose of making a guideline for branch offices of brokerage houses is to ensure that investors enjoy equal security," Farhad said. bdn
