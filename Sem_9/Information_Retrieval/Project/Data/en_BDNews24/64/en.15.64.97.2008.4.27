<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Sunday she would not give up on politics under any pressure. "I will not retire from politics. I will not quit politics under any pressure," Hasina was quoted as telling her lawyers after she was produced in the Special Divisional Judge's Court for Dhaka as part of the proceedings of a graft case involving the purchase of MiG-29 warplanes. "Countrymen will decide whether I will do politics or not. I will not yield to anybody else's decision," the detained Awami League president was quoted as saying. The court permitted Hasina to speak to her lawyers after the hearing of the case. Her lawyers Quamrul Islam, Sahara Khatun and Abdul Mannan briefed reporters emerging from the court. The lawyers quoted Hasina as saying that it would not be wise to quit politics "leaving people in such a condition". Hasina was said to have protested Dr Kamal Hossain's statement that those who demanded the release of corrupt politicians should also be punished. Referring to Hasina, her lawyers alleged that the prison authorities had ignored doctors' suggestion that she should have stayed one more week at Square Hospital. "I was asked to return to jail suddenly on Saturday afternoon," the AL chief was quoted to have said. bdnew
