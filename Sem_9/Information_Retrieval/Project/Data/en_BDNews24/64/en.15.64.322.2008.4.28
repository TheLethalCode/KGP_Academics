 NEW YORK, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks were little changed on Monday as financial shares fell on fears of more dividend cuts and weak profits, but optimism about a proposed $23 billion takeover in the confection sector cushioned the market. Record crude oil prices created another headwind for the broad market, although energy shares benefited from a rise in US crude for June delivery to $119.93 a barrel. Weighing heavily on the financial sector was a report from Morgan Stanley cutting its profit forecasts on several US banks, including Bank of America Corp, whose stock declined nearly 1 percent. In addition, Morgan Stanley said it expected more dividend cuts in the sector and said that Well Fargo and Wachovia were among institutions that will need to raise more capital to shore up their balance sheets. Investor Warren Buffett added to the gloom after he told CNBC television that the US could be mired in a longer and deeper recession than most people think. "There's some risk that if this is a prolonged recession, it might be too early to say that we're going to have a sustainable advance in the stock market," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 12.22 points, or 0.09 percent, to 12,904.08. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched up 2.84 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,400.68. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 6.06 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,428.99. But a proposed $23 billion acquisition of Wm Wrigley Jr Co and a billionaire's bid to increase a stake in Ford Motor Co. showed investors were still willing to put money in areas that held promise. Shares of Wrigley, the world's largest chewing gum maker, jumped 23.3 percent to $76.98 on the NYSE after it agreed to be bought by Mars Inc, maker of M&M's candy, for $23 billion. For details, see ID:nN28443723. Mars said Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is among the parties providing the financing for the deal. Shares of Ford rose 9.9 percent to $8.23 on the NYSE after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp said it intends to make a cash tender offer for up to 20 million shares of common stock of the automaker at a price of $8.50 per share. ID:nN28463132. Shares of Bank of America, the No. 2 US bank, declined 0.9 percent, to $37.96 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wachovia shares slid 3.5 percent to $27.81. Shares of Well Fargo declined 0.6 percent to $30.41. On the Nasdaq, shares of Microsoft Corp declined 1.1 percent to $29.49 after Yahoo Inc let the deadline for it to respond to the software maker's threat to take its takeover bid for the Internet company directly to shareholders pass with no new development. Exxon Mobil Corp climbed 0.5 percent to $92.89 on higher crud
