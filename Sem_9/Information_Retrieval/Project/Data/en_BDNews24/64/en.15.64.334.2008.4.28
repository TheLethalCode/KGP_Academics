 MUMBAI, India, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council's annual conference will take place in Dubai rather than at Lord's in London, the ICC said on Monday. "The decision to move the location to the United Arab Emirates was made by the ICC board on the basis that all delegates required to attend would be permitted entry," the Dubai-based ICC said in a statement.

England's David Morgan will take over as president and Haroon Lorgat as chief executive at the six-day conference
