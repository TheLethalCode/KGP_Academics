 PARIS, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy's approval ratings hit a record low in April, pummelled by concerns over the economy and government cost cutting plans, a survey by BVA pollsters said on Monday. The poll for L'Express magazine showed 64 percent of people had a negative opinion of the president, a year after he took office, up nine points on March. BVA said this was the worst such reading since it started its regular surveys in 1981. Just 32 percent of people had a positive view of the president, down eight points on the month. BVA said Sarkozy's predecessors Jacques Chirac and Francois Mitterrand both saw their popularity levels drop to 31 percent during their presidencies, but neither man ever registered such disastrous negative ratings. "This slump in the president's ratings ... is mainly explained by a brutal fall off in backing from supporters on the right, more especially from supporters of (Sarkozy's) UMP party," said BVA analyst Jerome Sainte-Marie. "And for the first time since his election, Sarkozy is unpopular with pensioners," he added. The BVA poll was carried out last week, just before the president made a 90-minute appearance on prime time television to explain his reform programme and apologise for past mistakes. A survey released after the TV interview said 51 percent of viewers had not been convinced by his performance, suggesting he won't be getting any immediate relief from his poll blues. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WOES Sarkozy got his presidency off to a strong start when he took office last May, but his ratings have lost 25 points in just eight months, hit by voter unhappiness over his turbulent private life and general economic woes. The rot set in last autumn when he divorced his wife and launched into a romance with Italian-born pop star Carla Bruni, which was played out on the front pages of glossy magazines. Stunned by the negative reaction to his high profile dating, Sarkozy has taken a much lower profile in recent weeks, but this has failed to lift his ratings, with voters increasingly unhappy about rising prices and the sluggish economy. Inflation surged at its fastest pace in a decade in March, fuelled by rises in energy, food and clothing prices. When he took office, Sarkozy promised to improve the standard of living and be "the president of purchasing power". He later appeared to row back on that pledge, arguing the state could do nothing to help because the coffers were empty. In an effort to boost accounts and cut the deficit, he has ordered that one out of every two public sector workers should not be replaced when they retire in the coming years. This has sparked a wave of street demonstrations by school students worried over announced staffing cuts in the education system -- a protest backed by 65 percent of voters, BVA said. "There is a risk that the student movement could crystalise the general dissatisfaction in France over the coming weeks," BVA's Sainte-Marie sai
