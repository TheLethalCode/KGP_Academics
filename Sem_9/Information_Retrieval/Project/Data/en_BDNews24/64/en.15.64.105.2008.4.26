<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka's commuters reported Saturday that city buses were charging passengers extra in the wake of the CNG price hike, despite a government announcement that CNG-run buses would not be allowed to raise their fares. Two bdnews24.com correspondents travelled around the city and found a number of bus companies charging higher fares. A passenger of Trans Silva Paribahan told bdnews24.com he had to pay Tk 12 for his trip from Badda to Motijheel, Tk 2 up from the previous Tk 10. Four different bus operators in Maniknagar, on Bishwa Road, were charging more for tickets. Ticker-sellers at Maniknagar said all buses on the Postogola-Gazipur route raised fares in the wake of CNG price hike, adding that they were only carrying out the directions of the bus owners. "We have nothing to do with it. The owners fixed the new fares," said Md Nasim, who sells tickets for Tashiko Paribahan bus company. Director (administration) of Salsabil, Md Nawaz-e-Ali Chishti , told bdnews24.com: "Before the price of CNG was raised, we had to spend Tk 24 lakh per month on gas. Now it will be Tk 48 lakh." "Bank interest rates are too high, vehicle parts have become more expensivealtogether we have no option but to raise fares." On whether bus companies can legally raise their fares with the government prohibiting such a move, Chishti did not answer directly but said: "The Association of Bus Companies took the decision to raise fares. By their consent, we have raised fares by 15 to 20 percent." ABC president, and owner of Winner Paribahan, Rafiqul Islam Kajol said: "The association has not said to anyone to raise fares. We are looking toward a government decision in this regard." Tashiko Paribahan and Blue Bird Transport have raised their Tk 7 tickets to Tk 8, Tk 8 to Tk 10, Tk 10 to Tk 12, Tk 12 to Tk 16, Tk 16 to Tk 20, and its Tk 18 tickets to Tk 22. Salsabil Paribahan has raised its lower fares at a similar rate, and on longer distance routes has raised its Tk 20 ticket to Tk Tk 25, Tk 24 to 28, and its Tk 32 ticket to Tk 38. Anabil Paribahan is another company that has hiked its fares along similar lines. The new fares have been written by hand on the existing tickets, or marked by rubber stamp. But fares were not raised on all routes Saturday, but ticketsellers said they would raise fares on Sunday. The government announced raised fares for CNG-run auto-rickshaws and taxicabs Saturday, but prohibited CNG-run buses from hiking their fares, two days after it doubled the price of compressed natural gas from Tk 8.50 to Tk 16.75. bdnew
