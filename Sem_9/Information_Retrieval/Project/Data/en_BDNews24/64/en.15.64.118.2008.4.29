<TITLE> U.S. reports big battle with Shi'ite militants </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mon Apr 28, BAGHDAD (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - U.S. forces fought their biggest battle in a month against dozens of Shi'ite militants attacking a Baghdad checkpoint under cover of dust storms and killed 45 in 24 hours of clashes, officials said on Monday. The fighting in and around the crowded Sadr City slum in the Iraqi capital showed some militants have apparently defied an order by anti-U.S. Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr to observe a truce, raising questions about how much he controls followers. U.S. and Iraqi troops have been locked in a month of fighting with militants since Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki launched a crackdown. They have taken over about a quarter of Sadr City where Sadr's Mehdi Army fighters held sway. The checkpoint attack on Sunday night was accompanied by rockets fired at the so-called Green Zone government and diplomatic compound in Baghdad. U.S. troops firing the heavy guns of M1 tanks killed 22 of the fighters who attacked the checkpoint, the U.S. military said. Other fighters fled. Asked if it was the biggest battle since the clashes first began in March, a U.S. military spokesman, Mark Cheadle, said: "Certainly." Officials at Sadr City's two hospitals said they had received eight bodies and treated 72 wounded. Maliki, himself a Shi'ite, says the crackdown is designed to restore the rule of law, but many of Sadr's followers see it as an effort to sideline Maliki's rivals from power. MAIN WEAPON Dust storms have grounded U.S. Apache attack helicopters, the main weapon used by U.S. forces to hunt militants firing rockets. "We are aware of the rise in attacks and how they correspond to bad weather," said Cheadle. "The end is inevitable. They are going to lose. We don't understand why they keep fighting, why they keep putting the people they are supposed to be protecting in danger." The militant attacks in Baghdad were launched despite Sadr's latest call for calm. The cleric had praised his followers on Friday for refraining from attacks. Maliki launched the crackdown on Sadr's followers in the southern city of Basra last month, triggering fighting which spread through the south and Baghdad. After initial setbacks, the Basra offensive seems to have been successful, driving militiamen from the streets. "These are well-trained people and they know when to choose the time because it makes detection difficult," said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih, referring to the attack on the checkpoint in the dust storms. "This is a reminder of why this situation cannot be allowed to continue," he told Reuters in an interview. "Militias have infiltrated the state, the society. This cannot end without disarming these militias and dismantling them (or) ... society will know no peace." But Salih said a full-scale military confrontation would put too many civilian lives at risk to be feasible. Sadr has not appeared in public in a year and the U.S. military says he is living in Iran, where he is believed to be taking advanced Islamic studies. Sadr launched two uprisings against U.S. forces in 2004. His movement then entered politics and backed Maliki's rise to power in 2006. But Sadr split with Maliki a year ago when the prime minister refused to set a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.
