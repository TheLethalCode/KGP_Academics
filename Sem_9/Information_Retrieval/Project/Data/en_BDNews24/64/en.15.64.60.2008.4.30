 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina was produced in court, on the Sangsad Bhaban premises Wednesday morning, for proceedings in a case involving 'illegal contracts' for setting up three barge-mounted power plants during her term as prime minister. Sheikh Hasina was taken to the special judge's court at 9.40am for the hearing, in which defense counsel resumed a plea to the court to withdraw all charges against the former prime minister in the case that was brought under emergency powers rules. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon police on Sept 2, 2007, naming eight people, including Hasina. The antigraft body accused the former prime minister and the others of being involved in the exchange of Tk 3 crore in bribes from Wartsila Power Development Limited Consortium's local representative, and Summit Group and United Group representatives, for awarding the contracts to set up three power plants in Khulna, Shikalbaha and Haripur. Other accused in the case are former power secretary Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former chairman of the Power Development Board Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad, and curator of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Of the accused, Hasina and Toufiq-e-Elahi are currently behind bars. bdnews
