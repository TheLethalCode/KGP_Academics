 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com) - The government will sit in formal dialogue with political parties starting in the first or second week of May, a spokesman said Sunday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will lead government representatives to the dialogue, the CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim said in a press briefing, after a cabinet meeting in the CA's office. Agenda for formal talks will be laid out after advisers submit a report to the CA on April 30 on the outcome of pre-dialogue talks. Earlier in the day, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said that the advisers would submit the report to the chief adviser on April 30. "The pre-dialogue talks will be rounded off on April 29 and the recommendations of the political parties will be presented before the chief adviser," he added. Asked when the government will hold talks with the pro-Delwar BNP leaders, Rahman said: "We'll complete the talks by April 29." Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman decided that a report on a synthesis of the issues that emerged during the pre-dialogue talks would be prepared. In the backdrop of the political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, the pre-dialogue talks were initiated in early April, spearheaded on behalf of the government by Hassan Ariff, Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Hossain Zillur Rahman. The government's informal dialogue with political parties began on April 7 through a meeting with Awami League leaders at the Rail Bhaban. Ghulam Quader, Hassan Ariff, Iftekhar Ahmed, Anwarul Iqbal and Zillur Rahman represented the government. The advisers later met a faction of BNP, Jatiya Party and other political parties. bdnews24.com/
