 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)  The police have filed a case under emergency powers rules against some 50 Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leaders and former women lawmakers of BNP's pro-Delwar faction for staging a rally in front of the Election Commission, a police official said Saturday. Sub-inspector of Tejgaon Police Station Deepok Kumar Paul filed the case Friday night. Assistant police inspector Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday: "The case has been filed against a number of leaders and lawmakers of one faction of the BNP, for breaching security by holding a rally in front of the EC on Apr 17." Of the accused, 14 are identified, while around another 40 people remain unnamed in the case details. The 14 accused are former MPs Shirin Sultana, Rehana Akhter Ranu, Saimum Begum and Bilkis Jahan Shirin, Khaleda Zia's assistant press secretary Mohiuddin Khan Mohan, JCD leaders Amiruzzaman Shimul, Nurul Islam Nayan, Rafiqul Alam Monju, Zakir Hossain Milan, Abdul Quader, Saiful Islam Firoz, Yasin Ali, Habibul Rashid and 'Robin'. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda invited both BNP's reformist faction leader and acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed and BNP's Khaleda-nominated secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain to the EC Secretariat last week. Hafizuddin accepted the invitation and led a delegation to meet with Huda and election commissioners on the morning of Apr 17. Pro-Delwar faction supporters chanted slogans in front of the EC office as the Hafizuddin-led group left the secretariat building. A 15-member delegation of BNP's opposing (Delwar) faction, led by standing committee member Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, met with the EC later the same day. Delwar himself did not attend the meeting. Acting BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed denounced the case, telling bdnews24.com: "The "false" case has been filed in a planned way. This is conspiracy." "I have said earlier and am saying again these false and fabricated charges have been filed one after another in a bid to split the BNP." Rizvi demanded the case be withdrawn immediately. bdnews24
