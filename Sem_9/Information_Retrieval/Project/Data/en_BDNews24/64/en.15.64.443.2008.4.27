 Dhaka, Apr 26 (bdnews24.com)Special Branch police filed a case Saturday against passengers, airline staff and recruiting agents, in connection with the arrest of 45 Bangladeshis at Zia International Airport for holding 'fake passports', a police official said. Airport police sub-inspector Tariqul Islam told bdnews24.com Saturday that SB and immigration officers had arrested 45 passengers of a GMG Airlines flight from Malaysia on their arrival at the airport the previous day (Friday). "The passengers, all Bangladeshis, were arrested with false passports," Islam said. "A case was filed with airport police against 92 people in all, including the 45 passengers who were accused of travelling with fake passports." "The other 52 people named in the case are officials of GMG Airlines, accused of carrying passengers with fake passports, and officials of recruiting agencies, accused with sending Bangladeshis abroad with fake passports," the sub-inspector said. GMG Airlines public relations officer Nurul Islam told bdnews24.com that the airline had not been officially informed of the case. He also pointed out: "Malaysian immigration and airport officials are the ones who check all travel documents before issuing boarding passes." "Our airline staff will check the boarding pass before allowing passengers on the plane. But it is not our responsibility to check passports when passengers board," Islam said. bdn
