 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)The local government ministry has finalised the drafts of twin ordinances, which provide for two vice chairmen for Upazila and Zila Parishads, an adviser said Sunday. "Two posts of vice chairman will be created for each of 482 Upazila Parishads and 61 Zila Parishads," LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters after a meeting to finalise the drafts Sunday. The proposed drafts made it mandatory that one of the two vice chairmen will be a woman, he said. One of the proposed ordinances provides for the election of the Zila Parishad chairman by direct vote, the adviser said. On women members of the Union Parishad, Iqbal said: "Responsibilities, activities and benefits of the Union Parishad women members will be regulated by rules." Asked whether Upazila elections would be held before the national election, the adviser said: "The Election Commission will look into the matter. Local government elections are routine work." In line with law, local government elections should be held within 180 days from the expiry of the tenure of a local government body. But the past governments had dithered over the elections by seeking up to 12 time extensions from the High Court despite the expiry of the Upazila elections tenure. On the matter, he said: "As per the 2001 Upazila election law, the jurisdiction of announcing a date for Upazila elections was with the government." The caretaker government has amended the law and handed the powers of announcing a date for Upazila elections to the Election Commission. A third ordinance on Union Parishad has also been finalised. The three ordinances will soon be sent to the council of advisers for approval. The cabinet on Thursday approved the Local Government (City Corporation) Ordinance 2008 and Local Government (Municipalities) Ordinance 2008 that prescribe a series of provisions, including a ban on convicted war criminals from taking part in the local government polls. The ordinancessimilar in naturealso enable the authorities to appoint an administrator to a local government body if there is no election in 180 days from the expiry of its term. The same day, the interim cabinet passed the Local Government Commission Ordinance 2008. bdnews24.c
