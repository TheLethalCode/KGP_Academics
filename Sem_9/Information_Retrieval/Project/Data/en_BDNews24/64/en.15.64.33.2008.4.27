 Beijing, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-dumping and other trade disputes with Chinese exporters could grow as global economic gloom stokes protectionism, a government official warned, urging local companies to do more to defend their legal rights. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce official in charge of fair trade, Li Ling, told a meeting in Beijing that slowing international trade growth could make the country's strong exports a bigger target for complaints. "This year global economic growth has slowed, and in some countries trade protectionism may lift its head," she said, according to a report on the Caijing business magazine Web site (www.caijing.com.cn) on Sunday. "China's exports may remain vigorous, and this may lead other countries to take anti-subsidy, anti-dumping and protective measures against China." Speaking on Saturday, Li singled out trade restrictions from the United States and the European Union as her biggest worry, with the most troubled sectors including steel, textiles, machinery and ship building. Last year, China was the target of 81 such trade measures. In the first three months of this year, the country had already been targeted by 17 anti-dumping and anti-subsidies cases, she said. Chinese exporters should join more in government efforts to challenge such protectionist steps, especially in fighting U.S. anti-subsidy cases that claim the government gives unfair tax and other economic support, Li said. With a quota deal on Chinese garment exports to the United States due to end next year, that sector too "may encounter new situations and trade friction may grow", Li said. This week, European Union officials met Chinese counterparts in Beijing in a bid to ease tensions of the big EU trade deficit. China's overall trade surplus rebounded in March from a month earlier as exports held up despite deepening gloom over the U.S. economy. The surplus rose to $13.4 billion from $8.56 billion in February, the customs administration said earlier this month. The surplus for the first quarter shrank, however, to $41.4 billion from $46.5 billion in the first three months of 2007.
