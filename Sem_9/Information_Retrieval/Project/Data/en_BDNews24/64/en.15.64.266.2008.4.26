<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 26 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited Saturday emerged unbeaten champions in the Club Cup Hockey with a tense 4-3 win over Sonali Bank SRC in the final at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. It was the second Club Cup title for the Dhanmondi-based outfit since the tournament was introduced in 1998 while Sonali Bank played the final for the first time in a major tournament like Club Cup Hockey. "It is always a pleasure to clinch a title, and all credit goes to the boys, who worked hard despite inadequate preparation," said Abahani captain Mahbub Ehsan Rana. "We should have scored at least six goals, but we did not do it due to failure of the strikers," said Rana, whose team took a comfortable 3-0 lead in the first half. Sonali Bank captain Ashiquzzaman expressed satisfaction with the result, and praised the performance of his young side. "The boys could not deal with Abahani's attack from the beginning due to lack of maturity and match temperament, but we bounced back in the second half taking an advantage of the opponent's defence failure," said the former national player, Ashiquzzaman. "We also got results scoring three goals," said the medio. Abahani captain Rana also admitted that their defence got stuck in the second half due to lack of fitness, and the opponents scored three goals easily. Rasel Mahmud Jimy put Abahani ahead in the very first minute capitalising on a left-side throw from his captain Rana while Mamunur Rahman Chayan doubled the margin in the eighth minute from a penalty corner with a superb combination of Musa Mia and Mosharraf Hossain Kuti. Mazharul Islam Mokshed being set up by Musa from the right flank dodged Sonali Bank goalkeeper M Jahangir past to make the margin 3-0 in the 18th minute to go for a lemon break. After the breather, Sonali Bank reorganised to rip through the Abahani defence marshalled by Chayan, Shaidullah Khokon, Faruque Ahmed and Hedayetul Islam Razib. Rimon Kumar capitalising on a right-side throw from substitute Sheikh M Nannu danced past Abahani goalkeeper Jahid Hossain to pull one goal back in the 49th minute before young striker Iqbal Nader Prince sent the ball over Jahid's head to reduce the margin to 3-2 in the 53rd minute. Chayan gave Abahani a breath converting a penalty corner with the same combination of Musa and Kuti before Sonali Bank's Asaduzzaman Chandan reduced the margin to 4-3 five minutes from time. The special assistant to the Chief Adviser, Mahbub Jamil, distributed prizes among the players while Bangladesh Hockey Federation president and air chief Air Marshal SM Ziaur Rahman was present.
