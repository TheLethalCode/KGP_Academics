<TITLE> Charges dropped against Aussie comedians` APEC stunt </TITLE>

 Sydney, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian comedy team arrested during the 2007 APEC summit in Sydney, after faking an official motorcade to reach the hotel of US President George W. Bush, had criminal charges against them dropped on Monday. The "Chaser's War On Everything" team made international headlines when their three-car convoy, using bogus APEC IDs and carrying Australian and Canadian flags, passed through several security checkpoints to reach the president's hotel and one of the team stepped out of the car dressed as Osama bin Laden. The New South Wales state prosecutor dropped the charges against the comedians, saying their action was defensible as a reasonable and honest mistake, as they did not believe they would be allowed through the security checks, and that there was no reasonable prospect of conviction. "I think we've been arrested so many times now that I've kind of started to become numb, but it's better to not have six months' jail hovering over your head," comedian Charles Licciardello told local media. The members of the group have previously been arrested for satire stunts. Television director for the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corp. (ABC), which screens the comedy show, said the decision validated the stunt as political satire. "What was undeniably the greatest moment in political satire last year, which the ABC has always been very proud of, has been found to be just that -- great political satire," said Kim Dalton.
