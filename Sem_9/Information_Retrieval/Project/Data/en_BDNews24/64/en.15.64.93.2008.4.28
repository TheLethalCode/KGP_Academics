<TITLE> BRTA launches drive against rogue CNG buses </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Road Transport Authority Monday fined 93 CNG buses in the capital for raising ticket prices despite a government ban. BRTA filed cases with mobile courts against the companies of the buses in Jatrabari, Gabtali, Mohakhali and Shyampur areas for charging passengers extra in the wake of a CNG price hike. The mobile courts also seized four buses and arrested two persons on charges of hiking fares. City buses took more-than-permitted fares from passengers from Saturday, a day after the government doubled the prices of compressed natural gas from Tk 8.50 to Tk 16.75 per cubic metre in an attempt to cut the burden of energy subsidy. The government fixed new fares for CNG autorickshaws and taxicabs but kept the rates unchanged for buses and trucks. bdnews24.com/mar/
