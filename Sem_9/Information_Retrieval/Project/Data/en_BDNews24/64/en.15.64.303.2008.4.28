<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, India, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's cricket board has ordered an independent investigation into allegations Harbhajan Singh slapped compatriot Shanthakumaran Sreesanth during a Twenty20 league game. The controversial off-spinner was suspended and faces a disciplinary hearing by league organisers later on Monday. The board said in a statement it had appointed advocate Sudhir Nanavati as commissioner to make a preliminary inquiry and to call for an explanation from those involved. Nanavati has been asked to submit his report within 15 days to the board president in order to determine whether disciplinary action against Harbhajan might be appropriate. The president will then refer the report to the disciplinary committee. The board on Sunday said it had felt "let down" by Harbhajan after having stood up for him in an ugly row in Australia this year. Harbhajan was initially banned for three tests after being found guilty of making racist remarks against all-rounder Andrew Symonds, but was subsequently let off with a fine on a lesser charge following an appeal. Harbhajan is one of his country's most successful spin bowlers, but his disciplinary record has been poor. He was even ejected from the board's National Cricket Academy early in his career
