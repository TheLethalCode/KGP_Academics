 MONTE CARLO, April 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer set up a third straight final showdown with Rafael Nadal at the Monte Carlo Masters after Serbian Novak Djokovic retired ill from their semi-final match on Saturday. The Swiss top seed was leading 6-3 3-2 when Australian Open champion Djokovic, seeded third, pulled out after complaining of dizziness and a sore throat. "From the start I didn't feel so great. But obviously, at the start of the match you feel, you know, fresh still somehow. But then after a while, after five, six games, after long points, I started to feel more and more worse," Djokovic told reporters. "I was thinking about, you know, stopping even after the first set. But I just wanted to try and see how it goes." Three-times champion Nadal reached the final with a 6-3 6-2 win over Russian fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko. The muscular Spaniard will face a rejuvenated Federer, who regained his best form on Friday by beating Argentine nemesis David Nalbandian 5-7 6-2 6-2. In the first set against Djokovic, the Swiss, who suffered from mononucleosis earlier this year, was back to his brilliant self. He saved three break points in the fifth game before stealing Djokovic's serve on his first attempt to open a decisive 5-3 lead. Djokovic seemed in a position to bother the 12-times grand slam winner in the second set, only for him to leave the court following a quick chat with Federer. UNIMPRESSIVE NADAL Nadal, who will be gunning for a fourth consecutive French Open title next month, was unimpressive but still too good for an exhausted Davydenko. The Russian, ranked third in the ATP Race after winning the Miami Masters against Nadal, needed two hours 44 minutes to overcome compatriot Igor Andreev in the quarter-finals on Friday and had already played 33 matches this season. He said he could not have done better: "I tried to play my best. But if I hit balls, for Nadal it's normal. He just runs and makes topspin back and gets running again." Nadal has not lost a set in Monte Carlo since the 2006 final against Federer, whom he beat at the same stage last year. He has now won his last 21 matches in the principality and was last beaten here in 2003 by Argentine Guillermo Coria in the third round. "I think I am more adapted to clay at every match. I feel I play more clay style every day," said Nadal. Two double faults by Davydenko earned the Majorcan a break in the third game. Nadal clinched the first set on his first opportunity when his opponent sent a forehand wide. Following an early exchange of breaks, Davydenko dropped serve again in the sixth game and Nadal held his in the seventh after shrugging off three break points. He sealed the win on his second match point when Davydenko sent a forehand long
