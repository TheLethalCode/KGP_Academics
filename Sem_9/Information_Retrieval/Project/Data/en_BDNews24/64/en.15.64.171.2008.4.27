 Dhaka, April 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has shifted its symbolic hunger strike to May 5 from April 29 to demand the immediate release of party chief Sheikh Hasina, said a party leader Sunday. The AL at a presidium meeting decided to limit the programme to Dhaka and suspended the programme for the rest of the country, acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting. In an April 23 decision, the party had announced the hunger strike for the country to be held on April 29. Ashraful said the decision of rescheduling the hunger strike had been taken in line with a request of lawyers as the Supreme Court Bar Association goes to the polls Monday. The programme outside Dhaka has been suspended as indoor politics is still banned in rest of the country. The presidium meeting was held at the party's acting chief Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. Ashraful said the presidium meeting had demanded an end to the state of emergency, allowing indoor politics across the country and election schedule soon. Asked if there was any decision on the national elections, Ashraful said: "There is plenty of time to think about it." He said the AL had decided to take part in the national polls under the leadership of Hasina. The former prime minister is behind bars on corruption charges. bdnews
