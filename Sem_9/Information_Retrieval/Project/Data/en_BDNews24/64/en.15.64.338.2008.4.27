 Ho Chi Minh City, April 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vietnamese security forces alone will guard the protest-ridden Olympics torch in Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Sunday, as political activists called for demonstrations over an island dispute with China. Chinese security has been involved in protecting the torch in several countries on its journey before the Beijing 2008 Olympics in August, but not for the April 29 leg in the city many still call Saigon. The relay has prompted protests against China's human rights record in Tibet and rallies by Chinese who criticise the West for vilifying Beijing. Communist neighbours China and Vietnam have friendly diplomatic and trade ties and Hanoi says it supports China's handling of riots in Tibet.. "It is only the Vietnamese forces who are going to ensure the safety and security of the participants and we have deployed the necessary forces to reach that goal," Nguyen Hoang Nang, co-vice chair of the Ho Chi Minh City organising committee said at a news conference to announce details of the event. Overseas groups opposed to Communist Party rule in Vietnam have called for protests at the torch relay over the Spratly islands and Paracel islands, saying Hanoi has not protected Vietnamese sovereignty from its large neighbour. For its part, the government frequently makes public statements on its claim to the islands, rocky outcrops that may be rich in oil and gas. China, Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines all make claims to the Spratlys. On Thursday night, Vietnam expelled a U.S. citizen of Vietnamese origin on accusations of planning "to try to snatch the torch" or protest outside the Chinese consulate, scene of rare nationalistic demonstrations last December over the islands. The Vietnamese official told reporters on Sunday that the torch would arrive on Monday night and be secured until Tuesday evening. Nearly four hours of events were planned from the city centre, including a run by 60 torch bearers along a 10 km (six miles) to 13 km (eight miles) route through the streets to a military stadium. The torch is in South Korea on Sunday and will go to North Korea before Vietnam. "We are well aware of the eventful route of the Olympic Torch Relay in different countries," Nang said. "I believe in our love for the sporting spirit, our respect for sports as well as peace and we have mobilised and called on our people to support the torch relay in our city." Some streets of the city are festooned with red banners bearing the yellow star and hammer and sickle as it also prepares to mark the April 30 communist takeover of the capital of U.S.-backed South Vietnam 33 years ago and May Day.
