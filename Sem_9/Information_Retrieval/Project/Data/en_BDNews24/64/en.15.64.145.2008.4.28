 Dhaka, April 28 (bdnews24.com)  The officials of the Bangladesh Cricket Board said Monday they were dissatisfied with the explanations given by national cricketers of their washout in the Pakistan tour. The board summoned the team earlier in the day to the BCB corporate office in Gulshan. "It was not possible for us to agree with some of the excuses they made," said Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, the chairman of the BCB cricket operation committee. "We saw every one of the matches on television and found some of the mistakes were committed repeatedly. There should not be any excuses for those kinds of mistakes,' said Lipu, a former national captain, after emerging from the meeting. A three-member committee, comprising Lipu, Shafiqur Rahman Munna and Ahmed Sazzadul Alam, held a separate meeting with captain Mohammad Ashraful, vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and manager Shafiqul Haque Heera. The BCB officials also quizzed the cricketers splitting them into separate groups. Coach Jamie Siddons was not available to attend the meeting, as he is on vacation in Australia, but the BCB would speak to him after his return. On the team's return, following a whitewash in the five-ODI series, Ashraful said he was satisfied with their performance in Pakistan, but he backtracked in the meeting with the board officials. "We are not in a position to feel satisfied after having scored a mere 200 runs in some games, as we have left those days behind us and should be moving forward," Lipu told the reporters after the meeting. The BCB officials said no decision on cutting the financial benefits of the players has yet been taken, but they felt that there should be a provision to penalise the players for their poor performance in future. "They have raised some issues and we will try to solve them. But, we will not allow the players to make the same excuses every time after each failed series,' said Lipu. Ashraful refused to disclose the issues raised in the meeting, but admitted inexperience was one of the main reasons for performing badly in the series. bd
