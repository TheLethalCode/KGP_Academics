 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks edged up Sunday, paced by a buying rush for mutual funds of Investment Corporation of Bangladesh after its declaration of net asset value. Turnover on the country's twin bourses witnessed a fall from the previous day while the trading volume recorded a slight increase. Investors traded in market majors throughout the day rather than going for a specific sector, according to brokerage house officials. "Oil companies, major issues in banks and cement that went up Thursday witnessed profit-taking, while pharmaceuticals issues ended mixed," an official with brokerage house IDLC Securities told bdnews24.com. Mutual funds issued by ICB enjoyed heavy buying following NAV declarations, the official added. Market watchers termed the day's trading as flat, saying that the prices of ICB mutual funds drove the indices slightly up.

Heavy buying into ICB mutual funds pushed up the indices a bit," Ahmad Rashid, vice president of Dhaka Stock Exchange, told bdnews24.com.
