 Dhaka, Apr 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission began electoral reforms dialogue with the BNP reformist faction Sunday, thus wrapping up its dialogue sessions with all major political parties. The long awaited dialogue taking place five months past its original schedule began at 10:10 am. Security was beefed up in and around the EC Secretariat as one faction was only invited for the dialogue. BNP standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman was leading the 15-member delegation. Others include acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, vice president Chowdhury Kamal Ibne Yusuf, adviser to the chairperson AHM Mofazzal Karim, ZA Khan, MA Hakim, former education minister Dr Osman Faruk, former lawmaker Abdul Alim, Shah Md Abul Hossain, Nazir Hossain, Abdul Khalek Chontu, Nasirul Haque Sabu, Dr Ziaul Haque Mollah and Tasmim Rana. The EC was represented by chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and Sakhawat Hussain and commission secretary Mohammad Humayun Kabir. Acting BNP secretary general Hafizuddin, nominated by the standing committee told bdnews24.com: "Holding a free, fair and acceptable election will be our main agenda of discussion with the EC. We'll recommend holding an election free of black money and terrorism." The EC was scheduled to hold dialogue with the BNP on Nov 22 last year and had then invited the secretary general of the reformist faction to dialogue on Nov 5. But the dialogue stalled as BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia filed a writ petition challenging the invitation on Nov 18. On Apr 22, the EC invited Hafizuddin again following the High Court verdict that went in favour of the reformist faction, quashing Khaleda's writ petition. The commission started its first round of dialogues with 15 major political parties on Sept 12 last year and second round on Feb 24. bdnews24.
