<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India spinner Harbhajan Singh has been banned for the remainder of a domestic Twenty20 league after he was found guilty on Monday of slapping compatriot Shanthakumaran Sreesanth. Indian Premier League (IPL) commissioner Lalit Modi told a news conference that the cricketer would be fined all of his match fees from the tournament. The incident happened on Friday, minutes after the Mumbai team captained by Harbhajan lost to Mohali. Television cameras showed opposition paceman Sreesanth sobbing. "As a penalty for the level 4.2 offence committed by Mr Harbhajan Singh, we hereby order that Mr Harbhajan Singh be banned for the rest of the remaining matches of the first IPL event," Modi announced after the committee viewed the footage of the incident and interviewed the parties. "We also order that Mr Harbhajan Singh be fined 100 per cent of any player fee that may have been paid or may hereafter be paid to him in respect of the remaining matches only. That does not take into account any of the two earlier matches (prior to Friday) that he may have played," Modi added. APOLOGETIC HARBHAJAN Harbhajan and Sreesanth were presented at the news conference and hugged each other and posed for the cameras. "I have made a big mistake and have got the punishment," Harbhajan said. "The (Indian) board has always supported me and I hope they will continue to do it. "I want to return from the ban in a happy frame of mind." Match referee and former India player Farokh Engineer added that Sreesanth, 25, has also been warned to be on good behaviour. Under the ICC code of conduct rules, a 4.2 offence refers to a physical assault and carries a minimum ban of 10 games and a maximum life ban from play. Modi said TV footage not aired live showed Harbhajan slap Sreesanth when both teams queued up to shake hands. Mumbai team manager Lalchand Rajput was found guilty of conduct contravening the spirit of the game and fined 50 per cent of his match fee. Rajput, the former India assistant coach, was found guilty for not trying to restrain Harbhajan despite being right behind him when the incident happened, Modi said. Harbhajan can appeal against the decision, though that appeared unlikely following his comments. The Indian board also ordered an independent investigation into the slapping incident. In January, the spinner escaped with a fine after appealing against a three-test ban by the International Cricket Council match referee for alleged racial comments against Australia all-rounder Andrew Symonds during India's test tour
