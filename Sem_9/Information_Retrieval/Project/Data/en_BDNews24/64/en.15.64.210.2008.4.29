 LONDON, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British mortgage approvals for house purchases fell in March to their lowest level since comparable records began, suggesting a housing market downturn is gathering pace. Figures from the Bank of England on Tuesday showed mortgage approvals -- a leading indicator of housing demand -- dropped to 64,000 last month from a downwardly revised 72,000 in February.
