 Sydney, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government of the tiny South Pacific nation of Nauru has been returned to office, ending a parliamentary deadlock over the impoverished nation's economic future. President Marcus Stephen's government won a snap election on April 26 and is expected to rule with a majority of at least 10, possibly 12, members in the 18-seat parliament, Justice Minister Mathew Batsiua said in a statement received on Monday. Stephen declared a state of emergency 10 days ago and dissolved parliament. Parliament had been deadlocked for months with the 18 lawmakers evenly divided and arguing about the economic future of the nation of 9,000, which has a total area of just 21 square kilometres. "This more than vindicates the stand we have taken," said Batsiua about the election win. "Now lets us get on with the job of governing for the people of Nauru, who have sent a clear message to the entire parliament that they want political stability." The new parliament will sit on Tuesday, when the final makeup of the house will be determined, he said. The parliamentary deadlock had prevented the passage of budget legislation. Nauru's citizens were once among the world's wealthiest thanks to abundant reserves of phosphate used in fertilizers. But its wealth has declined following poor investment decisions and its citizens now rely on foreign aid, fishing and horticulture. Incomes from royalties and investments had all but disappeared by 2003 and remain low, with total debt worth $939 million. Successive Nauru governments have concentrated on restoring the country's tarnished international financial reputation, ensuring it was removed from the OECD blacklist of money laundering and tax haven countries in October 2005. The country posted its third successive balanced budget in 2006-07.
