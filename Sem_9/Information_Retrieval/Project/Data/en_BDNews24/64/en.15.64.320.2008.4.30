<TITLE> Fiorentina bid to be bold against Rangers </TITLE>

 ROME, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Midfielder Marco Donadel said Fiorentina will need courage and determination to overcome Rangers in Thursday's UEFA Cup semi-final, second leg. Donadel echoed coach Cesare Prandelli's view that Rangers took a negative approach in last week's 0-0 draw at Ibrox and he called for a repeat of their 2-0 win at PSV Eindhoven which put Fiorentina into the last four. "We have to take the field with the mentality we had at Eindhoven," Donadel, who returns from suspension, told a news conference on Tuesday. "We have to give everything immediately and make Rangers understand that it will be hard for them. "The first leg showed they wanted to avoid conceding a goal, while we were trying to score; 0-0 was the result they were looking for. "We'll be a bit more bold and determined. It is not easy to speed things up against a tight team, so we'll press deep and play as we know how to." Centre back David Weir has added to Rangers' injury troubles. Manager Walter Smith told reporters that the 37-year-old is unavailable after he suffered a groin strain in title-chasing Rangers' 3-2 league defeat by Celtic on Sunday. Midfielders Steven Naismith, Chris Burke, Charlie Adam and Lee McCulloch look set to miss out again with fitness problems, while keeper Allan McGregor is a doubt with an ankle injury. However, captain Barry Ferguson and fellow midfielder Kevin Thomson are available for the game in Florence after serving one-match bans. The Scottish side missed Ferguson's influence in the first leg, when they were solid in defence but showed little adventure going forward. The visitors can take heart from defensive lapses Fiorentina showed in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Sampdoria, which leaves them just two points above AC Milan in fourth place, worth a slot in the Champions League qualifiers. Rangers will again need to keep close tabs on Romania striker Adrian Mutu, who scored his 17th Serie A goal of the season on Sunday and netted both goals at Eindhoven. Fiorentina beat Rangers 4-1 on aggregate over two legs to win the 1961 Cup Winners' Cup final and claim their only European trophy to date. Probable teams: Rangers: 13-Neil Alexander; 21-Kirk Broadfoot, 30-Christian Dailly, 24-Carlos Cuellar, 5-Sasa Papac; 7-Brahim Hemdani, 6-Barry Ferguson, 8-Kevin Thomson, 35-Steven Davis, 28-Steven Whittaker; 19-Jean-Claude Darcheville. Fiorentina: 1-Sebastien Frey; 20-Martin Jorgensen, 21-Tomas Ujfalusi, 5-Alessandro Gamberini, 19-Massimo Gobbi; 4-Marco Donadel, 11-Fabio Liverani, 18-Riccardo Montolivo; 24-Mario Alberto Santana, 29-Giampaolo Pazzini, 10-Adrian Mutu. Referee: Frank De Bleeckere (Belgium
