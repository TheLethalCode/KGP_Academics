 MADRID, April 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Betis had an initial two-match stadium ban for a bottle-throwing incident reduced to one game by Spain's Sporting Discipline Committee (CEDD) on Monday after an appeal. Betis received the punishment after Athletic Bilbao goalkeeper Armando was cut on the face when a fan threw a bottle of water at him during a league match at their Manuel Ruiz de Lopera stadium in March. "According to the resolution, the action of people in helping to detain the person who committed the illegal act was taken into consideration," the Primera Liga club said in a statement on their Web site (www.realbetisbalompie.es). Fans behind the goal helped identify the aggressor to stadium security after the incident and he was later arrested by the police. A 40-year-old Betis fan was charged with a public disorder offence and causing injury before being released on bail. Armando needed stitches just below his eye. The game was abandoned with Bilbao leading 2-1 and the Spanish Football Federation subsequently decided that the result should stand and that Betis be banned from their stadium for two matches
