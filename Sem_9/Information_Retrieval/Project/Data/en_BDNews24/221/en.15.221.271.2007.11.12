 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Customs officials and members of a taskforce Monday arrested two persons and seized a large quantity of heroin from them at Zia International Airport. The Department of Narcotics Control estimates that the heroin, seized from one Ariful and Mahmud Azad, would have retailed for Tk 23.5 crore. "The preliminary investigation confirmed the seized packets contained heroin. We tested the substance with a kit brought in from the USA," said Fazlur Rahman, assistant director of the DNC's Dhaka Metro Region. Sixteen packets of heroin were seized, each weighing one and a half kilograms. Samples of the powder were sent for test at the laboratory of Narcotics Control Department in Gandaria, Rahman said "If necessary, samples will be sent to the Regional Intelligence Liaison Office in Japan for further testing," he added. The seizure ranks as one of the largest hauls alongside a case in 1999 when DNC officials arrested two Pakistani nationals with 24kg of heroin in a hotel in Dhaka. Additional commissioner of Customs Humayun Kabir said the drugs were discovered in four separate bags. Inside, polythene packets wrapped in carbon paper and Scotch tape were found to contain the heroin. The packets were wrapped in carbon and soaked in lemon juice to ensure the scanning machine could not detect them, Kabir said. Security-man Abdul Quader's suspicions were aroused following the bag scan. He quizzed the two men and then informed his supervisor of his suspicions. Quader's supervisor called the taskforce, who later arrested the men and seized the heroin. At a press conference in the afternoon, Ariful told reporters that he came from Habiganj and was supposed to take the heroin to one Abbas in China. Abbas's brother accompanied them up to the airport, although he fled sensing danger, Ariful said. Mahmud said he came from Narayanganj and had met Ariful only four months ago in his shop in the Eastern Plus Market. He claimed they were going to China to buy cosmetics. bdnews24.c
