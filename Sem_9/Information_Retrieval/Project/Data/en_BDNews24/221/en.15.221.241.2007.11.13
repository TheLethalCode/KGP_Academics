<TITLE> Al Gore joins famed tech venture capital firm </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In a career marked by second acts, Al Gore, the former vice president of the United States and co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is becoming a partner at Silicon Valley's most storied venture capital firm. Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers said on Monday that Gore, who campaigns to slow global climate change, will join the Menlo Park, California-based venture capital firm as a partner focused on alternative energy investments. The venture firm, which since 1972 has backed seminal computer start-ups ranging from Sun Microsystems to Compaq Computer to Amazon.com and Google Inc, has emerged in recent years as a leading funder of alternative energy companies. The move deepens Gore's involvement in the private sector and makes a return to US presidential politics less likely. Advisors close to Gore say he has no intention of becoming a late contender in the crowded field for the presidential nomination for 2008. That has not stopped Democratic activists from pressing on with a grassroots "Draft Gore" campaign. Gore, 59, is joining the Kleiner board as part of a collaboration between his London-based Generation Investment Management fund and Kleiner to fund so-called "green" business, technology and policies that address global climate change. Kleiner Perkins plans to locate its European operations at Generation's offices in London. In addition, John Doerr, Silicon Valley's best-known venture capitalist and long a major backer of Gore's political and policy efforts, will join Generation's advisory board, the two organizations said. Generation was founded in 2004 by Gore and David Blood, former chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, to make investments based on sustainability principles. EXPANDING Kleiner has historically focused its own investing in and around Silicon Valley. However, it recently expanded operations in China. As the firm moves into energy investments, it has taken on a more global profile in its operations. The two firms will remain focused on separate activities, with Kleiner investing in start-ups and Generation continuing its previous focus on investing in publicly traded companies focused on alternative energy or agriculture. Gore said that as part of the agreement between the two firms, 100 percent of his salary as a partner at Kleiner Perkins will be donated directly to the Alliance for Climate Protection -- the nonpartisan foundation he chairs. As a member of the US Congress for 25 years, Gore popularized the term "information superhighway" and was instrumental in providing funds for what later became the Internet. He was defeated in a hotly contested race to become President of the United States in the 2000 election that brought George W. Bush to power. Since leaving government, Gore has advised top Silicon Valley companies. He sits on the board of computer and phone maker Apple Inc and is a senior adviser to Internet services leader Google Inc. Gore is chairman of Current TV, an Emmy Award-winning cable and satellite TV network that encourages young viewers to create video programming tied to global news events.
