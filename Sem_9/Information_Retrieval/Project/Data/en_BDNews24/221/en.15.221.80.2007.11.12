 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday said it was high time that existing laws were brought up to date. "With the passage of time, many laws have become irrelevant and outdated. The related ministry must act in this regard," Fakhruddin said at a ceremony launching "Bangladesh Code". "The main task of the judiciary of a country is to ensure justice and good governance by upholding human rights. It is difficult to achieve this goal if printed copies of existing laws are not easily available to citizens," the CA said. Fakhruddin thanked the laws, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry for its effort and thanked the Canadian government for its financial support for the project. "Restoring the rule of law becomes easier as an awareness of laws, rules and regulations among citizens increases," Fakhruddin said. "The government has taken the landmark step of separating the judiciary from the executive," he added. According to the rules of business, it is the responsibility of the law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry to compile and publish the country's laws. An initiative to publish the laws was taken for the first time in 1977, culminating in an 11 volume compilation of laws enacted between 1836 and 1938, the publishing work of which was completed by 1988. In 2002, the government published the laws again. As many as 956 laws were compiled in 38 volumes, including laws enacted between 1836 and 2007. The caretaker government chief thanked the authorities concern for their initiative to publish the code online. All existing laws have been compiled in the Bangladesh Code.
