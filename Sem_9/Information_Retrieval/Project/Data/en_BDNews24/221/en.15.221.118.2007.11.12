<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Awami league leader Suranjit Sengupta Monday alleged that law adviser Mainul Hosein was resorting to different excuses on the trial of war criminals. The AL presidium member told the reporters at his Jigatola home: "While the whole nation agrees on the trial of the war criminals, only one adviser is making excuses terming the Bangabandhu, jail and intellectual killings old mess." Asked whether the present government would try the war criminals, Mainul Sunday said: "Ask them, who have not tried them (war criminals) in the last 36 years, whether they are war criminals. Why are you asking us? You have been waiting for 36 years. Wait another two years." Suranjit in his reaction to the comments said, "He (Mainul) also cannot avert the accusation of not trying war criminals in 1972 as he was part of the government at the time. I wouldn't have any problem if other advisers had made any comment on the war criminals." "The constitution was first amended in 1973, and barrister Mainul was a member of that parliament and he supported the approval of the law." The amended constitution passed on July 15, 1973 says no law providing for detention, prosecution and punishment of any person for genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes under international law shall be deemed void. Suranjit said: "Many ignored their responsibilities in the past. It doesn't mean they would do the same in future. That's the reason all people are supporting the caretaker government." "Democracy won't be safe if the war criminals are not tried. Democracy will be safe only when freedom and constitution are safe. The war criminals will be bragging until their trial. The country's democracy, sovereignty, freedom and existence will be threatened." "Today reforms are taking place to protect democracy. But there is no alternative to their trial for the protection." Suranjit said: "I hope we have to go forward not avoiding any issue, but resolving the problem." "If the government can clamp down on corruption suspects, why not on suspected war criminals?" On the remark of the law adviser that reforms were not taking place in the political parties as much as expected, Suranjit said: "The government will conduct reforms, so will the political parties. Reform requires a sound political atmosphere." bdnews24.
