Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) are anxious the dispute over news and photographic rights could prevent worldwide coverage of spinner Muttiah Muralitharan breaking the world record for the most test wickets. "It would be a great shame for the world's media not to be able to report such an important event for millions of cricket fans," SLC secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan told Reuters. Muralitharan is six wickets short of equalling Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne's world record of 708 test match scalps. Muralitharan took two wickets during the first test defeat by Australia in Brisbane, but the second test, which starts in Hobart on Friday, is on a pitch expected to assist slow bowlers like the Sri Lankan. "We have therefore emailed Cricket Australia to express our concern, although we also appreciate that they have their own policies in which we do not wish to interfere," Mathivanan added. The world's leading news agencies - Reuters, Associated Press and Agence France-Presse - boycotted the first test after organisers placed unprecedented restrictions on photographic rights. Cricket Australia has argued that it owns the right to exploit photographs taken at its games and has asked the agencies to pay to license photos for editorial use.
