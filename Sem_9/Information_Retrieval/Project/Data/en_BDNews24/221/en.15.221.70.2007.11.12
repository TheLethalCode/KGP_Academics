 SHANGHAI, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dozens of Chinese scientists and support staff left Shanghai on Monday for the country's 24th scientific expedition to Antarctica in which they will expand two research stations and build a third. The 91-strong team and 40 crew were given a rousing farewell as the vessel "Xue Long", or Snow Dragon, left port to a rousing send-off by a military brass band, the beat of traditional dancers and the customary fireworks.

"We have made preparations to build a third station and once the site is located, construction will start soon. The whole project is expected to be completed by 2010," Xinhua news agency quoted Xu Xiaxing, a veteran of the expedition team on his eighth trip to the continent.

Some areas of the continent are disputed by Chile, Argentina and Britain. The claims come amid growing interest in the potential for mineral exploitation at both the North and South Poles. For now, though, all such claims are theoretical because Antarctica is protected by a 1959 treaty which prevents mineral exploitation of the continent except for scientific resear
