 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) - The Committee on Strengthening Local Government Institutions has recommended the introduction of a three-tier local government structure at the union, upazila and district levels and the maintenance of the existing two-tier system for urban areas. It recommended that 'Gram Sarkar' be abolished. To strengthen local government bodies, the caretaker government constituted a seven-member committee headed by former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali on July 1. Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com by telephone Monday: "Our report is almost done. We hope to formally submit the four-part report to the chief adviser Tuesday." The committee recommended that members of parliament be made ineligible for local government elections and MPs should not be able to influence the local bodies. Under the existing law, members of parliament are ex-officio advisers to district and upazila parishads. Ali said: "The committee studied comparative local government in addition to speaking to local stakeholders in drawing up the recommendations." The four-part report begins with the core report, followed by a section on districts, upazilas and villages, then a section on pourashavas, and ends with a discussion on city corporations. The report proposed a unified draft ordinance on district councils, upazila councils and union parishads. At present, district councils, upazila councils, union parishads and municipalities are run under different laws. The committee recommended one set of rules for district councils, upazila councils and union parishads and another for city corporations and municipalities. The report recommended that women account for 40 percent of local government bodies instead of the existing 30 percent. After three subsequent elections, it suggested that the reserved quota be abolished. Under the existing law, there is no expenditure limit in district, upazila and union parishad elections. Separate limits for each level of government have been suggested by the report. bdnews24.c
