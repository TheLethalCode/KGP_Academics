 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday ordered alleged Yaba trader Jannatul Ferdous Niki and her parents and brother to jail after the end of their remand. Magistrate Sultan Mahmud of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka issued the order after RAB-3 sub inspector Selim Badshah appealed to the court to send them to jail in the interest of "fair investigation". Niki, father Abdur Noor, mother Saleha Begum and brother Moinuddin were taken into a three-day remand Nov 9. On Nov 4, a RAB-3 team seized 34 Yaba tablets and over 100 packets of Yaba in a raid on their Karnaphuli City Garden flat. RAB officer Khairul Hasan filed a narcotics case against Niki with Ramna Police Station on Nov 4 and Niki was arrested the same day. The law enforcers also arrested Niki's boyfriend Mahbubur Rahman Joynal, managing director of the Hotel Purbani International. bdnew
