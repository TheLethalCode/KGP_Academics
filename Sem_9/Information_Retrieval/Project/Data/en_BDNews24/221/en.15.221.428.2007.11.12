<TITLE> Federer stunned by Gonzalez in Shanghai </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SHANGHAI, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer suffered a shock 3-6 7-6 7-5 defeat by Chile's Fernando Gonzalez in his opening match at the Tennis Masters Cup on Monday. The Swiss, chasing his fourth title at the season-ending tournament, had never previously been beaten in round-robin play at the Masters Cup. Andy Roddick survived a scare against Russia's Nikolay Davydenko in the day's earlier Red Group match in Shanghai, the American coming through 6-3 4-6 6-2. Federer, baseball cap pulled down low over his eyes, offered no excuses for his stunning loss, his first to Gonzalez in 11 meetings. "I just thought it was ridiculous the kind of shots he was coming up with," Federer told reporters. "You've got to give him credit for that." Federer appeared to be in total control after taking the opening set, but he lost his cool after Gonzalez ripped through the second-set tiebreak 7-1. The 12-times grand slam champion vented his fury at the umpire and his mood darkened further in the third set, Gonzalez saving five break points with some more inspired shot-making. "Obviously he's always going to pound my backhand with his incredible forehand," shrugged Federer. "You can't do much when he drills it in the corners. "The backhand, that's what killed me today. He's dangerous. On any given day he can beat you. It's a tough loss. I wish I had an excuse." UNBELIEVABLE POINTS Gonzalez acknowledged he had played to his limit after throwing the group wide open with one of the performances of his life. "I was saying to my coach in the locker room that nobody had ever beaten me 11 times in a row," joked Gonzalez, whose previous defeat by Federer came in this year's Australian Open final. "I played three unbelievable points to break him at 5-5. The last two games were the top of my level. The key was my serve and not being scared to go for my shots." Davydenko's gutsy fightback from a set and a break down sparked a tantrum from Roddick, who smashed his racket in disgust at his second-set collapse. But Roddick recovered superbly, storming through the third set to severely dent his opponent's chances at the $4.45 million eight-man event. Both players, set to clash in the Davis Cup final starting later this month, have been routinely tormented by Federer in the past, making victory in their group opener imperative. "Smashing rackets, for as many times as it's helped me, it's hurt me that many times also," laughed Roddick, who had struggled with ankle and knee problems in the run-in to Shanghai. World number two Rafael Nadal and fellow Spaniard David Ferrer won their Gold Group openers on Sunday
