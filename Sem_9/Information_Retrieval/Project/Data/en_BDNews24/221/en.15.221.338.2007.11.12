 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Asaduzaman Chayan struck a hat trick as Firoza Land Properties became the last team to qualify for the semifinals of the Office Hockey League with a massive 8-1 win over Afsar Limited in Group A last encounter at Moulna Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Monday. Three teams of Bangladesh Army, Sonali Bank SRC and Araf Apparels have already booked their semifinals seats in the eight-team meet. Chayan first put star-studded Firoza Land Properties ahead in the 22nd minute, but Razib restored the parity to Afsar Ltd seven minutes later and the first half was a 1-1 draw. After the breather, striker Habul again gave Firoza a lead in the 36th minute and Chayan completed his hat trick scoring in the 42nd, 50th and 61th minutes. Later, Habul, Mokshed and Asiquzzaman netted one goal each to confirm the semifinal berth for Firoza, who finished group runners-up after Bangladesh Army emerged group champions Sunday.
