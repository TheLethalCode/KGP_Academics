<TITLE> Turk's win may herald Slovenia's shift to left </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LJUBLJANA, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The triumph of leftist former diplomat Danilo Turk in Slovenia's presidential runoff heralds a possible centre-left victory in next year's general election, analysts said on Monday. Turk, an independent backed by three opposition centre-left parties, took 68.3 percent of the vote on Sunday ahead of conservative Lojze Peterle with 31.7 percent. Peterle was backed by most of the centre-right government in the small but wealthy ex-communist country that takes over the European Union presidency in January. "Turk's victory was not a surprise but the margin was wider than expected. This indicates that the voters are shifting to the left," Meta Roglic, a political commentator at daily Dnevnik, told Reuters. Analysts said the Social Democrats, who backed Turk and have topped popularity surveys in Slovenia since March, pose the biggest threat to Prime Minister Janez Jansa's Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) at parliamentary polls next year. "The possibility of a victory for Social Democrats at parliamentary election next year is high, and this has been confirmed by the result in Sunday's vote," said Borut Hocevar, an analyst at daily Zurnal 24. Latest opinion polls gave the Social Democrats some 24.7 percent of voters, clearly ahead of SDS with 14.4 percent. INFLATION HURTS GOVERNMENT Analysts said the government's popularity has fallen mostly due to a jump in inflation after Slovenia adopted the euro in January. Inflation rose to 5.1 percent in October, up from 1.6 percent a year ago. "Clearly, there's been a problem with the rise in inflation this year which has received a lot of attention, but it is entirely conceivable that the government will be able to get inflation down," said Darren Middleditch, senior economist at credit rating agency D&B. Middleditch said the success of the centre-left parties at parliamentary election due next autumn largely depended upon their ability to keep a united front and avoid infighting. The government suffered another setback in a parallel referendum vote on Sunday, where 71.2 percent of the voters rejected its proposal to have 35 pecent of a top local insurer managed by state investment fund KAD. The opposition demands this stake be distributed to some 750,000 Slovenians who were policy holders in the insurer in 1990, as the authorities had promised earlier. Analysts said the referendum further confirmed the public's turning away from the government. "So far, the government has not shown sensitivity to those who are poor and most hurt by price hikes and if people continue to find life difficult because of higher prices ... this will influence parliamentary polls," said Franci Krizanic, head of the Economic Institute at the Ljubljana's Faculty of Law. Most trade unions plan a first general protest rally in two years on Saturday, demanding a general increase of wages due to high inflation and economic growth. Slovenia's economy is expected to expand to 5.8 percent this year, up from 5.7 percent in 2006.
