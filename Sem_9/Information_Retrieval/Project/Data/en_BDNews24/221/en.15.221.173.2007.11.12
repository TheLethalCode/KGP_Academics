 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The Myanmar government Monday declined to ease visa restrictions and border pass availability to Bangladeshi nationals saying such decisions cannot be country-specific. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed briefed reporters after the Second Joint Trade Commission meeting between the two countries at Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. Brig-Gen Aung Tun, Myanmar's deputy commerce minister, who led the visiting delegation to talks, said: "If Myanmar gives anything special to Bangladesh in terms of issuing visas, other neighbours may seek the same." According to Bangladeshi businessmen, Myanmar only issues multiple and long-term visas following a difficult application process. However, Syed Mahmudul Huq, president of Bangladesh-Myanmar Business Promotion Council, told bdnews24.com that the Southeast Asian neighbour has become more lenient in providing visas to Bangladeshi nationals. Huq said Myanmar had agreed to discuss the matter further at the Bimstec meeting in December. "There may be a common system for visa applications between Bimstec countries," said Huq. Bangladesh also requested Myanmar to increase the coverage of their border passes up to the capital Yangon from their current boundary at the city of Mongdu. "Myanmar declined our request in view of safety and security issues. They have not indicated a quick response to the request," said Huq, who was present at the meeting. Currently, Myanmar allows Bangladeshis a seven-day border pass, which is not valid up to Yangon. "The issue has to come up at the next Bimstec meeting, in which both countries are members," added Ahmed. bd
