<TITLE> South Korea wants peace summit with North, US, China </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president called on Tuesday for a meeting with the leaders of the United States, North Korea and China to formally end the war that has split the Korean peninsula for over 50 years. President Roh Moo-hyun said such a summit would help international efforts to scrap the North's nuclear weapons programme and conclude a peace treaty to replace the ageing armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War. "In order to push for the prompt nuclear dismantlement of North Korea and the conclusion of a peace treaty, the leaders of the concerned countries need to make a joint declaration and set up a definite milestone," Roh said in a speech. Political analysts have said Roh is pressing for a summit to secure a positive legacy for what has been a largely unpopular presidency, but stands little chance of brokering the first meeting between the leaders of the United States and North Korea -- two long-time foes. US President George W Bush and China's ambassador to South Korea have said a peace treaty cannot be reached until North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons programme. "The North's nuclear programme is essentially related to the armistice regime, so both issues need to be dealt with at the same time," Roh said. North Korea agreed in a deal with China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States to disable by the end of the year its nuclear complex that makes plutonium for weapons in exchange for massive aid and an end to its status as an international pariah. The ceasefire that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War was signed by the United States, on behalf of UN-forces, China and North Korea. The North's powerful military has said South Korea did not deserve a seat at the table for peace treaty talks because it did not sign the armistice. But Roh and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il agreed at a summit in October to bring peace to the Cold War's last frontier by seeking talks with the United States and China. The peace deal will likely be discussed later this week when prime ministers from the two Koreas hold their first meeting in 15 years.
