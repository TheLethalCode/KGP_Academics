<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Monday hoped there would be reforms to political parties in four months. "Not for others, reforms should be made in the interest of the parties. I want the BNP to be reformed and united," Bhuiyan said Monday in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com. Bhuiyan said the BNP was the symbol of unity of the nationalist forces. "It needed to be united," he said. He called on the party workers and leaders to unite under the leadership of chairperson Khaleda Zia, keeping all feuds aside. Bhuiyan hoped that the BNP would be united under the leadership of M Saifur Rahman and Hafizuddin Ahmed in absence of Khaleda Zia. "Saifur Rahman has been with the party since it was formed. He is a senior leader. He took charge of the party in absence of the party chairperson. Hafiz was an elected MP for a long time and was vice president of BNP for long time too. "I hope the BNP stays united under their leadership," Bhuiyan said. On the remark of law adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein that expected reforms were not made in the political parties, Bhuiyan said: "Reform is the concern of a political party. It is not possible to conduct reforms hastily. We made steps for reforms and the reforms will be made in the interest of the party." He however conceded that the political parties had not made reforms as yet. Bhuiyan hailed the Election Commission saying its efforts to hold free and fair polls were "very good" and added that the BNP wanted to offer the EC all-out cooperation. "The commission sent us some proposals on the Representation of the People Order and the code of conduct for polls. Some of the proposals were good and some bad. We will hand in a proposal from the BNP to the EC after reviewing those proposals," he added. "I was given the responsibility to make a draft. We had a meeting Sunday. I will hand over my proposal to the policymakers of the party later after more meetings." The BNP earlier formed a seven-member committee led by Bhuiyan to draft a proposal for the Election Commission. bdnew
