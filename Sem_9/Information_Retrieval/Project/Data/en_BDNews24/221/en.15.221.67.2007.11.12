 Brisbane, November 11 (bdnews24.com)- Australia have sealed a comprehensive win over Sri Lanka by an innings and 40 runs in the first Test in Brisbane. Sri Lanka were bowled out for 300 in their second innings on the final day, which was twice interrupted by rain. Aussie paceman Brett Lee wrapped things up, taking four second innings wickets to add to his four in the first innings and win the man of the match award. Chamara Silva (43) offered some resistance but when Stuart Clark bowled Muttiah Muralitharan it was all over. The Aussies went into the final day needing just five Sri Lankan wickets to wrap up an innings victory in their first Test match for 10 months. Silva was dropped by Phil Jaques at midwicket off Stuart Clark in the fourth over of the day but Clark was not to be denied for long, trapping Prasanna Jayawardene lbw for one soon after. Farveez Maharoof (18) helped Silva add 33 for the seventh wicket before Lee kocked over his off stump and the only hold up for Australia was the two rain delays that followed. When they came back out Silva crashed three fours off one expensive Lee over before the fast bowler struck, Silva caught at third man by Michael Hussey. Dilhara Fernando was cleaned up by Lee for four before Clark wrapped up proceedings when he yorked Muralitharan for Australia's 13th Test win in a row. Australia captain Ricky Ponting said he hoped his new-look side would continue to improve. "You can expect us to maintain some very high standards," he said. "The young guys have a chance to forge identities and hopefully we can keep this group together and widen the gap between us and the other teams." Sir Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene admitted they had blown a chance to put the Aussies under pressure in their first Test without Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer. "It is an opportunity that we should have exploited, but we were not capable enough to do it over the first two days," said Jayawardene. (Courtesy : BBC
