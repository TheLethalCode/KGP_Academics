<TITLE> $100 oil overshadows OPEC heads of state summit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIYADH, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prospect of $100 oil and what OPEC can -- or cannot -- do about it will loom large as leaders of major oil exporters including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iran meet in Riyadh this week. When the OPEC heads of state last met in 2000 oil was at $30, and memories still fresh of a slump to $10 in 1998 that forced them to make painful spending cuts. Now their state coffers are bulging after years of bumper revenues and it is oil consuming countries' turn to feel the pinch. But oil ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries say they have little sway over rising prices, and that boosting supply would have minimal impact. They say the market is well supplied and the high price is due to international tensions, huge investment flows into the market, record dollar weakness and refinery capacity constraints. Still, the world's largest oil exporter Saudi Arabia will want to show concern for the effects of high prices on the world economy and its ally the United States. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Sunday that oil ministers would discuss raising oil output again at an upcoming meeting. bdnews24.com/lq/1919hrs OPEC's next formal ministerial conference is scheduled for for Dec. 5 in Abu Dhabi. The oil ministers were unlikely to make any policy decision in Riyadh before that, analysts said. "It would be a surprise," said Paul Horsnell, head of commodities research at Barclays Capital. "They don't want to upstage their heads of state, especially as they are meeting soon after in the first days of December." At OPEC's last meeting in September, Naimi persuaded the group to boost output in a gesture to consumer nations worried about soaring prices and diminishing stocks. U.S. oil prices were at $80 then, and already had Saudi Arabia and Kuwait concerned that they were taking their toll on the economy. Despite OPEC's decision, the price hit a record high of $98.62 a barrel on Nov. 7, close in on its inflation-adjusted peak of $101.70 in April 1980. FUNDS AND WEAK DOLLAR The growing role of investment funds in the oil market is one of the largest changes since the last summit and has complicated life for OPEC, which supplies more than an third of the world's crude. Funds have increasingly viewed oil as an asset in its own right, using it to diversify and hedge against inflation and dollar weakness. "That is setting up $100 oil," said David Kirsch, manager of market intelligence at Washington-based consultancy PFC Energy. "It puts OPEC in a very difficult situation. "Easing monetary policy in the U.S. is taking the dollar to new lows and oil to new highs, so higher oil output won't necessarily lead to a price reduction," he said. "But in the end in the court of public opinion, high oil prices would be blamed (for any economic recession)." The weak dollar too was likely to be a big theme at the meeting when OPEC heads of state meet on Saturday and Sunday after several days of talks between oil and finance ministers. Venezuela's oil minister has said that ministers in Riyadh would discuss possible changes in the way most oil exports are priced in dollars. True to its alliance with Washington, Riyadh has resisted any temptation to revalue its currency or break its strict dollar-riyal peg -- helping induce inflation which has hit ordinary Saudis whose incomes are a world away from their billionaire royal leaders. MIDDLE EAST Ecuador is set to become the group's 13th member in Riyadh, just 10 months after Angola joined, but it will be Middle East politics and their impact on the market which will be on the Riyadh agenda. "That is the strategic discussion that will take place, albeit not publicly" said Sadad Husseini, a former top executive at Saudi Arabian oil firm Saudi Aramco. "Is this the right time for the United States to be sabre-rattling in the region?" The United States has not ruled out military action against Iran over its nuclear energy programme. Washington says it is a front for developing weapons, a fear shared by Saudi Arabia. Turkish threats to invade north Iraq to hit Kurdish insurgents, and the potential for any conflict there to escalate has also worried the oil market. "This summit is likely to focus more on the Iran question," said Rochdi Yonsi, analyst with Eurasia Group. "I think the Saudis are taking a big risk by holding this summit in such a volatile context, in which rumours and apprehensio
