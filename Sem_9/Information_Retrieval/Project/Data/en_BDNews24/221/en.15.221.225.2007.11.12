<TITLE> Barca wary of Cup slip up away to Alcoyano </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's problems away from home make their trip to face Segunda B (third division) side Alcoyano on Tuesday a potential banana skin in the last 32 round of the King's Cup. Frank Rijkaard's team have only managed one away win in the league in six attempts, and looked short on motivation and confidence as they fell 2-0 at Getafe on Saturday. The Catalan club have won the trophy 24 times and are two divisions above Alcoyano, but have tumbled out to Segunda B sides twice at this stage in recent years. In 2002-3 they fell to Novelda, and 2004-5 it was Gramenet who inflicted the humiliation. They were both one-off knockout games, so at least this year there is a return leg to recover from any slip up. "I have lost these types of games before and although many think they will be easy, it is important we put on a good performance," said Barca captain Carles Puyol. Rijkaard, who is under pressure from local media, will be without players on international duty such as Brazil's Ronaldinho and Argentina's Lionel Messi. Holders Sevilla, who beat Getafe 1-0 in last June's final, travel to face another Segunda B side Denia on Tuesday while 23-time winners Athletic Bilbao visit second division Hercules. There are six more first legs being played on Wednesday, including two between top-flight sides as Levante host Almeria, and Valladolid receive Real Murcia. The Primera Liga's second-placed club Villarreal visit second division basement side Las Palmas. The remaining seven ties have been postponed until next month at the request of clubs exercising the option due to international call ups. They include Real Madrid and Valencia's trips to Segunda B Alicante and Real Union respectively, and the all-Primera Liga clashes between Osasuna and Real Mallorca, and 2006 winners Espanyol and Deportivo Coruna. The return legs are due to be played on January 2
