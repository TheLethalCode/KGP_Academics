<TITLE> BB governor rules out pegging up taka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  The taka will not be appreciated against the dollar, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said Monday. The country's central banker was speaking to reporters at the Purbani Hotel after he attended a Dutch-Bangla Bank stipend awarding ceremony for meritorious students. The governor said that appreciating the taka would decrease export earnings and remittances from expatriates. "The central bank will supply US dollars according to market demand," he added. Ahmed said that Bangladesh Bank had raised the dollar supply recently to finance imports, in a bid to stabilise the prices of oil and other commodities. "That is the reason behind the increased value of the taka against the dollar. It's normal that the price will go down if supply is increased," he said. The central bank was watching the taka value closely, the governor said. Asked if rising international oil prices would have a negative impact on the country's economy, Ahmed said: "We can't say anything precisely about the that at the moment. However, there is no doubt that Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation will suffer losses." Economists and specialists have long complained that the prices of imported goods had increased because the taka had been depreciated against the dollar at an alarming rate over the last few years. bdnews24.c
