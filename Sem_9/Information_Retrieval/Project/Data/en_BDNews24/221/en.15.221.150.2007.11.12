<TITLE> UK weapons inspector's death not suicide : book </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British lawmaker says a former UN weapons inspector, whose death caused one of the biggest crises of Tony Blair's premiership, did not commit suicide as official accounts state but may have been murdered. Critics of a book published on Monday by Norman Baker, an opposition Liberal Democrat member of parliament, describe its accusations as absurd. Kelly's wife has also publicly stated she believes her husband committed suicide. David Kelly was found dead in woods near his home in July 2003, just days after it was revealed that he was the source for a BBC report that said Blair's government had deliberately "sexed-up" intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. News of the death rocked Blair and his government, with critics saying Kelly's identity had been made public in order to discredit the BBC's story. Senior judge Lord Hutton carried out an independent inquiry into the circumstances and ruled in January 2004 that Kelly had slit his left wrist after taking painkillers in countryside near his home in Oxfordshire, central England. He concluded that Kelly ended his life because of a feeling people had lost trust in him and dismay at being exposed in the media. Hutton also cleared Blair and his officials. However Baker, in his book "The Strange death of David Kelly", says he believes the scientist did not kill himself. "I am convinced beyond reasonable doubt that it wasn't suicide. If it's not suicide, it's clearly not natural causes or an accident, and therefore it must be murder," he told Reuters in an interview. Baker, who along with his party opposed the war from the outset, said his investigations had uncovered a host of reasons which led to him querying Hutton's "unreliable" findings. WIFE ILL He said it was virtually impossible to kill yourself in the manner Kelly had, by cutting his ulnar artery, there was a lack of blood at the scene, and no fingerprints were found on the knife. Kelly had also booked a flight to Iraq for the following week, his wife was unwell, his daughter was shortly to be married and he left no suicide note, all factors that appeared to contradict the official verdict, Baker argues. While Baker says such conflicting evidence suggests Kelly was murdered, he is unable to pinpoint exactly who was responsible and why, although his top suspects are a group of Iraqis loyal to Iraq's former president Saddam Hussein. "The key question is whether the actions of the Iraqi group were self-generated, and subsequently covered up by the government, or whether a tiny cabal within the British establishment commissioned the assassins to undertake this," he wrote in the book. "Perhaps it was somewhere in between, with a nod and a wink being unofficially offered." The police say they will not reopen their inquiries and some commentators have dismissed Baker's findings. Columnist David Aaronovitch wrote in the Times newspaper that if Baker were subjected to the same scrutiny "then he might be challenged to tell his constituents on whose behalf he has wasted a year concocting absurd accusations."
