 ISLAMABAD, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto will not be allowed to hold a motorcade planned for Tuesday from the city of Lahore to Islamabad to protest against emergency rule, a senior government official said. "Rallies and protests are banned, they are not allowed," Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azim Khan told Reuters on Monday when asked if Bhutto's procession would be allowed. "Whoever breaks the law will be taken to task," he said.
