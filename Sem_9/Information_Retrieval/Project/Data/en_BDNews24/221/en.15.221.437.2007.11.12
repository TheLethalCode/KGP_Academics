 LONDON, Mon Nov 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A huge blaze at a warehouse sent black smoke pouring over east London on Monday but there were no reports of casualties and police ruled out a terrorist attack. Fifteen fire engines and 75 firefighters rushed to the scene, an industrial estate in the Stratford area, the London fire brigade said. Witnesses said the fire broke out in an empty warehouse being demolished as part of preparations for the 2012 Olympics. Two ambulances raced to the scene but the London ambulance service said no casualties had been reported. News reports and witnesses spoke of an explosion, raising fears of a possible attack.

And then it collapsed on itself." In July 2005, suicide bombers killed 52 people on London's transport system and there have been several unsuccessful attacks since then, keeping Londoners' nerves on edge. A spokesman for Britain's Home Office (interior ministry) said the capital's police force had reported there were no reports of an explosion. Asked if it was possible to rule out any terrorist connection, a security source said: "We wouldn't rule anything out at this stage, its too early.
