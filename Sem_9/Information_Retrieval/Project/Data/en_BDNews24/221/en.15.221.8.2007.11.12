 BAGHDAD, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guards from a foreign security firm shot dead a taxi driver in Baghdad over the weekend, a senior Iraqi police source said on Monday, in the latest killing of civilians by contractors who protect dignitaries in Iraq. DynCorp International, a private Virginia-based company which protects US embassy officials in Iraq, reported firing at a car as its guards escorted a convoy through Baghdad around midday on Saturday, U.S. and DynCorp officials said. Greg Lagana, a spokesman for the firm, said the company was not aware of any injuries or deaths. The police source said the taxi driver was shot in the chest on Saturday by a convoy travelling through the Utaifiya area of west-central Baghdad. He could not identify the security contractor involved in the incident. The taxi driver died on the way to hospital, the police source told Reuters, requesting anonymity. DynCorp had notified the Interior Ministry about their Saturday shooting, Lagana said. "(From) the information we had from observations of the team, there was no one injured," he said. BLACKWATER INCIDENT The shooting comes less than two months after U.S. security firm Blackwater was involved in an incident in western Baghdad in which 17 civilians were killed. Blackwater said its guards acted lawfully, but the shooting enraged the Iraqi government, which late last month approved a draft law to end foreign security firms' immunity from prosecution by scrapping a controversial 2004 decree. The measure must now be approved by Iraq's parliament. Mirembe Nantongo, spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, could not immediately confirm anyone had been killed. She said DynCorp reported using "non-lethal means" against a car which had come too close to the convoy. Typically, Lagana said, guards who see a threat from a nearby car will shoot at its engine block to stop it. "The idea is not to shoot the driver," but to disable the vehicle, he said. The Blackwater shooting thrust into the spotlight the operations of private security contractors in Iraq, who are believed to number up to 48,000 personnel. The draft bill that would end security contractors' immunity would cancel Order 17, a decree issued by the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) in 2004 shortly before it handed control to an interim Iraqi government. The measure prevents foreign contractors from being prosecuted in local courts. In Iraq, where DynCorp has worked since 2004, the company guards State Department and other US government employees, a US official said. DynCorp guards have been involved in other incidents involving Iraqis, but the number of casualties was "extremely low", Lagana said. While he did not have an exact figure, he said the number was in the `single digits
