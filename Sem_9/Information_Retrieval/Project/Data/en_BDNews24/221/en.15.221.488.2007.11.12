 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh will host a tri-nation one-day international tournament involving ach-rivals India, Pakistan and Bangladesh next May, said a Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Monday. "During the ICC board meeting in Dubai last month, both Indian and Pakistan board presidents assured us verbally of a tri-nation one-day international tournament some time in May," said BCB cricket operation chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu. BCB president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali got the pledge from the Indian and Pakistan board presidents during the ICC board meeting, said Lipu. The Indian board also confirmed that they would take part in a tri-series involving hosts Bangladesh, Pakistan and India. "We can confirm that India will participate in the series with Bangladesh and Pakistan," BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah was quoted by cricinfo as saying Monday. Shah said that the fixture and dates would be announced in 10 to 15 days. Bangladesh had a plan to host a tri-nation with India and South Africa during the Proteas tour of Bangladesh in February. After the pulling out of South Africa, the BCB invited Pakistan instead. "We've invited Pakistan to send their team and they have agreed as South Africa pulled out of the series," said Lipu, former Bangladesh skipper. The subcontinent's three sides last met in a tri-series in Bangladesh in 1998 and India emerged champions beating Pakistan in the best-of-three finals. Each team of the tournament will play each other twice in the league stages before the final.
