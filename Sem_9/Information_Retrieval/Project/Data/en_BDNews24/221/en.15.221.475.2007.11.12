<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bvdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission expects two cell phone operators to go public by the middle of 2008, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said Monday. "We have already completed our homework. We have held a series of talks with the mobile phone companies over the issuance of primary shares to the public," Alam said after a meeting of the Market Promotion Committee at the Dhaka Stock Exchange. The recently formed Market Promotion Committee, comprising leaders of leading chambers bodies, sat with the BTRC chairman on bringing cell phone operators to the capital market. Among others, SEC chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh president Mahabubur Rahman, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Latifur Rahman, and Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Hossain Khaled were present. Including the state-run Teletalk, six cell-phone companies Grameenphone, Aktel, Banglalink, CityCell and Warid Telecom are operating in Bangladesh. Bringing the cell phone companies into the stock market has been a long standing demand from investors who believe that country's stocks market will get a boost if cell phone operators go public. Alam said that the BTRC would sit with Grameenphone on November 30 over the IPO issue. "We may finalise when and how it will go public," he said. The BTRC chief said that discussion was going on with Aktel on the issue. "We will also set a timeframe for other mobile phone operators to get listed on the stock exchanges." He also said that they were considering bringing changes to the licensing conditions making floatation of primary shares to the public mandatory. "The market has the depth to absorb the shares of the mobile phone companies," Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan said they had discussed the ways of bringing private sector companies, especially the mobile companies, into the country's stock market. bd
