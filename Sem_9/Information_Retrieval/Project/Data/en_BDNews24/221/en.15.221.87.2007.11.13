<TITLE> China consumer inflation rebounds, worries mount </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Nov 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Soaring food costs pushed China's inflation back to a nearly 11-year high in October, reinforcing expectations of further interest rate rises and adding to worries that rising costs to consumers could undermine social stability. Consumer price inflation quickened to 6.5 percent last month, matching the peak scaled in August, from 6.2 percent in September, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. The numbers came a day after Premier Wen Jiabao visited a poorer part of Beijing, asking residents if they could afford to eat meat and telling them he understood even a 1 yuan ($0.14) rise in prices had an impact on the lives of ordinary people. Food prices, which tend to be volatile, are excluded from core inflation, but some economists warned that the surge in prices for everything from pork to cooking oil could trigger higher wage demands and spill over to the broad economy. "When you see the costs at your dinner table going up forever, you will go to your boss and say, 'Either you give me a salary increase or I will quit for another job'," said Dong Tao, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong. Non-food prices rose just 1.1 percent in October from a year earlier, the same pace as in September. But food prices soared 17.6 percent, with vegetables up 29.9 percent and food oil up 34 percent. "Definitely, this increases the possibility of an imminent rise in interest rates," said Xue Hua, an analyst with China Merchants Securities in Shenzhen. Xue said the central bank, which has raised rates five times so far this year, could act as soon as this week. Economists polled by Reuters had expected an inflation rate of 6.4 percent. Inflation was last higher in December 1996, when the rate was 7.0 percent. POLITICAL CONCERN Premier Wen's walkabout in poor alleys of historic Beijing underscored the government's anxieties about inflation, which helped fuel the social unrest that culminated in the bloody crackdown near Tiananmen Square in 1989. "Today I just want to sit down and talk with everyone, understand the impact of rising prices on citizens' lives," Wen said. "Resolving the difficulties of the masses is the government's responsibility." During the weekend three people died and 31 were injured in a stampede at a store in southwestern China as shoppers scrambled for cooking oil that had been discounted by 11 yuan ($1.48), a powerful lure for people juggling tight budgets. But some economists see rising food costs as a temporary supply shock caused by pig disease, among other factors, and are confident the fallout can be contained. "There is still little sign of food price inflation spreading to non-food items," Mingchun Sun of Lehman Brothers said in a note to clients. "In fact, prices for the clothing, transportation and communication, and recreation and education subgroups of the CPI are still falling at faster rates." The central bank's stated aim is to bring real interest rates into positive territory, and it is well off the mark with inflation eclipsing the 3.87 percent rate for one-year bank deposits. Goldman Sachs ratcheted up its full-year inflation forecast to 4.8 percent from 4.5 percent after Tuesday's data. For 2008 the investment bank now expects prices to rise 4.5 percent instead of 4.0 percent. "We believe the central bank will likely respond with additional tightening measures including strict control on bank lending and two more rate hikes before the end of this year," Goldman economist Yu Song said in a note to clien
