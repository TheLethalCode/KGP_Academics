 DHAKA, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Meteorological Department Monday issued storm warning signal number two over Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla as cyclonic storm SIDR intensified into a severe cyclonic storm. Maximum sustained wind speeds near the storm centre was about 90 kilometres per hour, rising to 115 kilometres per hour gusts. Cyclone SIDR is moving in a north/northwesterly direction from its location in the southeast Bay of Bengal. The storm was roughly 1240 kilometres away from Chittagong and Mongla ports, and about 1150 kilometres from Cox's Bazar at 6 pm on Nov 12. The sea remains high and fishing boats and trawlers have been advised to stay close to the coast and avoid going out to deep sea. The Met said wind speeds were likely to increase as the storm intensified and forecast landfall on the Bangladesh coast for Wednesday or Thursday. The Meteorological Department earlier advised fishing boats to stay close to shore and geared for the possible evacuation of thousands people living in coastal areas. "The evacuation will start when the storm comes dangerously close to the shores," a disaster management official said, adding that the army and police were ready to help. bdnews
