 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Internet users faced serious service disruptions Monday night after the fibre optic link to Dhaka was cut off. The link was severed at a point in Sitakundu, an official at BTTB's control room in Chittagong said. Saiful Islam, who mans the help desk of internet service provider ADN, told bdnews24.com at 1:45am Tuesday: "All fibre links are down." Kaimuzzaman, support officer at Bangladesh Online (BOL), said: "We have switched to VSAT." "It's been down since 12.45am and we've been trying to contact BTTB officials," he told bdnews24.com at 1:50am by phone. Fazal M Kamal, executive director for news and public affairs of bdnews24.com, one of the most affected internet-based operations, said: "It's most distressing that a second disruption has taken place in a matter of 48 hours." "We are able to operate because of VSAT connectivity provided by the ISP. But our readers are unable to access our site," he added. "It's worrying that it has occurred a number of times in the past few months and it's not ceased yet. In the larger perspective, it affects many business operations adversely." bdn
