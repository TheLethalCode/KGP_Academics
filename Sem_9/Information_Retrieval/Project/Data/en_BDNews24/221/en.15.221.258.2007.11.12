 LAHORE, Pakistan, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Monday urged Pakistanis of all shades to join a motorcade protest against President Pervez Musharraf's emergency rule and vowed it would go ahead even if police try to block her. Musharraf set off a storm of criticism when he imposed emergency rule on Nov. 3 and has come under pressure from Western allies and rivals to set the nuclear-armed country back on the path to democracy. He is likely to face more calls to restore democracy when the 53-nation Commonwealth group of mostly former British colonies holds a special meeting in London on Monday to discuss Pakistan. Two-time former prime minister Benazir plans to lead a 3-4 day long procession of vehicles from the city of Lahore to Islamabad on Tuesday to demand General Musharraf quits as army chief, ends emergency rule, reinstates the constitution and frees thousands of detained lawyers and opponents -- including many from her own party. Police have warned Benazir could face a suicide assassination bid, like the one at a rally last month to welcome her back from eight years in self-imposed exile which killed 139 people. "I know it is dangerous," Benazir said during a visit to the tomb of renowned 19th century poet Mohammad Iqbal during an impromptu foray into Lahore in her bullet-proof Landcruiser. "I don't want to take a dangerous path, but I ask myself, what is the alternative and how can we save our country?" "We appeal to all people, including from other parties and minorities, women and children, to take part in this long march," she said of the motorcade. Police initially said they would block the convoy, just as they stifled a protest rally in the city of Rawalpindi on Friday -- when Benazir was held under house arrest for most of the day. But a senior police official in Lahore said he had no orders to stop the convoy. Musharraf justified the emergency by saying the judiciary was hampering the battle against militants and interfering with governance. However diplomats say his main objective was to stop the Supreme Court from ruling invalid his Oct. 6 re-election by assemblies his supporters dominated. Musharraf said on Sunday a general election would be held by Jan. 9 but declined to say when the emergency would be lifted and the constitution restored. STEP DOWN He also said he would step down as army chief and be sworn in as civilian president as soon as the Supreme Court -- where new judges seen as friendly to the government have been appointed -- ruled on challenges to his election. Attorney General Malik Adul Qayyum said the court was expected to resume its hearing into the challenges against Musharraf's candidacy next week. Benazir welcomed Musharraf's announcement on the elections but said he had not gone far enough in meeting her demands. She said last week there would not be talks with Musharraf as long as the constitution was suspended but said on Sunday she had not closed the door to negotiations. The United States had hoped the pair would share power after the polls. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also welcomed the announcement but called for an end to emergency rule. The United States is worried the turmoil will distract its ally's attention from efforts against al Qaeda and the Taliban. Pakistani forces are battling an Islamist insurgency spreading from the Afghan border -- where Osama bin Laden is believed to be hiding -- into so-called "settled" areas. Pakistani stocks, hurt by the emergency, ended nearly 2 percent higher on the election announcement, dealers said. Musharraf has seen his popularity plummet since he first tried to sack the chief justice in March but he retains the crucial support of the army, analysts say. "The emergency is not good, it isolates us from the international community" said Sadruddin, an elderly man with a beard and turban selling snacks outside the High Court in Lahore. "(Musharraf) should quit altogether." But lawyer Sayed Wahid Hussain said he supported the emergency and Musharraf should stay on as army chief and president: "He has shown so much tolerance."
