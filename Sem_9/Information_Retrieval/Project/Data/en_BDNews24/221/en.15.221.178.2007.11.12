 Dhaka, Nov 12 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and Sylhet, looking for their first win, were in the driving seats Monday in the four-dayers against Chittagong and Barisal at the close of third day in the National Cricket League. Chittagong, 200 all out in the first innings, were trailing by 11 runs as they made 165 for four at stumps in the second innings after Dhaka posted a huge 376 all out in their first innings at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Sylhet, in stark contrast to their first-innings display where they scored 335/9 declared, collapsed to 95 all out in the second innings, setting Barisal to chase an easy target of 172 at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. However, pacer Subhashish Roy brought Sylhet back in the game wrecking the top order of Barisal who were 41 for five when the bails were drawn. Away at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna, Rajshahi took an overall 191-run lead against Khulna as the visitors finished the third day at 192 for seven. Earlier, Khulna declared their first innings at 204 for nine, taking a one-run lead against the league leaders. Rajshahi were bundled out for 203 after teenage pacer Dollar Mahmud snared seven wickets including a hat-trick. Dhaka vs Chittagong Chittagong skipper Ehsanul Haq (18 not out) and Faisal Hossain Dickens (17 not out) would look to prolong their second innings on the final day in a bid to avert a loss to the hosts. Despite two good knocks from opener Tamim Iqbal (70) and Aftab Ahmed (32), Chittagong finished the day on the back foot in the face of a cohesive bowling effort from Dhaka. Earlier, Dhaka resumed the day on 300 for five to finish on 376 all out, taking a comfortable 176-run first innings. Dickens and Saju Datta each took three wickets. Sylhet vs Barisal Having dismissed Sylhet for 95 all out in the second innings, Barisal themselves were in tatters after Sylhet pacer Subhashish rattled the top order with 23 for three. Barisal were struggling at 17 for five at one stage, but Raqibul Hasan (21) and Arafat Salahuddin (13) halted further damage to see their side reach 41 at the close. Earlier, former national pacer Talha Jubair (4/34) ran through the Sylhet top order while medium pacer Arafat Salahuddin (3/20) and left-handed pacer Sajidul Islam (3/28) clipped the middle and the late orders. Alok Kapali, who hit 168 in the first innings, topscored with 32 while Mithun (24) was the third Sylhet batsman to get to the double figures. In the morning, Barisal, having resumed the day on 215 for six, added another 44 runs to finish at 259 all out. Khulna vs Rajshahi Rajshahi resume their second innings on 192 for five on the final day Monday and unbeaten pair of Khaled Mashud (29) and Mushfiqur Rahman (5) will look to frustrate hosts Khulna who are looking to taste first win in the league. Khulna declared their first innings on 204 for nine in reply to Rajshahi's 203 all out. b
