 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University students Friday rolled out a new series of protest plans including a countrywide one-hour boycott of classes from 11am on Jan 23 to secure 'unblemished freedom' of the detained teachers and a student. A student movement under an "anti-oppression" banner announced the fresh protest plan from a press conference, as a previous 10-day ultimatum for the freedom of the detainees expired Friday. Student leader Imran Habib Johnny read out a statement at Madhu's Canteen on the campus. The new plan came three days before a Dhaka court is set to deliver a verdict on one of the cases against the four teachers and 15 students, who face charges of violating emergency rules during the campus rioting in August 2007. The court decision came Thursday hours after the government submitted a written appeal urging the court of magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui to fast-track the trial. The appeal makes a major move by the government to wrap up the controversial cases against the teachers and the student who were arrested with ties to the unrest at Dhaka University. The detained teachers and the student protested their innocence in the dock during court proceedings. The latest protest plans were in addition to a five-point demand put by the teachers earlier this week. Their plans include postponement of enrolment tests for two faculties for 2007-08. The new programmes include raising black flags on the university campus and wearing black badges until the teachers are freed. But all examinations would remain outside the fresh plans, the students said. The protests also include cultural programme in front of the central library at 3pm on Jan 19 and 20, a sit-in demonstration in front of the vice chancellor's office, expressing solidarity with the teacher's programme in front of the Aparajeyo Bangla and a daylong sit-in on Jan 21, a human chain in the educational institutions throughout the country on Jan 22 and one-hour class boycott on Jan 23. In a statement handed out to reporters at the news briefing Friday, the students said the government position on the ways of possible release of the detainees was not clear. It asked for "unconditional release" of the detainees and accused the government of 'unfair play'. The statement said the government was pushing the students on the edge by not releasing the detainees within the 10-day ultimatum. "The student community is being pushed into a complex situation," it observed. It said the government would be responsible if any chaos re-surfaced on the campus. The students 'against oppression' unveiled a raft of protest programmes on Jan 8 when the country's premier university re-opened after winter and Eid vacations. bdnews24.com/jf/my
