 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering a policy aimed at women's development to promote gender parity, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Thursday. Addressing the Bangladesh Mohila Parishad's 11th National Conference-2008, Fakhruddin said: "I'm quite optimistic that the government will be able to declare a Women's Development Policy soon." "It will reflect all the ideals of gender equity enshrined in our constitution, the UN charter CEDAW and the Beijing plan of work." "Different steps are also being taken to increase women's participation at different levels of civil and military administration and in policy making." With regard to the female workforce in the country, Fakhruddin said: "The vibrant presence of our women in different spheresincluding traditional as well as newer professionsis highly visible today." The lion's share of the country's foreign exchange earnings is due to the contribution of women workers in the export-oriented ready made garments industry, the chief adviser said. "The progress of micro-credit programmes has depended on the women members," he added. "Their role is prominent in the success of the socio-economic sector." "But women face deprivation at different spheres of national life," Fakhruddin continued. "Though sad, it is true that as a patriarchal outlook is dominant in the society, the equal rights of men and women recognised in the constitution are yet to be reflected in real life." The Bangladesh Mohila Parishad, founded by poet Sufia Kamal has been playing a positive role in realising women's rights for the last 37 years, the chief adviser said. Also addressing the conference, Norwegian ambassador Ingebjorg Stofring said: "In the last decade the status of women in Bangladesh has improved." "Despite this, incidents of forced child marriage still take place." "Men will also have to play a role in establishing the rights of women," the ambassador said. Mohila Parishad president Hena Das told participants: "(Our organisation) has been working for a progressive society and freedom for humanity." She said Mohila Parishad was fighting against fundamentalism, militancy and communalism. The three-day conferencebeing held at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Centrewas inaugurated with recitations from the Quran, the Bible, the Geeta and the Tripitak. The conference slogan for 2008 is "Equal opportunity for equality". Speaking as chief guest at the inauguration, the chief adviser told the conference: "The government has almost finalised the work of formulating a Citizens' Act, which will ensure equal right to all citizens." Representatives from 58 districts of the country are participating in the conference, which will conclude on Jan 19. Mohila Parishad general secretary Ayesha Khanam and grassroots organiser Moududa Begun from Dinajpur also spoke. bdnews2
