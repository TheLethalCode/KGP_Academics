 NAIROBI, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The threat of a freeze on aid to Kenya by western donors and opposition plans to boycott companies owned by people close to President Mwai Kibaki will delay the country's economic recovery, analysts said on Friday. The European Parliament on Thursday asked for a halt on budgetary support until Kibaki and his challenger, who is accusing him of rigging the Dec. 27 election, reach a political resolution to a crisis in which around 650 people have been killed. The opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) is demanding Kibaki step down from power and plans to boycott companies run by what it called hardliners backing Kibaki. Party supporters have held banned street protests since Wednesday. "Locally, we have an environment that is denying us a chance to generate money which the government needs for taxes and internationally, we are faced with a threat that the money they have received in support will not come," said James Shikwati, executive director of the Inter Regional Economic Network. The EU planned to give 383 million euros ($561 million) over 2008-2013. A decision to stop donations would however need the green light from all 27 members of the bloc. Kenya receives miniscule aid compared to other African countries but a withdrawal of it by Western powers would be noticed by the investors and tourists who have flocked to the east African economic powerhouse in the last five years. "A freeze on this stream of financing only means that the country must be ready to live much longer with bad roads, faulty power and water systems, all because those we call our leaders cannot find a solution to a problem that is of their own making," an editorial in the Business Daily said. BOYCOTTS, THEN STRIKES ODM said it would end three days of street protests on Friday but move on to other tactics to force Kibaki out. It plans boycotts and then labour union strikes. Companies targeted for boycotts are Equity Bank , Brookside Dairies and bus companies CityHoppa and Kenya Bus. Equity, which begun as a building society in the heartland of Kibaki's support in central Kenya, derives most of its business from there. The business community, civil society and religious leaders have all urged the two political leaders to sit down and talk and avert a bigger crisis. "The business community has suffered immensely during the previous two weeks with loss of staff, property, opportunities and long term confidence," said Steven Smith, chairman of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. International mediation efforts by African Union leader John Kufour, Washington's top diplomat to Africa Jendayi Frazer and Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu, have so far failed to soften the two sides. Former Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa and Graca Machel, wife of South Africa's Nelson Mandela, are in the country to continue the efforts. Former UN head Kofi Annan was supposed to lead the team but took ill before he left for Kenya. "Whoever emerges out of the current stalemate will inherit a tattered economy that has been needlessly driven to its knees," Smith sa
