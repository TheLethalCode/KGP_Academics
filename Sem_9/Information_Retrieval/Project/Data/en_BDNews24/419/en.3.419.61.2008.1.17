 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com) Dhaka University students "against oppression" boycotted classes Thursday for two hours. A section of teachers and students wore black badges and participated peacefully in a protest programme that had been announced earlier. Demanding the release of detained DU teachers and students, a group of students took out a silent procession under the banner of Chhatrobandhu (friends of students) from Aparajeyo Bangla, and marched through the campus. A section of the DU teachers had earlier declared a five-point protest programmebeginning Thursdayfor the unconditional release of their detained colleagues and students. The demands included postponement of admission tests of two units under two faculties for the 2007-2008 education year, sharing teacher-student oppression stories, wearing black badges and hoisting a black flag on top of the Arts Building until the demands are met. However the majority of students did not respond to the daylong class and exam boycott called by Chhatrobandhu in the morning hours. Students of almost all departments attended classes and took exams, excepting those of the Institute of Education Research. Towards noon, a group of 30 to 35 students from Bangla College joined the "students against oppression" in a human chain programme. The students were seen carrying banners and placards inscribed with messages such as: "we want freedom, wake up youths" and "can't expect to run the show keeping our teachers, students behind the bars". An extraordinary meeting of the DU teachers' association Wednesday evening attended by 63 pro-Awami League and left-leaning teachers had announced Thursday's programme and demands. The meeting also announced a three-hour token hunger strike in front of Aparajeyo Bangla on Jan 21. bdnews24
