 LONDON, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Geoff Miller has beaten David Graveney to the job of national selector for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), it was announced on Friday. In a restructuring of the game by the ECB, Graveney, who had been chairman of selectors since 1997, has been handed the new position of performance manager. Ashes-winning spinner Ashley Giles and James Whitaker will form the new four-man selection panel with former England, Derbyshire and Essex all rounder Miller and England head coach Peter Moores. "We would like to thank David Graveney for all the hard work, dedication and professionalism he has demonstrated as chairman of selectors over the past eleven years," Dennis Amiss, the ECB's deputy chairman, said in a statement. "England cricket has made significant progress during David's tenure and he can be immensely proud of his contribution." The changes follow recommendations made by the England Cricket Review Group headed by Ken Schofield last year in the aftermath of England's drubbing in Australia. Miller, who has been part of the selection panel for seven years, will start work immediately and join up with the England one-day squad in New Zealand. YOUNG PLAYERS Graveney will take responsibility for managing the development of young players across the counties. Hugh Morris, managing director of England Cricket, who made the appointments together with Amiss and chief executive David Collier, said: "Geoff is the ideal person to take on this new and important role of national selector. "He has played at the highest level, possesses in-depth knowledge of the domestic game and as a member of the selection panel for the past seven years he has extensive experience of the selection process." Giles, who retired from the game last year and is Warwickshires's director of cricket, said he was happy to be involved with England again. "I am really pleased to have been given this job and very excited by it," he said. "It will be great to be involved again with England cricket and I believe that my recent experience of international cricket will benefit all the various England teams as we go forward into the future.
