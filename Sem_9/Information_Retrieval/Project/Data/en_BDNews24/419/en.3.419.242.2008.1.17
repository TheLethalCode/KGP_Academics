 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission will not seek wealth statements of the chief adviser and other advisers, an ACC official said Thursday. The ACC cannot seek statements of their wealth because of government rules, director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal said at a regular press briefing. Iqbal said, according to the government order, the chief adviser and other advisers were to submit their wealth statement voluntarily; the commission could not ask them to. He said former secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury who surrendered to court had been shown arrested in the corruption case regarding setting up of a barge-mounted power station in Khulna. The Commission was preparing to interrogate him, Hanif added. On the status of the investigation into the corruption charges against Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka, the ACC director general said enquiry into allegations of his having illegal assets was going on. Hanif said it had not decided yet to file case against Khoka. Asked whether allegations of irregularities and corruption against some NGOs would be investigated, Iqbal said they had not made a decision. Former director general of Livestock Research Institute at Savar Dr Kazi Md Imdadul Haque submitted a statement to the ACC declaring Tk 65.23 lakh in wealth. In two separate cases against former BRTC chairman and BNP leader Taimur Alam Khandaker, the ACC approved submission of two charge sheets accusing him of taking Tk 16 lakh and Tk 22.50 lakh in bribes. The ACC has also decided to ask National Sports Council assistant engineer Nurul Amin Talukder to submit his wealth statement to the commission. bdnews24
