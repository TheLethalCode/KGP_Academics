 KARACHI, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe spinner Ray Price is hopeful the team will resume test cricket when they host India in May under the International Cricket Council (ICC) Future Tours Programme. Zimbabwe have been restricted to one-day internationals since January 2006 when country's cricket union opted to withdraw from its test commitments -- a decision the ICC welcomed -- following a dispute with some of its leading players. "I know we are trying to start playing test cricket again in May when India comes. But obviously our board will decide whether we are ready to go back," Price told reporters. "We are very positive about ourselves. Recently we had a very good tour of South Africa where we won all four games. We have won some good matches in recent months. "We need more four-day games to give more time in the middle to our batters and bowlers," added the 31-year-old, who has played 18 tests and 30 one-day internationals for Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe Cricket media manager Lovemore Banda said a final decision on when the team should resume playing tests would be taken by the board in consultation with ICC. India are scheduled to play two tests and three one-dayers in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe are currently in Pakistan for five-match one-day series but will also play a four-day game in Karachi
