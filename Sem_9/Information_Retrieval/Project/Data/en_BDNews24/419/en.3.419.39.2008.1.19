<TITLE> Villager, grandson die in Yunnan bridge collapse </TITLE>

 Beijing, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A villager and his six-year-old grandson were killed when a section of a 150-metre bridge collapsed under their oxcart in southwest China, Xinhua news agency said late on Friday. Hastily built and poorly maintained infrastructure projects, known in Chinese as "tofu dregs" projects, are causing problems across China as they age. Fatal collapses are increasingly common following a building boom over the past two decades. In the latest accident, a 10-metre (33 feet) section of the 150-metre Sunjiamachang bridge, which spanned the Dumu reservoir in Yunnan Province, fell into the water on Wednesday while Luo Laicun's coal-laden oxcart was driving over it, Xinhua said. Another villager is still missing while a fourth was rescued, Xinhua said, citing Wang Can, an official with the Qujing county Water Resource Bureau. The bridge was built in the 1980s and had been poorly maintained, Xinhua said. Last year, 64 people were killed when a nearly completed bridge in Hunan province crumbled. It turned out no steel was used in its construction to save on costs. Nine died in a pre-dawn collapse of a bridge in the Pearl River delta, when a section fell into the swollen Xijiang river after a sand barge hit a pillar. That accident caused China to order inspections of all major bridges and other structures. Just under half of China's nearly 90,000 dams were dangerously unstable and needed repairs, the Water Resources Ministry said last week. Many of the unstable dams were built from the 1950s to the 1970s, during the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, when China mobilised its population to industrialise rapidly
