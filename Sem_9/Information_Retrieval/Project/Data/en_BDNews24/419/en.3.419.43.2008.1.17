 Seoul, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president-elect Lee Myung-bak said on Thursday his conservative government will press North Korea to drop its nuclear arms programme but realised it needed to be patient with its communist neighbour. He tempered comments during his election campaign seen as promising as hard-nosed approach to the hermit state, saying he was simply looking for open dialogue and was ready to help repair the North's broken economy. "We will continue to persuade North Korea that giving up its nuclear weapons programmes will benefit both its regime and its people," Lee told the Seoul Foreign Correspondents' Club. But he added: "We remain patient and mindful of the need to proceed carefully." Lee, a conservative former mayor of Seoul who takes office on Feb. 25, had pledged during his election campaign to link future aid to the North's behaviour, including its internationally condemned human rights abuses. "When I said that I would be discussing North Korean human rights issues ... I would not like to have this taken as some sort of a challenge to North Korea," he said. "Quite the contrary. I said those things because I believe that honest and open discussion and dialogue with the North Koreans is what is needed if we are to truly improve the human rights situation in North Korea." Lee said he also wanted to discuss the fate of missing or abducted South Koreans in the North and allow relatives to freely visit families they have not seen since the two countries were divided more than half a century ago. Pyongyang has carefully avoided any direct comment on Lee's election win on Dec. 19, which ended 10 years of liberal rule in the South and regular handouts for a country that relies on aid. But its official media on Wednesday indirectly criticised the new leader whose conservative policies it has previously attacked for adding to tensions on the Korean peninsula. Lee dismissed suggestions he was downgrading relations with plans to scrap the unification ministry that has long handled ties with the North and absorb its functions into other agencies. As relations became more complex, they needed to be dealt with across a range of government agencies rather than just one, he said. "We must prepare for an era when inter-Korean cooperation will expand." The president-elect repeated his support for international negotiations on ending the North's nuclear arms programmes in return for massive aid and better diplomatic standing. "We stand ready to implement a bold policy that seeks to increase North Korea's economic capability within a decade up to the level where per-capita (income) reaches $3,000.
