<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Supreme Court absolved the People Power Party (PPP) of vote fraud in a Dec. 23 election on Friday, clearing the way for the backer of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to form a coalition government. The court also rejected a suit seeking to annul the poll, in which PPP narrowly failed to secure an outright majority, on the grounds of irregularities in early voting. "We were confident the court would treat the People Power Party fairly," Secretary-General Surapong Suebwonglee said amid jubilation at his party headquarters. "Our next move is to announce a six-party coalition government officially tomorrow." Analysts said the court ruling was the final nail in the coffin for the political aspirations of the generals who removed Thaksin in a September 2006 coup. It had always appeared the most likely verdict, given the PPP's strong election showing. "The junta group have really run out of options other than something really disruptive," Bangkok-based political analyst and Thaksin biographer Chris Baker said. "But they have recognised that would not be a good idea. To try some type of nuclear solution at this stage would rebound on them very badly," he said. A deal had probably been agreed between Thaksin, who has announced his hope of returning to Thailand by April despite facing corruption charges, and royalist military camps not go after each other, he added. The PPP-led coalition due to be announced on Saturday looks likely to include five other small parties and command around 320 of the 480 seats in parliament. The Democrats, Thailand's oldest political party who failed to make headway despite Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party being disbanded after the coup, are slated to be the only party in opposition. Supporters of the PPP, which openly backs telecoms billionaire Thaksin, cheered at party headquarters as television stationed relayed the verdict from the court that the judges had "decided to reject all the challenges" against it. The formation of an elected government after more than two years of political crisis, punctuated by the coup, should help the stock market, which has dropped 8 percent this year, suffering along with other bourses around the world. The case against the PPP was brought by a member of the Democrat party who accused it of breaching election laws. He accused the PPP and its leader, Samak Sundaravej, of being fronts for Thai Rak Thai and its 111 party members -- Thaksin included -- banned from politics for five years in the aftermath of the coup. As the PPP stood on the brink of power, the Election Commission endorsed another 29 winning candidates, pushing the total of approved lawmakers to 460 of 480 seats. That is more than enough for the quorum required to convene parliament by Tuesday, the 30-day post-election deadli
