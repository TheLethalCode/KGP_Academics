The software is said to distinguish the emotional reaction of 14 dogs of the Hungarian Mudi breed. After analysing 6,000 barks, it aims to determine when a dog has seen a ball, when it is fighting, playing, meeting a stranger or when it wants a walk. But the scientists admit the technology only just out-performs humans. While the computer correctly recognised the emotional state of 43% of dogs, humans did almost as well with 40%. But the author of the research - Csaba Molnar, from Eotvos University in Budapest - says the software can be improved, and told the BBC it may have applications for analysis of human communication. "I would say that we proved there are very strong contextual differences between the barks, but that very long further work is needed to determine which emotional states and which characteristics belong to each (different breed). He added: "In the future we can use this software for any other vocal or any other signal categorisation." The scientist also believes that later versions of the software could help owners and dog trainers identify more about dogs' well-being. "A possible commercial application could be a device for dog-human communication," the scientist told Reuters news agen
