 Quito, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Perceptions that Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa's style of rule is too abrasive have dragged his popularity close to a record low in a sign he may have to seek wider consensus to press his leftist agenda. A Cedatos-Gallup survey released on Wednesday showed Correa's popularity had dropped 15 points over two months to 57 percent in January. His popularity hit its lowest point at 56 percent in August after high ratings earlier in his tenure. The US-trained economist, who took office a year ago, has clashed repeatedly with the media and influential coastal mayors over the government's growing control over the economy as he says he wants to better distribute income to the majority poor. On Wednesday, the navy's top official resigned after a controversy over media reports of discontent in the military due to government influence over promotions. Falling approval ratings could tame Correa's leftist policies in a country where three presidents have been toppled by popular unrest in little over a decade. "This will push him to be a lot more careful with his future reforms," said Felipe Burbano at Ecuador's branch of the Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences. "Correa is addicted to polls and he wants to maintain his popularity high as the base of his political capital." Cedatos said most respondents wanted Correa to "respect others, stop being high-handed and halt his confrontation with local mayors and the media." Correa, a former economy minister, has gained broad powers through political victories over a weakened opposition considered corrupt and inefficient by most Ecuadoreans. He is relying on an assembly controlled by his allies and in charge of rewriting the constitution to implement broad changes to the oil-producing nation's politics and finances. Correa is ineligible to seek re-election when his term ends in 2011, but the assembly is expected to change the constitution to allow him to run for consecutive terms. The survey interviewed 1,291 people in five major cities across the country from Thursday to Monday. It had a 5-point margin of error
