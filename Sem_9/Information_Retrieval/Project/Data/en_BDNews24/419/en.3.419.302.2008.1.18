 COX'S BAZAR, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 40 dead turtles, some weighing 40 kg pounds or more, have been found on Cox's Bazar beach over the past week, officials said on Thursday. At least 10 of them were found dead on Thursday. "I have seen more than a dozen carcasses of turtles, some of them were Olive Ridley turtles, scattered on the vast beach, during my recent tour," a senior ecological official in Cox's Bazar said. The turtles die mostly in winter and last year officials and fishermen reported the death of more than 200 turtles along the Cox's Bazar sea beach. No one seems to know why the sea creatures are dying. Marine officials believed the turtles died after being caught in fishing nets. But fishermen said they avoided such big turtles, as they often tear their fishing nets and other gear. Environmental experts said the deaths could be caused by increased pollution in the Bay of Bengal, from waste disposal of ships or perhaps other unknown natural causes. Bangladesh has a 120-km (75-mile) stretch of natural beach from Cox's Bazar to Teknaf, which is poorly maintained and monitored.
