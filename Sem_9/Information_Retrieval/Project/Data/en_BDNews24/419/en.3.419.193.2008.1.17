<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Thursday asked her party to take part in the national election to resist "dictators" from coming to power. Hasina made the call standing in the dock of a court set up in the Jatiya Sangsad premises. Zillur Rahman, who is standing in for her as Awami League president, was present in court. "There is no alternative to polls. [You] have to take part in the polls so that dictators cannot come to power," Hasina said. The feisty leader said she had fought dictators throughout her life. "I'm being intimidated by many ways. I lost my father, mother and brothers. I have nothing more to lose." "I have been made a thief, an extortionist. If I accept their proposal right now, they will be dancing with me up on their head," Hasina said. Hasina earlier complained to the court that she had not been allowed to see relatives in the last three months. "I have not been allowed to see my relatives in last three months. I have been allowed to talk to lawyers a few times but intelligence people recorded our conversation. They were in front of me despite my complaining several times. "I want to say drawing the attention of the court that any accused can talk to relatives and lawyers as per the Jail Code," Hasina said to the court. bdnew
