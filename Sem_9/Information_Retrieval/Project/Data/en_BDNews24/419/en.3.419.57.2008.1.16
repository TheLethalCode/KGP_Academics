 MELBOURNE, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian Maria Sharapova produced a scintillating display to end the run of comeback mum Lindsay Davenport at the Australian Open on Wednesday, hammering the 2000 champion 6-1 6-3 in the second round. In a highly-anticipated battle of the two former world number ones, fifth seed Sharapova blew Davenport away in the first set and held off the American in the second to take her place in the last 32. "To tell the truth, I treated it like a final," Sharapova said in a courtside interview. "From the day I found out that I might play her I started working towards her game. I wanted my coach to hit the balls as hard as he can because she is one of the biggest hitters out there." Davenport had won 19 of her 20 matches since returning to the tour last September after a year off, but she was outclassed in the first set as the Russian wrong-footed and out-manoeuvred her at will. The American lifted her game in the second set but Sharapova broke twice, in the seventh and ninth games to progress to a clash with compatriot Elena Vesnina. Sharapova paid tribute to Davenport for coming back to the tour so soon, and with such success. "She was out for a year and she looks incredible," she said. "I thought I saw her little baby over there and thought he was giving me dirty looks.
