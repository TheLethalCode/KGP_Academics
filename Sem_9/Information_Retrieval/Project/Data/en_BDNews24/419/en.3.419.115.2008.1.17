<TITLE> Africa's migrants need help to stay home: IOM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALGIERS, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sub-Saharan Africans deported in a Libyan drive against illegal migrants will probably try to return unless their home countries can be helped to offer them jobs and reintegration, a relief official said on Thursday. The north African country says it has started deporting illegal immigrants, a community of up to 2 million people, mostly from poor African states who are trying to reach Europe. Tripoli is under pressure at home to tackle the problem of illegal immigrants whom officials and locals blame for spreading insecurity and taking jobs from unemployed Libyan youths. Laurence Hart, chief of mission in Libya of the International Organisation for Migration, said the effort was unlikely to provide a lasting solution to the problem and it was just the latest in a series of similar initiatives in the past. "The number of migrants in the country is an urgent and concerning situation for the Libyan authorities, and announcing these kinds of measures is nothing new. But how effective it's going to be remains to be seen," he told Reuters by telephone. Asked whether those expelled would probably return, Hart said: "Indeed. The fact that there's a pull factor -- the possibility of being employed -- means people who have returned home will make a second or third attempt (to go to Libya) as they have no options and no reintegration schemes at home." Hart said the IOM, which works to help ensure the orderly and humane management of migration, ran a programme that had helped 1,500 migrants in Libya settle back voluntarily in their home countries by giving them opportunities to work. CONCERTED EFFORT "These people have not returned -- the majority have succeeded in their reintegration. This needs to be sustained," he said of the project, which is funding by the Italian government and the European Union. "Europe should play an important role. The problem is so big that there is a need for concerted effort," he said. Hart said it was estimated that Libya deported 40,000 migrants in 2004, just under 60,000 in 2005 and more than 60,000 in 2006. "You can see an increase in return operations, which to a certain extent reflects more control over the territory in terms of governmental action, but the question remains -- is this a sustainable measure?" "The number continues to remain extremely high. Probably it is time to think about more sustainable action in terms of migration management." In the 1990s, Libya welcomed migrants from other African countries as it sought to draw cheap labour to help repair an economy suffering under economic sanctions. In recent years, it changed its policy under pressure from European governments alarmed at Libya's growing role as a jumping-off point for Africans seeking a better life in Europe. Sub-Saharan Africans usually walk into Libya in the cool of the winter across the Saharan border and work for a couple of years to build up cash to pay for a crossing to Europe. Some have menial jobs such as washing cars, while many work in construction, a sector booming because of a multibillion dollar programme of public works fuelled by large oil revenues. Established in 1951, IOM says it is the leading inter-governmental body on migration and works closely with governmental, intergovernmental and non-governmental partners.
