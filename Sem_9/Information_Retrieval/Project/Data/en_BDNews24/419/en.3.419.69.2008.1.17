 Dhaka, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers belonging to 'blue' and 'pink' groups Wednesday adopted new protest plans to free detained teachers and students. The groups represent the teachers who are linked with the Awami League and the Left-leaning parties. At a meeting of Dhaka University Teachers Association, the teachers Wednesday evening set a five-point demand, including the stalling of enrolment tests for two faculties for 2007-08. But the association leaders, belonging to the 'white' group representing the BNP and the Jamaat-e-Islami, did not join the meeting. A total of 63 teachers attended the evening meeting. 'Blue' panel leader Mohammad Samad said two detained students were sick but they were not being treated. DUTA acting president Professor Tajmeri SA Islam said she did not own up to Wednesday's meeting and its decisions. The new protest plans include raising black flags on the university campus, wearing black badges until the teachers are freed. bdnews24.com
