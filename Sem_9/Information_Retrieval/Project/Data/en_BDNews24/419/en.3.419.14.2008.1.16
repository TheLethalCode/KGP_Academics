 BEIJING, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale hit a sparsely populated area in Tibet on Wednesday, Xinhua reported. No casualties were reported from the tremor which follows an even stronger quake that struck the same region earlier this month, said the agency. The area near the epicentre has a population of about 1,000 to 2,000. Tibet is one of the most earthquake-prone areas in China.
