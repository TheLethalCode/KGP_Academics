 Rajshahi, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  A group of Rajshahi University sent an open letter to the education adviser Friday demanding the release of 10 students and a university employee detained in connection with campus unrest in August 2007. The students wrote the letter as part of a peaceful non-cooperation movement that started on Jan 16 and also announced a mass student rally Saturday. In the open letter to the adviser, the students wrote that university is a place for creativity and the practice of free knowledge. The letter said the student protest at Dhaka University in August last year was a spontaneous incident but the government saw it as a confrontation with the army. The students wrote that though the government had promised release of detained DU teachers and students in an honourable manner at the end of the legal process, it had not said anything on the release of the detained RU teachers and students. Rajshahi University officials have further filed an "ill-motivated" case against "unidentified" students, the letter claimed. The RU students expressed solidarity with DU students who are continuing movement for the release of their detained peers and teachers. The letter also invited the education adviser to participate in an open discussion and mass dialogue titled "Independence, solidarity, creativity and university", to be held at RU's Momtazuddin Arts Building at 3:30pm on Jan 20. The students mentioned that class boycotts had taken place at the university and black flags had been hoisted on buildings within the RU campus. Students' involvement in black flag processions is increasing by the day, they said. bdnews24.c
