 Hong Kong, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tokyo shares rose more than 1 percent on Thursday, bouncing back from two-year lows as a firmer dollar helped ease exporters' fears about a potential recession in the United States, the region's top overseas market. Investors were lured by sectors seen as oversold after the MSCI measure of Asia Pacific stocks beyond Japan had dropped 8.6 percent this year as of Wednesday's close. Commodities continued their sharp declines into a second session on worries a U.S.-led slowdown in the global economy would dent demand, with gold backing further away from a record hit on Monday. But there's still plenty of room for caution, according to analysts, with Merrill Lynch expected to announce a sizeable writedown with its quarterly earnings later in the day. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is set to testify before the US Congress as well, amid unanimous expectations for a half percentage point cut in US interest rates at the end of the month. "We need more time to see the market on a firm recovery path," said Zenshiro Mizuno, senior managing director at Maruasan Securities in Japan. Tokyo's Nikkei index was up 1.1 percent by 0242 GMT, and the MSCI index of markets elsewhere in Asia rose 0.6 percent, after slumping nearly 7 percent over the previous five days. The index on Wednesday hit its lowest in four months, amid deepening concerns about a US recession. The broad gains were led by exporters after the dollar rose against the euro which dropped sharply on Wednesday on concerns the US economic weakness was spreading to Europe. The yen retreated after hitting a 2- year high against the dollar on Wednesday, while South Korea's won hit its weakest against the US currency in almost a month. Among Asian exporters, Honda Motor and South Korea's Samsung Electronics both advanced more than 3 percent as a firmer dollar helps improve their returns from export markets. But Chinese stocks fell 1.2 percent after the country announced on Wednesday it would raise bank reserve requirements, extending a long-running campaign to mop up excess cash in the banking system. WHAT GOES UP... Gold continued its retreat on Thursday as part of a broad commodity sell-off seen a day earlier when funds liquidated positions to cover margin calls following a surge in prices this year as investors sought a safe haven from plunging stocks. Spot gold was trading around $881 an ounce, moving further away from a record $914 hit on Monday. Oil prices edged higher after plunging on Wednesday when prices were hit by a sharp increase in US inventories and concerns about slowing US demand. US crude was up 11 cents at $90.95 a barrel in Asia trade, after falling at one point on Wednesday to its lowest since Dec. 18. Japanese government bonds (JGBs) fell, with futures pulling back from a two-year high as stocks showed signs of recovering. JGBs have jumped recently as the darkening economic outlook in both the United States and Japan prompted market players to wonder whether the Bank of Japan would cut interest rates this year rather than raise them. The benchmark 10-year yield climbed 1.5 basis points to 1.395 percent after touching a 28-month low of 1.380 percent the previous day
