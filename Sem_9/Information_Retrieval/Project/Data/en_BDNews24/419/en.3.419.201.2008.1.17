<TITLE> India in strong position to win test, says Kumble </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India skipper Anil Kumble said his team were in a great position to beat Australia in the third test after dominating the second day at the WACA on Thursday. The tourists reached stumps in a commanding position, holding an overall lead of 170 runs with nine wickets in hand after their bowlers ripped through the Australian batting lineup. Australia could only manage 212 in their first innings after struggling to cope with India's seamers, who bowled superbly on a baking hot day. Kumble said India needed to continue playing positively to drive home their advantage. "I think it is important we play good cricket, we have done that in the last two days," he told a news conference. "It is important to take that forward, take the momentum and ensure that we have a good day tomorrow. "If we do that tomorrow then obviously have a great chance to win this test match." Kumble said he was especially proud of the way his young seamers, Rudra Pratap Singh, Irfan Pathan and Ishant Sharma, all fought back after the Indians made a slow start to the day, losing their last four wickets in just 17 deliveries. "RP and Irfan started off and picked up those three wickets and that changed the momentum in our favour. We had a pretty good day," Kumble said. Australia vice-captain Adam Gilchrist admitted his team had been outplayed for most of the day but said it was too early to make any bold predictions about the result. "We didn't play well. We started the day well and then we just handed it back to them," Gilchrist said. "There's a long way to go in the game so we're not thinking ahead to what may or may not happen. We've just got some wickets to take and start again well tomorrow." Gilchrist, one of eight Australian batsmen who fell to catches behind the stumps, said the Indian seamers had troubled all the players with swing and movement off the pitch. "A swinging ball anywhere in the world definitely gives you something extra to contend with and they definitely did that well," Gilchrist said. "They bowled very well. It was just of those days where it felt like we nicked everything and they played and missed everything. They've done well, they've dominated.
