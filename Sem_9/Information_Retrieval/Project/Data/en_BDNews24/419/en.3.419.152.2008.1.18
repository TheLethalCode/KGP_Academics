<TITLE> Nadal banking on better advice </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If you are going to offer advice to Rafael Nadal, you had better make sure it is good. The Spaniard took tips from David Ferrer, his fifth-seeded compatriot and fellow PlayStation addict, before facing Gilles Simon in the Australian Open third round on Friday and promptly found himself 5-2 down in the first set. "I thought he would start a little bit more slowly," Nadal told reporters. "With the ball not very high to his forehand, he will miss a little bit. "But really he didn't miss. He played forehand return winners, so...thank you David Ferrer, because he gave me this tactic. He said that to me before the match." The second seed had to dig deep to fend off the Frenchman 7-5 6-2 6-3, and he had to save six set points in the opener before eventually wearing down his opponent. "Normally, I start very hard," Nadal said. "And today, well, I really don't know. I started the match without very good tactics. "I started the match watching (Simon), not worrying about me, trying to play my game, trying to play aggressive with my forehand. "I knew I had to change. I had to try to start playing with my forehand, trying to have the control of the point with my forehand, move Gilles. When I had that, the match changed a lot. "So that's what I have to do, not watch what's going on on the other side." Nadal will play another Frenchman, 23rd seed Paul-Henri Mathieu, in the fourth round
