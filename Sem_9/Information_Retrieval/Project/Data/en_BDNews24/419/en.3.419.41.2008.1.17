 St. Mary`s City, Maryland, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The CIA's harsh questioning of terrorism suspects was legal and saved lives, the US national intelligence director said on Wednesday, as Congress questioned a CIA lawyer about the agency's destruction of interrogation videotapes. "It has saved lives. And so from my point of view, we've accomplished the mission within the bounds of US law," the director, Michael McConnell, told students at St. Mary's College in Maryland. The CIA's disclosure last month it destroyed hundreds of hours of videotapes depicting harsh interrogations, believed to have included a simulated form of drowning called waterboarding, cast US treatment of terrorism suspects under the spotlight and drew criticism from human rights groups. Waterboarding has been condemned internationally as a form of illegal torture, and McConnell was quoted in the current issue of The New Yorker magazine as saying he would consider the practice torture if it were applied to him. "The United States does not engage in torture. We do use enhanced interrogation techniques," McConnell said. "There are Americans today that are alive, that are living and breathing because of those interrogation techniques." While McConnell spoke, the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee met behind closed doors to question CIA attorney John Rizzo, who is reported to have been involved in the decision to destroy the tapes. The recordings depicted the interrogations of two suspected al Qaeda members in 2002, and the tapes were destroyed in 2005. The committee had also subpoenaed Jose Rodriguez, the former head of the CIA's clandestine branch who is believed to have made the decision to destroy the tapes. But the panel decided against calling him to testify after his attorney indicated Rodriguez would not answer questions, a House aide said. He remains under subpoena and may be called in the future to testify. Rep. Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, the committee's ranking Republican, told reporters after the hearing with Rizzo, "We need to get Jose Rodriguez in here to testify." "Jose was responsible for this -- or it appears that most press reports and other reports indicate that Jose was responsible for this decision to destroy the tapes," Hoekstra said. The Washington Post reported that CIA lawyers and officials told Rodriguez he had the legal right to order the destruction. Hoekstra and Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes, a Texas Democrat, said Rizzo was a cooperative witness. They did not disclose specifics. Reyes said in a statement: "We will be identifying additional officials to talk to in the coming days and weeks. I urge members of the executive branch to cooperate with this investigation and let the truth be told." The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation, and sought to discourage congressional probes, fearing they could undermine its efforts. Human rights activists and some intelligence analysts and congressional critics have questioned the validity of information gained under harsh interrogations and called for a ban on waterboarding. McConnell said it was important to keep suspects guessing about the techniques they would f
