 Asuncion, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Several thousand Paraguayans held a protest rally in the country's capital on Friday night, charging electoral fraud in the primary to pick the ruling party's candidate for the April 20 presidential election. The Colorado Party, which has governed for more than 60 years, is split after the primary vote last month ended in a virtual tie. Former Vice President Luis Castiglioni organized the rally after accusing electoral judges of swinging the vote in favor of his rival, Blanca Ovelar. The poor, landlocked South American country has a long history of corrupt politics, and leading opposition candidate Fernando Lugo -- a former Roman Catholic bishop -- endorsed the protest but did not participate in the rally. Castiglioni accused the government of tampering with polling station documents in 11 of the country's 17 provinces. "They can falsify the voting documents but when we govern, things are going to change," the 45-year-old civil engineer and businessman said. While he spoke, a small plane flying overhead dumped pro-Ovelar pamphlets, riling the protesters who were shouting, "Stop the fraud!" Ovelar was shown edging out Castiglioni in preliminary results and throughout much of the recount, but the former vice president insists he won the contest. Final results from the center-right Colorado Party's primaries are due to be announced on Monday, after a month of recounts and delays. "I'm the candidate that received the most votes in the history of the Colorado Party's primaries ... our victory is irreversible," Ovelar said in a recorded message, aired on television on Friday. A former education minister, Ovelar, 50, would become the country's first female president if she won the party's nomination and the presidential election. She is backed by President Nicanor Duarte. Castiglioni served under Duarte but resigned to launch his candidacy, without the president's support. "I can't help but feel sad tonight when I see the person who was my running mate ... now talking about conspiracies," Duarte said. Other presidential candidates include Lugo, retired army Gen. Lino Oviedo and businessman Pedro Fadul
