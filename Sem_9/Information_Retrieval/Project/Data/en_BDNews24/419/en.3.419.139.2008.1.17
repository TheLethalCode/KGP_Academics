<TITLE> Putin hopes for improved ties with Georgia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Moscow, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signalled on Wednesday that Russia was ready to improve ties with Georgia and congratulated Georgian counterpart Mikhail Saakashvili for winning a presidential election. "I would like to hope for a constructive development of relations between our countries in the upcoming period," Putin said in a message to Saakashvili published by the Kremlin, congratulating him on his re-election. Russia's Foreign Ministry said earlier that Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov would head Moscow's delegation at Saakashvili's inauguration set for Jan. 20. Ties between Russia and ex-Soviet Georgia have plunged to an all-time low since a 2006 diplomatic row when Georgia arrested several Russian officers and charged them with espionage. In response, Putin accused Georgia of state terrorism and hostage-taking. Moscow cut trade and transport links with Tbilisi in 2006, while Georgia accused it of backing its two rebel regions and dropping missiles on its territory. Saakashvili rose to power in a peaceful 2003 revolution and has since steered Georgia towards NATO and the West, irking former imperial master Russia. He called the snap election in November after ordering police to crush street protests. He won the Jan. 5 election, which the opposition says was rigged in his favour
