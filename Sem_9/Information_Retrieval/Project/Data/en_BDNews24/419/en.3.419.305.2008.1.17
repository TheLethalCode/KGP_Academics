 Bangkok, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's People Power Party, which backs ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and won the most seats in a Dec. 23 general election, said on Thursday it would unveil a six-party coalition government this weekend. PPP Secretary-General Surapong Suebwonglee also said he was confident the party would survive a lawsuit filed to the Supreme Court by the rival Democrat party, calling for the PPP to be disbanded for poll irregularities and acting as a Thaksin proxy. The court will deliver its ruling around 0900 GMT on Friday. "We strongly believe the statements we have given the court will win us a fair treatment," Surapong told Reuters. A Democrat candidate accused the PPP of being a front for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party, which was dissolved for electoral fraud after a September 2006 coup. Thaksin and 110 other leading members were also barred from politics for five years but were being re-elected by proxy in violation of the essence of the electoral laws, the plaintiff argued. The verdict, if it goes against the PPP, could deepen a political crisis that began two years ago with mass street protests against billionaire telecoms tycoon Thaksin, and snowballed nine months later into a military coup. But Surapong remained unperturbed, saying the PPP would make a formal announcement on Sunday of a six-party coalition commanding around 320 of 480 seats in parliament, leaving only the Democrats on the opposition benches. The Chart Thai (Thai Nation) party, one of the larger middle ground parties, was due to hold a news conference late on Thursday, at which it was expected to announce that it had joined the coalition. A week after the polls, the PPP announced a four-party coalition giving it only a very slim majority, and forcing it to continue to court Chart Thai and its ally, Pue Pandin. But the death of the king's elder sister on Jan. 2, followed by two weeks' mourning, put negotiations on ice. Surapong said negotiations for cabinet portfolios would take place next week, with the PPP claiming the ministries of finance, transport, tourism, defence, justice and interior. He denied speculation in the Thai media about the identity of individual ministers, but insisted firebrand party leader Samak Sundaravej would become prime minister despite his barely concealed hatred of the king's top adviser, Prem Tinsulanonda. "I can assure you that it will be Mr. Samak, not me," Surapong said. Thai newspapers have speculated that Surapong would be a ideal compromise candidate more acceptable to the army and royalist establishment thought to have been behind the 2006 coup
