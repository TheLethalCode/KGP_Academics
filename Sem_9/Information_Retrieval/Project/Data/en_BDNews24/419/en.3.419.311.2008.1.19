<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)An unelected government cannot resolve the present economic troubles, Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan said Saturday. Speaking at a Discussion on the state of the economy and the way forward , the RRC chairman requested that elections be held as soon as possible so that the new government may take up the responsibilities of running the nation. "The price of rice had remained affordable for people over the past 15 years, during which the nation was run by elected governments, but now that has become a thing of the past," Akbar Ali said. "The current economic condition of the nation is a very sensitive one and is verging on a crisis." "To tackle this situation and to run the state the government must take into consideration the views of the different political parties and the citizens of the country," the RRC head said. "The nation cannot be run just by the orders of the higher powers." Requesting a speedy election, Akbar Ali said that the only roadblock in the election roadmap was the time being taken to prepare a legal and correct voter list. "The elections must be held within 90 days after the completion of the voter list," he added. Mentioning that the caretaker government had already submitted one annual budget, Akbar said: "If this unelected government prepares another budget, then the country will be facing more problems." He stressed that the voter list must therefore be prepared as quickly as possible in order to hold national elections by the end of June. Akbar Ali was speaking Saturday as chief guest at the discussion programme held at Hotel Sonargaon in the capital. Bangladesh Economic Association president Kazi Kholikuzzaman presented the main topic of the discussion, which was chaired by Dr Kamal Hossain. bdnews24.co
