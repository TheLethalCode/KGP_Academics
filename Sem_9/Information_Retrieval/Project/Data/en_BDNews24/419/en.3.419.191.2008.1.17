<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka-Kolkata trains are likely to start rolling in three months, said communications adviser Ghulam Quader Thursday after a meeting with the Indian high commissioner. Updates with changes "We have sent copies of the agreement to India. The proposed train service will start operating after the Indian government officially endorses and seals the agreement," said Quader, after a meeting with Pinak Ranjan Chakravarti, the Indian envoy. "The agreement we've forwarded does not include security fencing, an issue India proposed. We may have to discuss the issue again," said Quader. The adviser said a compromise had been struck on scheduling, with both countries agreeing on three or four rides a week. "Once the service is up and running, people from Bangladesh and India will benefit socially, culturally and economically. It will also promote tourism," said Quader. The train service was originally scheduled to start during Ramadan last year when two trains linked Dhaka and Kolkata on a trial run. bdnews24.com/
