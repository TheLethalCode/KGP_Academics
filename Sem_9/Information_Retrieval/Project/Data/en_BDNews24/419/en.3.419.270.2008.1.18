<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)The National Coordination Committee (NCC) on Serious Crime and Corruption has investigated 455 cases against 197 people, the committee's chief said Thursday. The Anticorruption Commission, National Board of Revenue and police submitted chargesheets in the cases. Home adviser MA Matin, also chairman of the NCC, said: "I think we will be able to complete the proceedings of the cases during the rule of the caretaker government. Most cases are on trial or nearing investigations." Asked to comment on whether the cases would be deadlocked with the end of emergency rule, the adviser said: "With or without the sate of emergency, the guilty should be punished. We would urge the next government to carry on with the cases. We may amend rules if necessary." He said the committee would not work on any new list as 70 anticorruption taskforces were already overburdened with too many cases. "But we would certainly deal with any new serious case if necessary," Matin said. Matin faced questions on why some accused people had been put in detention even after they were granted bail by the High Court. "The accused are facing multiple cases. If an accused person is granted bail in one case, he is shown arrested in another. But I don't know if they were arrested without any charge." bd
