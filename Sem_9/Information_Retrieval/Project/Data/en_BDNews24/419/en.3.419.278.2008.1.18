 LONDON, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cinema-goers in the UK and Republic of Ireland spent 904 million pounds at the box office in 2007, up eight percent from the previous year, official figures showed.

But film production spending in the UK fell last year to 723 million pounds from 855 million. Woodward said the weak dollar had been a factor in the slide and warned that conditions in 2008 would be tough.
