<TITLE> Romney seeks win in Nevada in US White House race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Las Vegas, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Presidential candidate Mitt Romney opened a big poll lead on Friday in Nevada's lightly contested Republican nominating race, where support from the state's large Mormon community could be pivotal. Romney, a multimillionaire who would be the first Mormon US president, leads Arizona Sen. John McCain, by 15 percentage points before Nevada's caucus on Saturday, according to a Las Vegas Review-Journal poll that had a 4.5-point margin of error. While McCain and other Republican candidates are campaigning hard in South Carolina in the state-by-state battle to become the party's presidential nominee for the November election, Romney opted to focus on Nevada. The only other Republican contender campaigning in Nevada is long-shot candidate Ron Paul, a Texas congressman. Trailing in fourth place in South Carolina, Romney held rallies in Reno and the remote gold mining town of Elko vowing to protect jobs -- a reprise of the economic theme that helped him win in his home state of Michigan this week. Hours after President George W. Bush urged Congress to help stimulate the flagging economy by enacting temporary tax cuts and other measures estimated to cost up to $150 billion, Romney weighed in with a call for a package of tax breaks expected to cost $250 billion. The former Massachusetts governor's package centered on several permanent tax cuts, unlike the temporary rebates and spending programs favored by others in Washington and on the campaign trail. He proposed permanently reducing the rate for the lowest income bracket to 7.5 percent from 10 percent, retroactive to 2007 and permanently reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent over two years. In addition, Romney he proposed eliminating payroll taxes on the Social Security retirement fund for workers over 65 and scrapping capital gains and dividend taxes on households earning under $200,000 a year. "TONIGHT SHOW" APPEARANCE Romney was due to fly to California for a taped appearance on NBC's "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno late Friday, before returning to Nevada, where some 30,000 to 40,000 voters are expected to turn out for Saturday's caucuses. "I figure it's the only way I can be in South Carolina and Nevada at the same time," Romney joked when asked about his appearance on the national television show. While Romney's Mormon faith hurts him strong evangelical Christian states like South Carolina -- he finished second in Iowa to Mike Huckabee, a former Baptist preacher -- his religion could give him an edge in Nevada, which Mormons settled in the early 1850s. About 170,000 people in Nevada, or 6.8 percent of its population, are members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the formal name of the religion headquartered in neighboring Utah. "That voting bloc has turned out strong traditionally for Mormon candidates," said Zachary Moyle, executive director of Nevada's Republican Party. Boyd Peterson, director of the Mormon studies program at Utah State University, said many Mormons see Nevada's contest as a historic opportunity. "There's a sense of 'he's our boy.' There's a chance to finally be accepted and part of the mainstream, part of the national debate," he said. Political analysts say even if Romney prevails in Nevada's caucuses, which are gatherings of voters rather than secret ballots cast in voting booths, a win is unlikely to shake up the most wide open Republican presidential race in decades
