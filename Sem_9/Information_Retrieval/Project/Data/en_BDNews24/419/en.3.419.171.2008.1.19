 Washington, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush has named the head of US Army forces in Europe, Gen. David McKiernan, as the new leader of foreign forces in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said on Friday. McKiernan will head the 42,000-member NATO-led International Security Assistance Force. ISAF is responsible for fighting insurgents, training Afghan troops and reconstruction in northern and eastern Afghanistan. Secretary of Defense Robert M Gates on Tuesday ordered an additional 3,200 US Marines to Afghanistan, including 1,000 who will conduct training with ISAF. With the new Marine deployments in March and April, the United States will have around 30,000 troops in Afghanistan, about half in ISAF and the rest conducting missions ranging from counter-terrorism to training Afghan soldiers
