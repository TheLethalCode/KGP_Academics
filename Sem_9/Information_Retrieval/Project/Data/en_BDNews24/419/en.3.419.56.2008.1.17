 STRASBOURG, France, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Parliament said on Thursday the bloc should freeze budgetary aid to Kenya until the crisis over President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election is solved. The European Parliament "asks for the freezing of all further budgetary support to the government of Kenya until a political resolution to the present crisis has been found", the deputies said in a resolution.

A further 383 million euros of EU aid to Kenya is planned for 2008-20
