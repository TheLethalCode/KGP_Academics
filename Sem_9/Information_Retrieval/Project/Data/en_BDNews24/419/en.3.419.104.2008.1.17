 PERTH, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India captured three quick wickets to rip through the Australian top-order after their own batting had collapsed on a dramatic start to the second day of the third test on Thursday. Irfan Pathan dismissed Chris Rogers and Phil Jaques in the same over then Rudra Pratap Singh removed dangerman Mike Hussey for a duck to reduce the Australians to 22 for three at lunch. India's triple-strike gave the tourists renewed hope of keeping the series alive after they lost the first two matches and boosted their chances of ending Australia's push for a world record 17th straight win. Australia's pacemen had mopped up the last four Indian wickets for just two runs to dismiss the tourists for 330 on a baking hot day at the WACA. Mitchell Johnson and Stuart Clark captured two wickets each as the batsmen tumbled from just 17 deliveries in 20 minutes. India had made a bright start after resuming on 297-6, taking the score along to 328 without any losses inside the first hour when the session suddenly burst to life. Clark triggered the collapse when he trapped Mahendra Singh Dhoni lbw for 19 with a ball that straightened up and hit above the knee roll. Johnson then dismissed Pathan for 28 when he struck him on the pads with a full toss in the next over then Clark removed Anil Kumble for one off the next ball, caught at point by debutant Chris Rogers. Johnson finished off the innings when he dismissed RP Singh for a duck, caught in the gully by Hussey, giving the Australians their tun at the crease. Rogers, making his debut after Matthew Hayden succumbed to a hamstring, was trapped lbw by Pathan for four, then his fellow opener Jaques departed two balls later, caught at second slip by Vangipurappu Laxman for eight. Hussey registered his first duck in test cricket when he edged RP Singh to wicketkeeper Dhoni, leaving Ricky Ponting (six not out) and Michael Clarke (four not out) to survive to lunch
