<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Port Authority has decided to lease equipment necessary to load and unload goods at the country's prime port. CPA chairman M Faruque told bdnews24.com that a decision had been taken to lease machinery for the port through private companies. The CPA will float tenders for reconditioned equipment on the basis of 'supply, operation and maintenance.' Faruque said the different port sectors were in desperate need of specialised equipment. It takes about one year, from decision making to supply, to obtain the machinery, he said. "The lengthy process has stood as an obstacle in procuring machinery to meet the ever increasing demand." "So a process has been initiated to float tender for obtaining machinery through local and foreign joint investment ventures." He said there was no rule that allowed the government to buy used machinery. "For this reason, steps are being taken to hire reconditioned machinery to immediately resolve the crisis," the CPA chairman said. Faruque added they would initially sign agreements with private firms for six months to a maximum of one year. Other port officials have said the rate of container handling at the port had increased in recent years, but equipment had not kept pace. Only two straddle carriers and two gantry cranes have been added to the port's machinery over the last two years, they said. "At least 30 straddle carriers are required to meet the present demand of the port," director of the port's mechanical division MK Bakhtiar said. "And when the Port Park Container Yardnow under constructionis put into service next June, the minimum requirement will be 50 straddle carriers," he added. "At present there are only 19 straddle carriers in the port," Bakhtiar said, adding the process had been initiated to hire eight reconditioned carrier. Port officials said apart from straddle carriers, rubber tire gantry cranes, fork lifts of different capacities and various other equipment used for handling containers at the port were also in short supply, affecting the efficiency of the port. Bakhtiar said besides straddle carriers, there were plans to hire in phases various machinery including fork lifts and cranes. "If these steps are implemented the dynamism and efficiency of the port will greatly increase," he said. bdnews24.com/rar/
