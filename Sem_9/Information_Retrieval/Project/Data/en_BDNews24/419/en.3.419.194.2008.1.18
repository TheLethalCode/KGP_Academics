 MELBOURNE, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plucky Casey Dellacqua captivated Melbourne Park on Friday night, filling local hearts with pride by downing former world number one and 2006 champion Amelie Mauresmo to reach the Australian Open's last 16. After a day session which had proved fertile for the seeds -- Justine Henin, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal all winning -- the world number 78 turned the rankings on their heads and provided a shock which reverberated throughout the stadium. "It's just an absolutely wonderful feeling," a tearful Dellacqua sobbed after her 3-6 6-4 6-4 victory as a packed centre court crowd whistled and cheered. "I am shaking so much, I am so excited." The 22-year-old Australian provided much-needed excitement on a day when the form book had ruled. Giant-killers have been in short supply at the year's first grand slam and so it continued as day five opened with champion Serena and top seed Henin slicing through to the fourth round. They were joined by fifth seed Maria Sharapova, number three Jelena Jankovic, men's second seed Nadal and number four Nikolay Davydenko on a bad day for the bookmakers. NO CONFIDENCE With the tournament free-wheeling along smoothly, few expected Dellacqua to jam such a stick in the spokes. But she upended her French opponent with free hitting and brave counter attacking. Having only won one grand slam match before this year, she next plays third seed Jelena Jankovic. "I have nothing to lose, I'm just going to go for it," Dellacqua grinned. Mauresmo, seeded 18th after a spell of injuries, acknowledged that her lack of confidence had proved a factor. "Confidence and really not keeping in mind the aggression that I should have (had)," she mulled. "Great beginning of the match, but then struggle. Some ups and downs throughout the second and third sets." Henin advanced by beating tricky Italian Francesca Schiavone 7-5 6-4. "Francesca is always a tough player, tough opponent, and I knew that," the top seed told reporters. "I knew it was going to be a good fight." Henin, who has now won 31 consecutive matches since losing in last year's Wimbledon semi-finals to Marion Bartoli, meets Hsieh Su-wei for a place in the quarters after the Taiwanese player ousted France's Aravane Rezai. NAGGING INJURIES Williams eased through with a routine 6-3 6-4 win over Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and next up for her is 12th-seeded Czech Nicole Vaidisova who knocked out Japan's Ai Sugiyama. Jankovic shrugged off fatigue and nagging injuries to beat Virginie Razzano 6-2 4-6 6-1 and Sharapova swatted aside identikit opponent Elena Vesnina 6-3 6-0. Nadal shrugged off a slow start to overwhelm Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-5 6-2 6-3. The Spaniard trailed 5-2 in the first set to an inspired Simon, who wasted six set points, but he dug deep to win it and ran away with the match to line up a meeting with 23rd seed Paul-Henri Mathieu of France
