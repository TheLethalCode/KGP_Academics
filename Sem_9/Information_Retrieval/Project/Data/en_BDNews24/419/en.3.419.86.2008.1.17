<TITLE> Bone breaks in England double estimates: study </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bone fracture rates in England are more than double previous estimates, according to research published on Thursday that could help health officials better manage the rising cost of dealing with fractures. The annual bone fracture rate fell just short of 4 percent of the population in England, researchers wrote in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. "This study demonstrates that the overall incidence of fractures is likely to be higher than previously thought and reaffirms that the burden placed on health and social services is likely to be important," Liam Donaldson of Britain's Department of Health and colleagues wrote. The researchers said a likely reason for the discrepancy was that previous studies relied solely on information from hospitals and emergency rooms while their findings stemmed from a sample of more than 55,000 people. The most common fractures were of the hands and feet, followed by the leg, arm bones and the trunk. Half of middle-aged men and 40 percent of elderly women said they had sustained a break, the researchers found. Head and skull fractures were rare. The researchers also found variations across age and racial groups with whites far more likely to have a fracture during their lifetime than blacks or other ethnic minorities. The findings are important because fractures impose a heavy burden on healthcare systems, hip fractures alone costing Britain an estimated 726 million pounds ($1.42 billion)
