 Canbera, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-whaling campaigners vowed more confrontations with Japan's whaling fleet near Antarctica, after two activists were released on Friday from detention aboard a whale hunter where they had staged a two-day hunger strike. Whaling was resuming after a halt called on Tuesday, when the pair, from the militant Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, were detained after jumping aboard the whaler from an inflatable boat in the frigid waters of the Southern Ocean. Australian Benjamin Potts and Briton Giles Lane were picked up by an Australian patrol ship from the Yushin Maru No.2 in the Southern Ocean early on Friday and were greeted back aboard their protest vessel, Steve Irwin, as heroes. "They've been on a hunger strike since they were taken," Sea Shepherd spokesman Jonny Vasic told Reuters. "It was well worth the cost of saving whales." The pair were briefly tied up after boarding the vessel. "They intended to throw me overboard," Potts told local radio from the Steve Irwin on Friday. "Two guys picked me up by the shoulders, and the gunner, the guy that shoots the whales, picked my legs up and they attempted to tip me over." Japanese officials have denied that the pair were roughed up. Each side accused the other of behaving like terrorists and Australia's government offered on Thursday to act as a neutral intermediary and pick the two men up in a fisheries patrol ship sent to the area to monitor the Japanese whaling fleet. A spokesman for the Japanese whalers, Glenn Inwood, said the Yushin Maru was headed back to the rest of the six-ship Japanese fleet to resume whaling until the end of the season in February. FUEL RESERVES Whaling was halted during the standoff because a second protest ship operated by Greenpeace was still in pursuit of the fleet and Japan wanted to burn protest boat fuel reserves. The Japanese fleet has its own tanker and supply ship. "Eventually they will run out of fuel and both Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd will have to return to Melbourne. That's probably the safest option for everyone as Japan can resume the programme in safety," Inwood told Reuters. Measures to protect the fleet, he said, would include the high-pressure hoses that were used against Lane and Potts, as well as against Greenpeace inflatable boats that attempted to place themselves between harpoon gunners and whales. Australian Home Affairs Minister Bob Debus urged Sea Shepherd skipper Paul Watson, who last year threatened to ram the whaling flagship, to moderate his hardline tactics. "The Australian government repeats its call for calm and for all sides to respect the paramount importance of safety at sea," Debus told Reuters. "Whatever should happen, those on board should respect the laws of conduct at sea." But Vasic said there was no need to change tactics, despite the chance of another Southern Ocean confrontation and an Australian police investigation. "We're going to continue to defend the whales. I'm not sure why we would moderate our tactics, because we haven't done anything out of the ordinary," Vasic said. "To us, the people who need to moderate their tactics are the Japanese whalers." Australia's patrol ship, Oceanic Viking, is seeking to gather photo and video evidence for an international legal challenge against whaling that Tokyo says is scientific and thus legal. Japan plans to hunt almost 1,000 minke and fin whales for research over the Antarctic summer, but has abandoned the cull of 50 humpback whales after international condemnation and a formal diplomatic protest by 31 nations. Despite a moratorium on whaling, Japan is allowed an annual "scientific" hunt, arguing whaling is a cherished cultural tradition and the hunt is necessary to study whales. Its fleet has killed 7,000 Antarctic minkes over the past 20 years.
