<TITLE> Bangladesh to redraw border with Myanmar, India </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will redraw borders with Myanmar and India. An inter-ministerial meeting at the foreign ministry with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in the chair Thursday made the decision. "We will send a delegation, headed by an additional secretary to the foreign ministry, to Myanmar in February for holding talks on demarcation of borders between the two countries," Iftekhar told reporters after the meeting. He said the government would also take measures to demarcate border with India too. "We need to demarcate border with our neighbours as we are scheduled to submit a report on Bangladesh to the United Nations in 2011," the adviser said. The government took initiatives to limit borders with Myanmar since a vast tract of Bangladeshi land goes to the Myanmar portion of the river Naaf, which separates the two countries, in Cox's Bazar every year because of river erosion. Iftekhar said the procedure to construct a cross-boundary road connecting Teknaf in Bangladesh and Bowlibazar in Myanmar was at "final stages". Bangladesh and Myanmar in July last year signed a memorandum of understanding to build the road to boost trade. The road is considered as the first step toward connecting Bangladesh to the Chinese city of Kunming through Myanmar. bdn
