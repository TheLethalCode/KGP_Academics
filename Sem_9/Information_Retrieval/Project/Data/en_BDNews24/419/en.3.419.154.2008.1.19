<TEXT>
 Kerbala, Iraq, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi forces imposed tight security on the city of Kerbala on Saturday for the climax of a major Shia ceremony after gunmen from a Shia cult attacked pilgrims and police in two other southern cities. Police said the cities of Basra and Nassiriya were calm following street battles on Friday between security forces and gunmen from a cult called the "Soldiers of Heaven". Police said 57 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the clashes. In Kerbala, 2.5 million Shias thronged streets and alleyways for the end of the 10-day Ashura ritual, in which Shias mourn the slaying over 13 centuries ago of the Prophet Mohammad's grandson Imam Hussein near the holy city. Among the pilgrims were dozens of men wearing white robes who marched through the streets striking their heads with swords to underscore their grief at the killing of Imam Hussein. Blood flowed down their robes. Others beat their chests to the sound of drums and religious chants. Officials said 25,000 Iraqi police and soldiers were deployed across Kerbala, 110 km (70 miles) south of Baghdad. "The security situation in Kerbala is under control ... There is nothing to worry about," Kerbala police chief Brigadier-General Raad Shaker told Reuters. Iraqi helicopters circled over Kerbala. Military vehicles were parked at all entrances to the city which was under a total civilian vehicle curfew. Pilgrims were frisked up to 10 times before they could reach the focus of the ceremonies, the Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas shrines in the heart of Kerbala's Old City. Ashura is one of the holiest events in the Shia Muslim religious calendar. Imam Hussein was killed in the year 680 in a conflict that entrenched a schism between Sunni and Shia Muslims that has never been healed. "SOLDIERS OF HEAVEN" Iraqi security forces launched major operations across mainly Shia southern Iraq to protect pilgrims but clashes erupted in Basra and Nassiriya on Friday. A statement from the prime minister's office said a number of "heretics" had been detained after they attacked Ashura processions in Basra and tried to seize a municipal building. The "Soldiers of Heaven" cult was once led by a man who claimed to be the mahdi, an Islamic messiah-like figure. A man who said he was from the movement told Reuters in Basra their fighters had decided to attack security forces on Friday because of persecution he said the cult had suffered. He said they believed the mahdi would appear on Friday. The "Soldiers of Heaven" cult fought a major battle with Iraqi and US security forces a year ago near the holy Shia city of Najaf. The government said at the time the cult had planned to kill top Shia clerics at the peak of Ashura. Ashura has been a target in the past for Sunni militants who view Shias -- a majority in Iraq but a minority in the Muslim world -- as heretics. Suicide bombings and other attacks on Ashura crowds in Kerbala and Baghdad killed 171 people in 2004. The Ashura ritual was severely curtailed under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab. Shias have dominated politics in Iraq since Saddam's ousting in the 2003 US-led invasion
