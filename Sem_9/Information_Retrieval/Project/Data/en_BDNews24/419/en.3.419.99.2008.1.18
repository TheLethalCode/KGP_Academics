 BASRA, Iraq, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi soldiers and police fought running battles with gunmen from a Shi'ite cult in two southern cities on Friday ahead of the climax of a holy festival for Shi'ite Muslims, security officials said. Police said three policemen had been killed in the oil hub of Basra while the body of a civilian had also been found. Two policemen had been wounded in clashes with the gunmen, who staged a series of hit-and-run raids using heavy machineguns in Basra, Iraq's second biggest city. Witnesses said gunmen also attacked four police stations in the city of Nassiriya. "Fierce clashes are taking place between the security forces and gunmen in central Basra," the provincial police chief, Major-General Abdul Jalil Khalaf, told Reuters. "They have been attacking security forces and disappearing," he said, adding that Iraqi military helicopters had been called in to hunt for the gunmen. The clashes are the biggest test for Iraq's police and army in Basra since Britain handed back security control of Basra province last month. They also come as observations for the Ashura festival, one of the holiest events in the Shi'ite Muslim religious calendar, approach their peak across southern Iraq on Saturday. The focus of the event is in Kerbala, where the provincial governor said 2.5 million people had gathered. Police in Basra and Nassiriya said fighters from the so-called "Soldiers of Heaven" cult, an obscure group once led by a man who claimed to be the mahdi, an Islamic messiah-like figure, had opened fire on security forces in both cities. Nearly a year ago, members of the "Soldiers of Heaven" were involved in battles with Iraqi and U.S. forces near the southern city of Najaf in which hundreds of people were killed. The government said at the time the "Soldiers of Heaven" had planned to kill top Shi'ite clerics. CURFEW A policeman in Nassiriya, 375 km (235 miles) southeast of Baghdad, said three policemen may have been killed in clashes there but the reports could not be verified immediately. Police said a curfew had been declared in the city. A Reuters cameraman in Basra said he saw about 30 gunmen dressed in black carrying machineguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Some of them were driving at least two vehicles seized from police, he said. Police said the gunmen were supporters of Ahmed Hassani al-Yemeni, who took over after the cult's previous leader was killed in heavy battles with his followers a year ago. Those clashes near Najaf turned out to be one of the largest battles since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 but also one of the strangest episodes of the war. Hundreds were killed, mostly members of the "Soldiers of Heaven". A dozen Iraqi security forces were killed while a U.S. attack helicopter was shot down, killing its two crew. A man who said he was from the movement told Reuters in Basra that their fighters had decided to attack security forces on Friday because of persecution he said the cult had suffered. He also said they believed the mahdi would appear on Friday. The previous leader, who used the name Mahdi bin Ali bin Ali bin Abi Taleb, had claimed to be the mahdi. Religious pilgrims have been gathering in Kerbala all week for Ashura, which commemorates the death in battle of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, near the city 1,300 years ago. Iraqi security forces have launched major operations across southern Iraq to protect pilgrims, who have converged on Kerbala, 110 km (70 miles) south of Baghdad, for the event. Imam Hussein's death in 680 entrenched the schism between Shi'ite and Sunni Muslims over who they recognised as descendants of Mohamme
