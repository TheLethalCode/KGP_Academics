 JOHANNESBURG, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The deputy president of South Africa's ruling party may enter cabinet, paving the way for him to become president if ANC leader Jacob Zuma is forced to bow out of the race, a leading newspaper said on Friday. Kgalema Motlanthe, a left-leaning intellectual who is widely respected within the African National Congress (ANC), has been touted as a compromise candidate if Zuma's legal problems force him to stand down ahead of the 2009 general election. Zuma, who has stirred investor fears with his ties to trade unions and Communists, goes on trial for money-laundering, racketeering, fraud and corruption in August. He has said he will stand down as ANC leader if convicted in the case. The ANC's powerful National Executive Committee is pushing for Motlanthe to be a part of President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet, Business Day reported on Friday. Mbeki must stand down in 2009 as required by the country's constitution. "There is a very strong sentiment in the National Executive Committee that Motlanthe should go into cabinet to allow for a smooth transition," the newspaper said, citing an interview with an unidentified member of the NEC. Mbeki's cabinet and the NEC begin a three-day meeting on Friday. Motlanthe's stock within the ANC rose last month when he cooled tempers that flared between supporters of Mbeki and Zuma on the convention floor in Polokwane, where delegates overwhelmingly elected Zuma to succeed Mbeki as ANC leader. The ANC's electoral dominance in the country virtually assures that its leader will become state president in 2009. Putting Motlanthe into cabinet could also ease growing concerns that two centres of power have developed within the country since Zuma's election, with one based in the Mbeki-controlled government and the other in the Zuma-led ANC. There is speculation that Motlanthe could replace state Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, an Mbeki ally who took over from Zuma when he was fired in 2005 after being accused of corruption in an arms deal. Motlanthe could also assume the defense portfolio. There are growing calls for Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, another Mbeki ally who has raised the hackles of the Zuma camp with repeated attacks on the Zulu politician, to step down from cabinet. Lekota was booted off the NEC last month and he will appear in court in Johannesburg on Friday to face charges of reckless and negligent drivi
