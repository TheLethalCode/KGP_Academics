 Beijing, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A foul stench led Chinese police to a home where they found 16 protected pangolins in cages and plastic bags, and another 37 dead ones in the refrigerator, the Xinhua news agency said on Saturday. The rescued pangolins, an endangered scaly ant eater sought for their skin and for use in Chinese medicine, ranged in size from the palm of a human hand to four kilograms, Xinhua said, citing the local Forest Police Station. One bear paw was also found in the fridge in the house in southern China's Guangdong Province. Four suspects were arrested, Xinhua said.
