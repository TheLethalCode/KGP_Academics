<TITLE> Honours even after Australia grab late wickets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PERTH, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's master batsmen Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid both made half-centuries before Australia fought back with a flurry of wickets on an absorbing opening day of the third test against on Wednesday. Dravid top scored with 93 while Tendulkar made 71 after steering the tourists out of trouble early on to reach stumps on 297 for six in their first innings. The Australians captured four wickets in the last session to earn a share of the honours on day one but still need to run through the Indian tail quickly on Thursday to enhance their chances of a world record 17th consecutive test win. "We'd have taken four down for 300, that would have made us really happy, but we have to look at the positives," Dravid told a news conference. "There were some good performances through the day, people showed a lot of character. "We've still got some batting left so hopefully the lower order can contribute a little but and we get to 400 which is probably what we would have hoped for at the start of the game." Ricky Ponting's team, who were on their best behaviour after being condemned for their on-field conduct in the last test in Sydney, removed Indian openers in the morning session but needed three hours to break the Tendulkar-Dravid partnership. "We just had to hang in there, if we had them four down for 300, it might have been a different story and you'd probably give India the tick in the box," Australia fast bowler Brett Lee told a news conference. "Those two late wickets, six down, I think Australia is in a pretty good spot now." The pair had little trouble coping with Australia's four-prong pace attack on a WACA pitch that failed to live up to its reputation as the world's fastest and bounciest wicket. They added 139 runs for the third wicket and were unlucky not to have piled on a few more when Tendulkar was the victim of a dubious umpiring decision from Pakistan official Asad Rauf. Tendulkar, who made an unbeaten century in Sydney, looked to be on his way to another hundred after striking nine boundaries when he was given out lbw to Lee to a ball that appeared to be sailing over the top of the bails. Dravid, back in his preferred batting position at number three after opening in the first two tests, threw his wicket away in sight of a hundred with a reckless shot. The former skipper had a let off on 11 when he was dropped by Michael Clarke at first slip but batted sensibly after that, hitting 15 fours and occupying the crease for four and a half hours. But he blew his chance of making a ton when he tried to smack spinner Andrew Symonds out of the ground but mistimed the shot and skied a simple catch to Ponting at mid-off. "Obviously it's disappointing when you get out like, especially late in the day, but the shot was on," Dravid said. MINOR COLLAPSE Australia had captured two wickets before lunch to put the brakes on India's best start to the series, with Mitchell Johnson dismissing Virender Sehwag for 29 and Lee removing Wasim Jaffer for 16. Both batsmen fell to regulation catches behind the stumps to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist just after the first drinks break after putting on 57 for the opening wicket. Dravid and Tendulkar batted through the entire middle session but Tendulkar's departure after tea triggered a minor collapse. Saurav Ganguly made just nine when he was brilliantly caught at gully by Mike Hussey off Johnson, and Vangipurappu Laxman went for 27 when he skied a shot off Lee to Shaun Tait, who was making his first appearance in over two years. The opening day was played in good spirits after both teams promised to be on their best behaviour after the ugly fallout to the last match in Sydney. "They played it tough like they usually do. They ran in hard right through the day," Dravid said. "They were competitive. It was played in very good spirit. It was played tough and played hard like it should be." Lee said the players even managed to share a few laughs. "Today was a lot of fun, there was a few jokes cracked out there, both teams were laughing. Hard tough cricket and that is what cricket is all about.
