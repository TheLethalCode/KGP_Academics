 Las Vegas, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nevada voters make their choices for Democratic and Republican presidential candidates on Saturday in a process as quirky as Las Vegas itself and almost as unpredictable as a casino game. On the Democratic side, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama are in a close race to win the state's caucus and gain valuable momentum after splitting the first two state-by-state contests to choose a party nominee in Iowa and New Hampshire. Among Republicans, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Congressman Ron Paul have made the biggest effort in the western state, but their caucus has drawn less attention because of a primary contest the same day in South Carolina. For the Democratic contest, nine of Las Vegas's best-known casino hotels such as Caesar's Palace and the Bellagio will offer balloting for workers who keep one of the world's best-known tourist destinations running around the clock. That could give Obama, who would be the first black US president if he wins the Nov. 4 election, an advantage because casino workers are largely represented by a union that endorsed him. The Clinton campaign expressed disappointment on Thursday when a judge allowed the casino voting to go ahead. As the caucus process brings citizens together at a set time, voters in the casino hotels are likely to be a colorful mix of cocktail waitresses in skimpy dresses, bellmen in elegant uniforms and chefs dressed in white. As in Iowa earlier this month, decisions are reached through a process of consultation and persuasion in small groups, rather than the direct voting used in most other states. Campaigns and analysts say turnout will determine the results, as Nevada has never held an early caucus that could influence the national race, and voters are unfamiliar with the process. Several casinos said just a small fraction of their workers had requested time off to vote. Republicans will not be voting on the Strip, only at schools and more traditional sites in the state famed for gambling, easy divorce and America's only legalized prostitution. Candidates from both parties have avoided having their photos taken beside roulette wheels and slot machines, as well as chance encounters with colorful characters such as the porn stars attending the Oscars of adult film held last weekend. But they have not been above using gambling lingo. "We are glad we placed our bets on the American people because we have hit the jackpot," Obama said to cheers on Friday night at the University of Nevada Las Vegas. Romney appeared to be the favorite in the Republican race with a poll by the Las Vegas Review-Journal showing him with a 15-point lead over New Hampshire victor John McCain. Nearly 7 percent of Nevadans share Romney's Mormon faith. Candidates have focused their campaigning on economic topics. Nevada has long been one of America's fastest growing states, with many seeking a warmer climate and a place to start a new life. Yet the southwestern state bordering California has seen a downturn over the past year, with its unemployment rate rising. Nevada also suffers from an especially acute housing crisis, with foreclosures the highest in the nation
