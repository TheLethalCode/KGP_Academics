<TITLE> We won't take much longer to improve in Test: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful has said his side would not take much longer to improve in Test and expected better showing in the home series against South Africa. "All have hopes of doing better, and it is right that we are yet to play to our potential. But we have already started getting the benefit of the new training method that we had been introduced to before the tour of Sri Lanka," Ashraful said on arrival of the Bangladesh team from New Zealand at Zia International Airport in Friday. "We won't take much time to better our Test performance. I believe such talk will not resurface in future," said Ashraful when asked why they were looking for individual instead of collective performance seven years after gaining the Test status. Bar the second innings of the first Test when the openers put on record 161 runs, Bangladesh's performance on the New Zealand tour has been disappointing. They conceded hugely inside three days against the hosts in both Tests. Australian coach Jamie Siddons, his deputy Shaun Williams and physio Darryl Lifson did not return with the members of the team that looked gloomy after their poor showings in the both ODI and Test series. Batsmen under the supervision of new coaching staff now spend one hour compared with 20 to 30 minutes under previous coach Dav Whatmore in the nets. Ashraful drew positives from the new training method during the New Zealand tour despite his side making 137 and 254 in the Dunedin Test and 143 and 113 in the Wellington Test. "Especially our top-order batsmen sometimes appeared that they won't get out when they had gone out in the middle and they survived the first 15 to 20 balls confidently. "The coach has also said that the batsmen will have to leave the balls in Test," explained Ashraful. The youngest Test centurion hoped that their improvement would be seen in the upcoming home series against South Africa in February. bdnews
