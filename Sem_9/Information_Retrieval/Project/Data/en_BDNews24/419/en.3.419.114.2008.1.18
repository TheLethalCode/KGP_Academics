 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Friday remanded former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu for three days for further interrogation in a case involving the grenade attack on an Awami League rally in Aug 21, 2004. The grenade attack had been carried out with the consent of former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar and 'Hawa Bhaban', allegedly the alternative powerhouse of the latest BNP-led coalition government, Pintu was quoted by a CID officer as saying. The officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), speaking to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the media, said that Pintu had made the disclosure during interrogation. A CID team arrested the former MP for Tangail-2 constituency from Motijheel Thursday night. The CID officer said they were certain after the arrest of Mufti Hannan and Pintu that the attack on an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue in 2004 had been aided and abetted by Babar and Hawa Bhaban. To hide the truth, former investigation officer Ruhul Amin, a CID officer, had gone to Pintu's house several times, he said. Babar was involved in the entire process and Pintu would regularly enquire with him about the progress, the CID officer added. Intelligence members on Jan 3 picked up Pintu, former deputy minister for information, from Gulshan only to free him two hours later. Pintu will be interrogated by the Task Force Intelligence (TFI), investigation officer of the case, Fazlul Kabir, said. Kabir appealed to judge Abdullah Al Mamun of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, Dhaka for permission to take him on a 10-day remand. He referred to the confessional statement of militant outfit Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Abdul Hannan that Pintu masterminded the attack. Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina was seriously injured and at least 21 people including senior leader Ivy Rahman were killed in the attack. Pintu's lawyer advocate Sanaullah Mia appealed to the court for his bail but the court snubbed it. Pintu pleaded not guilty of the charges. "I worked as a lawyer for 37 years. I am not involved with any subversive or militant activities. I had no link with August 21 incident," he said to the magistrate. "I was interrogated on January 3 and released. I could have fled if I was guilty," Pintu added. He appealed to court for treatment as he was sick. Fazlul Kabir, also senior assistant superintendent of police, told bdnews24.com Thursday night that a CID team arrested him near Motijheel Police Station about 11.30pm. Pintu is a cousin of militant leader Moulana Tajul Islam. Allegations are there that Tajul supplied the grenades for the attack on the Awami League rally on August 21, 2004, with the help of Pintu. Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan in a confessional statement recently named Pintu as the mastermind of the attack. Hannan said the attack was planned at Pintu's official residence in Dhanmondi two days before the incident. Tajul stands accused of supplying grenades for the attack. Security officials carried out several operations in Tangail, Dhanmondi and Mohammadpur in Dhaka to arrest Tajul. He is presumed to be hiding somewhere in Pakistan or South Africa. CID has sought help from the International police organisation Interpol for his arrest. bdnews24.com/
