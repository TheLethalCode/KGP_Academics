 KIEV, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine told NATO it was ready to take the next step towards membership, the president's office said on Wednesday after more than a year of stalled relations. President Viktor Yushchenko had made NATO membership a long-term priority after the 2004 "Orange" revolution, but relations with the defence alliance cooled after Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich -- a political rival -- became prime minister in 2006 and said the country opposed entry. Current Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who replaced Yanukovich late last year, joined the president and parliament speaker Arseniy Yatsenyuk in writing a letter to NATO asking it to accept Ukraine into the Membership Action Plan, a step toward accession. The letter was published by the president's office. "It is the president's opinion that we have entered a moment of truth in our relations with NATO," top presidential foreign policy aide Oleksander Chaly told journalists on Wednesday. "We clearly declare ... that we are ready to fulfil all the obligations which the country accepts to join the action plan." Ukraine hopes to receive an answer from NATO at a summit in Bucharest in April, the letter said. NATO was set up early in the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact, and many people in former Soviet states are deeply suspicious of the alliance, especially following its eastward expansion after the collapse of communism. Ukrainians are split. In the west of the country, those who despised Moscow's control during the Soviet era embraced the idea of NATO, while millions of Russian-speakers living in the east and south share Moscow's distrust. The letter acknowledges the divide, saying extra cash had been allocated this year for an information campaign. Visiting U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar, a senior Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also urged a public debate on NATO entry. During a political crisis in 2006 which resulted in Yanukovich forming his government, the president and prime minister agreed NATO membership must be put to a referendum. Tymoshenko, who was present during the crisis talks and has long been non-committal about NATO, never signed the agreement.
