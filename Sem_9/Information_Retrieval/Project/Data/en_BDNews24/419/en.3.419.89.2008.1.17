 Brussels, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union cleared the way on Wednesday for Ukraine to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after Kiev agreed to a deal on the duties it applies to exports, an EU official said. Ukraine is the biggest country besides Russia and Iran outside the 151-member WTO which oversees global trade. European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Hryhory Nemyrya reached the agreement at a meeting in London, the EU official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "This is a very significant step forward for Ukraine's accession to the world trading system," the official said. Chile's WTO ambassador Mario Matus, who chairs the working party on Ukraine's accession, said this month he hoped to have a meeting of WTO members in the second half of January to finalise the accession package, provided the export duty issue was resolved. The way would then be clear for the next WTO general council on Feb. 5-6 to vote on Ukraine's accession request. WTO membership will provide new export opportunities for Ukraine's industry, still saddled with Soviet-era plants, and its farmers, who cultivate some of the most fertile land in Europe. Membership would not only allow Ukraine, which borders new EU members Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania, to share the benefits of the multilateral trading system but would also give it significant leverage over its powerful neighbour Russia. Ukraine had completed negotiations with the WTO as a group, but WTO accession rules required it to reach a bilateral agreement with any member that sought it, from which all other members benefit. Differences with the EU about export duties were the last remaining hurdle, with Brussels seeking a guarantee from Ukraine to reduce them, not just a declaration of intent. The EU was particularly concerned about export duties on non-ferrous metals, which Brussels argued constituted an effective subsidy for domestic metallurgy plants. The EU also wanted guarantees that Ukraine would not circumvent the restrictions on export duties by introducing measures with the equivalent effect, such as taxes or licence fees. The EU has said Ukraine's WTO membership will allow for the negotiation of a free trade agreement with the bloc. Once Ukraine has joined the WTO it will also be able to set conditions for Russia's own accession as the WTO operates by consensus of all its members. Georgia, which has a series of political and economic disputes with Moscow, is using its membership to hold up Russia's accession. Membership takes effect only when it has been ratified by the acceding country, which has six months from approval to do so
