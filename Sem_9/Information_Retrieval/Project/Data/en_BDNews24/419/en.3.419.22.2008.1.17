 NAIROBI, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenya's opposition accused police of shooting dead seven people on Thursday during a second day of clashes with demonstrators over President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election. In the capital, Nairobi, and the western towns of Kisumu and Eldoret, police fired teargas and bullets on the second of three days of banned rallies called by opposition leader Raila Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). Odinga, who accuses Kibaki of stealing victory in the Dec. 27 ballot, said police shot dead seven people in Nairobi. "Police are shooting innocent civilians at will ... the government has turned this country into a killing field of innocents," he told reporters. Police had no immediate comment but in the past have said that its officers have shot ODM supporters engaged in looting. Kenya's rapid plunge into crisis has tarnished its democratic credentials, horrified world powers, scared off tourists and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies. In three weeks since the vote, violence pitting police against protesters and opposition gangs against tribes seen as pro-Kibaki has caused about 620 deaths. A quarter of a million people, mostly from Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, have been turned into refugees in the turmoil set off by a vote that foreign observers, including the Commonwealth on Thursday, say fell short of democratic standards. In the Kibera slum in Odinga's Nairobi constituency, a Reuters cameraman said people there had hijacked a train passing through and were stealing its cargo. Earlier, a policeman in Mathare who asked not to be identified said some slum dwellers had guns and were shooting at officers In the Rift valley town of Eldoret, police chasing protesters fired teargas into the emergency wing of the main hospital, striking a security guard, a hospital official said. 'DISRUPT PEOPLE'S LIVES' The European Parliament recommended budgetary aid be frozen until the crisis is solved, although unlike many of its African neighbours, Kenya is not aid-dependent and gets less than 5 percent of its budget from aid. Former UN head Kofi Annan, due to lead talks to end the standoff, is recovering from a bout of flu that delayed his trip, the United Nations said, but gave no date for his arrival. With few options left as Kibaki has entrenched his administration and talks brokered by African leaders have yielded nothing, the ODM has taken its fight to the streets. The government accuses Odinga's side of rigging votes, orchestrating ethnic killings and ignoring court challenges in favour of violence. The opposition says the courts are biased. "They are just waking up at 10 o'clock, eating eggs and sausages, giving interviews and planning how to disrupt people's lives," government spokesman Alfred Mutua told reporters. In Burnt Forest, a Rift Valley town where some of the worst attacks on Kikuyus took place and thousands are staying at a camp under guard, a march by ODM supporters from the Kalenjin tribe, escorted by paramilitary officers, paralysed the highway. Witnesses said they were escorted by police mostly from their own tribe, but that other officers later teargassed them. Truck drivers said they were stopped by Kalenjin gangs who stole fuel on the highway, the main route from Kenya's port Mombasa into Uganda, Sudan and central Africa. In a repeat of Wednesday's trouble, police chased protesters through downtown Nairobi, sending people scurrying as tear gas wafted into office buildings. Some shops closed. In the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, local media said two people died on Thursday after demonstrators set up blazing roadblocks. Three men were killed there on Wednesday, including a youth shot dead by police in footage broadcast on local TV. Police said they were attacked by the victims first.
