 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  A group of Dhaka University students is expected to chalk out a fresh protest programme for the release of the detained DU teachers and students. Bangladesh Chhatra Union president Shamsul Alam Sajjan told bdnews24.com that the students would give a press conference Friday afternoon at Madhu's Canteen on the DU campus. A Dhaka court is set to deliver a verdict Monday on one of the cases against the four teachers and 15 students. The decision came Thursday hours after the government submitted a written appeal urging the court of magistrate Habibur Rahman Siddiqui to fast-track the trial of the teachers and students. The appeal makes a major move by the government to wrap up the controversial cases against the teachers and students who were arrested with ties to the August rioting at Dhaka University. The charges involve violations of emergency rules during the days of the August violence on Dhaka University campus. A number of Dhaka University teachers set a five-point demand Wednesday, including the stalling of enrolment tests for two faculties for 2007-08. The new protest plans include raising black flags on the university campus, wearing black badges until the teachers are freed. bdnew
