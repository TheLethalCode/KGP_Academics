<TITLE> UK`s Darling to make N Rock statement Monday: source </TITLE>

 Shanghai, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling is expected to make a statement to parliament on Monday on Northern Rock, a government source said on Saturday. The BBC's website reported Prime Minister Gordon Brown had backed a plan to convert billions of pounds of Bank of England loans to Northern Rock into bonds that would be sold to investors once credit markets stabilised. Government officials travelling with Brown in China declined to confirm the content of the report but a source said Darling would make a statement on Monday. The bank has borrowed about 24 billion pounds ($47 billion) from Britain's central bank since a crisis erupted four months ago when it was unable to fund its business in financial markets following a credit crunch. Northern Rock and the government have said they would prefer a private sector solution to nationalisation. Talks with two potential suitors have stumbled and the bank has talked of a self-help or standalone solution. The BBC said that if the loan conversion plan was agreed, this would make it far easier to agree a deal with a Virgin consortium or with Olivant. ($1=.5093 Pound
