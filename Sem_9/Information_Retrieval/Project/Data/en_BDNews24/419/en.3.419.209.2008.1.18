 HONG KONG, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian markets staged a late day comeback from heavy losses on Friday, taking heart from a financial package mooted by US President George W Bush aimed at cushioning the economy from a downturn. The late turnaround in sentiment lifted the dollar to 107 yen and away from a 2- year low that it had struggled to escape from in early trade, while yields on Japanese government bonds ticked up again after hitting 2-year lows. However, oil remained in negative territory. European shares were likely to continue a torrid start to 2008, with bookmakers expecting Britain's FTSE 100 to open 32 to 45 points lower, Germany's DAX seen down 25 to 38 points and France's CAC 40 down 22 to up 3 points. Stocks initially skidded in Asia on a fresh barrage of U.S. economic news that added to fears that the world's biggest economy -- and Asia's top export market -- was in a recession or headed into one. But Bush told lawmakers on Thursday he wants tax rebates for families and breaks for businesses in a rescue plan that could total $150 billion. He will tell the public more about the plan later on Friday. "By now, selling has pretty much run its course, and in this situation a single event could trigger an upward move," said Ryuta Otsuka of Toyo Securities. Asian stock markets fell around 2 percent in early trade but pulled out of their downward spiral as investors shrugged off the hangover from the U.S. trading day and sought value in shares such as Nippon Steel Corp, which closed up 5.24 percent. Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.56 percent after earlier hitting its lowest level since late 2005. MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks was down 0.66 percent by 0623 GMT. Seoul shares also got back on their feet, with the Korea Composite Stock Price Index closing up 0.65 percent after reaching its lowest point since Aug. 17. But the change of heart came too late for Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index, which finished down for its 10th straight session to log its longest losing streak in 26 years, despite clawing back most of an early plunge. "You've got a real headwind in the form of scepticism about the market's ability to deliver stronger earnings. Against that, you've got a very difficult background discounted and the potential for things not to be as bad as investors have come to believe," said Richard Urwin, head of asset allocation at BlackRock Inc. "But I think it's dangerous to simply extrapolate what's been going on for the past two weeks and assume it sets the tone for the next 50." NIGHTMARE ON WALL STREET The latest nightmare on Wall Street saw the benchmark S&P 500 drop 3 percent to a 15-month low on Thursday on a slump in regional factory activity and hefty losses reported by Merrill Lynch. However, US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke reiterated the central bank was ready to act aggressively, pointing to interest rate cuts this month to try to keep the US economy out of recession. The spectre of recession has pulled crude oil back from a record level above $100 a barrel that it hit on Jan. 3 to below $90. It was down 23 cents at $89.90 by 0611 GMT. Gold also trickled down towards $870 an ounce after falling around 1 percent in New York, but then struggled back towards $875 -- still lower than New York's late levels. The safe-haven metal has sagged after hitting a record of $914 on Monday, with demand worries compounded by investors selling the metal to raise funds to cover losses in other marke
