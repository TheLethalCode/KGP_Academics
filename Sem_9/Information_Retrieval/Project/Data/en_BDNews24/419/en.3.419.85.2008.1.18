 ISLAMABAD, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces killed up to 90 militants in two battles on Friday in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border, the military said. The clashes came two days after hundreds of militants overran a paramilitary fort in another part of South Waziristan.

Four members of the security forces were wounded in the second clash, he said. Both clashes were in areas of South Waziristan where an al Qaeda-linked militant leader, Baitullah Mehsud, operates.
