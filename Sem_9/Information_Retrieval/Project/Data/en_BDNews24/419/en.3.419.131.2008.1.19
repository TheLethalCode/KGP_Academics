 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League is waiting for a formal proposal from the interim government for a dialogue, the party's acting general secretary said Friday. "As soon as we get the invitation, we'll fix our agenda for the talks," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a meeting of the party's presidium. The members of the party's highest decision-making body met at the Gulshan home of acting president Zillur Rahman. Ashraful said his party does not want any "unfavourable environment" that could hinder a free and fair election. On whether the party would take part in polls under a state of emergency, Ashraful said: "We will take a decision on that after the schedule of the voting is declared." "But the Awami League does not want any unfavourable environment that can affect a free and fair voting." He said the presidium members also discussed the matters of soaring prices and the recent unrest in the garment sector. "We demand the government take proper measures to arrest the problems," he said. He said the party was very much concerned about the charges against the Dhaka University teachers and students. "We think it may trigger more incidents," he said of the DU affair. "The government should withdraw the charges to bring about a peaceful environment on the campus," Ashraful said. bdnews
