<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's Supreme Court was likely to clear the party backing ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of election fraud on Friday and clear its way to forming a coalition government, analysts said. The latest "Judgment Day" in a two-year political crisis would leave only minor cases standing between the People Power Party and the return of civilian rule ended by the September 2006 coup which ousted Thaksin, they said. Several stock analysts and legal experts in the Democrat Party, whose members filed the lawsuit, said they believed the court would rule in favour of the PPP, which faces dissolution after emerging from December elections as the biggest party. That would help a stock market stuttering along with other bourses around the world, its index down 8 percent already this year, they said. "We think PPP will survive," Anupon Sriard, head of research at BFIT Securities, told Reuters. The Democrat accused the PPP of being a front for Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party, which was dissolved after the coup for electoral fraud and Thaksin and 110 other leading members barred from politics for five years. They were being re-elected by proxy, a violation of electoral laws, he argued. The Democrats have disowned the suit and its legal experts said they believed the court would throw out the case, not least out of fear of the political consequences. "Since the court did not call for witness testimonies, there is a very high chance that the court will acquit the case," a senior Democrat lawmaker, who declined to be identified, told reporters on Thursday. A verdict against the PPP would deepen a political crisis that began two years ago with mass street protests against telecoms tycoon Thaksin and snowballed nine months later into a military coup. Shrugging off such a threat, PPP Secretary-General Surapong Suebwonglee told Reuters on Thursday he was confident "the statements we have given the court will win us a fair treatment". The PPP was due to announce a six-party coalition government at a posh Bangkok hotel on Saturday commanding around 320 of the 480 seats in parliament. A court ruling in favour of the PPP would push the stock market index beyond 800 points from its little changed 791.44 points at the midday break on Friday, Kiatkong Decho of SICCO Securities said. A ruling against the PPP and the consequent delay in forming a new government, could push it below 750 points, BFIT's Anupon sa
