 BANGKOK, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Thai government said on Friday it was failing to win over the ethnic Malays of the predominantly Muslim far south, where more than 2,800 people have been killed in four years of separatist insurgency. "We made great progress on military operations last year, but our efforts with the people remained static," government spokesman Chaiya Yimwilai told a news conference. "We need to beef up on the arrests, searches, intelligence as well as the civil affairs operations," Chaiya said. Despite an army "hearts and minds" campaign, 2007 was the bloodiest in the far south since the insurgency began in 2004, a Thai research institute said. Nearly 800 people were killed, taking the death toll in the four southernmost provinces to about 2,800 over the past three years, Prince of Songkhla University's "Deep South Watch" think-tank said. Army spokesman Colonel Thanathip Sawangsaeng told the same news conference the army, which has 30,000 troops in the region, was focusing on 72 villages, a sixth of the number in the region, where militants held sway. "We will be sending troops into those villages to create better understanding and communications between the state of the villagers," Thanathip said. But he said there were no signs militant attacks on civilians and security forces would diminish in what was an independent sultanate until annexed by predominantly Buddhist Thailand a century ago. Since his installation after a September 2006 coup, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont has travelled to the south to apologise for the heavy-handed military response of his ousted predecessor, Thaksin Shinawatra, but the violence has raged on. Thaksin, a billionaire telecoms tycoon, flooded the region with thousands of troops and police, alienating many Muslims, but also promised millions of dollars in development aid in a backwater border region infamous for crime and smuggling. Chaiya said the insurgency might be linked to Al Qaeda -- evidence for which analysts have looked for in vain -- but was promptly shot down by Surayud. "We have no such information, but they may share the same ideology. We don't know for sure if they are indeed connected," Surayud told reporte
