 Nairobi, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyans faced a second day of protests on Thursday as the opposition called for more rallies against President Mwai Kibaki's disputed re-election. Police fired teargas and live rounds to scatter hundreds of supporters of Kibaki's rival Raila Odinga who tried to march on Wednesday in the western towns of Kisumu and Eldoret, the slums of the capital Nairobi and the coastal resort of Mombasa. But calls for mass action by Odinga, who says Kibaki stole victory at the Dec. 27 polls, appeared to have gone unheeded by many Kenyans weary from more than two weeks of unrest. Security forces shot dead three men in the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, angering human rights activists. "The killing by the police is completely unjustified," Ben Rawlence of Human Rights Watch told Reuters. "They have not learnt their lesson since killing at least 44 people last week. They must be held accountable." In footage shown by local broadcaster KTN, one Kisumu policeman was seen firing his assault rifle at a young man in a black T-shirt who was pulling faces at other officers. The man in the black T-shirt fell down, then the policeman ran over and kicked him. KTN, which said four people were feared killed in Wednesday's trouble, said the youth later died. Across Kenya, more than 600 have been killed in riots and a wave of tribal violence since the outcome of the ballot, which international observers said fell short of democratic standards. A quarter of a million, many of them members of Kibaki's Kikuyu ethnic group, have been forced from their homes. Kenya's sudden descent into crisis has tarnished its democratic credentials, horrified world powers, scared off tourists and hurt one of Africa's most promising economies. TEARGAS Police have banned three days of protests by Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). In Nairobi, opposition supporters have focused on trying to reach the central Uhuru (Freedom) Park -- which was ringed by officers in riot gear. "We are not losing momentum," a top Odinga ally, William Ruto, told reporters after his convoy was teargassed as it tried to reach the park on Wednesday. The United States and former colonial power Britain have called on Kibaki's government to let peaceful protests go ahead. They and 11 other nations have threatened to cut aid if the government's commitment to "good governance, democracy, the rule of law and human rights weakens". Since being sworn in on Dec. 30, Kibaki, 76, has entrenched his position by naming most of a new cabinet, including figures the ODM says are hardliners, and calling parliament to meet. But the tables turned in the assembly on Tuesday when the opposition narrowly got their choice for speaker elected. Odinga, 63, a wealthy former minister and one-time political prisoner, may use that leverage to halt government work. Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula told Reuters on Wednesday that it was essential both sides learn to work together in parliament. And he said Kibaki was ready to talk. "President Kibaki has said right from the word go ... that he is interested in genuine dialogue with the opposition so that we reduce areas of friction," Wetangula said. International efforts to mediate the dispute suffered a setback last week with the failure of African Union talks. Former UN boss Kofi Annan had been due in Kenya this week to lead a team of "Eminent Africans" in a new push for peace. But he was taken ill with flu before leaving Geneva and a UN official said there was no news on when he might travel
