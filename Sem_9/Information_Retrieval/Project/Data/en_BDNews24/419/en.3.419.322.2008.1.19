<TITLE> Britain gets report on options for Northern Rock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Shanghai, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain has received a report from US investment bank Goldman Sachs on options for the troubled Northern Rock bank and is talking to potential buyers about them, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Saturday. Brown said Finance Minister Alistair Darling would make a statement to Britain's parliament on Monday about Northern Rock, but a government source said it would be about "process" rather than an outcome to the four-month-old crisis at the bank. Brown, on a visit to China, repeated that all options, including nationalisation, remained open. Northern Rock, Britain's fifth-biggest mortgage lender at its height, is estimated to have borrowed about 26 billion pounds ($51 billion) from the Bank of England since it was forced to seek emergency loans in September after being hit by the global credit squeeze. Brown was asked at a news conference about a report on the BBC's Web site that he had backed a plan by Goldman Sachs to convert billions of pounds of Bank of England loans to Northern Rock into bonds that would be sold later. The BBC said that if the loan conversion plan was agreed, it would make it far easier to agree on a deal to sell Northern Rock to a private buyer. Two consortiums, led by investment groups Virgin and Olivant, are at the forefront of attempts to buy the bank. Brown neither confirmed nor denied the BBC report, but said: "Now we've been presented with a report that we commissioned from Goldman Sachs that gives us a number of options for the future," Brown said. ALL OPTIONS ON THE TABLE "All options, including public ownership on the road to moving the bank into the private sector, are on the table and are available to the government," he said. Brown said discussions were taking place with private firms that had expressed an interest in buying Northern Rock, and the government source said those discussions were about the Goldman Sachs' proposals. Brown did not make clear if the government's discussions were just with Virgin and Olifant. He said he was confident that everything the government did would comply with European Union rules limiting state aid for bailouts of private companies. The chairman of Virgin Group, Richard Branson, is part of a business delegation accompanying Brown on a tour of China and India. "I haven't spoken in any detail to Richard Branson. The commercial discussions are not a matter for me," Brown said. Goldman Sachs had been locking at the best financing package for selling Northern Rock. The BBC said that, under the plan, the bonds would stay on the public sector balance sheet until conditions improved in financial markets when they would be sold to investors in small parcels every few months. That could mean the Northern Rock affair would hang over Brown's government for years to come. He is already being accused by the Conservative opposition of dithering by taking so long to find a solution. The banking crisis and a number of government blunders have undermined Brown's popularity since he succeeded Tony Blair as prime minister last June. His Labour Party lags the Conservatives in the polls although he does not have to call a general election until 2010. Northern Rock and the government have said they would prefer a private sector solution to nationalisation
