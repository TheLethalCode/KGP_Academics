 MELBOURNE, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Amelie Mauresmo was sent packing at the Australian Open on Friday and admitted she is a long way from the form that took her to the top. The Frenchwoman looked a shadow of the player who won the Australian Open and Wimbledon in 2006, losing 3-6 6-4 6-4 to unseeded Australian Casey Dellacqua, the world number 78, in the third round. The loss was Mauresmo's earliest at the Australian Open since 2000 and the 28-year-old, who slipped down the rankings to 18 after an injury-hit 2007, said had a lot of work to do. "Not enough, definitely not enough," Mauresmo told reporters when asked how well her game was progressing. "Even if maybe the match went a different way, I would still tell you probably the same thing. Great beginning of the match, but then struggle. Some ups and downs throughout the second and third sets." Mauresmo double-faulted 10 times but still had her chances, breaking for 4-3 in the final set only to lose the last three games. While Dellacqua, who had won just one grand slam match before this tournament, grew in confidence, Mauresmo struggled to impose herself. "Confidence (was the problem) and really not keeping in mind the aggression that I should have, the fact that I should, as I was doing very well in the beginning, mix up some serve and volley, and staying back. "That works pretty well usually on my serve, but I forgot a little bit about that in the second and third set.
