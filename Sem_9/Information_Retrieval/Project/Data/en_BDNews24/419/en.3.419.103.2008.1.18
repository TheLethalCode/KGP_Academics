<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The widow of late French President Francois Mitterrand is putting many of his clothes and personal effects up for sale 12 years after his death, including silk suits, top hats, crocodile-skin cases and a shapely piggy-bank. The Jan. 29 auction throws a spotlight on the Socialist leader's love of luxury and an apparent penchant for hoarding. Among the 367 lots that the Tajan auctioneers expect to sell are around 100 shirts, some 60 suits and a selection of gifts from international leaders, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro. Much of Danielle Mitterrand's own wardrobe is also going under the hammer as she aims to raise up to 100,000 euros ($146,600) for her human rights charity. The sales organiser Benedicte Blondeau-Wattel told Reuters it was hard to tell if Mitterrand, who governed France from 1981-1995, had accumulated more clothes than other presidents. "It is the first time that we have auctioned the wardrobe of a president of the republic. I haven't had access to any of the others' (wardrobes) so I can't make any comparisons," she said. Mitterrand died in January 1996 and Danielle has stored all his clothes in her Paris flat ever since. "She decided to sell many of their belongings to raise money for her foundation, but she is keeping hold of some items, such as the dress she wore for her husband's (presidential) investiture," Blondeau-Wattel said. The Mitterrand's taste in clothes ran the gamut of top world designers, including Chanel, Yves Saint-Laurent, Dior, Jil Sander and Hermes. The president himself appeared especially fond of grey woolen suits by Adriano Cifonelli. A number of his trademark hats will also be sold, including panamas, top hots, Russian fur hats, a bowler and a straw hat. Likewise, 13 pairs of his small, size 6 mocassins made by the chic French J.M. Weston shoemakers, are on sale. Most items have an estimated price tag of between 20-450 euros. "We pitched the prices low so that all the French people who loved Mitterrand can make bids," Blondeau-Wattel said. The most expensive item is a leather-bound carry case given to the Mitterrands by the Saudis, which contains bottles of perfume and bath oil. The estimated price is 1,500-2,000 euros. The presents from Castro included a Crocodile-skin brief case with the inscription "comandante en jefe fidel castro". It is estimated to sell for 500-700 euros. One of the more eye-catching items up for grabs is a piggy-bank in the shape of young woman carrying a sign that reads "Mitterrand, I am waiting for you". Some of the Air France travel kits that Mitterrand picked up on his many foreign visits will also be sold, as well as a table lighter, cigar box and a pair of porcelain pheasant
