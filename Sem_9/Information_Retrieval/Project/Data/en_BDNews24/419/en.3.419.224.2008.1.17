 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded Shia Muslim prayer hall in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar on Thursday, killing seven people and wounding 18, police said. Pakistan's minority Shia are observing a mourning period for the anniversary of the death of Iman Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, when sectarian violence often flares. "The bomber blew himself up inside the Imambargah and seven people were killed including one policeman," said city police chief Tanvir-ul-Haq Sipra, referring to the prayer hall. The bomber was a boy of about 16 years old, said Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema. One witness said he heard gunshots just before the blast. "People are crying and shouting. It's chaos," said Ali Haider, who was outside the hall when the attack took place. The government has stepped up security in the hope of heading off sectarian violence during the religious commemoration, which reached a climax this weekend with processions by Shi'ites across the country. Pakistan saw a surge of religious violence in the 1980s with the emergence of militant groups, most of them Sunni, funded by the United States and Saudi Arabia to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan and Shia radical groups following the success of the 1979 Islamic revolution in majority Shi'ite Iran. While ordinary Sunni and Shi'ite Pakistanis live side-by-side, radicals from the two sects have inflicted a bloody toll in tit-for-tat assassinations and bomb attacks since then. HUNT FOR MISSING SOLDIERS Meanwhile, security forces were searching for 15 paramilitary soldiers who went missing when hundreds of militants stormed a fort in the northwest of the country on Wednesday, a military spokesman said. Militants have been blamed for a string of attacks on security forces in recent months, compounding a sense of crisis in the nuclear-armed country as President Pervez Musharraf has struggled to hold power in the face of protests from opponents. About 200 militants attacked the Sara Rogha fort in South Waziristan on the Afghan border. They captured it after blowing up one of its walls, the military said. The military initially said 40 militants and seven soldiers were killed and 20 soldiers were missing, but five of the missing men were later reported to have reached villages in the area, said military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas. "Fifteen are still missing," Abbas said. "They are looking for the men, a search operation is on." Security forces have been battling al Qaeda-linked militants in South Waziristan for several years. A spokesman for the militants said they had killed 16 troops and captured 12 in the attack. He said only two of his men were killed. Abbas said there was no confirmation of the militants' claim that they had captured the 12. The militants had abandoned the fort and security forces were preparing an operation to take control of it again, Abbas said. The area where the fort is located is a stronghold of al Qaeda-linked militant leader Baitullah Mehsud, who the government said was behind the assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in Rawalpindi on Dec. 27. The government says the militants are intent on destabilising the country in the run-up to a Feb. 18 general election that is meant to complete a transition to civilian rule. The parliamentary elections were due to be held on Jan. 8 but were postponed after Bhutto was killed in a gun and bomb attack.
