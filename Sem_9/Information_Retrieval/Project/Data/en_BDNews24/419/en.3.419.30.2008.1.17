 LONDON, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stock index futures rose strongly on Thursday, tracking firmer markets in Asia where exporters rose as the dollar gained some ground against other currencies. By 0755 GMT, Euro Stoxx futures were up 0.9 percent, DAX futures rose 0.6 percent and CAC futures gained 1 percent. Markets fell on Wednesday on concerns of a U.S. recession. On the earnings front, Merrill Lynch reports fourth-quarter results ahead of U.S. trading hours and markets will focus on the extent of subprime-related writedowns. The euro had tumbled against the dollar on Wednesday after ECB Governing Council member Yves Mersch told Bloomberg News he did not rule out a downward revision of euro zone growth forecasts for 2008, and that the central bank should remain flexible with regard to fighting inflation. All eyes will be on US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is due to testify on the near-term outlook for the U.S. economy before the House Budget Committee at 1500 GMT. Markets will scrutinise his comments for clues on how aggressively the Fed may slash interest rates at its next policy meeting on Jan. 29-
