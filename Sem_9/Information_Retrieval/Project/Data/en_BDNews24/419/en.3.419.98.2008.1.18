 Compton, Calif., Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Economic worries dominated the US presidential campaign on Thursday, with White House hopefuls on both coasts touting plans to ease the pain of a recession while President George W. Bush prepared to announce his own fiscal package. Two days before Nevada and South Carolina voters make choices in a chaotic White House race leading up the November election, a federal judge gave Barack Obama a possible lift by allowing casino shift workers, represented by a union backing the Illinois Democrat, to vote in nine locations in Las Vegas casino hotels. Obama and rival Hillary Clinton journeyed to California, the biggest prize on a Feb. 5 "Super Tuesday" featuring 22 nominating contests, to plug their plans to help struggling families and jump-start the economy. With Iraq sliding off the front pages and the economy heading the list of voter concerns, candidates have rushed to emphasize approaches to fighting a recession that some economists believe has already started and could be deep and painful. Bush, a Republican who has a year left in office, will speak about his ideas for boosting the economy on Friday. Bush told lawmakers on Thursday he wants tax rebates for families and breaks for business included in an economic rescue package that sources said could total $150 billion. Clinton discussed her $110 billion stimulus package and told voters at a predominantly black church outside Los Angeles that she backed quick action to ease the burden on working and middle-class families. "We're facing a recession in the economy," she said at the Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Compton. "We need to take action as soon as possible." In San Francisco, Obama stressed his $75 billion plan to boost the economy and ease the tax burden on working families. He said "fundamental" long and short-term steps were needed. "It's absolutely critical for us to do something short-term. We don't know whether we are already in a technical definition of a recession, but what I know from traveling all across the country is families have been struggling for a long time," he said. Clinton, a New York senator, and Obama, an Illinois senator, are running neck-and-neck in polls in Nevada heading into the state's caucus on Saturday, just ahead of former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. FOCUS ON SOUTH CAROLINA Republicans are also on the ballot in Nevada but have focused more intensely on Saturday's contest in South Carolina, where Arizona Sen. John McCain leads polls over former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson. Romney, who visited Nevada on Thursday, resurrected his campaign with a win earlier this week in Michigan, where he focused on promises to heal the state's ailing auto industry and manufacturing base. McCain on Thursday offered a plan that would lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, allow deductions for equipment and technology investments and establish a permanent research and development tax credit. "The economy is in some difficulty now and we are going to have to adjust to that," he said in Aiken, South Carolina. At stops in Aiken and Columbia, McCain and his most loyal backer in South Carolina, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, urged supporters to resist negative phone calls and direct mail from opponents trying to raise questions about him. One such mailing this week accused McCain of turning his back on fellow Vietnam prisoners of war in order to save his own skin. "South Carolina is going to reject this garbage," Graham said in Columbia. Ahead of Nevada's caucuses on Saturday, a federal judge rejected arguments from a teachers' group that the temporary casino caucus locations were unfair. A large turnout of casino workers could boost Obama against Clinton because he is backed by the state's Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 cooks, cleaners and other hotel service workers. The Clinton campaign said it had not been behind the effort to kill the locations but it was not happy with the result. Obama's campaign applauded the decision.
