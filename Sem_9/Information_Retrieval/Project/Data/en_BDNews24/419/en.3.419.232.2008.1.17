 United Nations, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia will never recognize an independent Kosovo but will not use violence to prevent the country's ethnic Albanians from establishing their own state, Serbia's president said on Wednesday. "Serbia will never recognize Kosovo's independence and will preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty by all democratic means, legal arguments and diplomacy," President Boris Tadic of Serbia told the UN Security Council. "Serbia will not resort to violence and war." Kosovo's newly elected prime minister, ethnic Albanian former guerrilla Hashim Thaci, was also scheduled to address the 15-nation Security Council in a closed session. Kosovo's nearly 2 million Albanians are expected to declare independence sometime after Serbia's presidential elections later this month. But Belgrade is telling Serbs in Kosovo to ignore such a move, raising the prospect of an ethnic partition of the breakaway province. Western diplomats said Wednesday's debate would not affect Kosovo's future status, an issue they say has left the council hopelessly deadlocked due to Russia's staunch opposition to the idea of an independent Kosovo. "The Security Council is blocked," US Ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters. "There is nothing that would indicate that there is a role for the Security Council." Russia, a permanent veto-wielding Security Council member -- as are China, the United States, France and Britain -- has prevented the council from passing a resolution that would open the door to independence for Kosovo. Tadic pleaded with the council not to abandon the issue and to continue working to prevent "a unilateral act on the independence of Kosovo". He also called for renewed talks with Pristina to try to agree on a mutually acceptable arrangement. But Western diplomats dismiss this idea, saying further negotiations would be a waste of time given that past talks between Belgrade and Pristina produced no agreement. Khalilzad welcomed Tadic's assurances that Serbia would not resort to violence to hold onto Kosovo and urged Belgrade not to use economic weapons like restricting the region's access to water or electricity. As the role of the United Nations in Kosovo shrinks, the European Union plans take over UN police and justice functions, with NATO troops continuing to maintain order as Kosovo declares independence
