 BEIJING, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown told China on Friday he wanted Britain to be the number one choice for Chinese trade and investment as he sought to take the relationship to a "higher level". Brown also said he would bring up human rights and democracy in his talks with leaders of the world's fastest-growing major economy on his short trip to Beijing before heading off to Shanghai on Saturday and India on Sunday. "Britain will welcome substantial new investment from China in our country in the years to come," Brown told a news conference alongside Premier Wen Jiabao. "We want Britain to be the number one destination of choice for Chinese business as it invests in the rest of the world." The two leaders agreed to expand trade to a value of $60 billion by 2010, compared to about $40 billion last year, as they watched the signing of agreements on education cooperation, climate change, sustainable cities and several involving BP and clean energy development. "I believe by 2010 we will see 100 new Chinese companies investing in the UK, we will see 100 partnerships between our universities and Chinese universities and we will double the number of firms listed on the London Stock Exchange and thousands of jobs will be created," Brown said, adding that he welcomed investment from Beijing's huge sovereign wealth fund. "We are now able to sell to China not just financial and business services and environmental technologies, but also a whole range of British brands that are now becoming very popular among the rising number of Chinese consumers. "...We are moving our partnership with China to a higher level." Wen greeted Brown at the Great Hall of the People, the iconic heart of Communist Party rule. Wen assured reporters China was committed to eventual introduction of democracy. "China will remain committed to advancing democracy -- that is to say our people will gradually exercise greater democratic elections and participation in political affairs," he said. Brown said that he had raised the issue of elections in Hong Kong, which Britain handed back to China in 1997. "I welcomed his assurances that they will move to elections both for the chief executive and for the council in Hong Kong over the next period of time," he said. HUMAN RIGHTS While Britain is keen to promote trade, the two countries do not always see eye-to-eye on Iran, Myanmar or the conflict in Sudan's Darfur province. Brown said he would discuss human rights and democracy during his visit. Human Rights Watch said in an open letter to Brown that he should use his visit to press Beijing on rights in the run-up to the Olympics. Western politicians and rights groups have accused China in the past of selling Sudan arms that end up in Darfur and of fending off stronger U.N. Security Council resolutions. Wen said he and Brown agreed to press for a negotiated settlement on Darfur. On Iran, Britain has supported its ally, the United States, in pressing for new sanctions against Tehran's nuclear activities, but China wants a negotiated solution. And unlike Britain, China has been reluctant to criticise Myanmar's military rulers publicly. Britain has been the biggest EU investor in China over the past few years but it has been less successful than European rivals in exporting to China. Wen said it was a good omen that Brown arrived a day after the year's first snowfall in the capital. "China has an old saying that snow augurs a successful year, and this symbolises a fresh start in Sino-British relations in the new year and even greater development," he sa
