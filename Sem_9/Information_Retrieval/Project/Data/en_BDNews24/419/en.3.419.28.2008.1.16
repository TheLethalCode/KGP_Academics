<TITLE> Sick Russian oil boss says he could die in jail </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A gravely ill Russian oil executive held in a Russian prison has accused his jailers of trying to blackmail him into testifying against old associates by denying him the medical treatment he needs to stay alive. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg made the highly unusual step of issuing three requests for 36-year-old Vasily Alexanian to be transferred to a specialist hospital but Russian authorities have not complied. Alexanian's case is politically charged because he is the former vice-president of the now-defunct Yukos oil firm, whose main shareholder Mikhail Khodorkovsky is in a Siberian prison after falling foul of the Kremlin. Investigators deny any unlawful treatment of Alexanian, who is awaiting trial on charges of fraud and tax evasion. They say he has made his own health worse by rejecting the treatment on offer in the prison sanatorium. At a Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday where his lawyers challenged his detention, prosecutor Vladimir Khomutovsky said Alexanian had HIV/AIDS. His lawyers said they did not have their client's consent to disclose his illness. In an open letter he passed out of the Sailors' Rest prison in Moscow, Alexanian said he was now nearly blind, had a constant fever and was in urgent need of a course of drug treatment that was only available outside prison. "The prognosis is death," said his lawyer Yelena Lvova when asked what would happen if Alexanian, in detention since April 2006, was not transferred to a civilian hospital soon. Kremlin critics say Yukos and its executives became the targets of an official vendetta because they challenged President Vladimir Putin's power. The firm's chief Khodorkovsky is expected to stand trial soon on a set of new charges. HUNCHED OVER The investigators handling Alexanian's case said in a written reply to Reuters questions that "in accordance with current legislation the defendant has been offered comprehensive medical treatment, which he has declined to accept." "The investigation of this criminal case is being conducted in exact accordance with the demands of criminal procedural law," the Investigative Committee, an arm of the Prosecutor-General's office, said in the statement. Alexanian took part in Wednesday's Supreme Court hearing by video link from his prison, where he could be seen in a small metal cage. He appeared thin and tired, and sat hunched over. He struggled to get to his feet to address the court. When the judge adjourned the hearing until Jan. 22, Alexanian said: "I hope I will survive for another week." Alexanian has a brother who works as a translator in the Reuters Moscow office. In the open letter he wrote from prison, Alexanian accused the authorities of deliberately driving him to a condition where he was "close to death" by denying him treatment. "Meanwhile, all this time attempts have not ceased to make me give false evidence and provide testimony incriminating other Yukos bosses, in exchange for giving me bail on health grounds, that is, in effect, in exchange for life." The Russian prisons service did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters has seen letters from the European Court of Human Rights to Alexanian's legal team stating that the court had issued the Russian government with three "interim measures" asking for the "immediate transfer of the applicant to a hospital for specialised treatment." One letter stated that if Alexanian "dies in detention because of insufficient medical assistance provided to him, the court may find a violation" of articles of the Convention on Human Rights relating to torture and the right to life. Lev Ponomaryov, a prominent Russian human rights activist said he believed Alexanian's life was in danger. "They (officials) are prepared to kill a person by not providing him with medical help," he said.
