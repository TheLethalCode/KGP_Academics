 Istanbul, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish media lamented on Saturday the failure of an investigation into the killing of prominent Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink to shed full light on a murder which shocked Turkey a year ago. An ultra-nationalist gunman shot Dink outside his office in Istanbul on Jan. 19, 2007. Protesters planned to gather at 3 p.m. on Sunday at the spot where he was killed to call for justice. Amnesty International urged Turkey on Friday to widen the scope of the investigation and the liberal media called for the alleged complicity of security officials to be fully investigated. "Hrant Dink is in his grave, they are still at their posts," said a headline in the Radikal daily, in reference to claims that police failed to act on warnings that Dink's life was in danger. Before his murder, Dink received death threats for his articles urging Turkey to accept responsibility for its part in mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks and Kurds in 1915. Ankara has vowed to bring all those responsible for Dink's killing to justice. Nineteen suspects are on trial. The next hearing is on Feb. 11. The murder was one in a series of attacks in recent years on Turkey's small Christian population, which includes Roman Catholics, Protestants and Orthodox. The government has failed to learn the lessons of Dink's killing, according to Radikal columist Murat Yetkin. "(Prime Minister) Erdogan, who claims leadership of the Alliance of Civilisations, should sort out those who want to turn his country into a hell for non-Muslims," he said. "All the government's bodies associated with security, starting with the interior ministry, must root out the rotten apples within," he said. According to the court indictment, one of the defendants in the Dink case acted as a police informer and told the police of plans to assassinate the editor in the months before the murder. Dink's writings brought him a suspended 6-month jail sentence under a law that makes it a crime to insult Turkish identity. Ankara has failed to amend or scrap the law, despite pressure from the European Union which calls it a major obstacle to free speech and to Turkey's goal of joining the bloc. "Hrant Dink's case is not an exception. Many in Turkey continue to be prosecuted for the peaceful expression of their non-violent opinions," said Andrew Gardner, Amnesty's researcher on Turkey
