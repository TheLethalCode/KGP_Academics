 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Friday they were working to develop a better market information system to keep the prices down. "The government has moved to strengthen the flow of information about the market situation. It will surely bring in good results," the adviser told bdnews24.com as he visited a market in the city. "If there is coordination among the producers, traders and consumers, the prices would remain within [the people's] reach." "The government wants to keep the prices of daily commodities within the people's buying capacity. We are going ahead with a long-term strategy," he said on visiting Mohammadpur Krishi Market without any protocol. He said there should be a bonding among the producers, traders and clients. "This is the duty of the government. To do so the commerce ministry has taken steps to ensure better flow of information about the market situation. "It is possible to control the prices if it is possible to monitor the situation about the supply, deficits and the prices," Zillur said. "If the government gets a forecast about the market, it is possible to take steps." He said he would make similar visits to other markets in the capital. Replying to a query, the adviser said the government was working to keep the prices of rice stable. "This visit is the part of that effort. I want to assure the people that the market would get normal if the market management could be developed," he said. The adviser sat with the ministry officials and market experts Wednesday to discuss the market situation. bdnew
