 Beirut, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Shia Muslim Lebanese converged on Hezbollah's southern Beirut bastion on Saturday to mark the climax of the Ashura religious ceremony, one of Shia Islam's holiest events. The ceremony takes place this year as Lebanon goes through its worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. The protracted conflict pits the Hezbollah-led opposition against its domestic arch-foes, the anti-Syrian majority. Swarms of men, women and children dressed in black amassed on Beirut's southern suburbs, punching their fists in the air and beating their chests in unison as they chanted "We serve you Hussein", as a sign of grief at the killing of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad. Hezbollah supporters carrying red, yellow and black banners with the slogan "We will not be humiliated" marched in procession, blocking suburban roads, chanting "Death to America, Death to Israel". A Reuters witness said he saw Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah walking among the crowds, his first public appearance in months, although he has given live speeches via video link from undisclosed locations this week. He is due to address his followers. Hezbollah, allied to Syria and Iran, wants an equal three way division of cabinet seats -- between themselves, the majority and the president -- or veto power in a new government once army chief General Michel Suleiman is elected president. Neither option is acceptable to the ruling majority of whom the United States is the most powerful supporter. The conflict has paralysed government for more than a year and left Lebanon without a president since November. Ashura is the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram when according to Islamic tradition Hussein was killed along with most of his family in 680 AD in the Iraqi city of Kerbala by Islamic ruler Yazid, who Shias remember as an oppressor. Hussein's death is a defining moment in the history of Shia Islam
