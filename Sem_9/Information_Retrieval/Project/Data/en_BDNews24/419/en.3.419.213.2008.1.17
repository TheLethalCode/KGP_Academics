<TEXT>
 ROME, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European champions AC Milan went out of the Italian Cup on Wednesday after being held 1-1 at Catania, while holders AS Roma crushed Torino 4-0 to reach the quarter-finals. Peruvian full back Juan Manuel Vargas drilled home from 30 metres out to put Catania ahead in the 11th minute. Teenage striker Alberto Paloschi levelled the score in the 68th for Milan, who rested several regulars. Catania managed to hang on to the advantage they carried from their 2-1 first-leg triumph at the San Siro. Both sides finished with 10 men after Catania defender Andrea Sottil was sent off in the 76th for a foul as last man and Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso went three minutes later for a second yellow. Roma started to rally from their 3-1 first-leg defeat in the 59th minute, when French midfielder Ludovic Giuly sprinted from just beyond the halfway line and served Mancini, who slotted in from a central position. Giuly was the provider again two minutes later, this time for substitute Francesco Totti, who tucked the ball away from short range. The Roma captain then nailed a spot-kick to claim his 200th career goal and Giuly completed the rout at the death. In the last eight Roma will encounter Sampdoria, who thrashed Serie A basement club Cagliari 4-0 with an Emiliano Bonazzoli brace and goals by Luigi Sala and Angelo Palombo to wipe out a 1-0 deficit from the previous tie. Catania will face Udinese, who beat Palermo 1-0 away earlier thanks to Antonio Floro Flores' stoppage-time header to go through after the goalless first leg. Giampaolo Pazzini struck twice in the second half as Fiorentina knocked out Serie B Ascoli with a 2-0 victory (3-1 on aggregate). Serie A leaders Inter Milan entertain Reggina on Thursday after winning the away leg 4-1, while Lazio take a 2-1 advantage with them to Napoli. If Inter advance to the next round they will face Juventus, who beat Empoli 5-3 on Tuesday for a 6-5 aggregate win
