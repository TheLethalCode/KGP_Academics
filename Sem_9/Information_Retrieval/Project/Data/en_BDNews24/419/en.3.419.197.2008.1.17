<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission Thursday launched a website for voters to verify their personal information on the voter list. Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda launched the website www.voterlist.gov.bd at a press conference in his office. Voters can verify their personal information on the site with their 17-digit pin code available on the receipt they were given during registration, Huda said. He said the initiative would make it easier than before to correct information about voters. "Making the voter list with photograph with the technical assistance of the army has been on across the country. We are committed to making a clean and flawless electoral roll." Only the list of the voters of Dhaka City Corporation has primarily been posted on the site. The lists of other divisional and district towns will be included gradually, he said. He thanked the army for helping to develop the web page. Election commissioners M Sahul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain and military secretary Major General Shafiqul Islam were present at the press conference. Islam said the DCC voters would be able to correct information through the website but would need to contact the voter registration centre for major changes. After verification, the entire voter list would be posted on the site except photo and fingerprint as these were regarded confidential, Islam added. He said army technicians were on alert to stop information on the website being hacked. bdnew
