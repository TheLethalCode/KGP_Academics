 Bridgetown, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barbados installed a new prime minister on Wednesday, a day after an overwhelming vote for change in the former British colony that denied the Barbados Labour Party an unprecedented fourth term and put the Democratic Labour Party in office. Lawyer and DLP leader David Thompson was sworn in after final results from Tuesday's election showed the DLP winning 20 of the eastern Caribbean island's 30 constituencies, with 10 going to the party of ousted Prime Minister Owen Arthur. Thompson, a former junior finance minister, said he would announce his Cabinet by Friday. "The new Cabinet will be designed in such a way that we can give immediate effect to the key promises and pledges that we made in the manifesto, and to give some character to the new government," Thompson told reporters after taking the oath of office. He did not elaborate, but the incumbent party campaigned largely on its record, which clearly failed to resonate with voters on the island of 280,000, which won independence in 1966. Barbados has overcome the decline of its once powerful sugar industry and grown relatively wealthy through high-end tourism, light industry and offshore financial services. But discontent about the status quo has swept several incumbent parties from power across the Caribbean in the past few years and Barbadians said that seemed to be a factor behind Arthur's defeat. Many grumbled in the run-up to the election about the high cost of living. Other top issues were health care and transportation and the island's increasingly congested and potholed highways. "I voted for change," Kevin Smith, a 47-year-old mechanic, said about the outcome of the race. "Things weren't going the way they should or people perceived they should," he added. "What people need now is (the) opportunity to lead a fairly comfortable lifestyle. ... The cost of living is the main priority.
