<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey can resolve a bitter dispute over the Islamic headscarf in universities swiftly without waiting for the completion of a new constitution, Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan was quoted on Thursday as saying. Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party, which has Islamist roots, has previously signalled it would ease Turkey's strict ban on the wearing of the headscarf in universities with an article in the planned new constitution.

The wives of both Erdogan and President Abdullah Gul, a former AK Party foreign minister, wear the headscarf. The AK Party is expected to publish its draft constitution in the near future but it must then be debated by parliament and will then be submitted to a referendum, possibly in 2009. Opinion polls show a majority of Turks support relaxing the headscarf ban in universities, but some political analysts fear that pushing the headscarf issue will reignite tensions between the government and secular establishment. "Erdogan's party looks set to overplay its hand (over the headscarf) in a way that could upset Turkey's delicate political balance," Wolfango Piccoli, a Turkey expert at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, wrote in a report this we
