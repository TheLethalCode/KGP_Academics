<TITLE> Clinton plays flight attendant in campaign plane spoof </TITLE>

 Las Vegas, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hillary Clinton, flight attendant? Not exactly, but the Democratic presidential hopeful did impersonate one briefly on Wednesday as her new campaign plane made its first voyage with journalists, staff and the candidate herself on board. "Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome aboard the maiden flight of Hil Force One" said the former first lady, startling reporters on the flight from Las Vegas to Reno, Nevada. Air Force One is the name of the plane that carries the US president. "My name is Hillary and I am so pleased to have most of you on board," she said over the loud speaker, an oblique reference to her sometimes contentious relationship with the media. Clinton had been traveling on a chartered jet, with reporters relegated to a separate media plane or commercial flights. Now, with the race for the Democratic nomination going nationwide, the campaign has put the full entourage on one aircraft. Clinton parodied the speech that flight attendants give at the onset of a trip. "FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) regulations prohibit the use of any cell phones, blackberries, or wireless devices that may be used to transmit a negative story about me," the New York senator said. "And in the event of an unexpected drop in poll numbers, this plane will be diverted to New Hampshire," Clinton said, recalling her victory there over rival Barack Obama last week, despite polls that predicted the Illinois senator would win. Clinton slipped in one dig against Obama, whom she has portrayed as not experienced enough for the White House. "We know you have choices when you fly, and so we are grateful that you chose the plane with the most experienced candidate," she concluded
