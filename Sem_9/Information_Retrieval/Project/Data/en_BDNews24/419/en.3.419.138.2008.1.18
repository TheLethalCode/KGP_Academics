 Chittagong, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to double the allowances for union parishad chairmen and members, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Friday. He said the raise would come into force from April. "The local government ministry took the initiative and with the approval of the finance ministry decided to double the allowance of the Union Parishad chairmen and members," Anwarul said after launching the Laldighi Park in Chittagong. With the raise, an UP chairman will get Tk 3,000 allowance per month against Tk 1500 and an UP member would receive Tk 1,500 from the current Tk 750. The adviser said the caretaker government would also start giving allowances to city corporation commissioners and had decided to formulate new laws for the city corporations. "The next elections to the city corporations will be held as per the new laws." He advised all local government bodies including city corporations to increase earnings from their own sources. "If this is done local government bodies will not have to wait for release of government funds." Anwarul also advised Chittagong City Corporation to introduce a citizens' charter as the local government ministry, Dhaka WASA and Rajuk had done. Such a charter increases people's trust in the city corporation, he added. The adviser praised the initiative of CCC in founding the park. "These initiatives are necessary in every town of the country for the wellbeing of the urban population." Anwarul also announced that a project at the initiative of the local government ministry was under consideration to create a 'natural' lake stretching from Sonargaon Hotel to Rampura in the capital. "The lake would be also linked with Gulshan Lake," said the adviser, describing the breadth of the plan.
