 Los Angeles, Jan 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Comic actor Eddie Murphy and his new wife Tracey Edmonds have split up just two weeks after their wedding in French Polynesia, People magazine reported on Wednesday. The star of "Shrek" and "Dreamgirls" and Edmonds, a film producer, exchanged their vows on a private island off Bora Bora on Jan. 1. The couple needed a ceremony on US soil to make the marriage legal in this country. But Murphy, 46, and Edmonds, 40, told People in a statement they would not do that and had decided to remain friends. "After much consideration and discussion, we have jointly decided that we will forego having a legal ceremony as it is not necessary to define our relationship further," the statement said. "While the recent symbolic union in Bora Bora was representative of our deep love, friendship and respect that we have for one another on a spiritual level, we have decided to remain friends," it added. Murphy, 46, was divorced from his wife of 13 years, Nicole, in 2006. They had five children together. Last year, he fathered a daughter with Melanie Brown of the Spice Girls, but did not acknowledge paternity until four months after the baby was born. Edmonds split last year from her husband, R&B singer/songwriter Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. They had two sons together
