<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nuclear power generator British Energy said it would need to spend about 50 million pounds ($98 million) to get four reactors running again at its Hartlepool and Heysham 1 power stations. British Energy operates eight nuclear power stations built since 1965 to a unique UK design, and in recent years it has struggled with cracks in boilers and other faults linked to ageing. The latest occurred in October at Hartlepool and Heysham 1, where it discovered corrosion in concrete and steel plugs in the top of the boilers that surround the reactor cores. The 50 million pounds of remedial work will fall in the financial year to March 2009, which one London analyst said was as he and many peers had expected. Nuclear power provides 18 percent of electricity in Britain. Shares in British Energy, which operates eight out of 10 nuclear power stations in the country, rose 1.25 percent to 526.5 pence by 0946 GMT, valuing the group at around 5.5 billion pounds. "The shares are up due to relief that we now have some kind of visibility," said the analyst. "And they were helped by being preceded by a fairly bearish research note on the costs yesterday." British Energy said in a statement: "It is currently expected that return to service of the four units will be achieved in a phased process over the second and third quarters of financial year 2008/09." The 50 million pounds bill comes on top of 20 million pounds this year spent investigating for corrosion in the 54 km of wire wrapped around each of the eight concrete boiler plugs in each unit. The wires are used to "pre-stress" the concrete, and British Energy said it would have to build in a mechanism to lock in the existing stress. It will also improve the structure of the plugs, upgrade their cooling systems and enhance monitoring instruments. British Energy said it was managing its trading position to deal with the phased return of the 4 reactors. As of Jan. 13, it had fixed price contracts in place for approximately 58.6 terawatt hours for this financial year at an average contract price of 41 pounds per megawatt hour and for about 37.1 terawatt hours next year at an average contract price of 42 pounds per megawatt ho
