<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 18 (bdnews24.com)  State-run oil and gas company Petrobangla has snubbed a proposal to supply gas to some proposed power plants to be built after 2011, officials said Friday. The Power Division had made the proposal to Petrobangla but the gas agency said no to the proposal arguing that the country's gas reserve was depleting. The division wants Petrobangla to supply gas to six plants once they are built after 2011. It also asked Petrobngla to feed another under-construction power plant, Meghnaghat 2, but the agency said they would not be able to do so. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed said they would, however, continue to supply gas to some-under construction plants as they had signed agreement for gas supply. "Supplying gas to power plants to be built after 2011 will depend on new sources of gas," Jalal told bdnews24.com by phone Friday. He said they advised the government to make arrangement for use of both gas and diesel to produce electricity in the plants built after 2011. But the agency would supply gas to the rental power plants, the officials said. Petrobangla director Mahbubur Rahman said they had taken the decision not to supply gas through discussion with the Power Division. Another official of Petrobangla, preferring not to be named, said their decision came as a recent exploration at Magnama in the Bay of Bengal failed to find gas. The six proposed plants are 210 MW Siddhirganj power plant, 225 MW Shikalbaha combined cycle plant, 150MW Sylhet combined cycle plant, 225 MW Ghorashal plant, 450 MW Ashuganj plant and 450 MW Mehgna Ghat-3 plant. The government has planned to build these plants to meet rising electricity demand. The government is trying to add another 3,775 MW electricity from the new plants, for which 744 mmcf gas is required. The government also wants another 1,840 MW from the private sector initiatives, and it will require 315 mmcf gas. Currently, the country has a proven reserve of 21 tcf, and 15 tcf is recoverable. Daily production of gas is 1,700 mmcf. bdnews
