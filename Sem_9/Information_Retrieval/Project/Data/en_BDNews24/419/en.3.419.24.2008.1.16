<TITLE> Mozambique floods could be worst in memory: UN </TITLE>

 MAPUTO, Jan 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Devastating Mozambique floods, which have killed seven people and displaced tens of thousands, could be the worst in recent memory, the United Nations said on Wednesday. U.N. spokesman Luis Zaqueu said although Mozambique's emergency services were well-prepared, the scenario could change as raging waters engulfed agricultural lands and wrecked infrastructure like roads and bridges in the centre of the southern African country. "Because the rains started earlier than predicted and the high water levels -- which are getting higher each moment -- the situation is likely to be worse than in 2000-2001," Zaqueu told Reuters. Floods, compounded by a series of cyclones, in 2000-2001 were the worst disasters in memory in Mozambique and killed 700 people and caused $500 million damage. This year heavy downpours in several southern African countries have resulted in swollen floodwaters rushing through central Mozambique. Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi also suffered floods, killing several people and leaving thousands homeless. International development charity ActionAid warned on Wednesday up to 250,000 people in Mozambique were at risk as the lower Zambezi valley is being flooded by waters from the giant Cahora Bassa dam. "There are 250,000 people living downstream of the dam. This is the second year they will lose everything," ActionAid Mozambique director Alberto Silva said in a statement. ActionAid said it had worked with the Mozambique government to rescue 5,400 people who were cut off by the flood waters of the Zambezi River -- one of Africa's longest which cuts across four of Mozambique's provinces for 500 km (313 miles) before it reaches the sea. "More areas will be affected but the government has so far managed to reduce the death toll, damages are visible on infrastructure," Zaqueu said. At least 60,000 people have so far been rescued -- most of them by helicopter from trees and rooftops. But there are still about 7,000 people in highly dangerous areas who needs to be evacuated. The country's relief agency, the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), is using motor boats and canoes to carry the people rescued to a ferry which then transports them to resettlement areas. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said food distribution in affected areas needed to be increased as many badly hit towns and villages already face food shortages.
