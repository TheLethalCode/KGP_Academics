<TITLE> Thaksin-backed party forms new Thai coalition government </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's People Power Party (PPP), backed by ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, won support of five small allies on Saturday to lead a coalition government emerging after a Dec. 23 general election. The PPP-led coalition, announced one day after the Supreme Court cleared the party of charges of poll irregularities, paved the way for its pugnacious leader, Sumak Sundaravej, to become prime minister at the age of 72. Its success is expected to speed up Thaksin's return from exile, mostly in London, 16 months after he lost power in a peaceful military coup. Thaksin, highly popular among rural Thais, faces corruption charges related to a past property transaction made by his wife and false corporate disclosure by a listed firm owned by his family. The former telecom billionaire said in London this week he would probably return to Thailand in a few months. The PPP-led coalition, commanding about two-thirds of the 480 lower-house seats in parliament, is expected to get its nominee elected as parliament president on Tuesday, one day after the lower House of Representatives convenes its first session. PPP officials say parliament is expected to hold a special session next Friday to choose Samak as prime minister. "This coalition helps break a political deadlock. Our combined 315 seats should create a fairly strong government," Samak told a press conference to announce the coalition. "The country has gone through enough of a crisis and has wasted a lot of time. It's time we set forth to tackle problems," he said, referring to the period that Thailand was run by a military-appointed government since the September 2006 coup. Samak, a former Bangkok governor, and his PPP members are widely regarded as fronts for Thaksin and his dissolved Thai Rak Thai Party whose 111 executives -- Thaksin included -- have been banned from politics for five years in the aftermath of the coup. PPP, formed by Thaksin's supporters and campaigning on his populist policies, emerged the biggest party after the election last month capturing nearly half of its 480 lower house seats. The election results widened a wealth and geographical devide between urban and rural Thais. The election results confirmed PPP's overwhelming strength in poor northeast and northern Thailand, while the opposition Democrat Party, Thailand's oldest political party, won the most seats in capital Bangkok and its stronghold in the south. But the Democrats failed to make much headway in the national election, despite Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party being disbanded after the coup. The Supreme Court on Friday absolved PPP of vote fraud in the election last month. It also rejected a suit seeking to annul the poll on the grounds of irregularities in early voting. Analysts said the court ruling was the final nail in the coffin for the political aspirations of the generals who removed Thaksin in the September 2006 coup. Samak said on Saturday his government would probably run the country for a still undetermined period before calling another general election under an amended constitution. He did not elaborate but his remarks were broadly in line with what Thaksin proposed in Hong Kong in December. The former Thai leader told Reuters in an interview then that Thailand should install a national unity government to rule for two years after the December election. "If you take it seriously, and if you push ahead with the plan, I think two years should be about the time to bring back our unity, bring back our full democracy and let the people decide again," he said
