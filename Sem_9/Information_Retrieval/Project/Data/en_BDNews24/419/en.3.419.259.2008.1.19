<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe are banking on their spinners to shine in helpful conditions if they are to upset Pakistan in a low-key five match one-day international series starting on Monday. Zimbabwean skipper Prosper Utseya said he had formed a good bowling partnership with left-armer Ray Price and slow bowling was their best chance of causing an upset in the series. "We are young in age but some of our players have played over 50 ODIs and we have recent victories over Australia and West Indies," the off-spinner said. "Pakistan are favourites but we are in a positive and confident mood." The series is being played under a cloud with the home nation in the grip of a political uncertainty ahead of elections next month and reeling from a series of terrorist bomb attacks and the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. Security has been tightened for the visiting players with authorities keen to have an incident-free tour that would convince Australia to carry out their scheduled visit in March-April. Utseya said his team had been strengthened with the return of experienced players like Price and Gary Brent and the series was a good opportunity to push their case for a return to test cricket. "We are keen to return to test cricket and we need to win some matches. Hopefully we can make an impression with our spin bowling," Utseya added. Zimbabwe had one-day wins over Bangladesh and West Indies last year in their 15 matches and also upset World Champions Australia in the Twenty20 World Cup. Pakistan have decided to use the series to test out some of their leading performers on the domestic circuit and have included three uncapped players in their line-up for the first two matches next week. "We don't want to underestimate Zimbabwe. They are an improving side but this is a good opportunity for us to try out one or two new faces in every match," Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik said. Squads: Pakistan: Shoaib Malik (captain), Younis Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Kamran Akmal, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Kamran Hussain, Samiullah Niazi, Rao Iftikhar, Sohail Tanvir, Yasir Arafat. Zimbabwe: Prosper Utseya (captain), Tatenda Taibu, Brendan Taylor, Chamu Chibhabha, Elton Chigumbura, Gary Brent, Ray Price, Timycen Maruma, Keith Dabengwa, Hamilton Masakadza, Stuart Matsikenyeri, Christopher Mpofu, Tawanda Mupariwa, Vusi Sibanda, Sean William
