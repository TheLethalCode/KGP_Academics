<TITLE> Uruguay more of a team than Argentina, says Abreu </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MONTEVIDEO, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uruguay striker Sebastian Abreu fuelled the rivalry with neighbours Argentina on Wednesday by saying his team were doing more with fewer resources. "We're better because we have shown it," Abreu told reporters four days before Uruguay visit Buenos Aires for a World Cup qualifier. "At international level, you need team work as well as individuals and Uruguay have done very well as a team. "(Argentina) have had some sporadic individual performances but, against defensive teams and under strong pressure, they haven't functioned well." Argentina have drawn their last six games, including four World Cup qualifiers, and have scored only three goals in the process despite boasting talent such as Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero. Abreu said Uruguay would not just sit back and defend against them. "It's up to us at the start of the game to make them realise that we have not come to play for a draw, that we want to dominate the game and take another three points," he said. Argentina are third in the 10-team group with 13 points from eight games while Uruguay, joint topscorers with 16 goals, are a point behind in fifth place
