 Dhaka, Oct 11(bdnews24.com)The DMP chief has defended police failure to arrest Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed even after a warrant of arrest has been issued in connection with a corruption case. "The legal aspects are being looked into regarding his arrest," commissioner Naim Ahmed told reporters at a regular briefing Saturday. Pressed by reporters, he said: "Not everyone can be arrested right away. Mr Mojaheed's stature has been taken into account, apart from looking into the legal aspects of the warrant." The former minister under the BNP-led alliance government is wanted in the Barapukuria Coalmine Project corruption case. Other co-accused in the case include former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former ministers in the immediate past BNP-led government, Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Matiur Rahman Nizami Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid. Asked about Khaleda's court appearance, he said the date Oct 12 has been set for the former prime minister to appear in special court in the Barapukuria case. Additional security measures have been taken on the occasion." He also said he expected no trouble regarding BNP's protest programme the same day. Nayeem Ahmed spoke at a regular press parley after the monthly crime-based meeting in Rajarbagh Police auditorium. He said overall crime is in hand, but that the juvenile crime trend continues. "They are working as agents to big criminals." He suggested anti-crime campaigns targeted against juvenile crimes. Nayeem said arrest warrants were issued against 14,590 people. Of these, 2,209 were arrested including 1,855 convicted in September. bdn
