 WASHINGTON, Fri Oct 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Friday the government would move aggressively to address the financial markets crisis, but he acknowledged that anxiety was feeding on itself which was sending stocks plummeting. "The United States government is acting; we will continue to act to resolve this crisis and restore stability to our markets," Bush said in the White House Rose Garden. "We can solve this crisis and we will." He also said the Treasury Department would work quickly to implement the $700 billion financial sector rescue plan approved a week ago and that the Securities and Exchange Commission was stepping up its efforts to fight manipulation in the stock market. Speaking from the White House, Mr Bush said the market turmoil was being driven by "uncertainty and fear". BBC online reported. He spoke as world markets tumbled amid rising fears of a global recession, despite interest rate cuts and huge cash injections by central banks. The US recently approved a $700bn (409bn) rescue plan for Wall Street. Mr Bush said: "We are a prosperous nation with immense resources and a wide range of tools at our disposal. We are using these tools aggressively." He said the US was working with other world governments to steady the markets. "We're in this together and we'll come through this together," he added
