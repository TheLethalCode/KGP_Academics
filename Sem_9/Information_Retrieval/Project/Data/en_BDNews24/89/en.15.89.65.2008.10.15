 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)From Delhi to Dhaka, More than 120 million children across South Asia will have clean hands Wednesday as they mark Global Hand Washing Day. "From Kabul to Karachi, Kathmandu to Kerala and Colombo, Wednesday is likely to break all records as millions and millions of children practice the power of proper sanitation through soap suds," Unicef said in a statement. Bangladesh along with 62 countries around the world will observe the day for the first time this year, as part of the International Year of Sanitation. More that 16 million children from 73,000 primary and secondary schools countrywide will wash their hands simultaneously and pledge to promote hand washing with soap after going to the toilet and before a meal. According to Unicef figures, South Asia has the world's highest population, 48 percent, living without toilets with some 778 million people in the region still relying on open defecation, the riskiest sanitation practice. Hygiene promotion activities, like simple handwashing, can help rid the region of diseases like diarrhoea, worm infestations, hepatitis and acute respiratory infections like pneumonia, the biggest killers of children. Poor hygiene practice is also one the greatest environmental hazards and the greatest contributor to malnutrition in the region. A 2008 ICDDR,B study, funded by the government and Unicef, on health impact in 34 districts found that 14 percent of people said they washed hands with soap before eating, but less than one percent of surveyed people were seen to do the same during observation. Similarly 56 percent of people reported washing hands with soap or ash after defecation, but only 17 percent of people were seen to do this during observation. The Global Public Private Partnership on Hand Washing involves soap companies, NGOs, and UN organisations, as a contribution to the International Year of Sanitation. It is intended to go beyond 2008 and will be marked annually in coming years, said Unicef. bnd
