 TORONTO, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)- An opening stand of 66 set Sri Lanka on the way to victory as they beat Pakistan in the quadrangular Twenty20 tournament final in Canada. Spinner Ajantha Mendis took 3-23 as Sri Lanka restricted Pakistan to 132-7 from their 20 overs after winning the toss. Veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya (40) and Mahela Udawatte (25) then laid the platform for Sri Lanka's victory. Despite a flurry of wickets, Chamara Kapugedera (17 not out) saw them home by five wickets with an over to spare. After Pakistan were put in, opener Shoaib Khan junior - who made his international debut earlier in the four-team tournament - fell early for a duck when he gave a return catch to Dilhara Fernando. His opening partner Salman Butt anchored the innings with 44 before becoming one of Mendis's three victims, but Misbah-ul-Haq (23 not out) was the only other Pakistan player to pass 20. Mendis had been rested when the sides met at the round-robin stage on Saturday, when Pakistan won by three wickets - but the emerging spinner made the difference with three wickets in mid-innings, including the dangerous Butt and captain Shoaib Malik, and his 11 wickets from three games earned him the player of the series award. Sri Lanka got off to a superb start, with man-of-the-match Jayasuriya smashing pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar for two consecutive sixes while Udawatte plundered 14 from an Umar Gul over. The rapid scoring meant Pakistan were always up against it, and although Malik took a tidy 2-17 with his off-spin, the hapless Akhtar's three wicketless overs cost 40 runs. Jayasuriya won the man-of-the-match award, while Mendis was named as player of the series for his 11 wickets in three matches. Sri Lanka were subsequently fined 10% of their match fees - apart from captain Mahela Jayawardene, who was fined 20% - for slow over-rates by match referee Jeff Crowe. Meanwhile, in the third-place play-off, Zimbabwe posted 184-5 against Canada before bowling the hosts out for 75 to claim a 109-run victory. After Canada chose to field first, Zimbabwe opener Hamilton Masakadza's 79 off 52 balls was more than the hosts' entire team managed. He added 89 for the second wicket with Justice Chibhabha (40), while Elton Chigumbura (25 off 10 balls) and Keith Dabengwa (16 off six balls) pitched in with some big hitting in the final stages. Canada never really got going as skipper Prosper Utseya took 3-26, Tatenda Taibu picked up three stumpings and only Abdool Samad's 29 saved the hosts from total humiliation. Courtesy : BB
