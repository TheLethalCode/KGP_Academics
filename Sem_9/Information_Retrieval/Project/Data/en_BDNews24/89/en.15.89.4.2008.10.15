<TITLE> Canada's Conservatives win stronger minority </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ottawa, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the first Western leader to face the electorate since the financial meltdown, won a strengthened second minority government mandate on Tuesday, provisional results showed. The Conservatives, who convinced voters they were the best choice to steer Canada through the economic turmoil, will still need opposition support to govern. The result was Canada's third minority government in four years. Harper's Conservatives defeated a Liberal minority government in the January 2006 election. With five of Parliament's 308 seats yet to be counted, initial television projections put the Conservatives at 142 seats, up from the 127 they held before the election. The opposition Liberals were at 78, down from 95. The separatist Bloc Quebecois were down one to 47 seats, the leftist New Democrats were up three to 33 seats. Independents took three seats and the Greens had none. That would mark the worst showing in at least 20 years for the Liberals, who have historically governed Canada for longer than any other party. "We were expecting a minority government. It looks like it will be a strengthened one. We're going to get right back to work, that's what people expect us to do," Health Minister Tony Clement told Global Television. The Conservative leader ran on a modest platform of keeping taxes and spending under control. The Liberals proposed introducing a carbon tax while cutting income taxes and boosting social spending, and Harper said the Liberal plan would throw Canada into recession. Liberal leader Stephane Dion, a bookish francophone who sometimes makes mistakes in English, found it difficult at a time of relatively high energy prices to pitch his carbon tax plan. "It's a hard sell," Liberal strategist David Smith conceded to CTV. Dion started to cut into Harper's lead during the campaign as he charged the prime minister, a former economist who is also fairly wooden, was not doing enough to prevent financial contagion from spreading into Canada. But the Conservative lead over the Liberals widened again in parallel with specific action taken to improve Canadian bank liquidity. Harper had the added benefit that markets and the Canadian dollar rebounded on Election Day. SPLIT ON THE LEFT One of Dion's problems was that he was competing with two other parties on the left nationally -- the New Democrats and the Greens -- and a fourth party, the separatist Bloc Quebecois in the province of Quebec. Each party made the pitch it was the best one to deny Harper a second term. Just as a split on the right guaranteed Liberal rule from 1993 to 2006, a split on the left now helped the Conservatives. A Conservative majority looked within reach at times during the campaign, but besides questions on the economy, Harper lost major support in Quebec over cuts to arts funding and plans to give adult sentences to violent youth criminals. The careers of both Harper and Dion were on the line. Dion, who became Liberal leader in 2006, was re-elected to Parliament but due to his national defeat his party under its rules will automatically have to decide whether to replace him. The Liberals' Smith questioned what the point was of having an election when the result appeared to be another minority government. Harper had said earlier that even if he only got a second minority, he would be in a stronger position than he had been 2 1/2 years into the minority mandate he won in the 2006 election since opposition parties would be less likely to topple him for now. "This was about trying to reset the clock and move forward," Conservative strategist Sandra Buckler told CTV.
