 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has amended its party constitution, keeping a provision for associate organisations and foreign outfits, the AL acting president announced Monday. "The meeting has approved the proposed amendment of its constitution," Zillur Rahman told reporters after emerging from a meeting of the party's central working committee. "The associated organisations and foreign outfits will remain," he said. The meeting was still ongoing, he told reporters, adding that the party would apply to the Election Commission for registration on Oct 15 (Wednesday). The AL CWC resumed its meeting Monday on amendments to its constitution ahead of registration with the Election Commission. The meeting, which was adjourned on Saturday, was being chaired by Zillur Rahman at the office of the AL president's Dhanmondi office. A special committee finalised the draft amendment Sunday, keeping provisions for associate and overseas bodies. On Saturday, the CWC had decided to maintain "all the associate organisations" and overseas units of the party. It also demanded scrapping of two clauses of the newly amended Representation of the People Ordinance, giving the EC powers to cancel candidature and declaring utility bill defaulters unfit. Among others presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam were present in Sunday's CWC meeting. AL has been involved in debate over the past week over whether the party would keep associate organisations or not. As a pre-condition to being registered with the EC, parties are expected to amend their constitutions in line with the newly amended Representation of the People Ordinance, which bars associate organisations. The Election Commission has set a deadline of Oct 15, for parties to apply for registration. Nine parties have applied so far. bdnew
