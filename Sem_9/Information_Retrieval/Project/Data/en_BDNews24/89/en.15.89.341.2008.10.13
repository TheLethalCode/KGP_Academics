 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) - The government will sit with business leaders and policy makers to devise a strategy to safeguard Bangladesh export earnings in the face of global economic recession, the commerce adviser said Monday. Hossain Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the commerce ministry would call the meeting next week but had not yet fixed the date. He said the meeting was meant to explore if the worldwide credit crisis could affect Bangladesh's export sector. "All those concerned with exports from government agencies and the private sectors were asked to be present at the meeting," the adviser said. Hossain Zillur said the government was closely observing the global economic situation. "If the meeting suggests any strategy, we will take it on an urgent basis," the adviser said. Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said: "We have nothing to be worried about over the current global situation as we do not export luxury products." "People in the USA and Europe may stop buying expensive goods due to the economic crisis. But they will not stop buying our cheap products," Hoque said. He nevertheless stressed taking cautionary steps. "We have to be careful so that the manufacturing cost of products does not rise. The government has to stay alert so production is not affected by any means." The BKMEA president cautioned the government against any increase in gas and electricity prices. "Energy prices have come down on the international market. Government cuts in energy prices will help cut manufacturing costs," Hoque said. The government has set the target for export earnings in 2008-09 at $1,630 crore, 15.5 percent higher than the previous fiscal's $1,450 core. The commerce adviser announced the target after a meeting with garment manufacturers and exporters on Oct 8. In fiscal 2007-08, Bangladesh earned $ 1,411 crore from exports. According to the target for the present fiscal year, $658 crore would come from the knitwear sector and $568 crore from the woven garment sector. That is respectively 19 percent and 10 percent higher than the last fiscal year's targets. Besides, $57 crore is expected to come from frozen foods and $16 crore from farm goods. bdnews
