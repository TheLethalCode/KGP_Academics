 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday refused to hear an appeal by former prime minister Khaleda Zia's to quash the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case, saying it did not have the jurisdiction. The High Court bench of Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haq and Justice Moinul Islam Chowdhury said they were 'embarrassed' to hear the appeal Tuesday. The court sent the case docket to the chief justice to take further action in this regard. Khaleda's counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told reporters: "The High Court felt embarrassed in hearing Khaleda Zia's appeal." "The hearing will be held by another chosen by the chief justice." Earlier in the hearing, barrister Rafique said due procedure had not been followed in taking the case into cognizance. The bench pointed out that a previous High Court verdict had stated that Emergency Powers Rules does not give the court jurisdiction to grant bail or hear appeals for quashing corruption cases. bdnew
