<TITLE> Global 'meltdown' won't hit Bangladesh share market: DSE </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's capital market is likely to remain relatively unscathed from the present global financial fallout, according to market operators. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, the Dhaka Stock Exchange's chief executive officer, told a press briefing Sunday that there were no reasons, other than panic, for the market to fall. Panic has hit shares on a global scale in recent days as a $700 billion bank bailout in the US has failed to shore up investor confidence in markets around the world. The IMF has warned the world's financial system was near "meltdown", while an emergency meeting of European leaders was battling to ensure measures to keep market panic from triggering the most severe global downturn in decades. But while many of the world's financial markets are heavily exposed to the crisis as a result of their strong links to the US market, Bangladesh remains relatively immune to the deepening financial catastrophe. "The Bangladesh market would have suffered if our local financial institutions had any investments in the securities of those economies facing the fallout," Salahuddin said. "It would also have been of concern if our capital market was dependent on foreign investments," he said. "However, there is no capital account convertibility." "Bangladeshi companies cannot directly invest abroad, and therefore there is no fear of our financial institutions or banking sector suffering from the global crisis," stressed the DSE chief. Salahuddin went on to say any unwarranted panic by investors would only result in unnecessary losses. "As far as I can see, smaller investors are becoming nervous without properly analysing the situations, while smart investors are seeing this as an opportunity," the CEO said. "Nevertheless, as always, it is advisable that investments should be based on fundamentals and not rumours," he said. Securities and Exchange Commission official Farhad Ahmed echoed the DSE chief's comments, saying the correlation between the international and domestic market remained weak. "As foreign portfolio investment totals less than 3 percent, there are no reasons for our market to be affected by the global financial crisis," said Farhad. bdnews2
