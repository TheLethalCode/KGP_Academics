<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had a closed-door meeting with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at her Shaheed Mainul Road home on Friday evening, a staffer at the former prime minister's house said. The meeting, kept under wraps, started at 7:10pm and came to a close at 8:45pm. The details of the meeting could not be known immediately. Speaking to bdnews24.com by telephone late at night, the adviser acknowledged the meeting but would not say anything "at the moment". He said he would fill the media in on Saturday about the issues they had discussed in the meeting. Earlier, the staffer, who did not want to be named, told bdnews24.com after the meeting had started, "The adviser has come. He is talking with madam." The BNP is scheduled to sit with the government on key electoral issues on Oct. 15, the deadline for registration with the Election Commission. But a highly-placed government source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Oct. 15 'dialogue' had been deferred by a day. Before the meeting, BNP joint secretary general Abdullah Al Noman, who hails from Chittagong as does the adviser, met Khaleda. On Sept. 12, a day after Khaleda was released on bail from special jail, Hossain Zillur and three other advisers met with her at her home. bdne
