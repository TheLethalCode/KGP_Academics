<TITLE> Kuranyi sulk unsettles Germany before Wales game </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Kuranyi's decision to walk out on the national team has disrupted Germany's preparations for Wednesday's 2010 World Cup Group Four qualifier against Wales and overshadowed Saturday's important 2-1 win over Russia. Germany lead the group after three matches, one point ahead of the Welsh, but Kuranyi's sulk has not made coach Joachim Loew's task any easier against a Wales team he believes will sit back and play for a draw. The Schalke 04 striker was upset at being left out of the 18-man squad to play Russia and did not return to the team hotel after watching the first half in the stands. Loew said on Sunday he will not be selected again. "We were all surprised by Kevin's early departure," he said on the German soccer federation's web site (www.dfb.de). "When we announced the squad for the Russia match on Saturday afternoon, Kevin came straight up to me afterwards and expressed his disappointment that he wasn't in the 18-man squad and would have to sit in the stands," he added. "I can understand his disappointment but the reaction that happened that evening is neither acceptable nor understandable." Both Loew and his captain Michael Ballack acknowledged that Germany rode their luck to hold on for victory against Russia in Dortmund, the visitors denied only by a post near the end. The match in Moenchengladbach against Wales, who struggled to a 2-0 win over tiny Liechtenstein on Saturday in Cardiff, will be very different, Loew said. "Wales will play more defensively and will probably go for a draw," he said in a television interview. STEP UP Wales coach John Toshack, who included six Under-21 internationals in the side on Saturday, wants his older and more experienced players to up their game on Wednesday. "The younger lads have done well," he said. "Maybe a few of the older ones can step up to the plate and do a bit more." They will also need to make sure they take full advantage of their chances after missing from the penalty spot in all three qualifiers they have played. Although they have only beaten the Germans twice in 15 matches since they first met 40 years ago and never scored more than once in a match against them, Wales have drawn their last two competitive matches in Germany. In 1995 they drew a European Championship qualifier 1-1 in Dusseldorf and escaped with a 0-0 draw when they met them in Frankfurt in another European qualifier in November last year, although the home side were already assured of their place in the finals when they met. Probable teams: Germany: Rene Adler; Arne Friedrich, Per Mertesacker, Heiko Westermann, Philipp Lahm; Bastian Schweinsteiger, Thomas Hitzlsperger, Michael Ballack, Piotr Trochowski; Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski. Wales: Wayne Hennessey; Chris Gunter, Craig Morgan, Ashley Williams, Lewin Nyatanga, Gareth Bale; Simon Davies, Carl Fletcher, David Edwards, Jason Koumas; Craig Bellamy. Referee: Laurent Duhamel (France
