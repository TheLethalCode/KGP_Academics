 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Tuesday was happy to allay doubts about the Dec 18 Jatiya Sangsad elections on the back of final printing of the countrywide voter list with photographs. "There was much doubt and debate centring on the countrywide voter list," said Huda as he was formally handed the final voter lists from across the country at the Election Commission Secretariat Tuesday noon. "As the final list has been completed properly, all doubt and apprehension over the election on this account can be put to rest." Replying to reporters' questions, the CEC said: "There is no more scope to become voter afresh before the upcoming election." "When the scheduled updating of the voter list begins early next year there, from Jan 2 to 31, voters will have the chance to enlist anew or change address." Asked about BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's refusal to enlist so far, he said: "The Election Commission has special power to enlist a person in before the election schedule is announced." He added this would be in "exceptional cases" only. The former prime minister had been approached by the EC on a number of occasions, but she had so far refused to enlist "while behind bars". Former PM Sheikh Hasina, on the other hand, enlisted as a voter on June 10 from special jail. According to new electoral law, no unlisted person can contest elections. On behalf of the army and Operation Nabojatrathe national voter list and ID card projectmilitary secretary of army headquarters Maj Gen Md Shafiqul Islam formally handed over the final printed copy of the full voter list to the CEC in a special ceremony. Election commissioners Muhammad Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain, EC secretary Md Humayun Kabir, director of the voter list project Brig Gen Shahadat Hossain Chowdhury and officials concerned were present. The total number of voters in the country, according to the list, stands at 81,130,973. In the now controversial 2006 voter list, the number was 92,441,868. Expressing gratitude to all, including funders of the project, and addressing the people, the CEC said: "The Ninth Parliamentary election will be a credible election, because you have applied your voting right without any fear." "Today is really a day of happiness for the country, a day of pride. As the voter list has been completed ahead of the roadmap, whoever says what, there is no doubt regarding the December election." Maj Gen Shafiqul Islam said: "Operation Nabojatra has come been concluded through the handing over of the final voter list." "We feel a great sense of achievement as we succeeded in completing a momentous task with the cooperation of the Election Commission, the armed forces and the civil administration." He claimed that this time the voter list is greatly improved, with fewer flaws even than any Western developed nation. He said if minor flaws remained, the EC would correct them in good time. Election officials have also said 130 additional people will be added to the voter list on Oct 20, who have made late applications through various indispositions, such as illness or being abroad. After the incumbent commission took office it decided to introduce voter lists with photographs and to issue ID cards in a countrywide project, over 18 months from May last year to October this year. bdnews24.c
