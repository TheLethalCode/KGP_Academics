<TITLE> Rooney and Heskey partnership key to more success </TITLE>

 LONDON, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The attacking partnership of Emile Heskey and Wayne Rooney is the key to England enjoying more success when they face Belarus on Wednesday (1830 GMT) looking for a fourth successive World Cup qualifying win. England coach Fabio Capello, speaking after England's 5-1 win over Kazakhstan at Wembley Stadium in Saturday's Group Six game, said Rooney, who scored twice, benefits most when he plays alongside the taller, muscular Heskey. "Rooney is very important for us," said the Italian, "but Heskey is important for him. Defenders always go towards Heskey. "When that happens, it creates a bit of space for Rooney  whose movement is so good." Although Heskey has not scored for England in his last 16 appearances over the past five and a half years, Rooney is bang in form, scoring in his last four matches for Manchester United and England with his international tally now standing at 17 goals in 47 appearances. TACTICAL SWITCH Their partnership only began to work properly in the second half of Saturday's match after Rooney spent a frustrating time wide on the left for the first 45 minutes. A halftime tactical switch, in which midfielder Gareth Barry was replaced by Shaun Wright-Phillips who took Rooney's place on the left with Rooney moving to a more central role, unlocked the determined Kazakh defence and gave England victory. The only change likely to the England starting lineup will be in defence if skipper John Terry recovers from a back injury in time to play. If he does not, Capello may stick with stand-in Matthew Upson, although Joleon Lescott would also be in contention to play alongside Rio Ferdinand at the heart of the defence. England travel to Minsk looking for a fourth successive win in Group Six from their first meeting with Belarus. England have never previously won their four opening matches in a World Cup qualifying campaign. The home side have three points from two matches after losing 1-0 to Ukraine and beating Andorra 3-1. They look like being disadvantaged without their best player and skipper, midfielder Aleksandr Hleb who is doubtful after twisting ankle ligaments playing for Barcelona last month. Striker Vitaly Rodionov is also injured but his BATE Borisov team mates, midfielders Sergei Sosnovsky and Igor Stasevich have recovered from illnesses and are expected to play. "At least I don't have to give any pep talk to my team playing England," Belarus coach Bernd Stange told reporters before the game. "I think my guys will go out with nothing to lose and they should not have any fear of their opponents," said the German. Probable teams: Belarus: Yuri Zhevnov; Egor Filipenko, Sergei Omelyanchyuk, Vladimir Korytko, Dmitry Verkhovtsov; Aleksandr Kulchy, Anton Putilo, Oleg Strakhanovich, Aleksandr Pavlov, Vitaly Kutuzov; Vitaly Bulyga England: David James; Wes Brown, Rio Ferdinand, Matthew Upson or John Terry, Ashley Cole; Steven Gerrard, Gareth Barry, Frank Lampard; Theo Walcott, Emile Heskey, Wayne Rooney Referee: Terje Hauge (Norway)
