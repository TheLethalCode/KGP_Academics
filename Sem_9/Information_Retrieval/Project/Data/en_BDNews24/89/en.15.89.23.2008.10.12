<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has deferred an appeal hearing of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina invovling a graft case filed by businessman Noor Ali. A full bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, adjourned the hearing for two weeks on Sunday after the defence appealed for more time. Hasina's lawyer, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, told the court: "We have not received a copy of the High Court order that rejected her bail plea. We could not file a regular appeal against the ruling. We need a further two weeks for that." Barrister Fazle Nur Taposh, another of Hasina's lawyers, told bdnews24.com: "We hope to get a High Court copy this week. Then we will file a regular appeal in the next week." The Awami League chief on Oct 5 challenged the HC order turning down her bail prayer in the Noor Ali case. Appellate Division chamber judge Joynul Abedeen on Oct 6 ordered her lawyers to file a regular 'leave to appeal' by Oct 12 against the HC order. The High Court had previously rejected Hasina's bail petition, on Sept 29, in the case. Prior to that, on Aug 7 2007, it had granted her bail in the case, which eventually came to be halted by the Appellate Division on Aug 27. Unique Group chairman Noor Ali filed the case against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helal and his wife Roopa Chowdhury on June 13 2007, accusing them of extortion amounting to Tk 5 crore. Arrested on July 16 2007, Hasina was released on parole on June 11 2008 for treatment abroad. bdnew
