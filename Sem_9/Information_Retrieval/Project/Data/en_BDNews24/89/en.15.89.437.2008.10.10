 KABUL, Fri Oct 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed a provincial intelligence officer and wounded three policemen in the eastern Afghan province of Khost on Friday, a provincial official said. Taliban insurgents have vowed to intensify their attacks in Afghanistan this year, using suicide and roadside bombings in a campaign to bring down the Afghan government and eject the international forces that support it. The incident took place in the Baak district of Khost province, some 150 km east of the capital Kabul. "The suicide bomber on foot attacked the detective while he was going to work," provincial district governor Sayed Ahmad Khan said. "No civilians were killed or wounded in the attack." Violence in Afghanistan has this year hit its worst level since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, prompting some in the Afghan government and its allies consider talks with the Taliban insurgents to end the war
