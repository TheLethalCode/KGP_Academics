<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The four-party alliance has asked the Election Commission to reply by Monday to their written request for extending the party registration deadline, so they may go to polls. "We would like a reply within 24 hours," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after a meeting of the alliance at his NAM apartment. "Otherwise, it will appear that the Election Commission is deferring its decision in order to leave the four-party alliance out of the elections," he said. BNP and its political ally Jamaat-e-Islami submitted two separate written applications to the Election Commission on Sunday asking it to extend the deadline for party registration by one week. In a letter signed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, BNP said it would be difficult for the party to complete registration by Oct 15 as it was to sit in dialogue with the government on Oct 14. If given one more week, the party will be able to complete its necessary preparations for registration, the letter said. Jamaat, in its letter signed by secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed, stated the same reason. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in the afternoon told reporters: "[BNP and Jamaat] have informed us that it will be difficult for them to apply for registration by the deadline. We will let them know our decision about a deadline extension on Oct 15." Delwar had previously said the party would make a decision on registration after its dialogue with the government. The chief adviser is scheduled to sit in separate talks with both BNP and Jamaat on Oct 14. After a meeting with EC officials Sunday, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said: "We will have discussions with the government on many issues including new electoral laws and party registration." He said BNP would discuss the issue of registration at the party forum and with its alliance partners after the dialogue before taking a final decision. Nazrul pointed out it would not be possible for them to take necessary preparations for registration in just one day following the dialogue with the government. The EC appears to be taking a positive stand regarding registration, he added. Top election officials told bdnews24.com on Saturday that the EC might respond positively to calls for extending the deadline for party registration, but would not give any concessions over re-demarcation of constituencies or recent alterations to the new Representation of the People Ordinance. So far nine political parties have applied for registration. bdnews24.com/sm
