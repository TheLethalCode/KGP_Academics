<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Johan Elmander missed three good first-half chances in Sweden's 0-0 draw with Portugal in World Cup Group One qualifying on Saturday. The Bolton Wanderers striker went wide in the seventh minute after excellent work by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who was captaining his country for the first time in the absence of Henrik Larsson. Twenty minutes later Elmander fired a volley over the crossbar before he failed to hit the target with a header just before halftime. The result gave second-placed Sweden five points from three games, one ahead of Portugal in third spot. Denmark lead the way on seven points. "I sure am pleased with my players and their accomplishments tonight, although I am a little disappointed with the result. We should have won this game," said Sweden coach Lars Lagerback, underlining that Sweden had more goal chances. "I promise I will give Portugal a tough game in MarchThis group is still very open and it's going to be very tight. I will not underestimate Hungaria and Albania." The home side were disciplined and well organised, with Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo reduced to a peripheral figure especially in the first half. The Manchester United player, booed by the crowd for most of the match, helped set up a scoring opportunity for Hugo Almeida in the 33rd minute but his effort was saved by keeper Andreas Isaksson. FEW OPPORTUNITIES "It was not a game with a lot of opportunities," Portugal coach Carlos Quieroz told reporters. "We tried to use our style, but the Sweden team knew we like to build up our game from behind and they forced us to change our tactics. We had to pass the balls straight to the forwards. "We forced Sweden to play a bit different than they usually do, and they did the same to us." The visitors raised their game after halftime and got better as the match wore on. Joao Moutinho went narrowly wide in the 52nd minute before Raul Meireles forced a fine stop from Isaksson. With some of the Swedish players tiring in the latter stages, most notably Elmander and midfielder Sebastian Larsson, the Portuguese launched several counter-attacks but never came close to scoring. "At the end of the day, it was a good performance. Not from an entertainment point of view, but from an emotional point of view," added Quiero
