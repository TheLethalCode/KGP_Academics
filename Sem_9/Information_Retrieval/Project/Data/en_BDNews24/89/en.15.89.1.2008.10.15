 LA PAZ, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Uruguay fought back from 2-0 down at halftime to force a remarkable 2-2 draw in Bolivia at 3,600 metres above sea level in their World Cup qualifier on Tuesday. Uruguay, forced by injuries and suspensions to make seven changes to the team that lost 2-1 in Argentina on Saturday, trailed at the break to a double from forward Marcelo Martins.

The draw left Uruguay fourth in the 10-team South American group with 13 points from 10 games, ahead of Chile on goal difference, while Bolivia stayed eighth with nine points. Abreu's goal prevented Bolivia moving within two points of Chile, who have played only nine games, and one of Uruguay and Ecuador, with the latter also having a game in hand. Martins opened the scoring in the 15th minute with a low shot into the corner of the net from the edge of the area after collecting a poor headed clearance from Diego Lugano. He was also helped by slack defending in the 42nd minute when he escaped his marker and scored with a free header from Ronald Garcia's cross. Uruguay's fightback began when Bueno, who had a shot parried by Carlos Arias with the score still goalless, rose between two defenders to head in Bruno Silva's cross. Uruguay continued to look more threatening as Maximiliano Pereira shot over and they equalised when Abreu rose at the far post to head in a curling cross from the left
