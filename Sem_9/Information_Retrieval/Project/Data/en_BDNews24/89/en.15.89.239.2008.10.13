 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Local airlines have welcomed a cut in jet fuel prices by the government, from $1.00 to $0.88 a litre. "The new price is effective from today," M Anwarul Karim, chairman of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, told bdnews24.com Monday. M Haider Uzzaman, convener of Bangladesh Private Airlines Association, told bdnews24.com that the decision would greatly benefit the aviation sector, which had suffered as fuel prices rose in line with global oil prices. He said the price had been effective from Sunday midnight. Nafiz Ahmed, director (planning) of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, said: "We are already stocking up on fuel at the reduced price." According to the website of International Air Transport Association, the global price of jet fuel was $114.90 a barrel in the first week of October, marking a 14.8 percent drop over the previous month. But, according to IATA, jet fuel price marked an overall 20.9 percent rise over the past year. Haider Uzzaman said the cost of jet fuel in Bangladesh rose steeply from the start of the year and reached $1.25 a litre in May. In Sept, the price was cut down to $1.00. The BPAA official said the country's aviation industry suffered adversely on the fuel price hike. Many private airlines had to cancel flights due to the immediate impact. bdnews24.
