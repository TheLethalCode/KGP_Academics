<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Tuesday tabled 10 demands including lifting of emergency when they met chief adviser Fakhrudin Ahmed and his five cabinet colleagues. One of their key demands was that the government declare May 30, the day BNP founder General Ziaur Rahman was killed in a coup in 1981, as public holiday and national mourning day. They also insisted that "the historic 7th of November", the day in 1975 the then major general Ziaur Rahman was restored to his army post through a campaign by troops loyal to him, be re-introduced as public holiday. Ameer Matiur Rahman Nizami led an 11-member team to the talks at the CA's office. Party secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojahid, wanted in a high-profile corruption case, was part of the delegation. The Jamaat leaders said lifting of the state of emergency was necessary to ensure participation of all political parties in the parliamentary elections scheduled for Dec 18. They called the corruption cases including Gatco, Niko and Barapukuriaand other charges against political leaders motivated and demanded they all be thrown away. They said they would rather prefer polls under the original Representation of People's Order (RPO). They also renewed demand that dates of Upazila Parishad elections be moved by a month, elections be held according to the old boundaries of the 300 constituencies. The meeting lasted more than two hours. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, briefing reporters, said he "fully agreed" with Jamaat that civil servants loyal to "a certain (political) party" benefited from changes made by the current caretakers. The Jamaat leaders alleged that the changes were made based on "perception" that the four-party alliance government had placed party supporters in key positions. "Changes have already been made in the administration. If they still have any specific proposals, the government will consider them," the commerce adviser said. The Jamaat leaders also proposed that the Upazila polls be held at least one month after the general election or there be "a reasonable space" between the two. bdnews24
