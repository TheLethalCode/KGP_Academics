<TITLE> Thai protest leaders get bail, campaign to roll on </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders of a long-running protest in Thailand were bailed on Friday after surrendering to police on charges of inciting unrest, leaving them free to continue their five-month campaign to unseat the government. "Everything is done. There is no detention," Sondhi Limthongkul, the head of the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), told reporters after his release from a Bangkok police station. Sondhi's surrender to police along with six colleagues followed the Court of Appeals' quashing of treason charges against them on Thursday. The court issued fresh warrants for inciting unrest, which still carries seven years in jail. Two PAD leaders already in custody were freed on Thursday on the lesser charge, a major blow to the government and police who had been hoping to decapitate the protest movement by gradually picking off its leadership. The original arrest orders for treason were issued on Aug. 27, the day after PAD protesters armed with golf clubs, stakes and machetes stormed a state television station, broke into ministries and overran the prime minister's official compound. They have been at Government House ever since, making it the heart of a long-running anti-government campaign that spilled over into running battles with riot police this week in which two people died and more than 400 were injured. Several police officers were shot, one was skewered with a flag pole and another was run over by a truck. The unrest has hit investor confidence and distracted policymakers from focusing on slowing economic growth and the fallout from the global credit crisis, analysts say. Consumer confidence hit a 10-month low in September. Police have denied PAD claims they fired explosives into the crowd this week, insisting they only used teargas. QUEEN WEIGHS IN Several doctors at Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok's top medical school, have launched a campaign to deny medical services to police or politicians involved in the clashes, the worst street violence in Thailand in 16 years. Queen Sirikit has donated 1 million baht ($29,200) to help treat the injured, including the police, and sent a wreath to the funeral of a 28-year-old woman killed in Tuesday's running battles with police. The PAD leaders trumpeted the latter action as explicit support for their cause from the palace, which wields enormous moral clout in a country where the king is regarded by many as a demi-god. Thailand's political crisis dates back to late 2005, when the PAD first started its street protests against then Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. It has meandered through a military coup to elections and back to street protests. It is not clear how it will end, although pressure is mounting on army chief Anupong Paochinda to launch another coup, even though he has repeatedly stressed that it would do nothing to defuse the underlying political tensions. In a front page interview with the Bangkok Post on Friday, ex-premier and former army chief Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who resigned from the cabinet on Tuesday to take responsibility for the police action, said a coup was the only solution. "After the military steps in, power should immediately be returned to the people and an interim government can be formed in which every party takes part," he was quoted as saying.
