<TITLE> Del Bosque keeps Spanish bandwagon rolling </TITLE>

 MADRID, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain coach Vicente del Bosque's skilful handling of Luis Aragones's Euro 2008 winning side sees them continuing to build on their summer success as they head into a clash with their closest rivals Belgium on Wednesday. The European champions top qualifying Group Five having won all three of their opening matches without conceding a goal, and lead Belgium and Turkey by two points. Former Real Madrid boss Del Bosque may come across as a kindly grandfather figure, in contrast to his more cantankerous predecessor, but his man-management skills are an important factor in the side continuing to sweep all before them. There has been no resting on laurels in the wins over Bosnia, Armenia and Estonia. Barring odd lapses in concentration, like midway through the second half of Saturday's 3-0 victory in Estonia when the hosts almost scored twice, Del Bosque has managed to keep the side hungry, the passing quick, and the work rate high. "Spain have a winning momentum and we have to make the most of it to build up the best advantage we can in the group," the 57-year-old said after the victory in Tallinn. Goalkeeper Iker Casillas kept another clean sheet helping Spain set a new national record of just over 700 minutes without conceding a goal, bettering the previous best of 691 minutes achieved in 1992-3. The side have gone 26 matches unbeaten and few changes are likely for the match in Brussels, though Marcos Senna could return to replace Xabi Alonso in the midfield holding role. UNBEATEN BELGIUM Unbeaten Belgium are set to make at least one change from the side which defeated Armenia 2-0 on Saturday with Ajax defender Thomas Vermaelen expected to return in place of Axel Witsel, who is likely to drop back to the bench. Belgian coach Rene Vandereycken left Vermaelen out of the team against Armenia to avoid him getting suspended for the Spanish encounter after he picked up a yellow card in their previous match against Turkey. "Spain is a whole other game. There will be certain changes carried out. Firstly because this is a different, tougher, more attacking opponent and the secondly because some players won't manage two games at this level in four days." Vandereycken said. Probable teams: Belgium: Stijn Stijnen; Timmy Simons, Vincent Kompany, Guillaume Gillet, Jelle van Damme, Thomas Vermaelen; Steven Defour, Jan Vertonghen, Marouane Fellaini, Moussa Dembele; Wesley Sonck. Spain: Iker Casillas; Sergio Ramos, Carles Puyol, Juanito, Joan Capdevila; Santi Cazorla, Xavi, Marcos Senna or Xabi Alonso, Andres Iniesta; David Villa, Fernando Torres
