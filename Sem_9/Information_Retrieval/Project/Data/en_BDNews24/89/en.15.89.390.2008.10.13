 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Bank governor has said the financial service sector in Bangladesh, 'little exposed' to banking and investment firms in the US and Europe, will not suffer the consequences of the global financial shock, but cautioned that a prolonged global downturn could hit aid and trade. BB chief Salehuddin Ahmed was speaking at a roundtable on the Impact of Financial Crisis in South Asia, held on Oct 10 at the World Bank headquarters in Washington DC on the sidelines of the WB-IMF annual meeting, a government press release said Monday. The central banker also said that commercial banks were taking appropriate measures so that funds kept in foreign banks were not adversely affected. Their liquidity was good and no commercial banks had approached the central bank over cash-flow crises nor had they request any bailout support, the governor said. However, he cautioned, if the global crisis is prolonged or deepens even further in developed countries, the effect via sectors like export and import may have an adverse impact on Bangladesh's economy. If official development assistance and bi-lateral funding slow down, it may create acute pressure on the government budget and affect ongoing programmes such as poverty alleviation, social safety net, health and education, Salehuddin observed. The governor's comments came as Europe and Australia, following the US, were trying to prevent a world wide market crash by shoring up their banks. As the IMF warned that the world's financial system was near "meltdown", an emergency meeting of G7 leaders was battling to ensure measures to keep market panic from triggering the most severe global downturn in decades. bd
