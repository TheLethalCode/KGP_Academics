<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League central working committee resumed a meeting Monday on amendments to its constitution ahead of registration with the Election Commission, a party member said. The meeting, which was adjourned on Saturday, was being chaired by acting party president Zillur Rahman at the office of the AL president's Dhanmondi office. "Today's meeting might approve a proposed amendment of the constitution," AL deputy publication secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil told bdnews24.com. An AL sub-committee finalised a draft amendment Sunday, keeping provisions for associate and overseas bodies. On Saturday, the CWC had decided to maintain "all the associate organisations" and overseas units of the party. It also demanded scrapping of two clauses of the newly amended Representation of the People Ordinance, giving the EC powers to cancel candidature and declaring utility bill defaulters unfit. Among others presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam were present in Sunday's CWC meeting. AL has been involved in debate over the past week over whether the party would keep associate organisations or not. As a pre-condition to being registered with the EC, parties are expected to amend their constitutions in line with the newly amended Representation of the People Ordinance, which bars associate organisations. The Election Commission has set a deadline of Oct 15, for parties to apply for registration. Nine parties have applied so far. bdnew
