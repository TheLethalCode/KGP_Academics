 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)Responding to joint pressure by the BNP and its political allies, the Election Commission has decided to extend the deadline for parties to apply for registration to Oct 20. "The EC has decided to extend the deadline for parties by five days," the chief election commissioner told reporters Monday. He added: "The commission will still complete its registration process, including scrutiny of applications, by its own deadline of Oct 30." ATM Shamsul Huda made the announcement after a meeting of the commission, with fellow commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain attending. "There will be no further extension of the deadline," the CEC warned, replying to reporters. BNP and its political ally Jamaat-e-Islami submitted two separate written applications to the Election Commission on Sunday asking it to extend the deadline for party registration by one week. The four-party alliance said Sunday it was giving just 24 hours for the EC to respond. The CEC had however told bdnews24.com on Saturday afternoon that the EC would consider extending the time if any of the parties submitted a written request. The BNP and Jamaat quickly grabbed the offer and sent the letters the following morning. The CEC said that the remaining members of the four-party alliance, Bangladesh Jatiya Party and Islami Oikya Jote, had also submitted written petitions Monday morning. "We would like a reply within 24 hours," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after a meeting of the alliance at his NAM apartment. "Otherwise, it will appear that the Election Commission is deferring its decision in order to leave the four-party alliance out of the elections," Delwar had said. Asked if the BNP ultimatum worked, the CEC said: "I wouldn't look at it that way." In the letter signed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, BNP said it would be difficult for the party to complete registration by Oct 15 as it was to sit in dialogue with the government on Oct 14. If given one more week, the party will be able to complete its necessary preparations for registration, the letter said. bdn
