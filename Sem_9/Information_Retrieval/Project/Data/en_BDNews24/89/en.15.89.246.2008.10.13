 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)The communications ministry wants to begin a Tk 10 crore feasibility study from December on an ambitious metro-rail system for the capital. The decision was taken at an inter-ministerial review meeting on Monday, on the proposed Dhaka metro-rail project, chaired by communications adviser Ghulam Quader. The feasibility study is the first step in constructing the mass transit system that will include up to 60 kilometres of subway and elevated rail with the aim of carrying 44,000 people per hour. "The average speed of traffic in Dhaka is just five kilometres per hour. This situation is intolerable," Ghulam Quader told the meeting. "We must start the project as soon as possible. We want to rescue the time we have lost," the adviser said. "It is our failure that we could not implement the project before. Hopefully we can start the feasibility study by December," communications secretary Mahbubur Rahman told reporters after the meeting at the communications ministry. The meeting disposed of a sticking point over financing, deciding to complete the feasibility study at a cost of Tk 10 crore from government funds. The mass transit plan was initially floated in 2002, although protracted bureaucratic wrangling over the feasibility study's funding mechanism left the project hanging. The debate over funding has seen the communications ministry, who insist the money should be raised from public funds, at loggerheads with the planning ministry, who favour foreign donors. "As we will carry out the feasibility study on a build-operate-own-transfer (BOOT) basis, we don't need to go to donors such as the World Bank or others," the secretary said. "The process will be overly time-consuming if we are compelled to seek donors for the feasibility study," added Rahman. However, several highly placed officials, including Planning Commission member Jafrullah Khan and additional secretary to the economic relations division Md Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, continue to back World Bank funding for the feasibility study. Bangladesh Railway director general Md Belayet Hossain told the meeting that no donor would fund the feasibility study: "We must finance this project ourselves." The meeting also decided that Bangladesh Railway should divert funds from some of its existing projects to implement the project. "The railway's DG will submit a proposal for the funding mechanism within seven days. We will then invite tenders for the feasibility study in November, after necessary formalities," said the communications secretary. The BR chief told bdnews24.com that it would take around one-and-a-half years to complete the feasibility study. In August 2003, Bangladesh Railway sent a proposal through the communications ministry to the planning ministry to carry out the feasibility study using government money. But an inter-ministerial meeting later decided that the decision should only be taken after finalisation of the Dhaka strategic transport plan (STP), which only received the government nod in Feb 2008. In October 2005, the railway sent another proposal to the planning ministry seeking Japanese assistance for the study. However, no further action was taken when Japan refused to fund the project. The following year the same proposal sought government funding. In May 2006, the planning ministry returned the proposal, again suggesting the railway should find a donor for the study after approval of the STP. Finally, in April this year, the communications ministry recommended the study could be undertaken using government money, provided the funds were reimbursed in the form of a "success fee" from the winning bidder. The communications ministry sent this proposal to the planning ministry for approval. However, in another twist, a meeting of the special project evaluation committee in September, presided over by the communications secretary, once more recommended foreign funding. "The search for funding has been delaying the feasibility study for too long," Abdul Halim, a retired additional director general and a former director of the project, told bdnews24.com. bdnews
