 Dahaka, Oct 13, 2008 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bureau of Educational Information and Statistics (BANBEIS) is conducting a base line survey on post-primary education from Oct 15 to Nov 15, the first such survey in nine years. The last such survey, funded by the UNDP, was held back in 1999. The survey has been named 'National Education Survey-2008' under the government's National Education Survey and Training (NEST) Programme, BANBEIS director Ahsan Abdullah told reporters at a press briefing Monday. Some 1,600 data collectors, including 1,000 teachers, have been appointed for the survey, the BANBEIS director said. "They will collect data from 34,000 educational institutions, including both government and non-government secondary schools, colleges, madrasas, vocational institutes, universities, medical colleges and other post primary institutions," he said. BANBEIS has trained the surveyors based on the use of a 15-page questionnaire. On average, each surveyor will be assigned 21 educational institutions. On the monitoring process, Ahsan Abdullah said the district education office would check the data collected in the first phase, followed by BANBEIS officials. Assuring accuracy, Abdullah said they prepared the roster in such a manner that there would be very little probability of an individual teacher of being assigned to collect data from his own area. "If it is found that any institution has furnished false data, then that institution will be in trouble." Ex-vice chancellor of Jahangirnagar University Prof Kazi Saleh Ahmed, working as a consultant in the project, called for all cooperation towards institution members. "Without the cooperation of teachers we can't be successful in our survey," he said. Officials of the education ministry and BANBEIS were present at the briefing among others. bdnews
