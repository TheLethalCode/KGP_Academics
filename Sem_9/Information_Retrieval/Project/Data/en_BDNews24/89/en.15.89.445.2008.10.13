 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) Adviser Anwarul Iqbal has said he is hopeful of a positive outcome from government talks with BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami set for Tuesday. "I am hopeful the dialogue will be successful. If there is any problem the two parties face, it will be solved there," the local government adviser told reporters Monday. Anwarul Iqbal termed the moves of parties to amend their constitutions for registration as positive. Saying there was no doubt now that national elections would be held on the announced date, he added: "There will not be any rigging there." On allegations by some quarters that the government was forcing parties to participate in the polls, the adviser said: "We should not care about such allegations. We have to see the result of elections." "But the government's position on the elections is wholly positive," he said, stressing that the caretaker government was determined to hold a free, fair and credible election. Citing the August city corporation and municipal polls, Anwarul Iqbal said: "Bangladesh has not witnessed such elections before. We hope the upcoming elections will be as good and there will not be any rigging there." The government and the Election Commission have announced the national election date to be held on Dec 18 and the EC has said that it would announce the election schedule at the outset of November. bdnew
