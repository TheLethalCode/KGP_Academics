 London, Oct 12 (BBC Online) - An earthquake in the southern Russian republic of Chechnya has killed at least 13 people and injured more than 100 more, officials say. The magnitude 4.7 quake damaged roads, power supplies and communications across the Caucasus, and was felt as far away as Georgia and Armenia. It was centred 40km (25 miles) east of the Chechen capital, Grozny, said the US Geological Institute. A rescue team has been sent from Moscow to co-ordinate the relief effort. The tremor struck at around noon (0800 GMT) on Saturday and lasted some 40 seconds. It left hundreds of residents sheltering in tents and more than 50,000 homes without electricity, a day before regional elections. "Each and every (victim) will receive the necessary help support," Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov was reported as saying Russia's Interfax news agency. "We must not forget that we have elections tomorrow They must go ahead as a happy event for all residents of Chechnya."
