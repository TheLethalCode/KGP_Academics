<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)A paltry Tk 130 crore has so far been declared as income previously undisclosed, with the Oct 31 deadline just three weeks away and the top taxman threatening tough action after the cut-off time. In the three months to September, the NBR received statements from only 1,250 people who paid just Tk 27 crore in tax on the money they had failed to declare earlier. "There will be no extension of the time beyond Oct 31," said NBR chairman Muhammad Abdul Mazid, speaking to bdnews24.com Thursday, of the provision with just seven percent penalty on top of the regular tax rate. "From Nov 1 onwards, my officers will be out hunting the dodgers," he said. "NBR will be really tough on those failing to legalise their money this time," Mazid said. The finance adviser, in his budget speech last June, gave the July 1-Oct 31 window of opportunity to those who failed to "disclose" their "legally earned" income in their tax statements. Last year, the response had been much betetr to a similar government gesture. From July to September last year, 42,449 people "legalised" Tk 5,213 crore and the government was richer for Tk 802 crore. Last year, the government initially gave two months and then extended the time by two more months. But this time many people are using their income tax returns to show the undisclosed money as they got four months together, according to the NBR chief. Some, he said, were submitting both together because of the deadline coinciding with the submission of the income tax returns. Mazid said he was expecting people to rush at the eleventh hour. "We have some idea about who may have undisclosed money. We will be out chasing them from Nov 1," he said. bdne
