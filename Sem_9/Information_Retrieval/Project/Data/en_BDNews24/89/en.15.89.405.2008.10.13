<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)With the general elections just two months away, the home ministry and the national coordination committee on serious crimes have asked the Anticorruption Commission for its list of graft convicts. "The ministry and the national coordination committee today sent letters to the ACC, seeking the list of those convicted for corruption. The list will be sent to them in a day or two," ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal told a regular press briefing Monday. More than 100 politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and trade union leaders have so far been convicted following the anticorruption drive launched by the reconstituted ACC. Col Iqbal referred to the section 11 (5) of Emergency Powers Rules and said: "The section says those convicted during the state of emergency in the trial court for corruption cannot participate in the election." The ACC director general also mentioned sub article 2 (Gha) of article 66 of the constitution that bars the convicts from participating in the election. When his attention was drawn to a top lawyer's allegations, as reported in the press Monday, that an army officer was supervising the preparation of the cause list for the Supreme Court Chamber Judge, he said, "The commission has not appointed any such army officer to the court. "The army officers who have come to the Commission on deputation are posted in the head office or divisional offices." He said that the ACC was taking initiatives to activate the corruption cases now stalled due to high court orders. bd
