<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation on Saturday announced a 20-member squad for the Merdeka Cup giving the priority to the senior players. "I have actually considered those players who have temperament in international matches and shine in the ongoing B. League," said coach Shafiqul Islam Manik at a press conference at the BFF House on Saturday. Manik's predecessor Abu Yousuf had earlier laid emphasis on young players during the SAFF Championship and saw an early exit from group stage, and this time Manik said they would try to show better performance instead of winning a match or qualifying for the semifinals in Malaysia. "We have no specific target in the meet, but we will hope the players do something unexpected," said the former national defender. The eight-nation cup is scheduled for Oct 15-25 in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with Bangladesh playing against Mozambique, Myanmar and Vietnam in the group stage matches. Abahani medio Prantosh Kumar Das and Farashganj SC striker Enamul Haq have been called by the national team for the first time while Motiur Munna and Mohammad Sujon have returned to the fold after a long period. Munna has also been given the armband of captaincy for the first time while Sujon will be his deputy. Goalkeeper Aminul Islam last time led the nation in the SAFF Championship. Manik, well-known as a defensive coach, picked eight defenders along with seven midfielders and only three strikers. Asked whether the team might suffer from strikers' crisis if any one was booked or injured, Manik said that he had the attacking midfielders. About the exclusion of veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed, Manik said that except the performance they had also considered the players' commitment and discipline. Bangladesh will begin the campaign on Oct 16 taking on Mozambique before facing Myanmar on Oct 18 at Shah Alam Stadium in Kuala Lumpur. The last group match against Vietnam will be held on Oct 20 as top two teams from each group will qualify for the semifinals, scheduled for Oct 23. The final will be held on Oct 25. Squad: M Aminul Islam and Biplob Bhattacharya (goalkeepers), Hasan Al Mamun, M Ariful Islam, Rajani Kanta Barman, Mohammad Sujon, Wali Faisal, Amit Khan Shuvro, Kazi Nazrul Islam and Mofazzal Hossain Saikat (defenders), Enamul Haq Sharif, Pranotosh Kumar Das, Motiur Munna, Mamunul Islam, Arman Aziz, Abul Hossain and Jahid Hossain (midfielders) and Mohammad Enamul Haq, Jahid Hasan Emily and Mohammad Robin (strikers).
