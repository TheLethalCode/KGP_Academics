 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has ordered Khaleda Zia and others accused in the Barapukuria coalmine case to appear in court on Oct 16, after the former prime minister missed Sunday's scheduled appearance citing illness. Other accused in the case, former ministers MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam appeared in the special judge's court on Sunday, while Motiur Rahman Nizami and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan failed to show also citing illness. Lawyers for the accused, who had earlier been ordered to appear in court on Oct 12 (Sunday), asked for two weeks' time. But Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque set the next hearing date for Oct 16. All four ministers of the previous four-party alliance government have secured bail from the High Court in the case, as has Khaleda. Two other accused in the case who are currently in custody, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, were not produced in court as they were undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheih Mujib Medical University Hospital and BIRDEM prison cells. State counsel Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told the court that the police had not submitted any report to the court on nine other accused in the case facing arrest. They nine are: former ministers of the immediate past BNP-led government Saifur Rahman and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, Aminul Haq, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former energy secretary Nazrul Islam, former chairman of Petrobangla SR Osmany, former director (mines and minerals) Moyeenul Ahsan, former managing director of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd Sirajul Islam, and chairman of Hosaf Group Moazzem Hossain, the local agent of the Chinese firm which was awarded the running of the coal mine. The ACC pressed charges in the case against 16 people, including Khaleda Zia, on Oct 5. Arrest warrants against the nine accused who had not secured bail were issued on Oct 6. The case was filed on Feb 26 this year on charges of irregularities and corruption in awarding the production, management and maintenance work of Barapukuria coalmine to a Chinese firm. The charge sheets said the agreement with Chinese firm Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) caused losses of Tk 158.71 crore to the government. bdnew
