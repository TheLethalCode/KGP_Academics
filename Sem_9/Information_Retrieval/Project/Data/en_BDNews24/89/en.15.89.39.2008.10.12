 Kandahar, Afghanistan,Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and NATO-led forces killed 65 Taliban militants overnight near the provincial capital of the southern province of Helmand, the provincial governor's spokesman Daud Ahmadi said on Sunday. The leader of the group of Taliban militants, Mullah Qudratullah, was also among the dead, he said, but there were no casualties among Afghan and NATO forces. Most NATO troops in Helmand are British. The Taliban militants were preparing to attack the capital of Helmand, Lashkar Gah, late on Saturday when the joint operation was launched, Ahmadi said. One Afghan police vehicle was destroyed in the fighting, but there was no other damage. "There was an air strike against enemy forces in Lashkar Gah last night," said a spokeswoman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) who confirmed there were Taliban casualties, but declined to give any number. "We are still gathering information," she said. Britain has some 8,000 troops in the mainly desert province, which is bisected by a lush strip of land irrigated by the Helmand River where about half the world's of opium is grown. British troops have been engaged in almost daily battles with Taliban militants in Helmand since they moved into the province in 2006, but the capital Lashkar Gah has been relatively quiet. bd
