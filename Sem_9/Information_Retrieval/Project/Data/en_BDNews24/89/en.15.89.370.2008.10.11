<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  All-rounder Jacob Oram hammered a quick unbeaten fifty as New Zealand recovered from their early setback to post 212 for nine against Bangladesh in the crucial second one-day international at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. Oram, batting at number seven, remained unbeaten on 75 while Jeetan Patel made four not out and they together put on 45 runs for the unbroken ninth wicket. The 30-year-old middle batsman, who also rescued the visitors in their first match making 57, came down heavily on left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak to smash him 6,6,2,4,6 and 1 in the final over to help New Zealand beyond the 200-mark, 11 runs over their first ODI total of 201 for nine. Bangladesh paid the price when they dropped Oram on 26 by Razzak off Shahadat Hossain, as the left-handed batsman hammered four sixes and five fours in his 62-ball innings. The hosts had another setback as television replays showed Jeetan Patel clearly run out as the last New Zealand batsman, with the visitors at 169 for nine, though no appeal was against him by Bangladesh. Swing bowler Syed Rasel gave the Tigers a smashing start, ripping through the Black Caps top order, followed by strikes from spinners Nayeem Islam and Shakib Al Hasan, but in the end Bangladesh failed to fully cash in on the New Zealand collapse. Rasel penetrated the top order with accurate line and length, while spinners Nayeem and Shakib exploited the early damage to reduce the visitors to 115 for seven. But they failed to maintain their momentum allowing New Zealand to shoot the 200-mark. Openers Jesse Ryder and McCullum started cautiously, posting 24 runs in the first five overs, and faced trouble as Rasel got into his swing after his first over with the left-handed medium pacer making the first break by forcing McCullum to be caught at the first slip by Junaed Siddique for a 15-ball 12. Rasel, struck two successive fours by Ryder in his fifth over, soon had one-down Jamie How, who was struggling to build up his game facing 16 balls for a duck, caught by Mohammad Ashraful at midwicket in his next over. In contrast with his first one-day performance, Rasel removed Ryder for 33, with a slower delivery in his seventh, to return a super unbroken 10-over spell of three for 23, his second best haul after four for 22 against Kenya in 2006. His new partner Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, one of the main architects in Bangladesh's seven-wicket win over New Zealand in the first ODI, dismissed Scott Syris with an extra bounce to force the Kiwi to be caught at the first slip by Junaed. After being reduced to 45 for four in 14.1 overs, Ross Taylor and Daniel Flynn put up brief resistance to add 41 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter was dismissed by Nayeem Islam. Skipper Mohammad Ashraful had brought in spinner Nayeem to replace Shahadat Hossain, who was struck two successive fours by Flynn, with the off-spinner bowling the left-handed batsman in his very second delivery to get his first international wicket after debuting on Thursday. Shakib Al Hasan and Nayeem took three more wickets between them to reduce New Zealand to 167 for nine in 44.5 overs, but failed to bundle them out. Nayeem and Shakib grabbed another two wickets each for an identical 20 runs. b
