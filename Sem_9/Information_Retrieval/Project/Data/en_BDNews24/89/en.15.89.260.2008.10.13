 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Oct 19 to hold the final hearings on two separate writ petitions, challenging the gazette on delimitation of constituencies and challenging the state of emergency. A HC bench of justices Mir Hashmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain gave the order on Monday on the petition filed by BNP leader Abdul Mannan on Aug 6. The HC stayed the enforcement of the gazette for three months a day after the petitioner filed. It also issued a rule nisi against the government and the Election Commission asking them to explain why the gazette should not be declared unconstitutional and cancelled. The EC published the gazette, on re-demaraction of 133 out of 300 electoral constituencies on July 10. The same HC bench also set Oct 19 to hold the final hearing on the writ petition challenging the legality of the announcement of the state of emergency, filed by Supreme Court lawyers. The petitioners include M Solimullah, Mohsin Rashid, Nahid Sultana Juthi and Abdul Mannan Khan. MI Faruki, counsel for the petitioners, after the order said: "The issue is urgent. So the final hearing of the petition is required." On July 20, after an initial hearing, the HC issued a rule nisi against the government asking it to explain why the declaration of the state of emergency was not illegal. It also asked the government to explain why the Emergency Powers Law, Emergency Powers Ordinance and Emergency Powers Rules should not be declared unconstitutional. The court asked the government to report when the election would be held and how the power would be transferred. The president imposed the state of emergency on Jan 11 last year. bdnew
