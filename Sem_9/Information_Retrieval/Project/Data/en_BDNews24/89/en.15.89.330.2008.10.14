<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Energy ministry officials will meet Wednesday to discuss a proposal from Cairn Energy regarding potential gas finds in Hatia and Moghnama. Cairn has newly proposed a higher than contract price to Petrobangla, for any gas found in the two fields, or that the Scottish oil company be allowed to sell to a third party. "A meeting will be held at the ministry Wednesday on Cairn's proposal," energy division secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com. According to an official of Petrobangla, Cairn sank exploration wells in Moghnama and Hatia last winter, although they so far failed to locate any commercially extractable gas. Cairn has now proposed conducting three-dimensional surveys at the two sites for further exploration. According to Cairn Energy, the company has already spent around $117 million on exploration, which will not be covered by cost recovery. For three-dimensional explorations at least another $30 million would have to be spent, said Cairn, adding that if gas was found construction of offshore platforms and other expenses would amount to a further $100 million. The Cairn proposal said selling gas from Moghnama and Hatia would not be viable at current rates. If gas is found there, it has to be sold at a higher price than fixed in the production sharing contract (PSC). Otherwise, Cairn should be permitted to sell its share to a third party, the company said. Petrobangla said the upper limit for the price of gas has already been fixed through the PSC signed with Cairn. According to the PSC, gas cannot be purchased at more than $120 dollars per thousand cubic feet. If the Cairn proposal is to be accepted the PSC has to be amended, said Petrobangla. At present Cairn is producing 38 million cubic feet of gas from Sangu, the only offshore gas field in the country. Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed told bdnews24.com that they feel commercially extractable gas will be found in Moghnama. Cairn Energy is an independent Scottish based oil-gas exploration and production company operating in South Asia. bdnew
