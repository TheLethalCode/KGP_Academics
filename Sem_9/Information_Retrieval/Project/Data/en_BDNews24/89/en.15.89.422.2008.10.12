 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com) - The government will import 14 lakh tonnes of diesel in the next Boro season, one lakh more than last season, a senior government official said on Sunday. After a ministerial meeting on fuel supply for Boro cultivation, energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com that the government agencies had been asked to take necessary steps to ensure untrammelled supply of fuel. Import and supply of fuel were the key issues on the meeting's agenda, he said. Anwarul Karim, chairman of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, told bdnews24.com that 14 lakh tonnes diesel would be imported from December to May. The government imported 13 lakh tonnes of diesel during the last Boro season. BPC has storage capacity for 2.72 lakh tonnes. A senior official of the ministry, who attended Sunday's meeting, said home ministry and Bangladesh Rifles were asked to take steps to resist fuel smuggling. Officials of the energy and mineral resources ministry said the government had taken initiatives to ensure smooth transportation of fuel to remote villages, northern part of the country in particular. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority was asked to ensure navigability of rivers and set up pontoons at river stations for smooth delivery, they said. In the past, oil supply has been hampered as some rivers were not navigable. The BIWTA would detect areas of rivers prone to silting and undertake necessary dredging operations. Railway authorities have also been asked to make available additional bogeys and a special engine to transport fuel. According to the agriculture ministry, Boro paddy was farmed on 45 lakh hectares of land last year. As many as 11,83,860 diesel-fired and 1.61 lakh electric pumps are used for irrigation during Boro cultivation. bdnews
