 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com) Awami League has finalised a proposal for necessary amendments to the party constitution, a pre-condition to being registered with the Election Commission, keeping provisions for associate and overseas bodies. Presidium member Tofail Ahmed heads the sub-committee, to recommend changes to the Awami League constitution, which the party's central working committee convened on Saturday. Tofail told newsmen Sunday after an hours-long meeting that the party's central working committee had finalised its recommendations. He added that the Awami League had always been willing to be registered with the EC. Presidium members Abdur Razzak and Matia Chowdhury were present in the meeting among others. The recommendations come in the wake of legal requirement that political parties follow the newly-prescribed rules that have necessitated re-writing of constitutions to be eligible for registration. "We have deliberated over the CWC's proposals from Saturday," Tofail said. The Awami League central working committee decided Saturday to maintain "all associate organisations" and overseas units of the party. This past week has seen the party debate, often publicly, whether to keep the so-called "associate" organisations. Replying to queries on expatriate organisations on Sunday, Tofail said the sub-committee meeting discussed how such organisations could be kept functional. After Saturday's CWC meeting reporters were told that the expatriate organisations will be operated in line with the rules and regulations of the respective countries. Tofail also affirmed the CWC meeting decision that nominations of candidates for the Dec 18 parliamentary polls will be made by grassroots leaders. "The sub-committee will present the proposals in Monday's CWC meeting. Then the central committee will take the final step for registration," added Tofail. The other main proposed amendments address women's representation at various levels of the party, budgets and accounts of party income and expenditure, activities and power of the general secretary and party treasurer. The party's general secretary will endorse all statements on election expenditures of the party made by treasurers and submit these to the EC within the required 90 days, according to the proposed amendment. Tofail also asked the EC to come up with a more flexible attitude in a bid to hold a free, fair and credible national election. bdnews2
