 RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five-times champions Brazil are capable of losing to any team right now, said striker Robinho ahead of Sunday's World Cup qualifier in Venezuela. Brazil, winners of all 17 previous meetings against Venezuela, slumped to a shock 2-0 defeat against their South American rivals in Boston in June to spark a form slide that has left coach Dunga's job in danger. Dunga's side have won once in four outings since, beating Chile 3-0 last month and failing to score in the other three games. "A lot of people don't treat Venezuela with respect because they don't have much tradition but we know that nowadays Brazil can lose to any side," Robinho told reporters. "We have to work with humility and respect. "Each game is a different story, this match is a new chapter and Brazil will be prepared," added the Manchester City player. Full back Maicon said confidence sagged after the defeat by Venezuela. "It was a game in which nothing went right for us and it damaged morale because we had never lost to Venezuela," said Maicon. "But that was a friendly and this is a World Cup qualifier. They will attack us because they are confident and have the backing of the crowd but we hope to play a good game.
