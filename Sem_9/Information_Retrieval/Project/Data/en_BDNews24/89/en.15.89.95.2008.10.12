<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  Defending champions Khulna got off to a winning start in the National Cricket League on Sunday when they handed a 35-run defeat to Sylhet in the inaugural four-day match with a day to go at the Birshreshtho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Rajin Saleh hammered 135, league's first century, but could not avert the defeat as Sylhet were all out for 256, chasing a winning target of 292 set by hosts Khulna, on the third day. Spinner Robiul Islam (5/60) and pacer Ziaur Rahman (4/63) shared nine wickets as the visitors collapsed to 120 for eight after having resumed the day on 18 for 2. Sylhet were 34 for five at one stage. Rajin Saleh and Sharifullah then put on 86 runs for the sixth wicket before the latter was trapped leg before by Robiul for a patient 38 off 93 balls to leave the side at 120 for six, triggering a mini collapse to lose another two wickets on the identical total. Then, Rajin pairing with Shuvashish Roy raised another hope of exceeding the total to take the side to 252 for nine from 120 for eight before Rajin was caught behind Shahagir Hossain off Ziaur Rahman. Seven balls later, Robiul removed last batsman Shuvashish (33) to end Sylhet's second innings on 256. Rajin struck eight four in his 229-ball knock. Left-arm spinner Nabil Samad of Sylhet was adjudged man of the match for his 13-wicket haul in the match. Barisal vs Rajshahi At Rajshahi Divisional Stadium, visitors Barisal took an overall 207-run lead against hosts Rajshahi, who Sunday added 48 runs to their overnight total of 162 for seven to finish 215 all out and conceded a 58-run deficit in the first innings. Barisal, who made 273 in the first innings, were 149 for four at close of Day-3 with Nasir Hossain and Rony Talukdar batting on 30 and 11 respectively. After the dismissal of opener Hannan Sarkar on a first-ball duck, Uttam Kumar along with one-down Nasiruddin Faruque repaired the early setback putting on 65 runs for the second wicket before Uttam was caught by Sabbir off Kabir for 35. Later, Suhrawardi Shuvo removed Nasiruddin (45) while Farhad dismissed Imran Ahmed (17) to reduce Barisal to 112 for four, but Nasir and Rony kept Barisal away from further damage before the close. Dhaka vs Chittagong Mohammad Younus (5/59) and Tareq Aziz (4/44) shared nine wickets as Dhaka were bundled out for 210 in the first innings against Chittagong after the first two days of the match were called off due to the wet outfield at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Middle-order batsman Nazmul Hossain Milon topscored with 45 off 76 balls. Opener Javed Omar (43), Marshal Ayub (36) and Mominul Haq (22) were other remarkable Dhaka batsmen. Visitors Chittagong, in reply, were 48 for no loss in the first innings when the bails were drawn for the day with openers Gazi Salahuddin and Nafis Iqbal batting on 26 and 13 respectively.
