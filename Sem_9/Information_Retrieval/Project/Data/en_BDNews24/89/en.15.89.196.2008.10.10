 ROTTERDAM, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Edwin van der Sar's return to the international side soon fell into the background as coach Bert van Marwijk pondered a long list of injuries ahead of the Netherlands' World Cup qualifier against Iceland on Saturday. Van Marwijk last week recalled the retired Van der Sar to solve the goalkeeping problems with first choice Maarten Stekelenburg out for weeks and stand-in Henk Timmer still struggling with groin problems. "I understood the urgency of the request with two injured keepers," Edwin van der Sar told reporters. "The coming two matches are very important and it is crucial that we finish them well." Van Marwijk also welcomed back Wesley Sneijder, who missed the first three matches under the new coach due to a knee injury. However it is not likely Sneijder will be in action against Iceland as Van Marwijk promised Real Madrid the midfielder might only play against Norway next Wednesday. Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie both pulled out injured with hamstring problems, while Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, John Heitinga and Khalid Boulahrouz will also be absent due to injuries. All the injuries will probably offer Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt and Ryan Babel the opportunity to prove their value as two of three offensive midfielders besides playmaker Rafael van der Vaart. For Iceland, who drew 2-2 against Norway and lost 2-1 against Scotland and never qualified for a major tournament, the match in Rotterdam will be tough. Assistant coach Petur Petursson, who had two spells in Rotterdam for Feyenoord, said it would be a major shock if Iceland surprised the Dutch. "Netherlands have a much better team, with players from Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Liverpool" Petursson was quoted as saying in Dutch weekly Voetbal International. "That is something different then the league in Norway where most of our players are performing. The only thing we can do is to appear as tight collectively.
