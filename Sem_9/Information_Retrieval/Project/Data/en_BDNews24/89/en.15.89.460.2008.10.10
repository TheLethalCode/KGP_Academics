<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The $20 million winner-takes-all Twenty20 Stanford match between England and a West Indies' side in Antigua on Nov. 1 will go ahead after an agreement was reached over sponsorship rights. A statement on Thursday from Allen Stanford, who is bankrolling the match, said he had reached an agreement with Digicel, the official sponsors of West Indies cricket. "I am pleased with both parties' solution oriented approach and most importantly that this matter has been finally resolved," Stanford said in the statement. "We look forward to welcoming fans from around the world to the Stanford Cricket Ground to enjoy a fantastic week of cricket." The match was thrown into doubt when the High Court in London upheld Digicel's objection that the agreement between Stanford and the England and Wales Cricket Board compromised their exclusive rights to promote West Indies' cricket. Next month's match between England and a West Indies team, called the "Stanford Super Stars", follows five games also featuring England Twenty20 champions Middlesex and West Indies' regional side Trinidad and Tobago. Each player on the winning side will receive one million dollars with the rest of the money distributed between the remainder of the squad and management team and the England and West Indies' boards
