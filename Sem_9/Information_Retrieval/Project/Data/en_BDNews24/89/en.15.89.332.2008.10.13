 LONDON, Mon Oct 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World stocks jumped on Monday from last week's four-year low after policymakers around the world took new and drastic steps to rescue banks and prevent the global economy from sinking into recession. Oil jumped nearly 5 percent from its 13-month low while government bonds tumbled after Britain injected 37 billion pounds ($63.95 billion) buying into leading UK banks while Australia and New Zealand guaranteed all bank deposits.
