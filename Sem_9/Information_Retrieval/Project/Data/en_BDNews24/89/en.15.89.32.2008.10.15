 Dhaka, October 15 (bdnews24.com)BNP will not take any decision about registration with the Election Commission before they reach a consensus with the government, said the party's secretary general on Wednesday. Referring to Tuesday's dialogue session with the chief adviser, Khandakar Delwar Hossain told reporters at his NAM Flat residence: "No great progress was made though we discussed a number of issues." "We expect to have another dialogue with the government before Oct 20." Asked about a likely timeline for BNP's registration with the EC, Delwar said: "We are not considering registration at all before we reach a consensus in dialogue." Wednesday (Oct 15) was the original deadline for parties to register with the EC. The commission extended the deadline by five days to Oct 20 after BNP and its political allies, including Jamaat-e-Islami, petitioned for an extension. BNP tabled a seven-point proposal in its three-hour dialogue with the government on Tuesday, including lifting the emergency for creating a congenial atmosphere for national elections. "We think the implementation of the proposals will help to create an electoral atmosphere. It is not possible to hold elections amid the state of emergency.," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after the dialogue. Both government and party representatives said in a joint news briefing that the two sides could not reach a consensus yet. "We will hold more talks," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said. bdnews
