<TITLE> 'Bangladesh's billions safe' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Funds estimated to be worth billions of dollars that the Bangladesh Bank and commercial banks have kept with foreign banks are safe despite the global financial crisis, a top central bank official said Tuesday. "All our money is safe. There are no risks or problems," Ziaul H Siddiqui, deputy governor, told a press conference. But the deputy governor declined to divulge any information about the amount of money involved. "It's very sensitive issue. I can't comment on that," he told a questioner. The deputy governor however said a large part of Bangladesh's foreign currency reserves, US$ 5.68 billion on Tuesday, was deposited with foreign banks. If the central bank reserves and the commercial banks' money are put together, the figure would be estimated at several billion US dollars. "As the crisis loomed, money deposited with problem banks was quickly transferred to central banks of those countries," Siddiqui said. He admitted that this would mean local banks would incur some losses because central banks offered lower interest rates than commercial banks. "But there is nothing to be worried about. We could anticipate such a crisis long ago. "We acted three months ago and transferred all money from 'risky' commercial banks to central banks. Similar advice was given to our commercial banks and they acted accordingly." Siddiqui, standing in for governor Salehuddin Ahmed who is abroad, said the western banks which disbursed massive amounts of short term loans were hit by the crisis. "But our commercial banks do not usually lend short term ... the central bank also discourages commercial banks to offer short-term loans." Siddiqui also did not say the names of foreign banks from which Bangladeshi banks moved their funds. "They might even sue us for defamation if we name them," he said. The deputy governor said that the financial services industry in Bangladesh was not vulnerable to the global meltdown. bdn
