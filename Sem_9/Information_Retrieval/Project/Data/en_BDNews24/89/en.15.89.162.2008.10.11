 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  A scintillating performance by all-rounder Jacob Oram helped visiting New Zealand level a three ODI series, thrashing Bangladesh by 75 runs in the crucial second one-dayer at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. Bangladesh were bundled out for 137 in 42.4 overs, after Oram hammered an unbeaten 75 to lift New Zealand to a modest 212 for nine, as batsmen failed to cash in on bowlers' tremendous start. The drubbing means Bangladesh maintain their record for failing to win back-to-back ODIs against a top team, while they lost one of their best opportunities so far to wrap up a series with a match to go. The hosts must now look to the third one-dayer in Chittagong on Tuesday, in their bid to win a series against a major cricketing nation. The hosts were in the match till the halfway through their innings, only to be derailed after the departure of skipper Mohammad Ashraful, who along with Junaed Siddique steadied the side after losing Tamim Iqbal (two-ball duck) and Mushfiqur Rahim (11 off 27 balls) inside 10 overs. Ashraful and Junaed, who together added a significant 109 runs on the way to Bangladesh's first-ever win over the Kiwis on Thursday, raised the hope of a repeat performance, but this time were sluggish in putting on 53 runs off 110 balls before Junaed was trapped lbw by Tim Southee, leaving the side at 71 for three in 27 overs. The departure of Junaed, who scored a patient 32 off 68, toppled the Tigers' batting performance, with Bangladesh being reduced to 111 for seven as Shakib Al Hasan (10), Nayeem Islam (0), Mohammad Ashraful and Mahmudullah (8) were dismissed in a row. Oram dashed Bangladesh's last dim hope of victory having Ashraful caught by Brendon McCullum for a patient 86-ball 40. New Zealand had almost ensured their triumph, before Mashrafee's entertaining run-a-ball 27 studded with one six and three fours. The Bangladesh vice captain was the last batsman to be caught by Oram off Millis, who was top of the New Zealand attack with three for 13. Earlier, New Zealand recovered from their early setback to post a competitive total on the slow wicket, riding on a quickfire 75 from Oram, who smashed four sixes and five fours facing 62 balls. The 30-year-old middle batsman, who also struck 57 in the first match, came down heavily on left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak to take the match from Bangladesh, smashing him for 25 (6,6,2,4,6 and 1) in the final over. Bangladesh paid the price when Oram was dropped on 26 by Razzak off Shahadat Hossain, and the hosts had another setback as television replays showed Jeetan Patel clearly run out as the last New Zealand batsman, with the visitors at 167 for nine, though no appeal was made against him by Bangladesh. Swing bowler Syed Rasel made an early inroad, ripping through the Black Caps top order after Ahsraful decided to bowl first for the second time in a row, with spinners Nayeem Islam and Shakib Al Hasan striking hard after Rasel, but in the end Bangladesh failed to fully cash in on the New Zealand collapse. Rasel penetrated the opponents' top order with accuracy, while spinners Nayeem and Shakib exploited the early damage to reduce the visitors to 115 for seven before Oram defiantly challenged the hosts' bowling with barely any assistance from the other end. Rasel, in contrast to his previous one-day performance, finished his 10-over unbroken spell with three for 23, his second best haul after four for 22 against Kenya in 2006. Nayeem Islam and Shakib Al Hasan returned two wickets each for identical 20 runs, but Abdur Razzak was too expensive with 67 for nought in 10 overs. b
