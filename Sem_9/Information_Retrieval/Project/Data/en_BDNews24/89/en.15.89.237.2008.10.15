<TITLE> Argentina forced to field team without Riquelme </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina will finally find out whether or not they can play better without enigmatic midfielder Juan Roman Riquelme when they face Chile in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Riquelme has been ever-present in the nine matches of the campaign so far but, after several lethargic displays, an increasing number of critics have been clamouring for coach Alfio Basile to field a team without him. Basile, who has publicly confessed his admiration for the former Barcelona and Villarreal player, has been forced by circumstances to oblige after Riquelme picked up a second yellow card in Saturday's 2-1 win over Uruguay and is suspended. "Of course, it's an important loss for the team," said captain Javier Zanetti. "He's a player who can make a difference at any moment, especially from a set piece. "Fortunately, we are lucky enough as a country to have a lot of top level players, so there won't be any problem in covering his absence." Forward Carlos Tevez is also suspended while striker Sergio Aguero, midfielder Javier Mascherano and defender Martin Demichelis are doubtful. Aguero's eventual absence could force Basile to again bow to the critics and field a conventional target man in Diego Milito. Argentina finally ended a run of six successive draws on Saturday although their performance was lacklustre as they were dragged into a vicious kicking match by their neighbours. Basile's side are third in the 10-team group with 16 points. BIELSA-BASILE MEETING The match will pit Basile's team against their former coach Marcelo Bielsa, who during his six years with Argentina rarely gave Riquelme much of a look-in. As Chile coach, Bielsa has boldly put his faith in a crop of young players. So far, his team have performed inconsistently but are fourth in the 10-team table with 13 points. The hosts have two of their regular three-man defence, Gonzalo Jara and Ismael Fuentes, suspended after being sent off in Sunday's 1-0 loss in Ecuador, along with midfielder Roberto Cereceda and forward Alexis Sanchez who have been booked twice. The gifted but temperamental Jorge Valdivia, who has completed a 10-match international suspension for indiscipline at last year's Copa America, is expected to get another chance in midfield. Teams: Chile: Claudio Bravo; Gary Medel, Waldo Ponce, Marco Estrada; Arturo Vidal, Carlos Carmona, Jorge Valdivia, Gonzalo Fierro, Mark Gonzalez; Humberto Suazo, Jean Beausejour Argentina: Juan Pablo Carrizo; Javier Zanetti, Nicolas Burdisso, Martin Demichelis, Gabriel Heinze; Javier Mascherano, Esteban Cambiasso, Cristian Ledesma, Angel Di Maria; Lionel Messi, Sergio Aguero or Diego Milito Referee: Oscar Ruiz (Colombia)
