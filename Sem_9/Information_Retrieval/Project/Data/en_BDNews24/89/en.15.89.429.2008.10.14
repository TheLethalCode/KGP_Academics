 NEW YORK, Tue Oct 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P 500 rose on Tuesday on the US government's bank rescue plan, but the Nasdaq fell as concerns about recession and the third-quarter profit outlook tempered optimism.

The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 21.06 points, or 2.10 percent, at 1,024.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.18 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,837.07
