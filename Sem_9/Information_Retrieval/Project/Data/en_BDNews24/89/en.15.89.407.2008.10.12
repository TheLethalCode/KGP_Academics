 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Sunday that he had held a one-on-one meeting with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as part of maintaining contact with political leaders. "I discussed with Khaleda Zia issues including participating in the national polls and removing all uncertainties regarding a congenial atmosphere for elections," the adviser told reporters after attending a seminar held by Centre for Policy Dialogue at the Brac Centre Inn. Hossain Zillur had a 'closed-door meeting' with the former prime minister at her Shaheed Mainul Road home on Friday evening. Speaking to bdnews24.com by telephone late at night on Friday, the adviser acknowledged the meeting but would not say anything "at the moment". On Sunday, he said: "We exchanged opinions on the moves required for holding elections and overcoming political crises." He said on holding upazila polls. "It is not a political desire. The upzila election is required for reinforcing the mid-level economy and alleviating poverty by strengthening the local government." The adviser said that everything would take place as per the government ' and Election Commission announced roadmap and they were hopeful that all polls would be held in time. The private meeting has raised some questions. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain on Saturday denounced what he termed "secret meetings" between caretaker advisers and top political leaders. "Those who they (advisers) are meeting with are being tried in the court of law," said the lawyer-turned-politician, without naming the former prime minister. "The caretaker advisers are holding constitutional positions. How can they go and hold secret meetings with such people?" bdnews
