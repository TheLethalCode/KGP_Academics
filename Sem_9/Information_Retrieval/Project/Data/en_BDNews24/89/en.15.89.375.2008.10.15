 KARACHI, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Under fire Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson has no intention of quitting and is keen to extend his contract with the team until the 2011 World Cup. Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Ejaz Butt has said he was not impressed with the team's performance over the last year, while former players have called for Australian Lawson to step down. Lawson was appointed Pakistan coach last year after the death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup and his two-year contract expires in July 2009.
