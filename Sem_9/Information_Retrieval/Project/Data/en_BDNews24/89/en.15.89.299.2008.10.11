<TEXT>
 Chapainawabganj, Oct 11(bdnews24.com) Jamaat-e-Islami chief Moulana Matiur Rahman Nizami has questioned the commitment and motive of the caretaker government in holding the Dec 18 polls and reiterated the demand that emergency be lifted before the vote. "The only responsibility of the caretaker government is to hold fair election with the participation of all parties. But the government gave rise to suspicion by going far beyond its jurisdiction," Nizami told an assembly organised by the district unit of his party on Saturday. "After scheduling the election for Dec 18, if you harass former four-party alliance ministers by filing cases against them in October, it gives rise to suspicion about your motives." He was speaking at Shaheed Satu auditorium in Chapainawabganj town. Nizami said participation of all the political leaders was crucial to holding a credible election. "It will not be good for the country if any leader is kept outside the polls through unusual means. "If the election is foiled on some pretext, and political orphans are brought together to form a government, it will not bode well for the country." He called upon the four-party alliance leaders and workers to remain united. bdnews24.c
