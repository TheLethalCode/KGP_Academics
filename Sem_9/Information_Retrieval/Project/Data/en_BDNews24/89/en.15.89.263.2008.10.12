Fakhruddin hailed the youth movement as a means to foster regional cooperation, saying: "It will aid sustainable social and economic development in many spheres of interest between SAARC countries." He welcomed the 350 Rover Scouts from Afghanistan, Bhutan, the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh that have joined the camp this year.
