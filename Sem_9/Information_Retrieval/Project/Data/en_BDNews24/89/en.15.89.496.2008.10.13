 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League, after amending its constitution on Monday ahead of registering for elections, has announced a countrywide programme on Oct 19 to press for permanent release of party chief Sheikh Hasina. The party took the decision at the meeting of its central working committee at the party president's office in Dhanmondi, "The freedom of Sheikh Hasina is a must for a free and fair election. We hope the government will release her in the interest of national polls," acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting. "The state of emergency must be lifted immediately to remove the uncertainty over polls," he added. "We say fair elections are not possible without permanent release of our leader and withdrawal of the state of emergency," Ashraful said. Amending some sections of the party constitution for registration in line with the amended Representation of the People Ordinance 2008 was one of the key issues on the meeting's agenda Monday. Acting president Zillur Rahman chaired the meeting for some time, but left before the meeting ended as he was feeling unwell. Emerging from the meeting venue, Zillur had told reporters that the CWC had approved amendments to the party constitution, associate organisations and overseas units would remain as before as would the power of the party chief. The acting party chief added that the party would submit its application for registration to the Election Commission by Oct 15. Ashraful told reporters, after the meeting ended: "We hope there will be no obstacle to being registered." He reiterated that they were against upazila polls being so soon after national elections and would speak to the government and the Election Commission about holding the polls at an appropriate time. "If the talks do not work, there will be a street movement if necessary," Ashraful warned. AL presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury were Sheikh Fazlul Karim were present at the CWC meeting. bdnew
