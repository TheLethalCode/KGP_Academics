<TITLE> Italy's Gilardino ready to usurp Toni for good </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alberto Gilardino can take over from struggling Luca Toni as Italy's main striker if he impresses in Wednesday's World Cup qualifying Group Eight game at home to Montenegro (1850 GMT). Toni, 31, is suspended for the match in Lecce having picked up a booking as a substitute in Saturday's 0-0 draw in Bulgaria. The Bayern Munich forward, a huge flop during Italy's disappointing Euro 2008 campaign, was again lacklustre after coming on for the lively Gilardino in the second half. Gilardino, not even in Roberto Donadoni's Euro 2008 squad, has been reinvigorated now he is playing regular football at Fiorentina having been a bit-part player at AC Milan last term. The 26-year-old has netted four times in Serie A this season but it was still a slight surprise when coach Marcello Lippi, who had Gilardino in his 2006 World Cup-winning squad, included him ahead of Toni on Saturday. "I'm sorry for Luca but if Lippi keeps me in the lineup in Lecce, I am ready. I have saved up a goal for Montenegro," Gilardino said after coming the closest to scoring in Sofia. Fabio Quagliarella has replaced Toni in the squad, meaning the group leaders now boast three Udinese forwards. UNUSUALLY QUIET Debutant Simone Pepe was unspectacular on the right of a three-pronged attack on Saturday with club team mate Antonio Di Natale unusually quiet on the left of Gilardino. Villarreal forward Giuseppe Rossi, who came on against Bulgaria for his first cap, could replace Pepe in Lecce. Midfielders Daniele De Rossi and Gennaro Gattuso have slight knocks but should recover. Montenegro's AS Roma striker Mirko Vucinic is well-known to the Italians but may not shake off a knee injury in time. Coach Zoran Filipovic could be forced to field a makeshift side with several other key players struggling. Sporting Lisbon midfielder Simon Vukcevic limped off the pitch after Saturday's practice while defenders Radoslav Batak, Elsad Zverotic, Vladimir Bozovic and Milan Jovanovic have niggling injuries. Midfielder Milorad Pekovic is suspended. "I will only field players who are 100 percent fit because those who are not can be detrimental to the national team," Filipovic said. "I hope all injured players make a full recovery as many of those who are fit are not getting enough games for their clubs." Montenegro drew 2-2 with Bulgaria and 0-0 with Ireland at home in their opening two qualifierstheir first competitive matches as an independent nation after breaking away from a state union with Serbia in 2006. Probable teams: Italy: Marco Amelia; Gianluca Zambrotta, Fabio Cannavaro, Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Dossena; Gennaro Gattuso, Daniele De Rossi, Simone Perrotta; Giuseppe Rossi, Alberto Gilardino, Antonio Di Natale Montenegro: Vukasin Poleksic; Luka Pejovic, Jovan Tanasijevic, Vlado Jeknic, Vladimir Bozovic; Mitar Novakovic, Ivan Delic, Simon Vukcevic, Branko Boskovic; Stevan Jovetic, Mirko Vucinic Referee: Pedro Proenca (Portugal)
