 BERLIN, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany's reputation for defensive solidity will face a stern test from Russia in Saturday's 2010 World Cup Group Four qualifier and coach Joachim Loew expects any lapse in concentration to be severely punished. Loew said on Wednesday he had seldom seen a side that can change gears as fast and that the fluidity and pace of Guus Hiddink's team rivalled European champions Spain. "There are often only a few moments between them winning the ball and completing an attack," Loew said at a news conference. "They have a balanced and disciplined team and their approach has become much more structured and organised. If we make too many mistakes we will be punished without mercy." Euro 2008 runners-up Germany could only manage a 3-3 draw with Finland in their last qualifier in Helsinki, but still lead the group with four points from two matches. Russia are in second with three points from their only match so far, a 2-1 home win over Wales. Hiddink is suffering something of an injury crisis ahead of the tie in Dortmund, with striker Roman Pavlyuchenko, defender Denis Kolodin and midfielder Dmitry Torbinsky ruled out. Pavlyuchenko has been Russia's key striker for the past 12 months, scoring both goals in a 2-1 win over England in a crucial Euro 2008 qualifier last October and netting three goals at Euro 2008 during Russia's run to the semi-finals. "Pavlyuchenko's injury is a huge blow for us, the same goes for Kolodin," said Hiddink, who has added striker Dmitry Sychev and midfielder Denis Glushakov as cover. "Injuries are part of the game and, no doubt, we're going to overcome any problems," he added. Loew can call again on the experienced central midfield pairing of captain Michael Ballack and Torsten Frings, who both missed the Finland match. Defenders Per Mertesacker and Arne Friedrich are also back in the squad. "I am happy that the return of Ballack, Friedrich, Frings and Mertesacker gives me more options but I will look closely at each player in training and then decide who plays," he said. Hiddink said Russia's performance at Euro 2008 had given his side a huge confidence boost. "My players are no longer afraid of any team, although Germany are always a tough opponent," the Dutchman said. "So if we get a draw there I'll be fully satisfied." Probable teams: Germany: Robert Enke; Clemens Fritz, Per Mertesacker, Heiko Westermann, Philipp Lahm; Bastian Schweinsteiger, Torsten Frings, Michael Ballack, Piotr Trochowski; Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski or Patrick Helmes. Russia: Igor Akinfeyev; Alexander Anyukov, Sergei Ignashevich, Vasily Berezutsky or Alexei Berezutsky, Yuri Zhirkov; Konstantin Zyryanov, Sergei Semak, Igor Semshov, Igor Denisov or Diniyar Bilyaletdinov; Andrei Arshavin, Pavel Pogrebnyak
