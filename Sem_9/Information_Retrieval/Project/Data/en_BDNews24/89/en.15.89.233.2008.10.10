 STOCKHOLM, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal, having slumped to a shock home defeat by Denmark without Cristiano Ronaldo last month, welcome the winger back for their World Cup Group One qualifier against Sweden on Saturday (1800 GMT). Ronaldo coming up against Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a rival for the World Player of the Year award, is a potential feast in store for the fans in Stockholm as Portugal look to make up for the 3-2 upset in Lisbon. The 2006 World Cup semi-finalists are fourth in the group with three points, a point behind leaders Albania, the Danes and Sweden after two matches. "I know that from now on everything will be more complicated after the defeat against Denmark," said Ronaldo, who has recovered from ankle surgery. "We cannot lose more qualifiers. I hope that things run better," added the winger, who will, however, lack the support of several regulars in the Portuguese team. Midfielder Maniche and playmaker Deco have been ruled out through injuries, adding their names to a list that already included central defender Ricardo Carvalho and winger Simao Sabrosa. INJURY NIGHTMARES Sweden's situation is no better, though. Striker Henrik Larsson, who came out of retirement for the third time in his career at Euro 2008, will be out for the next few weeks after injuring his thigh during training. Defensive midfielder Tobias Linderoth, a cornerstone in the Swedish team, has been plagued by injuries this year and also misses the tie, with the competent but much slower Daniel Andersson set to take his place. Andersson is also likely to deputise as captain in Larsson's absence, as stalwart defenders Olof Mellberg and Erik Edman are out, along with midfielders Anders Svensson and Christian Wilhelmsson. "I don't think I've ever had this kind of injury situation since I began (this job)," coach Lars Lagerback said on Wednesday. The Swedes, however, have a history of collective strength and have been known to upset bigger teams when it has been least expected. Two years ago, they beat Spain in a Euro qualifier without Ibrahimovic. Lagerback experimented with a 3-5-2 formation in last month's 0-0 draw in Albania and 2-1 home win over Hungary, instead of his usual 4-4-2, but with so many absentees and facing stronger opponents, he could well play it safe. "We say what we've said before, we're keeping both playing alternatives alive, then we'll have to see the condition of the players," said Lagerback. Probable teams: Sweden: Andreas Isaksson; Mikael Nilsson, Petter Hansson, Daniel Majstorovic, Fredrik Stoor; Daniel Andersson, Kim Kallstrom, Sebastian Larsson, Samuel Holmen; Johan Elmander, Zlatan Ibrahimovic Portugal: Quim; Jose Bosingwa, Pepe, Bruno Alves, Paulo Ferreira; Raul Meireles, Fernando Meira, Danny, Nani; Cristiano Ronaldo, Nuno Gomes
