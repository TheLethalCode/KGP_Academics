<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)Khaleda Zia may be the only person permitted still to enrol as a voter, after the final country voter list was handed to the Election Commission in a special ceremony on Tuesday. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda was happy to allay doubts about the Dec 18 elections on the back of final voter list, while at the same time allowing that the commission had power to still enlist special exceptions. "There was much doubt and debate centring on the countrywide voter list," said Huda as he was formally handed the final voter lists from across the country at the Election Commission Secretariat Tuesday noon. "As the final list has been completed properly, all doubt and apprehension over the election on this account can be put to rest." Replying to reporters' questions, the CEC said: "There is no more scope to become voter afresh before the upcoming election." "When the scheduled updating of the voter list begins early next year there, from Jan 2 to 31, voters will have the chance to enlist anew or change address." Asked about BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's refusal to enlist so far, he said: "The Election Commission has special power to enlist a person before the election schedule is announced." He added this would be in "exceptional cases" only. The former prime minister had been approached by the EC on a number of occasions, but she had so far refused to enlist "while behind bars". Former PM Sheikh Hasina, on the other hand, enlisted as a voter on June 10 from special jail. According to new electoral law, no unlisted person can contest elections. Election officials said 130 additional people will be added to the voter list on Oct 20, who have made late applications due to indiposition such as illness or being abroad. bdnews24.c
