 Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Defending champions Abahani Limited topped the point table of the B. League for the first time on Friday, beating their Khulna namesakes after title contenders Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel KC stumbled in the day's other encounters. Abahani, who were surprisingly tamed by Rahmatganj MFS in the league opener, routed Khulna Abahani KC 3-0 while Brothers Union came from behind to take a 2-2 draw against Arambagh KS at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Hosts Chittagong Abahani Limited held Sheikh Russel KC to a goalless draw at MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong. Nigerian striker Emeka Christian gave the Dhanmondi-based outfit a 23-minute first-half lead under the floodlights at the big bowl. After resumption, midfielder Mamunul Islam doubled the Abahani lead in the 61st minute before Jahid Hasan Emily struck his league's second goal to seal the match in the 77th minute. In the first match at the same venue, Adbullah Parvez salvaged Brothers Union from a certain defeat with a last-gasp goal against Arambagh. Parvez levelled the margin in the 91st minute after captain Amit Khan Shuvo reduced the Gopibagh-based outfit's margin in the 75th minute as Arambagh took a two-goal lead riding on strikes from Lutfur Rahman and Emadul Haq in the 36th and 46th minute respectively.
