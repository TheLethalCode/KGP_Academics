<TITLE> Panesar to sharpen his game in Sri Lankan club cricket </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leg-spinner Monty Panesar will warm up for England's test series in India by playing club cricket in Sri Lanka, coach Peter Moores said on Tuesday. Panesar has already taken more than 100 test wickets since bursting on the scene in India in 2006 although he failed to impress against South Africa this year. Australia great Shane Warne was quoted in The Mail on Sunday saying Panesar would get "taken apart" in next year's Ashes series unless he added more variation to his bowling. The 26-year-old Northamptonshire bowler has been omitted from the one-day squad for the tour of India and will instead sharpen his skills in Sri Lanka for a month before the two December tests in Ahmedabad and Mumbai where spin will be vital. "It's a great opportunity for him," Moores told reporters at Lord's. "He will learn a lot. He's been there before, they're physically tough conditions, they are very good players of spin. "Monty has not been in the England squad for a while but this will help him get ready for the first test against India." Panesar was not selected for the one-day series against South Africa this summer and last played for England in the fourth test in August
