 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) - Private airline Best Air is going to launch flights from Dhaka to Singapore on Oct 20 and to Kuala Lumpur on Oct 21, chairman of the airline said on Monday. The airline will operate two flights per week on the Dhaka-Singapore route and four on the Dhaka-Kuala Lumpur route, Best Air chairman M Haider Uzzaman said at a press conference at Sonargaon Hotel on Monday. The flights to Singapore will be on Monday and Friday and to Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. "We have taken the decision to operate flights on the routes in view of the links between Bangladesh and the countries in terms of traveling, medical treatment and business," Haider Uzzaman said. Best Air fixed the airfare for two-way Dhaka-Singapore ticket at $ 282 in addition to tax and surcharge and Dhaka-Kuala Lumpur two-way ticket would cost $ 380. "We offered the lowest airfare for traveling on these two routes," the Best Air chairman claimed. Best Aviation started operations in 1999 as a helicopter operator. Best Air has been operating different types of freighter in the Domestic and International Sectors from 2000. The private airline obtained license from the Civil Aviation Authority in 2006 to operate passenger service. Best Air started its journey on Jan 14 with a leased Boeing 737 through running a flight on Dhaka-Chittagong route. It later took lease of a McDonnell Douglas-83 aircraft. The airline made its debut on international route on May 25 through the flight from Dhaka to Bangkok. Best Air started operating on Dhaka-Colombo-Male' route on July 28 and Dhaka-Dubai route on Sept 8. The private airline has permission to fly to 11 international destinations including Dhaka-Kunming, Dhaka- Kathmandu, Dhaka-Bahrain. Best Air chairman Haider Uzzaman said, "In 2006, foreign airliners took away $ 140 crore from Bangladesh as Bangladeshi airliners accounted for less than 20 percent of local aviation business." At the press conference, Haider Uzzaman asked the government to take initiatives to train immigration officials abroad. "The immigration officials we have are not efficient that often taint images of the country," Haider Uzzaman said. b
