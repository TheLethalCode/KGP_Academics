Garriott, a video game developer from Texas, paid $35 million (20.6 million pounds) to fly into space alongside US astronaut Michael Fincke and Russian cosmonaut Yury Lonchakov.

In April, a Soyuz capsule landed 420 km (260 miles) off course after explosive bolts failed to detonate before re-entry, sending the craft into a steep descent.
