 Dhaka, Oct 13(bdnews24.com)--Four bodies were recovered in a search operation up to Monday night following a collision on the Buriganga River in Mohammadpur in the early morning. The search for three more missing was called off until Tuesday, said officials. Kamal Mea, who was travelling on the Muktadi-2 when it went down, told bdnews24.com that the cargo boat sank following a collision with another cargo vessel coming from the direction of Gabtali at around 5am. The stricken vessel had been loaded with sand in Gazaria, Munshiganj and was heading for Dhaka Udyan in Mohammadpur, said Kamal. "When we reached Mohammadpur, the empty cargo vessel MV Gazaria hit our boat and then carried on," said Kamal. Alkas, who was also aboard the Muktadi when she went down, said there were 40 people on board at the time of the accident, adding that he believed all but seven managed to swim ashore. Fire brigade divers recovered the bodies of Alkas' wife and mother-in-law after mounting a rescue operation midday. Jasmin Akhter, sub-inspector of South Keraniganj Police Station, said they seized the MV Gazaria earlier in the day near Fatulla ghat. "The motor vessel was brought to Ainta. Its operator, one Jahidul Islam, and an employee named Ibrahim Mea have been arrested. Russel Enterprise is the owner of the cargo vessel," said Akhter. The deceased have been identified as Rakib (5), his mother Nayantara (40), Sabiha (40) and her mother Hazera Bibi (60). Those still missing are Milon (45), his son Akash (4) and Milon's cousin Babu (17). bdnews24.co
