<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, India, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Hussey anchored Australia to a commanding first innings score of 430 with a remarkable century on the second day of the first test against India on Friday. In reply, hosts India made a confident start by reaching 68 without loss at stumps, drawn early due to rain. Left-hander Hussey scored a patient 146, following up on skipper Ricky Ponting's first-day century (123) when the touring side made a good start to the four-test series. "It was a slow wicket with a bit of uneven bounce, there are a bit of cracks and indentations, a dry wicket. It was a challenge and it feels special to score," Hussey told a news conference. "All (centuries) are special but I guess India is the toughest place to play cricket for an Australian and so this is very special," added Hussey, who opened the tour with a century in Australia's only warm-up match in Hyderabad last week. Ponting's 36th hundred on Thursday was his first in India as he banished the frustrations of seven test failures spread over 12 years. The visitors lost Shane Watson early on day two to lively paceman Ishant Sharma, who finished with four for 77, after Australia resumed on 254 for four. SPREAD OUT The 33-year-old Hussey, playing his first test in India, displayed steadfast purpose to lift Australia out of a tight corner with a crucial 91-run stand with Brad Haddin (33) for the sixth wicket. "Our run scoring was determined by the kind of fields that Anil (Kumble, India captain) set for us, they had kept fielders in the deep and the field was spread out so we could get the singles better than the fours," Hussey said. Hussey, who struck 15 boundaries and a six for his ninth test century, put on 59 runs for the eighth wicket with Brett Lee (27). "While batting with the lower order I tell the guys to be calm because the first 15 minutes they are pretty tense and once they get through that they get some handy runs," Hussey said. "Lee did well and we had that partnership going. It's all about showing some faith in them." Hussey was last man out in a late three-wicket burst by left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan, who finished with five for 91. Aggressive Indian opener Virender Sehwag made 43 not out and Gautam Gambhir was unbeaten on 20 when rain forced the early finish
