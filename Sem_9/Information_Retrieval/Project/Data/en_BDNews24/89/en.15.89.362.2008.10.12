 Mumbai, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India may escape the worst consequences of the global financial crisis due to its strong internal drivers for growth but money, debt and credit markets may be impacted indirectly, its central bank chief said. "The equity and the forex markets provide the channels through which the global crisis can spread to the Indian system," Duvvuri Subbarao, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said in a statement posted on the central bank's web site www.rbi.org.in on Sunday. The remarks were made in Washington on Saturday.
