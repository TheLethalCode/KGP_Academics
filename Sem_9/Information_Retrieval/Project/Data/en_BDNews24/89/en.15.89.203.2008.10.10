 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited will start connecting land phones with broadband internet connections by December, a senior government official said on Friday. Telecommunications secretary Iqbal Mahmood told bdnews24.com that internet connections would initially be given to some districts in addition to Dhaka. Mahmood said 26 telephone exchanges were being prepared for the service. The state-run company will use Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line or ADSL technology that helps landline users to access phone and internet on the same line, a senior BTCL official said. The users will have to install a modem costing up to Tk 5,000 for the service. The speedy internet connection will be available for BTCL phone users at a competitive price. A BTCL official preferring anonymity said users of Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Bogra and some other districts would get broadband internet connection initially. He said the BTCL would charge less than private companies for the service. Digital phone users can use dial-up internet without any connection fee. It charges Tk 0.10 per minute in off-peak hours and Tk 0.15 during peak hours or Tk 6 and Tk 9 per hour respectively. BTCL provides digital data network service in 71 areas in 41 districts.
