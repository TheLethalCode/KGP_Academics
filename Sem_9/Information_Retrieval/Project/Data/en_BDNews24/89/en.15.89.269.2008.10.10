 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors president Pedro Pompilio said it was a privilege to have Juan Roman Riquelme at the club after the enigmatic Argentina international was publicly criticised by a team mate.

Critics also say that when he has an off day, he drags the rest of his team down with him. Riquelme left previous club Villarreal under a cloud, having been shunted into the reserves after the Spanish side said they were tired of his privileges and lack of commitment. Pompilio added that he had asked Caceres to ring Riquelme and apologise. The episode has come at a bad time for Boca, who have lost three of their last four domestic games including two in a row at the usually impregnable Bombonera. On Sunday, off-form goalkeeper Mauricio Caranta asked not to play against Estudiantes and his replacement Javier Garcia was twice beaten by shots from outside the penalty area in the 2-1 home defeat. After meeting with Pompilio, Caranta later blamed his request on a personal problem
