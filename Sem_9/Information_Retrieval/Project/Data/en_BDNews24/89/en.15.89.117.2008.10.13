 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)  Farhad Hossain struck an unbeaten 56 as runners-up Rajshahi made a draw against Barisal on the fourth and final day of the National Cricket League four-dayer at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium on Monday. The match between Chittagong and Dhaka ended in an expected draw at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium, which saw the first two days of the match called off due to wet outfield. Barisal and Chittagong with first innings lead secured four points each while Rajshahi and Dhaka earned two points each. Khulna secured full eight points for their outright win over Sylhet on Sunday. Barisal vs Rajshahi Hosts Rajshahi were 135 for three in 42 overs at close of the final day after visitors Barisal set them to chase 263 runs to win almost in two sessions. Tariqul Islam tore Rajshahi top-order removing Shakil Haider (20), Jahurul Islam (14) and Anisur Rahman (13) before Farhad and Mushfiqur Rahman produced a stiff resistance to ensure no further damage. Farhad and Mushfiqur together put on 76 runs for the unbroken fourth wicket and remained unbeaten on 56 and 23 respectively before the bails were drawn for the final day. Earlier, Barisal, having resumed the day on 149 for four, were all out for 204 in the second innings as Farhad Hossain (4/74) and Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/45) wracked the visitors' batting. Dhaka vs Chittagong After resuming the day on 48 for no loss, visitors Chittagong ended up with 212, taking a slim two-run lead after bundling Dhaka out for 210 in the first innings.
