 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Fri Oct 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least 15 people and 30 wounded attending a tribal council in Pakistan's Orakzai region in the northwest on Friday, said a tribal elder who witnessed the attack. "We were busy in raising a lashkar (a tribal militia) to evict Taliban from the region when this attack took place," Qeemat Khan Orakzai, a member of the council told Reuters. Orakzai has been the most peaceful of Pakistan's seven semi-autonomous tribal regions. Unlike most of the others, Orakzai does not border Afghanistan
