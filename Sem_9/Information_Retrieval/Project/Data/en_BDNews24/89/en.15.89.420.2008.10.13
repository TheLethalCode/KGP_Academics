<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com) US ambassador James F Moriarty said Monday that a general election held under the state of emergency could suffer a crisis of credibility. "I have very little confidence that a free, fair and credible election can be held under emergency," Moriarty said, speaking in Bangla, after a meeting with BNP chief Khaleda Zia. "The United States hopes that through the dialogue, the December 18 election will be free, fair and acceptable." Replying to reporters, Moriarty said the US was not a party to the on-going discussions between the government and the political parties and hoped they would be able to reach consensus. The US envoy said they discussed transition to democracy in Bangladesh, the elections, developmental issues and ways to fight terrorism. Described by a BNP spokesperson as a courtesy meeting, it took place at her new office in Gulshan and lasted about an hour and a half. "They discussed issues of bilateral interest as well as the upcoming election," said Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury, a former foreign secretary and an adviser to the BNP chairperson. "We briefed the ambassador on several issues, including our five-point demands, which will be highlighted by the BNP at our dialogue with the government tomorrow," said Chowdhury. "The BNP chairperson considers withdrawal of the state of emergency necessary to holding fair elections in the country. She also explained her position on why the upazila polls needed to be deferred," he said. The US ambassador was aided by embassy political officer, Dan Byers. BNP secretary general Khondakar Delwar Hossain, former state minister for foreign affairs and BNP adviser Reaz Rahman and Chowdhury were present. bdn
