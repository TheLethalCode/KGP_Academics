<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 14 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court said Tuesday that the trial proceedings of the two cases regarding the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack would be tried separately. Judge Masdar Hossain of Dhaka Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 set the next hearing date for Oct 19. Prosecution and defence lawyers debated fiercely over the legal points of jointly trying the two cases, one an explosives case and the other a murder case. Some 23 people, including AL central leader Ivy Rahman, died of injuries sustained on grenade attack on an Awami League rally held in front of party offices on Bangabandhu Avenue. The police filed a case the next day. Four years later, on June 11 this year, the Criminal Investigation Department pressed two separate chargesheets accusing 22 people, including BNP former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu and Harkatul Jihad leader Mufti Hannan, one for unlawful killing/murder and another under the Explosives Act. Later, the government shifted the cases to the Speedy Trial Tribunal. It has been alleged that the immediate past four-party alliance government led by BNP previously attempted to derail the investigations by frequently changing investigation officers and though other irregularities. bdnew
