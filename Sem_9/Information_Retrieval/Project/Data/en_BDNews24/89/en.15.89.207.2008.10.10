<TITLE> McCain again raises Obama's ties with 1970s radical </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Waukesha, Wisconsin, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Trailing in opinion polls, Republican presidential nominee John McCain pressed his effort to raise doubts about Barack Obama's character on Thursday with a fresh attack on his Democratic rival's contacts with a former radical who became a college professor. On a day the stock market took another huge drop, the two candidates also bickered over how to resurrect the economy, with Obama taking aim at a McCain mortgage bailout plan he said would reward banks responsible for the housing crisis. Obama is riding an advantage in national opinion polls and in several states that hold the key to the election. He has built a 4-point lead over McCain, according to a Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Thursday. Trying to turn the tide with less than four weeks until the November 4 vote, McCain went on the attack at a joint rally with his vice presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, as well as in a new Web video ad. His goal was to tie Obama to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground, a radical left anti-Vietnam War group that bombed the U.S. Capitol and Pentagon in the early 1970s. Ayers spent 10 years as a fugitive and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, spent time on the FBI's Most Wanted list. Obama has called Ayers, now an education professor at a Chicago university, "a guy in my neighborhood" and said they are not close. He told ABC News on Wednesday McCain is trying to score "cheap political points" by bringing up Ayers. Ayers hosted a meeting at his house in 1995 to introduce Obama to neighbors during Obama's first run for the Illinois Senate. They also served on a nonprofit anti-poverty board together. "We don't care about an old washed-up terrorist and his wife..." McCain said. "That's not the point here. The point is Sen. Obama said he was just a guy in the neighborhood. We know that's not true. We need to know the full extent of the relationship because of whether Sen. Obama is telling the truth to the American people or not." A Web video ad released by the McCain campaign shows pictures of Obama and Ayers and accuses Obama of concealing the extent of his ties with Ayers. "Americans say, 'Where's the truth, Barack?' Barack Obama. Too risky for America." Obama spokesman Bill Burton said Obama did not know about Ayers' past when he went to his house and that the candidate found Ayers' radical activities "detestable and deplorable." ECONOMIC FEARS "You know, I can talk about it 'til I'm blue in the face, but it doesn't help American voters and American taxpayers understand what's really going on in this race, which is that John McCain, as his campaign has said over and over again, does not want to talk about the economy, because if they do, they lose," Burton told the Fox News Channel. On Thursday, the U.S. stock market plunged close to 700 points to reach its lowest level in five years on fears that frozen credit markets may lead to a global recession. Obama told a rally in Portsmouth, Ohio, that the market upheaval was threatening "not just banks, not just Wall Street, but your economic security." "It's really important that we respond using all the tools at our disposal," Obama said, adding that the U.S. Treasury Department must move as quickly as possible to carry out the $700 billion financial rescue package approved by Congress. Earlier, the Democratic candidate attacked McCain's mortgage bailout plan at a rally in Dayton, Ohio. Ohio has gone Republican in the past two presidential elections and is crucial to McCain's chances this time. At a debate with Obama in Tennessee on Tuesday, McCain proposed the U.S. government buy up troubled loans from people who have seen their home values fall below their debt. The loans would then be structured into more affordable mortgages. The Arizona senator has called the plan "a critical first step" to get through the crisis. The U.S. housing crisis was the seed for the mushrooming Wall Street mess that has cost investors trillions of dollars and put the country on the brink of a deep recession. Illinois Sen. Obama, whom polls show is more trusted by Americans on economic issues, dismissed McCain's mortgage plan as not "particularly new" and said he had proposed a version of it before as a tool to help homeowners stay in their homes. "Taxpayers shouldn't be asked to pick up the tab for the very folks who helped create this crisis," Obama said. McCain defended the plan and said Obama was happy to bail out companies like Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, "but he's opposed to us helping the homeowners of America." The Obama campaign has purchased a half hour of TV time on NBC and CBS on October 29, six days before the election. The campaign has also reached a deal with Fox for a similar slot if the network is not broadcasting a baseball game that night, according to Linda Douglass, senior advisor to Obama.
