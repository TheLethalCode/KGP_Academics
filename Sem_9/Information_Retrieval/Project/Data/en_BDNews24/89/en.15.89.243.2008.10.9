<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  Skipper Mohammad Ashraful has said it was 'team game' that won Bangladesh their first-ever ODI against New Zealand on Thursday. A new-look Bangladesh left the setback of losing top players to the Indian Cricket League behind them, to pull off a spectacular triumph against the No. 4 ODI side at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, their first since the victory over South Africa in the World Cup in 2007. "Frankly, we bowled very well along with fielding today and later Junaed did the main job. It was actually a team game," said Ashraful at a post-match briefing. He also said winning the toss was vital. He was all praises for strike bowler Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and the spinning troika of Abdur Razzak, debutant Nayeem Islam and Shakib Al Hasan, who between them captured eight wickets. Ashraful, who hit an unbeaten 60, said he would try to take the momentum into the next matches. He said though he had been trying to do well with bat, it had not happened in recent past. Asked whether there was lack of coherence in the side in the past, Ashraful said, "We were always unified and still are. But we were not getting results. We have pulled it off as all three departments clicked together for us today. I want to ensure you that we are always united." Ashraful said he had felt better after having performed, specially against a big team like New Zealand. Man of the match Junaed Siddique said that his 85-run innings against New Zealand was the best innings he has played in his career. "From the beginning, we all were dreaming of succeeding in the match and it finally happened. It feels very good now that we've won the match," said Junaed, who received his man of the match trophy from former captain Khaled Mashud Pilot. "Pilot Bhai is a role model to us in Rajshahi and we have learnt a lot from him," said the left-handed opener, who also came from Rajshahi. About his batting strategy, Junaed said that he had planned to bat throughout 50 overs and he had always talked with wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim and Ashraful during the knock. Junaed added 67 runs with Mushfiq for the second wicket and put up another 109 for third wicket with Ashraful. bdne
