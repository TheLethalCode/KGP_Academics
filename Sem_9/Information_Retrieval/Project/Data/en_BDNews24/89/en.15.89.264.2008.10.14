 LISBON, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Portugal go into their World Cup qualifier against Albania in Braga on Wednesday (1945 GMT) with coach Carlos Queiroz in no doubt they will reach the 2010 finals despite a shock defeat in their previous home tie. "Without a doubt, I'm convinced we'll qualify (for South Africa)," Queiroz said after Portugal drew 0-0 with Sweden in Stockholm in their third Group One game on Saturday. "With the players we have, it is possible to ensure qualification," he told reporters, adding that his team's versatility would trouble most opponents. Queiroz has had to do without several injured regulars for this month's qualifiers, midfielder Maniche, playmaker Deco, central defender Ricardo Carvalho and winger Simao Sabrosa. He was pleased with the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the team after ankle surgery, saying: "The team's spirit is in place and Cristiano was a great captain. I want a team of leaders he was a great example." The winger missed last month's 4-0 win in Malta and 3-2 defeat in Lisbon against Denmark, who lead the group with seven points after three games, two points ahead of Sweden and three above Portugal, Hungary and Albania. Queiroz, who believes Portugal were the better side in Stockholm, added: "We'll be playing at home (on Wednesday) and we want to show that we're determined to build a great team, playing good football. "For one reason or another, the national team hasn't yet reached it's potential," he added of the 2006 World Cup semi-finalists who only reached the last eight at Euro 2008. Albania, who lost 2-0 away to Hungary on Saturday, could be without striker Hamdih Salihi on Wednesday due to injury. Their Dutch coach Arie Haan has no illusions about the task facing his team. He said the group will be won by Portugal, Sweden or Denmark. Probable teams: Portugal: 1-Quim; 4-Jose Bosingwa, 5-Pepe, 2-Bruno Alves, 3-Paulo Ferreira; 10-Joao Moutinho, 6-Fernando Meira, 8-Raul Meireles; 11-Nani, 9-Hugo Almeida, 7-Cristiano Ronaldo Albania: 1-Arjan Beqaj; 6-Debatik Curri, 3-Kristi Vangjeli, 4-Armend Dallku, 2-Elvin Beqiri; 5-Lorik Cana, 10-Klodian Duro, 14-Altin Lala, 7-Amsi Agolli, 13-Ervin Skela; 16-Erion Bogdani Referee: Knut Kircher (Germany)
