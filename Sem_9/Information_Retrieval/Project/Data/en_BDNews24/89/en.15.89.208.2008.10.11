 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission chairman says the antigraft body will take steps to carry on its work effectively under the next elected government. "The commission will hold talks with politicians along with the government officials and the business community so that it might go on with its activities with a minimum level of cooperation," ACC boss Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury told reporters on Saturday. Briefing the press, at the ACC office in Segunbagicha ahead of his five-day tour to Barisal, he said of corruption suspects contesting the upcoming elections: "The government and Election Commission will decide the matter." "But the commission considers a verdict upheld until an appeal is filed against the verdict or the verdict is overturned." Said Mashhud: "We can do nothing to do if a corrupt person contests and wins the elections. We can only continue our awareness campaigns so that the public does not vote for them." Asked about the commission's view on possible government moves to withdraw the cases filed against former prime minsters Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, the ACC boss said: "The commission is not dwelling on the matter. Nor does it have any statement regarding the issue." "It is not possible to stop corruption just through accusing persons or parties. So the commission has planned to hold a series of talks with the top government officials, politicians and businessmen." On the Truth Commission's activities so far, he said: "It should be cross-checked whether those who are going to the commission are providing correct information. Their information should be evaluated." "If they provide any wrong information, their cases should be reconsidered. If we work altogether we will definitely get good outcome," he said. bdnew
