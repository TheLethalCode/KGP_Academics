 RAIPUR, India, Sun Oct 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An elderly woman in Chhattisgarh jumped into her husband's funeral pyre, killing herself in an outlawed custom, police said on Sunday. Lalmati Verma, 71, immolated herself on Saturday after mourners had left the cremation site, said police officer B.R. Mandawi in Kasdol, 125 km from Raipur.

At village Chechar, dozens of people gathered at the site on the bank of river Shivnath on Sunday to pay their respects. Investigations were being conducted, Mandawi said.

Her death sparked a national outrage and forced the government to issue a ban on the glorification of sati
