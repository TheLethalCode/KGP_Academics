 Dhaka, Oct 11(bdnews24.com) Embattled former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Saturday said he would contest the upcoming national elections as an independent candidate from his home constituency, and called on all politicians "to work in unison with the government towards a fair election". Speaking at a rally on the Chowghoria Adarsha Biddyapith premises, Bhuiyan announced that he no longer belonged to any party. "I am a son of Narsingdi. I have stood by you in the past, and will continue to do. I have tried to work for the people and will continue that as long as live," said Bhuiyan. "My efforts now centre on you, the inhabitants of Narsingdi and Shibpur. I will contest the elections for you," he said. Bhuiyan was greeted by several hundred locals on his arrival at his home village of Shibpur on Friday. The former LRGD and cooperative affairs minister said he believed it was essential to maintain the schedule for the national polls, slated for December 18, adding that only an election can take the nation forward. "I urge all politicians to work in unison with the government towards a fair election," said Bhuiyan. During his speech, the former BNP leader focused on the importance of the agricultural sector, saying: "The overall development of a country comes from a flourishing agricultural economy." Former prime minister Khaleda Zia expelled Bhuiyan from the BNP immediately after her arrest on Sept 3, 2007. bdne
