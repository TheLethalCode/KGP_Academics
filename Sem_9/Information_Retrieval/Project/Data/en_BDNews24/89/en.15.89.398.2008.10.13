 Dhaka, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation on Monday signed a one-year contract on group life and health insurance for the national footballers with the Progati Life Insurance Limited ahead of the Merdeka Cup in Malaysia. The national footballers are scheduled to leave here for Kuala Lumpur early Tuesday and the BFF highups informed the players that they were insured during the campaign in the 40th edition of the tournament scheduled for Oct 15-25. "We could have signed the agreement a few days later, but we have completed it today so that the players can play without any hesitation about any injury," said BFF vice president Badal Roy at a press conference at the BFF House. "What the football federation had done in favour of the players is a unique thing in the arena of sports," said Badal Roy, who is also chairman of the National Team Management Committee. BFF senior vice president Salam Murshedi and Progati Life Insurance deputy general director SK Sarkar signed the contract on behalf of the respective organisations. "It is a historical day for the BFF and the footballers and I believe this would inspire the players and help build up their confidence level in tournament," said Murshedi. "We feel proud of being associated with the BFF and it is a 'no profit scheme 'for us as we have only taken a nominal charge for the group and health insurances," said SK Sarkar. Each of 20 national footballers will get Tk 5 lakh for the medical treatment if he suffers injuries while his family will receive Tk 10 lakh if a player dies a natural death. The amount will increase to Tk 20 lakh if a player dies from unnatural cause. Salam Murshedi said that the insurance would remain effective on the selected 20 players until the BFF calls another new squad in future. Meanwhile, BFF president Kazi Salahuddin on Monday met the players and the officials of the Kuala Lumpur-bound national team and urged them to put up better performance in the tournament. After the meeting, captain Motiur Munna told bdnews24.com that the speech from the BFF president had inspired all the players much. "What we have done and are going to do are all for the footballers and we want nothing special from you except a better performance," Munna quoted Salahuddin as saying. Bangladesh will play their first match against Mozambique on Oct 16 while the second and third matches against Myanmar and Vietnam will be held on Oct 18 and 20 respectively.
