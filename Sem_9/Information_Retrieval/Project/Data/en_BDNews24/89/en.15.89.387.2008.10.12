 Dhaka, Oct 12 9bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Khaleda Zia has appealed to the High Court to quash the Barapukuria charges against her, a lawyer said Sunday. The appeal was made to the HC bench of justices Syed AB Mahmudul Haque and Moinul Islam Chowdhury. The hearing on the appeal might be held Monday, barrister Nasiruddin Ashim told bdnews24.com. Khaleda's chief counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq is expected to take part in the hearing. Rafique-ul-Huq had earlier moved for a hearing Sunday afternoon, telling the HC bench: "This is an appeal for quashment of the case under section 561 of the CrPC." The bench said the court was not scheduled on Sunday to hear any appeal under section 561. Earlier in the day, a Dhaka court ordered Khaleda and others accused in the case to appear in court on Oct 16, after the BNP chairperson missed Sunday's scheduled appearance citing illness. Other accused in the case, former ministers MK Anwar and M Shamsul Islam appeared in the special judge's court on Sunday, while Motiur Rahman Nizami and Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan failed to show also citing illness. All four ministers of the previous four-party alliance government have secured bail from the High Court in the case, as has Khaleda. Two other accused in the case who are currently in custody, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, were not produced in court as they were undergoing treatment at Bangabandhu Sheih Mujib Medical University Hospital and BIRDEM prison cells. Another nine accused, facing arrest, are: former ministers of the immediate past BNP-led government Saifur Rahman and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, Aminul Haq, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former energy secretary Nazrul Islam, former chairman of Petrobangla SR Osmany, former director (mines and minerals) Moyeenul Ahsan, former managing director of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd Sirajul Islam, and chairman of Hosaf Group Moazzem Hossain, the local agent of the Chinese firm which was awarded the running of the coal mine. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the case against 16 people, including Khaleda Zia, on Oct 5. Arrest warrants against the nine accused who had not secured bail were issued on Oct 6. The case was filed on Feb 26 this year on charges of irregularities and corruption in awarding the production, management and maintenance work of Barapukuria coalmine to a Chinese firm. The charge sheets said the agreement with Chinese firm Consortium of China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) caused losses of Tk 158.71 crore to the government. bdnew
