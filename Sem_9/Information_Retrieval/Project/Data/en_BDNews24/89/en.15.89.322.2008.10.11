<TEXT>
 BANGALORE, India, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harbhajan Singh smashed his fifth test fifty to frustrate Australia after left-arm Mitchell Johnson had ripped through India's top-order with a four-wicket haul in the first test on Saturday. Harbhajan (54) put on 80 with Zaheer Khan (35 not out) for the eighth wicket to help India recover from 232 for seven on the third day after Johnson's three-wicket opening burst. At the close, India were 313 for eight in reply to Australia's first innings 430. Skipper Anil Kumble, who had yet to score, was at the crease with Zaheer after play was extended following a rain interruption of almost half an hour. The morning belonged to 26-year-old Johnson, whose opening burst dismissed opener Virender Sehwag (45), Sachin Tendulkar (13) and Vangipurappu Laxman (0). The Queenslander trapped Saurav Ganguly for 47 in his second spell in the final session to thrust India into deep trouble before Harbhajan anchored a recovery. Earlier, a dogged half-century by Rahul Dravid (51) and Ganguly's three useful partnerships averted a total collapse after paceman Brett Lee dismissed opener Gautam Gambhir (21) in the second over of the day. India had pinned their hopes on Sehwag, known for his ability to play big innings at a frantic pace, after the hosts resumed on 68 without loss. But Johnson, playing in his 10th test, enticed the dangerman to play loosely on the off-side to be caught by Matthew Hayden in the lone slip position after adding just two runs to his overnight 43. Johnson troubled Tendulkar with subtle changes of pace twice before having him caught at short cover by debutant spinner Cameron White. Tendulkar began the match needing 77 to overtake West Indian Brian Lara's test record tally of 11,953 runs. A scratchy start by Laxman was short-lived as he edged Johnson behind to leave India struggling at 106 for four before Ganguly put on 126 runs in the company of Dravid, Mahendra Dhoni (9) and Harbhajan. Medium-pacer Shane Watson trapped Dravid leg before and part-time spinner Michael Clarke dismissed Dhoni with a straight ball. Australia looked set for a commanding lead but a fired-up Harbhajan changed the script with some gutsy batting before Watson induced an edge. Harbajan hit five boundaries in his 110-ball effort, including two consecutive fours off Lee after the second new ball was taken
