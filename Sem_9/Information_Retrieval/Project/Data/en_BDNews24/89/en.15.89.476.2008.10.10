<TITLE> NATO seeks to overcome divide on Afghan drugs plan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Budapest, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The NATO allies will try on Friday to iron out differences over a US call for direct attacks on the Afghan drugs trade that is fuelling the Taliban insurgency. Defence ministers from the 26 NATO states, meeting in Budapest, will also discuss ways of helping Georgia rebuild its military which was badly mauled by Russian troops in August. NATO operations commander Gen. John Craddock has asked for the alliance force in Afghanistan, which numbers 50,700, to be allowed to attack laboratories, trafficking networks and drug lords to stem a trade that helps fund the Taliban insurgency. Germany, Spain and some other NATO states are wary of extending the role of the NATO mission. Germany is concerned it could worsen the violence and increase the risk to its forces, which although stationed in the quieter north patrol trafficking routes out of Afghanistan. Proponents say the plan is essential if NATO is to reduce violence. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Thursday the drugs trade brought the Taliban $60-$80 million a year. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer said action was needed as drug money was being used to buy weapons that kill NATO soldiers. German Defence Minister Franz Josef Jung said Germany was willing to assist in reconnaissance of trafficking routes and in training but any operations should be Afghan-led. "If this keeps an Afghan face then it's also in our interest that we support such an activity," he told reporters on Thursday. "I hope that NATO can reach an agreement tomorrow." Afghan Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak fully backed Craddock's call for more robust NATO action. Gates said allies were considering many options to allow for an agreement, such as allowing allies to opt out of counter-narcotics operations. "GLOOM AND DOOM" Seven years after U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, Britain's military commander and ambassador in Afghanistan gave gloomy assessments of the effort and said they thought the war against the Taliban could not be won. De Hoop Scheffer criticised NATO states for failing to provide enough troops, helicopters and trainers for the Afghan mission, but said he did not agree with the "gloom and doom". The United States has urged allies to send extra troops. Commanders are seeking up to 12,000 extra troops but some European member states have been reluctant to commit additional numbers. The United States plans to increase its troop numbers from 33,000 now, which include 13,000 under NATO, but U.S. officials worry allies will see this as an excuse not to meet pledges. Gates said he would press for a more comprehensive NATO approach to the war incorporating a quicker build-up of the Afghan army, more civilian aid and development as well as the counter-narcotics mission. De Hoop Scheffer said NATO would have to be in Afghanistan "several more long years" and members must also pursue military reforms and boost spending, despite the global financial crisis. Referring to members' standing pledges to being defence spending up to two percent of GDP, he complained that "the large majority of the allies aren't doing what the should do". The NATO ministers will also meet their Georgian counterpart to look at ways of helping it rebuild a military shattered during Russia's August invasion. Gates said on Thursday Washington was pushing NATO allies to put Georgia on a formal track to NATO membership in December. Some European allies want to delay membership to either Georgia or Ukraine due to concerns about the response of Russia, which has been incensed but what it sees as NATO encroachment into its traditional sphere of influence.
