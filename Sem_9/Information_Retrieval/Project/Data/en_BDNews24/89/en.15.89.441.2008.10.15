<TITLE> Azeris vote for president; opposition boycotts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAKU, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Azeris voted in a presidential election on Wednesday that was boycotted by the opposition and was almost certain to give Ilham Aliyev another five years, extending his family's rule in the oil-producing state. Analysts predict a low turnout. The main opposition leaders say curbs on democracy and media freedom make participation pointless, and have called on voters to stay at home. Rights groups back their complaints, and point to a personality cult around Ilham's late father, long-serving leader Heydar Aliyev, which they say makes dissent dangerous. But the government says Aliyev will win because he is immensely popular. His reign has coincided with an oil boom driving one of the world's fastest-growing economies -- despite the global financial crisis -- and filling government coffers. "I voted for our dear president," said Sona Azimova, a 69-year-old pensioner in Baku, where the fast cars and building boom strike a dramatic contrast with the poverty beyond the capital. "Look how our country is flourishing. He is the only one who helps and thinks about the people." The country of 8.3 million people lies at a strategic crossroads between East and West, sandwiched between Russia and Iran and straddling a region emerging as a major energy transit route from Central Asia to Europe. Opposition politicians and journalists in Azerbaijan say Western governments have toned down their criticism of Azerbaijan's democracy for fear of losing a strategic ally and access to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea. A win for the mustachioed 46-year-old would give him a second five-year term, his last under the constitution. Critics say he has done little to tackle rampant corruption. OPPOSITION PROTEST In 2003, Aliyev succeeded his father, a former local KGB chief who went on to rule Azerbaijan for more than 30 years as Soviet-era Communist party boss and then as president. His father's portrait displayed at almost every turn, Aliyev won 76 percent of the vote. The opposition cried foul, but protests were crushed by police. The opposition Musavat party has already filed for permission to protest on Saturday, October18. Observers will watch closely for Thursday's initial assessment by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has almost 400 monitors in the field. "Turnout will be low, but everyone who goes to the polling station will vote for the president," said analyst Leila Aliyeva of the Baku-based Center for National and International Studies. "The West has other priorities in Azerbaijan, not the democratization of our society." Baku has traditionally tried to balance itself between the West and its former Soviet master Russia. But this summer's war between Russia and Georgia, when Moscow made clear its readiness to defend spheres of "privileged interest" in the former Soviet Union, has cast doubt over Azerbaijan's ability to play all sides for much longer. Analysts say a smooth election day, despite a flawed campaign, could be enough to win a more favorable report card. Besides Aliyev, there are six other candidates. None of the main opposition leaders are running. Polls close at 7.00 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT), and official results are expected early on Thursday
