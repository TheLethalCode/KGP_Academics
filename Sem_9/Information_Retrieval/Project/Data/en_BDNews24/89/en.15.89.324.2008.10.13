 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh Road Transport Owners and Workers Unity Council withdrew a strike threat Monday, which had been scheduled for the following day. The council announced the move following what they described as 'fruitful talks' with communications adviser Ghulam Quader and secretary Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, the council's joint convenor Shahjahan Khan said an understanding had been reached between the two parties. Regarding the possibility of reduced passenger fares in the wake of falling fuel prices, Khan said: "We are considering the matter. Any decision to lower fares will be taken after consultation with the government." bdne
