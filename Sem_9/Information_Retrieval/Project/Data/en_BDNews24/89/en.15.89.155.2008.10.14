<TEXT>
 DAMASCUS, Tue Oct 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree on Tuesday to establish diplomatic relations with Lebanon for the first time since the two Arab neighbors won independence from France in the 1940s. The decree, which formalizes decisions taken jointly with Lebanon, encouraged by France over the last few months, instructs the Syrian foreign ministry to establish an embassy in Beirut, without specifying a date. Lebanon's Foreign Minister Fawzi Salloukh said he would visit Damascus on Wednesday to discuss the mechanism for establishing ties with his Syrian counterpart Walid al-Moualem. Syrian officials had expected ambassadors to be exchanged before the end of this year. The Damascus government has been under Western pressure to take steps viewed as recognition of Lebanon's sovereignty, including opening diplomatic relations, since Syrian forces pulled out of Lebanon in 2005 after a 29-year presence. Syria dominated Lebanese politics for three decades before its 2005 withdrawal, which followed the assassination of Lebanese former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. A United Nations investigation implicated high-level Syrian security officials in the killing. Syria denied involvement. Syria and Lebanon, carved by Britain and France out of the remnants of the Ottoman empire in 1920, have never had diplomatic relations. Tension and restrictions on cross-border movement have often marred relations between them. The Beirut government has a liaison office in Damascus staffed by a Lebanese diplomat. The two countries signed a "brotherhood" agreement in 1991, which anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians say is tilted in Syria's favor
