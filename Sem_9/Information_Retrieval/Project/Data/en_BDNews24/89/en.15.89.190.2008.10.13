<TITLE> Will Prince Charles appear in `Doctor Who?' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mon Oct 13,(bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Prince Charles has been invited to appear on the BBC's `Doctor Who' television show -- and his office has not ruled it out. Initially, Clarence House turned down the approach, a move which prompted the show's executive producer Russell T. Davies to label the Prince a "miserable swine" in a joking reference to the heir to the throne's favorite radio show. But a Clarence House spokeswoman told Reuters on Monday the Prince himself had not actually seen the request. "We did receive a request from 'Doctor Who's' producers," she said. "It was not turned down by Prince Charles but by a Clarence House official. We receive hundreds of requests and he doesn't see them all. She added: "It's not uncommon for people to resubmit requests with different criteria and if it was resubmitted we would look at it again." With the show's lead actor David Tennant winning rave reviews for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company at the moment, the fifth season of "Doctor Who" is not due until 2010, though three one-off specials featuring the time-traveling adventurer are planned for 2009
