<TITLE> Ecuador ready for 'weak' Chile attack, says Benitez </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 QUITO, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuador can cope with Chile's toothless attack and defensive strategy when their World Cup qualifying opponents visit Quito, says striker Christian Benitez. "They have weak players in attack," Benitez was quoted as saying on Web sites in both countries ahead of Sunday's game. "They always hide themselves when they come and play in Quito. We are going to go out to press them and win." Team mate Felipe Caicedo also predicted the visitors would struggle in the high altitude of Quito at 2,800 metres above sea level. "It's unlikely that they will compete on equal terms. We're going to put pressure on them from the start and it's unlikely they can stand this rhythm," he said. Beaten 2-0 on their previous visit to Quito four years ago, Chile said they would not rise to the bait. "Everyone is entitled to say what they want," midfielder Gonzalo Fierro told the Chilean federation's Web site (www.anfp.cl). "When we arrived here, they said we were a very young team and that we're not ready for matches of this importance. But we have won important games and taken a lot of points away from home." "We're thinking about Chile and not the comments of the Ecuadoreans." Chile are fourth in the 10-team South American qualifying group with 13 points from eight games, four ahead of Ecuador. Chile, who have already won in Bolivia at 3,600 metres above sea level, have scored 13 goals, three more than their opponents
