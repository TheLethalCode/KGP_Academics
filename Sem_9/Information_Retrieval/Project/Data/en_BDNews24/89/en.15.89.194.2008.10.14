 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com) - BNP tabled a seven-point proposal in its three-hour dialogue with the government on Tuesday, including lifting the emergency for creating a congenial atmosphere for national elections. "We think the implementation of the proposals will help to create an electoral atmosphere. It is not possible to hold elections amid the state of emergency.," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after the dialogue. Both government and party representaives said in a joint news briefing that the two sides could not reach a consensus yet. "We will hold more talks," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said. The long-awaited dialogue between the government and BNP began around 11.15am and ended at 2.10pm at the chief adviser's office. Delwar led a 13-member BNP delegation, while the government side was led by chief adviser Fakhrudddin Ahmed and five fellow advisers Ghulam Quader, AFM Hassan Ariff, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, Anwarul Iqbal and Hossain Zillur Rahman. The meeting was brought forward by a day. It had been originally scheduled for Oct 15. The morning talks with the BNP will be followed by an afternoon dialogue with its four-party ally, Jamaat-e-Islami. Prior to the dialogue BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com that the discussions would focus on "some existing obstacles to holding a fair election, especially the issue of withdrawal of the state of emergency". The party would repeat the demand for withdrawal of the state of emergency, scrapping the amended Representation of the People Ordinance, and release of the party leaders in jail and withdrawal of cases against them, he said. The dialogue between the government and the political parties started on May 22. The government has already had meetings with 16 parties including the Awami League. bdnew
