<TEXT>
 DORTMUND, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Germany retained top spot in World Cup qualifying Group Four after first-half goals from Lukas Podolski and Michael Ballack gave them a 2-1 win over Russia on Saturday. Having built a deserved 2-0 lead at halftime, the Euro 2008 runners-up came under severe pressure in the second period, and rode their luck near the end when Alan Dzagoyev's scrambled effort rebounded off a post. Podolski opened the scoring when he picked up Miroslav Klose's pass on the edge of the penalty area in the ninth minute, hustled his way around defender Vasily Berezutsky and slammed the ball past Igor Akinfeyev in the Russian goal. Captain Ballack was in the right place to double Germany's lead 20 minutes later by side-footing home Bastian Schweinsteiger's clever cross with Akinfeyev stranded. Russia's playmaker Andrei Arshavin got his side back in the match just after the break, stabbing Alexander Anyukov's cross into an empty net after a rare mistake by Philipp Lahm. Midfielder Piotr Trochowski almost restored Germany's two-goal cushion minutes later when Akinfeyev tipped his swerving, long-range drive on to the crossbar but Germany looked increasingly nervous as the second half wore on. The dangerous Arshavin shot just past the post and had another low effort saved by Rene Adler but the visitors failed to find an equaliser. "We started at a fast tempo in the first half and played some great football," Ballack said in a television interview. "They were pushing until the very end for the equaliser and it certainly wouldn't have been undeserved," he added. "I am happy that I managed the goal today and it was definitely an important victory." Germany lead the Group Four standings with seven points from three matches, ahead of Wales, who Germany play on Wednesday in Moenchengladbach, with six points. Russia are fourth with three points from two matches, behind Finland on four points. Germany coach Joachim Loew conceded the Russians probably deserved a draw. "We definitely had a bit of luck at the end," he said in a television interview. "We lost the ball a few times and they were able to take advantage and show what a dangerous team they are. "When you concede a goal so soon after halftime then everything gets a bit hairy
