 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com) Officials at the communications ministry will meet Monday to discuss a mass transit plan for Dhaka that includes up to 60 kilometres of subway and elevated rail. The meeting, to be chaired by the communications adviser, is expected to recommend a Tk 10 crore feasibility study on the proposed transit system. "The meeting will discuss funding mechanisms for feasibility studies on the proposed subway and circular elevated expressway," Bangladesh Railway director general Md Belyet Hossain told bdnews24.com Sunday. The director general said he expected it would take one-and-a-half years to complete the study once the funding mechanism was fixed. The meeting marks an advance for the two proposals, initially floated in 2002, following years of bureaucratic wrangling and red tape. However, a sticking point remains on who will finance the feasibility study, with the communications ministry maintaining the funds should be raised from public money, while the planning ministry favours foreign donors. "We have been asked to look for a donor to conduct the feasibility study," said Hossain. In August 2003, Bangladesh Railway sent a proposal through the communications ministry to the planning ministry to carry out the feasibility study using government money. But an inter-ministerial meeting later decided that the decision should only be taken after finalisation of the Dhaka strategic transport plan (STP), which only received the government nod in Feb 2008. In October 2005, the railway sent another proposal to the planning ministry seeking Japanese assistance for the study. However, no further action was taken when Japan refused to fund the project. The following year the same proposal sought government funding. In May 2006, the planning ministry returned the proposal, again suggesting the railway should find a donor for the study after approval of the STP. Finally, in April this year, the communications ministry recommended the study could be undertaken using government money, provided the funds were reimbursed in the form of a "success fee" from the winning bidder. The communications ministry has now sent this proposal to the planning ministry for approval. However, in another twist, a meeting of the special project evaluation committee in September, presided over by the communications secretary, once more recommended foreign funding. "It is not possible to find a donor for a feasibility study. It must funded by the government," Andul Halim, a retired additional director general of the project, told bdnews24.com. "This search for funding has been delaying the feasibility study for too long," he added. bd
