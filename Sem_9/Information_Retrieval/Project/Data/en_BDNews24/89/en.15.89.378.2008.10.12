 BOGOTA, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Paraguay handed Colombia's new coach Eduardo Lara a losing start on Saturday with a 1-0 win in Bogota which kept them top of the South American group. Forward Salvador Cabanas stunned the hosts when he caught goalkeeper Agustin Julio off his guard in the ninth minute. Cabanas unleashed a swerving 30-metre shot from near the touchline which found the huge gap between Julio and his near post and was over the line before the keeper reacted. Colombia, who have scored only four goals in nine qualifiers, had plenty of possession but failed to create openings as they slumped to their third successive defeat in the group and completed their fourth game without scoring. Lara, who replaced Jorge Luis Pinto following a 4-0 loss to Chile, made sweeping changes to the side but Colombia still showed their old failings in front of goal. David Ferreira had their best chance in injury-time when he fired narrowly over after some neat footwork by Darwin Quintero. Paraguay lead the 10-team group with 20 points from nine games, four ahead of Argentina who beat Uruguay 2-1, as they stay on course for a fourth successive World Cup appearance. Colombia, who last qualified in 1998, stayed sixth with 10 point
