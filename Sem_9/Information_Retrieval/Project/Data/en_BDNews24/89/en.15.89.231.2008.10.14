<TITLE> Van Persie could return for Dutch against Norway </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROTTERDAM, Netherlands, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Robin van Persie will join the Netherlands squad on Monday when they gather for their World Cup Group Nine qualifier against Norway in Oslo on Wednesday (1700 GMT). Van Persie pulled out earlier this week with hamstring problems but will be tested to see if he can join the team that beat Iceland 2-0 on Saturday to top the group with six points after two matches. Nigel de Jong and John Heitinga both missed the match against the fourth-placed Norwegians, who have two points after two matches, due to knee injuries. The Dutch will travel to Norway with confidence and the knowledge that a third successive win will put them firmly in the driving seat, five points ahead of second-placed Scotland, to qualify for the 2010 finals in South Africa. Despite his injury problems, coach Bert van Marwijk managed to pick a team that showed form against Iceland with outstanding games by left winger Ryan Babel, who was a nightmare for his marker, and defender Dirk Marcellis on his debut. Wesley Sneijder is fit for the match, though Van Marwijk will handle the midfielder with care as he has just recovered from a knee injury. "Sneijder has not played a match for two months and I will take that in consideration" Van Marwijk told reporters. "But it will be my decision if he starts and Real Madrid has nothing to do with that," he added, referring to the contact he had with Sneijder's club before adding him to the squad. TWO DRAWS Norway need a win to fight back in the group after drawing against Iceland last month and Scotland on Saturday. However, a home win against one of the major European countries is something recent Norway teams have not experienced as the last shock result at home was in 1993 when they beat England to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. "We must not be afraid of the unknown, even though we're up against Netherlands. We can take them if we use the right tactics and have a clear mindset," coach Aage Hareide was quoted as saying in tabloid VG. "We are not out of the fight for second place in the group after the draw in Scotland but what we can and must do is win." Probable teams: Norway: 1-Jon Knudsen; 2-Jon Hoiland, 5-Brede Hangeland, 3-Kjetil Waehler, 6-John Arne Riise; 9-Bjorn Helge Riise, 7-Fredrik Stromstad, 8-Christian Grindheim, 4-Fredrik Winsnes; 14-Steffen Iversen, 10-John Carew Netherlands: 1-Edwin van der Sar; 2-Dirk Marcellis, 3-Andre Ooijer, 4-Joris Mathijsen, 5-Giovanni van Bronckhorst; 7-Dirk Kuyt, 6-Mark van Bommel, 10-Rafael van der Vaart, 15-Demy de Zeeuw, 11-Ryan Babel; 9-Klaas Jan Huntelaar Referee: Konrad Plautz (Austria)
