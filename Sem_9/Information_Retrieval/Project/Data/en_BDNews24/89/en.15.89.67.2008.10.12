 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will propose changing the schedule of the Dhaka-Kolkata Maitree Express to make it more attractive and convenient for passengers, say senior railway officials. Bangladesh wants the train to reach Dhaka on Tuesday and go back to Kolkata on Wednesday, Bangladesh Railway's director general Md Belayet Hossain told bdnews24.com. He said they have no problem with the schedule of the train operated from Dhaka. Currently, one Bangladesh train starts from Dhaka to Kolkata on Saturday and returns from Kolkata on Sunday. Similarly, one Indian train starts from Kolkata for Dhaka on Saturday and returns next day. "According to the current schedule, if passengers go to Kolkata by train, they have to spend seven days in Kolkata for the next return train. "Because of the inconvenience, passengers travel by bus, instead," Hossain reasoned. "If the Indian authorities agree, the new schedule would come into effect from January next year," said the director general. He said they would table the proposal at the next inter-governmental railway meeting scheduled next month. "If the new schedule is implemented, the Maitree Express trains would become more attractive and convenient for passengers," railway's additional director general (operations) Quazi Asadullah told bdnews24.com. He said both Bangladesh and India agreed cutting the travel time by two hours. "The agreed travel time cannot be enforced until the Indian Railway (Eastern Railway) completes the construction of a new platform at Kolkata station," said Asadullah. Maitree Express takes at least 12 hours  six hours for customs and immigration formalities at the border stations  to reach Kolkata from Dhaka and vice versa. This has been a drag on the travelers. The direct passenger trains were launched on April 14 after the service was snapped in 1965. According to the railway figures, 100 passengers travel on average by the 418-seat train. bd
