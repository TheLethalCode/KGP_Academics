<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP and its political ally Jamaat-e-Islami submitted two separate written applications to the Election Commission on Sunday asking it to extend the deadline for party registration by one week. In a letter signed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, BNP said it would be difficult for the party to complete registration by Oct 15 as it was to sit in dialogue with the government on Oct 14. If given one more week, the party will be able to complete its necessary preparations for registration, the letter said. Jamaat, in its letter signed by secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed, stated the same reason. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in the afternoon told reporters: "[BNP and Jamaat] have informed us that it will be difficult for them to apply for registration by the deadline. We will let them know our decision about a deadline extension on Oct 15." Delwar has earlier said the party would make a decision on registration after its dialogue with the government. The chief adviser is scheduled to sit in separate talks with both BNP and Jamaat on Oct 14. After a meeting with EC officials Sunday, BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said: "We will have discussions with the government on many issues including new electoral laws and party registration." He said BNP would discuss the issue of registration at the party forum and with its alliance partners after the dialogue before taking a final decision. Nazrul pointed out it would not be possible for them to take necessary preparations for registration in just one day following the dialogue with the government. The EC is taking a positive stand regarding registration, he added. Asked whether BNP is going to be registered in compliance with the new electoral laws, the BNP leader said: "We let the EC know our objections with some sections of the electoral laws. We will inform the government about them too." Jamaat said in its letter the party had taken a "positive decision" regarding the dialogue and requested the deadline for registration to be extended by one week. Top election officials told bdnews24.com on Saturday that the EC might respond positively to calls for extending the deadline for party registration, but would not give any concessions over re-demarcation of constituencies or recent alterations to the new Representation of the People Ordinance. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com: "The EC does not have any plan yet to extend the deadline for registration of political parties. However, if it gets any 'written proposal' in this regard it may be taken into consideration." Asked about any specific request that might be made by BNP, the CEC said: "There is yet some time before the October 15 deadline passes. However, if any written proposal comes explaining why the deadline has to be extended and what the problems are then it would be considered." Election commissioners told bdnews24.com there was no time in hand to make further concessions to other demands of parties, including constituency demarcation or another set of alterations to the RPO, if the election schedule for Dec 18 polls is to be announced by Nov 2. So far nine political parties have applied for registration. bdnews24.com
