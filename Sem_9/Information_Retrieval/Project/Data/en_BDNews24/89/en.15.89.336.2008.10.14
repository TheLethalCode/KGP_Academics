 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com) Advisers and the country's top policeman Tuesday refused to answer queries about participation of a top Jamaat leader, wanted in a high-profile corruption case, in a meeting with a government team led by the chief adviser. Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid, described by police as fugitive in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case, was part of the Jamaat delegation that took part in the dialogue at the chief adviser's office. At the post-dialogue press conference, one of the advisers evaded questions from the reporters. "His lawyer is present here. He will speak on the matter," said Hossain Zillur Rahman when asked about Mojahid's presence in the dialogue despite a police report calling him a fugitive. "There are cases against many politicians. There are cases against two former prime ministers. Mr Mojahid was present at the dialogue as the Jamaat secretary general," said Barrister Abdur Razzak, Mojahid's lawyer, who is also a member of the Jamaat team. "A bail petition has been made in the High Court. The hearing is scheduled for Oct 16. There is no legal barrier to his being present in the meeting," Razzak, an assistant secretary general of the party, told a questioner. Asked by journalists how the chief adviser and five other advisers could hold a meeting with a 'fugitive from the law', adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman hurriedly left the press conference room along with other advisers and Jamaat leaders. Mojahid and his party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami laughed as they watched the advisers leave the scene. The police chief was not willing either to answer queries on Mojahid. "I don't want to say anything further on these things," inspector general of police Noor Mohammad said, in response to bdnews24.com. "Sorry," he said, slamming the phone down. A police report on Sunday showed Mojahid as a fugitive after an arrest warrant was issued against him in the corruption case. Later in the day, DMP commissioner Naim Ahmed, asked by reporters, told a press conference that Mojahid could not be arrested due to his social status. On Monday, BNP secretary general warned against arrests of the Barapukuria accused, saying the polls atmosphere could be spoiled. Mojahid has also appeared in public rallies and made speeches since the warrant of arrest issued on Oct 6. A Dhaka special judge, Md Azizul Haq, also ordered publication of a notice in newspapers on confiscation of his property if he failed to appear in the court by Oct 16. The judge ordered arrest of eight others in the case. bdnews2
