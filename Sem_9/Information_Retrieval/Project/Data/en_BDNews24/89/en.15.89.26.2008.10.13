<TEXT>
 SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kaka scored a superb goal only six minutes into his first international for eleven months to set Brazil on the way to a 4-0 win over Venezuela in a World Cup qualifier on Sunday. Robinho and Adriano, with his first international goal since the 2006 World Cup, added two before the 20th minute to effectively kill off the game and give Brazil their 18th win in 19 outings against their northern neighbours. Robinho completed the scoring in the second half while Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar was also outstanding, making one brave save when the score was goalless and pulling off a brilliant double save in the second half. The win lifted Brazil to second in the 10-team South American group with 16 points from nine games, ahead of Argentina on goal difference and four behind leaders Paraguay. Venezuela are ninth with seven points. Venezuela fielded nine of their players from their 2-0 friendly win against Brazil in June in the hope of pulling off a repeat. The hosts made a lively start and had an excellent chance in the fourth minute when Julio Cesar dived at the feet of Alejandro Guerra after he latched onto a long ball forward and broke clear of the Brazil defence. Instead, Venezuela were shot to ribbons in a devastating 13-minute spell. Kaka started things off when he collected the ball on the right around 30 metres from goal, burst into the area and unleashed a shot which found a gap between Venezuela goalkeeper Renny Vega and the near post. Robinho, also given too much freedom, added the second four minutes later with a dipping 30-metre shot which again found Vega wanting. In the 19th minute, Kaka found Elano on the left and his low cross was met by Adriano, who sidefooted the third. Venezuela forward Juan Arango had a powerful free kick fisted away by Julio Cesar in the 22nd minute and should have pulled one back in first-half injury-time when he broke clear of the Brazil defence but dallied over his shot. The hosts were frustrated again after halftime when Julio Cesar saved Maldonado's header and somehow managed to block the rebound as well. Shortly afterwards, he fisted away another goal-bound Maldonado shot. Robinho added the fourth for Brazil in the 67th minute when he beat the offside trap and scored with a clinical finish from Kleber's pass forwar
