<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked upazila nirbahi officers to be neutral in the upcoming elections, warning UNOs who will act as assistant returning officers of maximum penalties for those found violating the electoral code. Election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain inaugurated a training programme for the assistant returning officers assigned to national and upazila polls at the Electoral Training Institute in Agargaon. "Any kind of biased attitude is prohibited in the elections. If such allegations are proved against anybody, he will face maximum punishment on charges of violating the rule of his service," commissioner Sakhawat Hussain told local administrators. "It will not be acceptable to scrap any candidate's nomination in any trivial pretext," Sakhawat said. The electoral law, giving the power of cancelling candidature, must not be misused, he said. Only the EC has that power, he said, adding: "The returning officers have never been vested with the authority." "But the commission will hold hearings, based on reports against any candidate by electoral enquiry committees," Sakhawat said. The EC in the last local polls did not cancel any candidacy even after hearing major allegations against some candidates, he added. On objections by parties to provisions in the new Representation of People Ordinance, Sakhawat said: "After a second amendment it is not possible to bring any further change to the RPO before elections." "The commission is fully prepared to hold the elections scheduled for Dec 18," he said. "If it does not take place in time the people who foil the polls will be responsible for that." Commissioner Sohul Hussain cautioned the local administrators: "You must not pay any heed to anybody. You will do your jobs in line with the electoral laws." "Any kind of biasness will not be tolerated," he told them. Sohul said: "We have heard allegations on biasness against officers in the past. But now the situation is congenial." Nevertheless, he added, the EC would be extra vigilant about any allegations of bias by UNOs from now up to elections. Urging the returning officer to work neutrally, Sohul said: "There is no more important issue before the nation than elections." "Everybody must be sincere in exercising electoral laws in the polls. And also to be vigilant whether electoral laws are being violated anywhere." EC joint secretary Rafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com Sunday that a total of 525 officers, including 481 upazila nirbahi officers, would be in the training programme from Oct 12 to Nov 4. Some 70 UNOs were at the first session on Sunday. Any officer found guilty of violating the law of his service will have to face seven years' imprisonment along with losing his job, Rafiqul said. bdnews
