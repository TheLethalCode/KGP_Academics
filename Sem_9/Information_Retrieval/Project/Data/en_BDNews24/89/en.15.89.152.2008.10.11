<TITLE> Kaka set for Brazil return against Venezuela </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Player of the Year Kaka is set to make his first Brazil appearance in 11 months when they visit Venezuela for a World Cup qualifier on Sunday (2000 GMT kickoff). A series of nagging injuries have prevented Kaka from representing his country and also raised questions over his commitment to the national side, especially as they followed his request to skip last year's Copa America. The AC Milan player was criticised in Brazil over the timing of a knee operation in May, which took place immediately after the end of the Italian season but prevented him from playing in the World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Argentina in June. His last international was in the 2-1 win over Uruguay last November. Brazil have sorely missed Kaka's presence, winning only one of their last four World Cup qualifiers and failing to score in the other three. Their problems culminated in a dismal 0-0 draw at home to Bolivia last month, which increased the pressure on beleaguered coach Dunga. Striker Robinho said that Kaka's presence would have a knock-on effect, giving team mates more freedom on the pitch. "Any team which knows that they are facing Kaka will respect us. I think they'll be more worried, not just with him but the others," he said. "I hope it gives me more space to play in." Brazil's unhappy run began with a stunning 2-0 defeat to Venezuela in a friendly in Boston in June, ending a 100 percent record against their northern neighbours. Venezuela have also struggled since then, taking only one out of their last 12 points in the qualifiers, although they have won low-key friendlies against Netherlands Antilles and Syria. The only South American country never to have played at a World Cup, Venezuela have dropped to eighth in the 10-team group with seven points from eight games. Brazil, despite their poor run, are second with 13, but have slipped four points behind leaders Paraguay. Probable teams: Venezuela: Rafael Dudamel; Roberto Rosales, Pedro Boada, Jose Manuel Rey, Jorge Vargas; Miguel Mea Vitali, Franklin Lucena, Alejandro Guerra, Ronald Vargas; Juan Arango, Giancarlo Maldonado Brazil: Julio Cesar; Maicon, Lucio, Juan, Kleber; Gilberto Silva, Josue, Elano, Kaka; Robinho, Adriano Referee: Victor Rivera (Peru)
