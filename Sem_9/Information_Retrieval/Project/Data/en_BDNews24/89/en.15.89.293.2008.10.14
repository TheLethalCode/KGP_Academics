 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman said the party was ready to submit its application, along with a draft of its amended constitution, for registration on Wednesday "in line with new electoral law". Presidium member Tofail Ahmed told a press briefing that the application would be submitted at noon Wednesday. Asked whether Awami League's decision to keep associate organisations was against the new Representation of the People Ordinance 2008, Tofail replied in the negative. He said AL's associate organisations would run according to their own constitution. Awami League's central working committee will have no control in running the associate organisations, say AL leaders. Zillur told reporters, after a meeting of the party presidium at his Gulshan home Tuesday, the party's policymaking body approved the amended constitution adopted by the working committee on Monday. "A delegation of Awami League comprising its office secretary, assistant office secretary and others will submit the application tomorrow (Wednesday), along with the draft amended constitution," he added. Replying to reporters' questions, the party's acting general secretary Syed Ashrfaul Islam said: "There is no doubt regarding the holding of election." Asked whether they would participate if the election is held under the emergency Ashraf maintained: "The emergency has to be withdrawn. We want withdrawal of the emergency for an election recognised as credible nationally and internationally." Party presidium member Abdur Razzak voiced AL's demand for cancellation of the Election Commission's power to cancel candidature for electoral code violations. AL presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam were present among others. bdnew
