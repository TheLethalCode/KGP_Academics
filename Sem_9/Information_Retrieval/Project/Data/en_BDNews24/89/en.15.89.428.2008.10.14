 Dhaka, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com)  A polished century from Ross Taylor drove New Zealand to clinch the one-day international series 2-1, with an emphatic 79-run win over hosts Bangladesh, in the decider at Birshreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong on Tuesday. Bangladesh put on a shaky 170 for eight in 50 overs after the Kiwis posted a fighting total of 249 for seven in 50 overs. The Tigers badly needed to hone their performance in the final match to see them with a winning chance, but reckless shots threw away wickets in an all too familiar pattern, making the visitors' task all too easy. Junaed Siddique (one) fell to Kyle Mills in the third over before Tamim Iqbal, on his home ground in Chittagong, and debutant Imrul Kayes briefly raised hopes of their first series win against a Test-playing nation other than Zimbabwe. After being dropped on nought, Tamim punished New Zealand pace duo Mills and Tim Southee, smashing five boundaries, but Daniel Vettori brought Jacob Orman in to relieve Southee and was immediately rewarded. Imrul, looking uneasy on the pitch, struck Oram for a boundary, but Oram picked up the debutant batsman (12) in the next and last delivery of his first over to justify Vettori's decision to bring him in the attack. Tamim (35 off 39 balls) followed Imrul two balls later, while trying to cut spinner Jeetan Patel to be caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum, and Mohammad Ashraful missed a good length ball off Oram to be bowled for a seven-ball eight. Off-spinner Patel next had Shakib Al Hasan caught by Jesse Ryder for one, to leave Bangladesh collapsing on 59 for five in 16.4 overs from 49 for two in 12 overs, with and hosts unable to recover the damage. With five wickets down, Bangladesh's hopes of knocking down the Black Caps, in the 100th one-dayer to be played on Bangladesh soil, ended with the remaining batsmen left only to reduce the defeat margin playing out the 50 overs. Nayeem Islam remained unbeaten on a painful 46 off 106 balls, while, in contrast, Abdur Razzak played a quick 27 off 31 balls studded with two fours and one six. Oram, Mills, and Patel returned two wickets each. Taylor's faultless 103, his third ODI hundred, and 125 runs for the third wicket with Jamie How, earlier powered the Black Caps to their highest total in the series. Syed Rasel and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza created an early inroad for Bangladesh, removing openers Jesse Ryder (3) and McCullum (6) after being put into bowl first. However, Taylor and How upped the pressure on the Bangladesh bowlers to repair the early setback before spinners Shakib and Nayeem, introduced after 20 overs, forced them to limit their strokes. The duo's tight bowling slowed the visitors down till the 30th over, but the Kiwis rose again to accelerate the run-wheel before How was trapped lbw by Nayeem for 73 off 82 balls studded with 10 boundaries. Bangladesh picked up another two quick wickets including big fish Oram, who put on 57 and 75 not out in the first two matches, as the all-rounder swept Razzak to be caught at deep square leg by Tamim for just three runs in the final match. Taylor, who smacked four sixes and five fours in his 119-ball knock, was finally caught by Mushfiqur Rahim off Mashrafee to leave his side at 219 for seven in 47 overs. Daniel Vettori (19) and Mills (18) together put on a quick 30 in the last three overs for the unbroken eighth wicket. bdnews
