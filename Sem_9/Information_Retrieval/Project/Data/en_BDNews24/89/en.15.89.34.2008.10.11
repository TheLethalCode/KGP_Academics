<TITLE> Tofail to head AL constitutional body </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 11 (bdnews24.com)Presidium member Tofail Ahmed will head a powerful committee to recommend changes to the Awami League constitution, the party's central working committee decided Saturday. The decision came in the wake of legal requirement that political parties register and follow the newly-prescribed rules of the political game that have necessitated re-writing of constitutions. All other members of the presidium, advisory council members Hossain Toufique Imam, Abul Maal Abdul Muhit and six central committee members will join the former commerce and industries minister in the exercise. This past week has seen the party debate, often publicly, whether to keep the so-called "associate" organisations. The acting general secretary said last week there would be no associate organisations. But some days later, acting president Zillur Rahman said such organisations would definitely stay. Advisory council member HT Imam again said Friday night: "In the draft amendment to the party constitution, a recommendation has been made to scrap the associate organisations."
