 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)--Britain supports holding of the Dec 18 general election "with as little emergency legislation as possible" to ensure free and fair polls, says visiting UK minister Lord Mark Malloch Brown. After meeting foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry on Wednesday, he also told reporters that his country was "counting down" to the exit of the caretaker government and Bangladesh's return to democracy. "Our message: we are on the side of [the elections] being as much as possible free and fair, with as little emergency legislation as possible," said the UK foreign office minister for Asia, Africa and the United Nations, who arrived in Dhaka on a two-day visit Wednesday morning. "When I say that the elections should be free, fair and legitimate, I think that as much as possible that should mean that they should take place not under emergency laws, but under the regular constitutional arrangement." "But there are some law and order issues that the government is very concerned about and we will have to see whether or not they are able to remove all of the legislation or leave at least some small part in place," said Lord Brown. "We are counting on the elections going forward on December 18 and the elections being held in conditions which allow a free and fair vote and the people of Bangladesh to choose again their government." "We think the caretaker government played a very important role  it is time now for Bangladeshi democracy again and people to choose their own government," he added. He said Britain could not dictate what Bangladesh should do, and stressed that the government, the political parties and the Election Commission should negotiate to resolve differences. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed told reporters: "We discussed the political developments in Bangladesh leading to the election scheduled for 18th December". "I apprised [the minister] of the government's determination that the elections be free, fair and credible, and that we are able to demonstrate once again what is now generally acknowledged, that Bangladesh is the most peaceful country in the region". Lord Brown earlier met with home affairs adviser MA Matin and is later scheduled to have talks with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. The chief adviser in a September address to the nation announced general elections would be held under a relaxed state of emergency, rather than a total withdrawal. Political parties have been demanding a total lifting of emergency for holding of the ninth parliamentary polls, with major party BNP along with its political allies refusing to register before an accord is reached with the government on the issue. Meanwhile, the European Commission's mission head in Dhaka said Wednesday that the European Union will not send a polls observation mission unless the government restores certain civil and political rights by relaxing or lifting the state of emergency. bdn
