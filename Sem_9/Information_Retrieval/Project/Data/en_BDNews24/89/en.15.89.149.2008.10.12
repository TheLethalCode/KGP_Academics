 Dhaka, Oct 12 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain Sunday warned the government against carrying out a court arrest order in the Barapukuria coalmine case. Aiming at the government, he said: "Don't try to execute arrest warrants. Refrain from such activities. Otherwise you will be held responsible for hampering congenial atmosphere to election." He issued the warning from a four-party rally at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh Sunday afternoon. Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, one of the accused who faces arrest in the case, was present at the rally. After the rally, Mijaheed left the venue in a Pajero jeep under personal guard. Police and detective branch personnel were present outside the rally venue at the time. The rally was organised as a party of a four-party alliance's programme to press home its five point demands, including withdrawal of cases against Khaleda Zia, scrapping of the amended Representation of the People Ordinance and lifting of emergency. BNP standing committee members Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui and M Shamsul Islam, joint secretaries general Selima Rahman and Prof Abdul Mannan, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general M Qamaruzzaman, Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Barr Andalib Rahman Partha, Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami and Khelafat Majlish chairman Maulana Mohammad Ishaque addressed the rally. bdnew
