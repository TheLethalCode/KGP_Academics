<TITLE> As China slows, commodities may feel outsize pain </TITLE>

 By Tom Miles HONG KONG, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An unscripted slowdown in China's economy may take an exaggerated toll on commodity markets as demand from its construction sector and export-oriented manufacturers, which drove prices sky high, falls back to earth. As the financial crisis threatens to sink the global economy into recession, the question of China's future demand for oil, coal, copper and iron ore has taken on new importance for traders more accustomed to pricing in unstoppable growth. While no one expects its economy to slip into reverse, some analysts say even a slower-paced 6-8 percent expansion could have an outsize impact on demand for commodities, which China sucked in from around the world to turbo-charge its growth. "Commodities demand may slow faster than GDP for a period, depending on inventory levels and depth of the correction in the Chinese housing market," said Ben Simpfendorfer, China economist at RBS in Hong Kong. "Anything leveraged to exports will hurt, as will residential housing. So copper may get a double-whammy," Simpfendorfer said. London copper has already endured two weeks of unprecedented losses to stand at little more than half a record high touched just three months ago, with traders losing faith that the country that consumes more than a fifth of the world's copper can maintain its momentum. A Reuters poll at the end of last month found that on average, economists expect China's GDP growth to slow this year to 9.9 percent from 11.9 percent in 2007. Other warning indicators are also flashing red: China has halted imports of gasoline, oil companies have delayed new refinery start-ups, steel mills have slowed imports of iron ore and cut production. Power production, which has normally outpaced economic growth, rose by only 8.9 percent in September, an official said on Friday, despite expectations of a swift recovery from exceptionally weak summer growth as a coal supply shortage eased and industry resumed after the Olympics. Further clues may come early next week, when China's customs office releases preliminary data showing September metals trade, although analysts warn that it could still be months before a clear picture emerges after the Olympics run-up and wind-down. ONE-WAY NO MORE China's drive for growth has driven a historic surge in world prices for oil, food, coal and metals, prompting investors to talk of a 20-year rally that looked like a one-way bet. For months, Chinese demand helped shore up shares in mining and metals firms while banking and insurance stocks plummeted. But China has now joined the slowdown. Shanghai's copper market seized up this week when returning traders dumped contracts in a catch-up with London's unprecedented slump. But copper sitting in Shanghai warehouses fared better than spot copper in London, creating a buying opportunity for canny investors. Oil prices have tumbled by nearly half since their July peaks, while China's apparent demand has collapsed after a surge in pre-Olympic imports to build up stocks, and following a shock one-fifth rise in fuel prices in June. New car sales rose 1.4 percent in September, an improvement from August's decline but still a stark reversal from years of double-digit growth China. "The growth in energy consumption will fall faster than the economy as it will retreat to a more efficient and sustainable level," said Yang Fuqiang, vice president of the Energy Foundation, a U.S. consultancy. "We expect energy demand growth will fall noticeably in the fourth quarter." The International Energy Agency on Friday maintained its forecast for Chinese oil demand to grow by 6 percent or 450,000 barrels per day this year, slowing to 5.2 pct or 420,000 bpd next year, when China will be make up two-thirds of the global rise. LONGER-TERM HOPEFULS Complicating this view will be Beijing's effort to stave off the worst of the slowdown. It aggressively eased monetary policy this week, showing its determination to keep the economy expanding. Further subsidies or new projects may support demand. "We observe that these actions are not merely symbolic. They are a lot stronger than market expectations and show that the Chinese government has firmly adopted a pro-growth policy," said Na Liu, China strategist at Scotia Capital. "The news is a significantly positive development for the global raw materials and energy sectors." While copper goes into China's housing and exports, steel is more geared to infrastructure, which could get a boost if the government decides to launch a drive to expand public projects. So far it has concentrated on spurring domestic consumption but it could launch an ambitious rail and road program or build agricultural facilities like grain storage, said Simpfendorfer. Without state help, a slowdown could hit steel firms hardest, further dimming demand for imported iron ore. According to Citigroup analysts, global steel consumption has become unusually sensitive to economic growth in the last three years, so a 1 percent change in GDP means a 1.9 percent change in steel use, compared to a historic average of 1.1 percent. Four big Chinese steel firms have already cut output by up to one fifth and some Chinese customers have asked Australia's No.4 iron ore miner, Mount Gibson, to delay shipments. China's appetite for richer food may also suffer a hiccup as the downturn thins the numbers joining the urban middle class. "Inevitably there'll be some impact on China growth and demand for soft commodities. Since the pre-Olympic bubble we've seen a pretty significant slowdown," said Luke Chandler, senior commodity analyst at Rabobank in Sydney. "At the moment fundamentals are out the window. And it's really being driven by uncertainty in the economic and financial markets," he said. "We still expect the overall demand story to remain relatively robust. This might take a bit of gloss off it.
