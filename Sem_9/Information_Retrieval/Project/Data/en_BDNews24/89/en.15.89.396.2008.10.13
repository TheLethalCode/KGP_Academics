<TITLE> Tigers eye on series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 13 (bdnews24.com)  Shrugging off the misfortune of their second one dayer, Bangladesh are looking to clinch the ODI series against New Zealand by winning the third and final match on Tuesday. The 100th ODI affair to be played on Bangladesh soil will start at 9.00am with state run BTV beaming the match live from Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. Coach Jamie Siddons believes the Tigers have a good chance going into the match. "We have another chance now. The series is 1-all, which is a great feeling. Coming here the people are excited and obviously the players are also excited and looking forward to it. "If the pitch plays slow like I expect it to then our bowlers can always make something out of it," said Siddons on Monday. Despite restricting the Kiwis to 212/9 in the second match, Bangladesh spoiled a rare opportunity of wrapping up the three-match series with one match to go, after being bundled out for 137 to allow the visitors to level the series. Siddons could not conceal his frustration over the second match. "I thought it was a great chance, great opportunity." The Australian coach thought either side have a good chance to win the third match, but batting first may make the difference.. "But whoever puts some runs on the board is favourite. If we can bat first and make a decent total hopefully the wickets will turn. We have a good chance, if it is a slow wicket. I think it might be," said the Bangladesh coach. New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram stole the second match from Bangladesh with a vital 75 not out. The Tigers plan to restrict him from the beginning in the third game. "[Oram] made the difference. He gave us chances, but we failed to cash in on those and we really suffered for that in the second match. We can not let that happen again," said captain Mohammad Ashraful. Ashraful believes they need all three departments to work in synch for a result. "We have consistently done well in bowling and fielding, but it takes all three departments to click together for a result and we are focusing on that," said Ashraful. New Zealand vice captain Brendon McCullum said: "We had to fight in the last game to level the series, and it has given us the opportunity to try an win the series tomorrow. "If we can do that it will be a very well fought and hard fought win." "I haven't really played yet, tomorrow is a great opportunity for me to try and get big runs. I am confident that if I can give myself a big start, hopefully I can get into my aggressive stance and put on some runs for my team," said the opener, who had struck a 28-ball 80 to power New Zealand to a 10-wicket win over Bangladesh in just six overs last December. Bangladesh have kept out Mehrab Hossain Jr and Mahbubul Alam Robin from the 12-member squad for Tuesday's match. b
