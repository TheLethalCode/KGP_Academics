<TEXT>
 MADRID, Oct 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Struggling Osasuna have agreed to to appoint former Spain boss Jose Antonio Camacho to replace Jose Angel Ziganda as coach, the Primera Liga club said on Monday. The 53-year-old will sign a contract until 2009 and will be presented on Tuesday, the Navarrans said on their website (www.osasuna.es) Camacho was coach of the Spanish national team between 1998 and 2002 guiding them to the quarter-finals of both Euro 2000 and the 2002 World Cup. He steered Espanyol and Rayo Vallecano to promotion to the top flight and had two brief spells in charge of Real Madrid. He resigned from the Bernabeu after 23 days in 1998 following a bust up over back room staff, and after three league games in 2004, claiming he could not carry a dressing room packed with high-profile players. Camacho quit as Benfica coach last March in his second spell at the club, having led them to second place in the standings in 2004, before leaving them to join Real. Ziganda, who was sacked earlier in the day, had coached Osasuna for the last two years but six games into this season they have yet to register a win and lie 16th in the standings. He led them to the UEFA Cup semi-finals in 2007, when they lost 2-1 on aggregate to eventual winners Sevilla, but last season they only just avoided relegation by a point on the final day
