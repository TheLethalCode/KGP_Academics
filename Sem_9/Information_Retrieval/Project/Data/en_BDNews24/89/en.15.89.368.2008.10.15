<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) Home adviser MA Matin said Wednesday a list of graft convicts being sought by the government and NCC had "nothing to do with the upcoming elections". On why the home ministry sought the list of latest convicts from the Anticorruption Commission, Matin said: "The list has been sought in a decision by the National Coordination Committee on curbing serious crimes." "We wanted to get the latest information on people accused and convicted," he said. The adviser replied in the negative when asked whether the list had any relation to the December general elections or whether the list was sought to prevent the convicted from contesting polls. "The Election Commission will decide on that matter if required," he said. Matin refused to make any comment Wednesday on the previous day's government dialogue with 'fugitive' Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid in attendance. "I won't make any comment on the matter now. I will have to find how it was possible for [the dialogue] to take place," the adviser told reporters after a shipping ministry meeting. The Jamaat leader, who was shown in a police report as fugitive after an arrest warrant was issued on him in the Barapukuria corruption case, was present on Tuesday in the dialogue between the government and the party held in the chief adviser's office. With the general elections just two months away, the home ministry and the national coordination committee on serious crimes asked the Anticorruption Commission for a list of graft convicts on Monday. "The ministry and the national coordination committee sent letters to the ACC, seeking the list of those convicted for corruption. The list will be sent to them in a day or two," ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal told a regular press briefing on the day. Col Iqbal also referred to sections of Emergency Powers Rules and the constitution that bar convicts from participating in the election. He added that the ACC was taking initiatives to activate the corruption cases now stalled due to High Court orders. More than 100 politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and trade union leaders have so far been convicted following the antigraft drive launched by the reconstituted ACC. bdnew
