 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)Thailand has finally given the green signal for repatriation of 28 Bangladeshis picked up from Thai waters more than a year ago, a foreign ministry official said. They would return home on Wednesday by Biman flight BG 089, scheduled to land at 5.20pm local time, Saida Muna Tasneem, director general for external publicity told bdnews24.com on Monday night. She said the repatriation took long time due to complex verification process to confirm their Bangladeshi nationality. The Thai government had a meeting with Paban Chowdhury, Charge d' Affaires of Bangladesh mission in Bangkok, on Monday and gave consent for repatriating the 28 Bangladeshis. Over 200 people, mainly Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, were caught by Thai coast guards more than a year ago from a boat destined for Malaysia or Singapore. The Thai authorities detained them after alleged mistreatment by their military. They informed the Bangladesh embassy in Bangkok that they were Bangladeshi nationals. The embassy officials visited the camps and talked to those economic migrants. Of the total, only 28 people were confirmed as Bangladeshis. Foreign ministry officials said the Thai authorities had taken all of the detained as Bangladeshis as they spoke Bangla. They said most of the Bangladeshis were from the greater Chittagong district
