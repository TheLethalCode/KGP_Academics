 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's international donors on Tuesday stressed the importance of regional connectivity with neighbouring countries to boost economic growth. Chris Austin, DfID country head and co-chair of the Local Consultative Group, said spread of communications were a measure of poverty reduction. Austin, briefing the press after a session of the Bangladesh Development Forum in the capital, said effective communications and connectivity werewas essential for mobility, sustainable growth and economic activity. Communications minister Abul Hossain said that the government had already taken initiatives to get connected to the regional and Asian highways. "This is not the time to move alone," he added. The minister cited construction of the Padma multipurpose bridge as the most important and significant project. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is pursuing the project," he added. The prime minister had initiated construction of the bridge in her previous term. It will be completed by the tenure of the current government, he said. The minister said the government's different communications projects were discussed in the session. The need for upgrading the national and regional highways to four lanes with medians was stressed by the development partners. Hossain said a proposal in this connection has been sent to the cabinet committee on economic affairs. "But this requires a lot of funds which could not be found from lenders easily. So we would like to go for public-private partnership in these initiatives." The donors strongly endorsed a multimodal transport policy and stressed reform measures for Bangladesh Railway, which had deteriorated in past years. The minister said they proposed reforms which the ministry has already approved. The proposal will also be sent to the finance ministry and the establishment ministry for their opinion to the final approval soon, he added. Citing donors' suggestion of a new rail-bridge over the Jamuna river, the minister said a letter of interest has recently been issued for feasibility studies. Transparency and good governance within the ministry were also raised in the session, he said. The ministry's efforts were appreciated, he added. "It is only the only communications ministry which provides all major documents to Transparency International Bangladesh, which reassured the donors." "We are showing zero percent tolerance on corruption," he added. The session also discussed water transport and civil aviation issues.
