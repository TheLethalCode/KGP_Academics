<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has said that the opposition is now going through a tough time and asked the party men to launch countrywide movements. He was speaking at an extended meeting of Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, the party's student wing, at the Institute of Engineers on Wednesday. Alamgir asked the JCD workers to organize movements against the renaming of Zia International Airport and alleged tortures on the opposition leaders and activists. He believed that revoking the Fifth Amendment to constitution would create a crisis in the country. The Supreme Court last month upheld a previous High Court ruling that declared the Fifth Amendment illegal, meaning three illegal regimes between August 15, 1975 and 1979, headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman were not legal. The government said the Zia International Airport was renamed following the court ruling. Alamgir said: "They (the government) are renaming all the establishments including the Zia International Airport on the excuse of the Fifth Amendment. "The government is creating a constitutional crisis through revoking of the Fifth Amendment," he said. The BNP leader alleged that the opposition leaders and activists were facing tortures across the country. He asked all to play a strong role to get over the tough time. JCD held its last extended meeting in 2005.
