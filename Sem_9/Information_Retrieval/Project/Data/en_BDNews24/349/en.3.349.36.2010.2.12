 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  At least 57 Islami Chhatra Shibir activists were arrested in Dhaka in the early hours of Friday. The arrests came within 24 hours of a home ministry order on Thursday to "comb out" activists of Chhatra Shibir, the pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student front, from campuses across the country after violent episodes in at least three major campuses in recent days. Police said 21 Shibir activists were arrested in a pre-dawn raid in Dhaka on Friday. Shahbagh police chief Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com: "Police conducted the raid at a mess behind Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujib Medical University at around 3am on information that an anti-state meeting was being held there." "The 21 Shibir men, including 19 Dhaka University students, were arrested from there," he said. The officer said some CDs, documents and a list of 74 members of rival pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League were seized from the Shibir mess. A Dhaka metropolitan magistrate court sent the arrested to jail under Section 54 of Criminal Procedure Code, as they were produced before it, rejecting their bail prayers. Police said the arrested DU students include Shibir's DU unit publicity secretary Mohabbat Ali (chemistry department), finance secretary Abul Kashem (Islamic studies and culture) and publication secretary Jamaluddin (Islamic studies and culture). They also include Shibir members Hafizur Rahman and Md Habib (political science), Naimul Islam (mathematics), Sakhawat Hossain and Aminul Islam (microbiology), Hadiar Rahman (biology), Shafiullah Khan (public administration), Abdul Gafur (journalism and mass communication), Moyenuddin (English), Md Kabir and Ehteshamul Haq (applied chemistry), Insanal, Muntasir Mamun and Atiqul Islam (social science), Ibrahim Khalil (Arabic), Masud Rana (women and gender studies). The two others Shibir arrestees from the capital are Dhaka College's Md Sabbir (philosophy) and IBIT's Alamgir Hossain. Thirty-six other suspected Shibir activists were arrested from Uttara in Dhaka early on Friday. Deputy commissioner of Uttara zone police Nisarul Arif told bdnews24.com that they conducted a raid at a mess at Sector 14 on information that Shibir men fleeing from Rajshahi had taken shelter there. Police arrested the Shibir men and seized anti-government leaflets from there, he said. In Tangail, police held 14 activists of Chhatra Shibir from different messes, but later freed them following interrogation. Police have launched a massive haunt for Shibir activists following the killing of Rashahi University Chhatra League member Faruque Hossain, allegedly by Shibir cadres, in the early hours of Tuesday. The state home minister for home, Shamsul Haque Tuku said on Thursday the ministry had ordered government agencies concerned to carry out a "combing operation" to "uproot" unruly Shibir elements in all educational institutions from campuses after the killing of Rajshahi University student and Chhatra League worker Faruque Hossain during Shibir-BCL clashes earlier this week. Rajshsahi police have arrested a number of Jamaat-e-Islami figures and hundreds of Shibir activists, including Jamaat's Rajshahi metropolitan unit chief Maulana Ataur Rahman, in connection with the killing of Faruque. bdnews
