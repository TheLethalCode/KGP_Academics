 NEW YORK, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global gold demand dropped 11 percent in 2009 on weaker industrial and jewellery demand, but investors appetite for the bullion is likely to remain strong this year, the World Gold Council said on Wednesday. Gold demand for both industrial and jewellery showed signs of recovery late last year, the London-based WGC said in a report, which could underpin gold prices and add to last year's steep gains. Gold gained 35 percent return last year, its biggest annual gain in three decades, due to worries over currencies' depreciation and expectations of long-term inflation as the world economy emerges from economic downturn. Global demand fell 24 percent in the last quarter of the year to 819.7 tonnes versus a year ago, but rose compared with the previous two quarters of the year. "We are beginning to believe, as a number of people are showing through their purchases of gold, that things may be beginning to get better," George Milling-Stanley, the WGC's managing director of government affairs told Reuters. "We will see some recovery in what have been depressed sectors in demand, along with continued strong demand in the investment side." Identifiable investment demand in 2009 rose 7 percent from the previous year in part due to recovery in net retail investment in India and the United States, the reports said. Investment in gold is taking a larger piece of the overall demand pie helped by new instruments as investors see it as a safe bet in times of economic crisis. Gold demand for exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, rose 85 percent in 2009 versus the previous year on a strong first-quarter, the report said. It has somewhat retreated in recent quarters. Demand for ETFs is likely to keep rising due to increased investors appetite for gold. "Regardless of whether the economic recovery gathers momentum or stumbles in 2010, we believe that western investment demand will remain well underpinned," the report said. Gold rallied to two-week highs of about $1,120 an ounce on Tuesday as the euro recovered from recent hefty losses against the dollar and investors snapped up gold to hedge against debt default risks in Europe. INDIA STILL TOPS Global jewellery demand plummeted 20 percent in 2009 to 1,747.3 tonnes as the downturn curtailed purchases in top consumers like India. A sharp fall in gold jewellery demand in India dragged down its overall demand by 33 percent to 480 tonnes in 2009. Still, India saw jewellery recover 27 percent in the last quarter of the year versus the same period in 2008, holding its position as the world's top consumer of the precious metal. The Reserve Bank of India purchase of 200 tonnes of gold in November has underpinned growing optimism bullion remains a good save-haven investment. The council said it is unclear if that optimism will persist in India given high prices. Following closely on India was Greater China, which includes Taiwan and Hong Kong, with 461.9 tonnes in gold demand last year, up 7 percent year-on-year on strong retail investment demand. China has rapidly gained ground against India, the perennial No.1 gold consumer. "In the absence of sharp fluctuations in the gold price, demand is likely to remain firm (in China) as we head into 2010, particularly in the run up to Chinese New Year," the report said. However, investment in most non-western countries will likely be closely linked to the health of the world economy as budget constrains weighs on consumption, the council sa
