<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government is going to launch Open-Market Sales (OMS) of rice at upazila levels this month, food minister Abdur Razzak said on Tuesday. He urged the public to make use of the existing OMS shops at district headquarters. The minister also dismissed allegations that dishonest traders were responsible for raising the price of rice in the market. He said it was market forces, especially demand and supply, and not unfair business practice that was responsible for the recent rice price hike. The minister was speaking to journalists after a seminar in the capita. The supply of rice in the market this year has been inadequate compared to demand, he told them. This coupled with inadequate storage facilities was also the reason behind the government's failure to acquire adequate rice reserves. Responding to a query on whether the government strategy for OMS was affecting prices, Razzak said there was some impact on the market after its launch at different districts. Since then the price rise has been somewhat stable but still remains high. The inadequate supply is making it difficult to lower the price, he said. The government is going to start the OMS at upazila levels within the 10 days to lower prices further, he said. However, the government appears to be running into some problems to do that because of shortage of manpower. The minister also said that "despite lower price at OMS shops, the customer flow at the OMS shops is minimal. It is not that the quality of rice is low, so the cause behind the lack of customers at the OMS shops is not evident. The shops are supposed to be crowded with customers." The minister was attending a seminar titled "Canadian Agricultural Product" in Hotel Sonargaon on Tuesday. The seminar was organised as a part of a five-day exhibition of Canadian agricultural products in Bangladesh. Canadian high commissioner Robert Mcdougall, Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership (STEP)'s chairman Lionel Labelle, Saskatchewan's agricultural producer John Bennet and Raelene Regier spoke at the seminar presided over by Canada-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CBCCI)'s president Masud Rahman. STEP executive Tim Marshall provided details on manufacture of agricultural products in Saskatchewan and Bangladesh. The minister said Canada grants around US$70 million assistance every year in the fields of agriculture and water resources. Besides, it also assisted Bangladesh through the World Food Programme (WFP), which has now stopped. "We have asked them to resume it as it helps ensure food security", Razzak said. He also said that Canada is a surplus wheat producing country. On the other hand, Bangladesh doesn't produce enough wheat. "So we are importing wheat from Canada in small numbers and are trying to import more to meet the deficit". bdne
