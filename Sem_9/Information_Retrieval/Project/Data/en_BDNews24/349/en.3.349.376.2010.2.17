 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  A national conference on "Anti-corruption Reform Efforts for Women Entrepreneurs" opened in Dhaka on Wednesday. Jointly inaugurated by commerce minister Faruk Khan and US ambassador James F Moriarty, the conference is aimed at promoting good governance and anti-corruption activities that help women to perform their work better. It was arranged to mark the conclusion of an eight month-long good governance programme called 'PRAGATI'  Promoting Governance, Accountability Transparency and Integrity Programme - funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), a US embassy press release said. Under the initiative, PRAGATI brought together 300 women entrepreneurs in Chittagong, Sylhet and Khulna to promote anti-corruption activities. The entrepreneurs identified how they experience corruption in their professional lives. The participants cited taxation, access to credit, and business development services as the key areas where corruption was most pronounced. In his remarks, the US ambassador said: "Corruption compounds the discrimination women experience more broadly throughout society." "As caregivers they are confronted with corrupt practices affecting their family's healthcare. As parents they experience demands for bribe for school enrollment. As jobseekers, they have to pay foremen, supervisors and personnel officers in cash and in kind to get a job. As merchants they are forced to pay protection money to criminals." The U.S. promises to work hand-in-hand with the government to mitigate the costs of corruption and its impact in Bangladesh, Moriarty said. These training and advocacy activities were implemented in Bangladesh by the Bangladesh Women's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BWCCI). The participants analyzed how existing laws and policies protect women entrepreneurs and where new laws and policies are necessary. The entrepreneurs also held advocacy events in their home districts to promote necessary policy change.
