"It looks really good, nice and smooth coming in there," Behnken said as he watched the module slip into place. Endeavour lifted off from the Kennedy Space Centre on Monday with the connecting hub, named Tranquility, and a seven-sided viewing port, slated to be installed later this week. Tranquility, made in Italy, takes its name from the site where US astronauts first landed on the moon in 1969. Tranquility will be outfitted as a second habitation module for the live-aboard station crew, housing a toilet, oxygen generator, air scrubber and water recycling system.
