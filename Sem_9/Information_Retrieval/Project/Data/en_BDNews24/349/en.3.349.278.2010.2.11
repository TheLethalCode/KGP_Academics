 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday ordered the police not to torture former home state minister Lutfozzaman Babar during his remand in custody. Babar, a state minister during BNP's tenure between 2001 and 2006, is currently in remand for alleged involvement in the murder of Shah A M S Kibria in 2005, a sitting AL MP at the time, also a former finance minister for the previous AL government. The bench of justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and justice Md Rais Uddin gave the order following a petition by Babar's wife. The court in its order said: "Lutfozzaman Babar can be taken to remand, but no torture is allowed." It asked the police to follow a directive on remand issued by justice Hamidul Haque in 2003. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued for the state while Rafique-ul-Huq and Mahbub Uddin Khokan represented Babar. Babar was shown arrested in the case on Feb 2, following an order by a judicial magistrate in Habiganj upon an appeal by criminal investigation department. Public prosecutor Akbar Hossain Jitu earlier said that Babar had 'confessed' his connection with the killing of Kibria, while being interrogated in the August 21 grenade attack case. CID police super Rafiqul Islam, who is the investigation officer, asked for a ten-day remand for further questioning. Babar, currently serving a sentence of 17 years, is behind bars in an arms case. Babar has already been shown arrested in connection with August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally when he was state minister. The CID police interrogated Babar and two other suspects last month for allegedly suppressing the grenade attack case of 2005 in Habiganj that killed Kibria and four others. bd
