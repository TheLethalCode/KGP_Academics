 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)The government is keen to increase the proportion of national investment from 23 percent of national income to about 30-35 percent. Finance minister AMA Muhith speaking as chief guest at a seminar on Private-Public Partnership in Agriculture on Friday, Muhith said the government was looking to increaes public investment through this new mechanism that he introduced in a big way when proposing the current budget in June last year. But Muhith did not elaborate on the exact mechanism or policy through which national investment would be increased. He said, "At present our national earnings is worth some 6 lakh crore, of which 23 percent goes into investment." Muhith said regarding large projects that the was unable to take them up by itself due to its financial constraints. "But they could be implemented through PPP." On increasing public expenditure, he said, "We spend 16 percent of our national earnings but we have a plan to spend 20 percent of national earnings by 2013-2014." The finance minister urged the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation to take charge of investment in agriculture through PPP. "I would suggest that BADC work on PPP-based projects in agriculture." The government has a budgetary allocation of Tk 2500 crore for PPP. Currently three organisations are coordinating 27 projects under PPP, which mainly include infrastructure development but there are no agro-based projects among them. The minister said agriculture would remain out of PPP during the current fiscal and would likely be included in the next fiscal. bdnews2
