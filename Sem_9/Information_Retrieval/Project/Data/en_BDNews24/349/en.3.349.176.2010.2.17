 MILAN, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Wayne Rooney headers midway through the second half gave Manchester United a slightly fortunate 3-2 win at AC Milan in their pulsating Champions League last 16 first leg Tuesday. Seven-time champions Milan, who had never lost to United at home or over two legs, were quickly ahead when Ronaldinho's volley deflected in off Michael Carrick following a free kick from former United midfielder David Beckham. The hosts had a series of other chances before Paul Scholes swung at a Darren Fletcher cross with his right foot, the ball hit his left shin and then bobbled in off the post. United then became favourites ahead of the second leg on March 10 when Rooney netted with headers after superb crosses from Antonio Valencia and Fletcher.

United fans again noisily protested against owners the Glazer family in Milan's main square before kickoff but they were soon silenced at a rocking 80,000 capacity San Siro. Beckham sent in a free kick and United left back Patrice Evra made a hash of a clearance, sending the ball across the box where Ronaldinho was waiting to lash in a volley off Carrick.

Last year's runners-up found their way back into the game, however, and scored their first European Cup goal against Milan in the San Siro thanks to Scholes' 36th minute mishit. England striker Rooney, who worked tirelessly all night upfront alone, then sent a looping header into the top corner on 66 minutes after Valencia crossed with one of his first touches of the ball having replaced the lacklustre Nani. An unmarked Rooney then proved again why he is fast becoming one of the best players in the world when he guided in Fletcher's well-weighted cross as United went a record 16 away matches unbeaten in the Champions League. Beckham, who won the 1999 trophy with United, had a decent game in his first appearance against his former club and shot over with a trademark free
