 Rajshahi, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Police on Tuesday arrested a Rajshahi University syndicate member and Jamaat-e-Islami leader in connection with Chhatra League activist Faruk Hossain's killing during overnight clashes on the campus on Feb 8-9. Faruk was killed and scores of students were injured during fierce overnight clashes between pro-ruling party Chhatra League and pro-Jamaat Chhatra Shibir activists on Feb 8-9. The government launched a countrywide operation to round up hundreds of Jamaat-Shibir suspects following the killing. Detective Branch police picked up Siddique Hossain, principal of Binodpur Islami College and assistant secretary of Jamaat's Rajshahi city unit, from his Rajpara residence Tuesday evening. Assistant commissioner of city detective branch of police Tariqul Islam told bdnews24.com that they arrested Siddique as Chhatra Sibir activists rounded up earlier had given statements implicating him in the killing. Rajshahi University vice-chancellor Abdus Sobhan confirmed that Siddique is a syndicate member. Earlier on Feb 11, Jamaat's Rajshahi city unit ameer Maulana Ataur Rahman was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder. He was sent to jail on Tuesday after a five-day grilling by police. Tariq said 82 other Jamaat-Shibir activists were also rounded up in Rajshahi in connection with the case. DU PROVOST RESIGNS Meanwhile, a Dhaka University provost resigned on Monday upon allegations that he lobbied for an Islamic Chhatra Shibir leader, now in jail. Fazlul Huq Muslim Hall provost Mozammel Hoq, who is a professor of the microbiology department, said he had sent his resignation to DU vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddique. Regarding his resignation, he said "I have quit my post after students moved against me when I contacted Shahbagh Police Station to release Shakhawat Hossain, a student of my department, who was arrested as a Shibir activist." "I went to see the vice chancellor to submit my resignation letter at around noon (Monday), but he asked me to reconsider my decision. Afterwards, I sent the letter to his office at 5pm." He said that he did not know Shakhawat was a Chhatra Shibir leader. Police had earlier arrested 21 Shibir leaders and workers including Shakhawat from a mess in Shahbagh on charges of their involvement in anti-state activities as part of the countrywide round-up of Shibir activists in wake of the Rajshahi University violence. All the DU arrestees, including Hossain, are in jail. bdn
