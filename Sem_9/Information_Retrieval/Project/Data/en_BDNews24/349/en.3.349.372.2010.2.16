<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and its development partners are still at loggerheads over the role of the World Bank in the administration of the climate fund. Funding agencies continue to insist that the World Bank should be in charge of running the funds pledged by the development partners despite the government's opposition. Hasan Mahmud, state minister for environment and forests, admitted that there were some 'differences' with the development partners over the issue. Briefing reporters on the climate session at the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum meet between Bangladesh government and development partners, Mahmud said climate change assistance pledged by foreign agencies was grant money and not even soft loans. "So we will certainly accept the funds". But the government appears reluctant to accept the World Bank to be in chrage of the fund. However, as an apparent compromise the government seems to have agreed to allow the Bank to provide 'technical assistance'. Chris Austin, country head of UK development arm, DfID, which has also pledged a substantial portion of climate assistance said that there had already been a decision about handling the funds and the Bangladesh government had in fact sought technical assistance. He said the government would very much be in the driver's seat as it had desired from the outset. But Mahmud said that since the government was in the middle of negotiating the administration of climate funds, it would not be 'wise' or 'desirable' to comment on the matter. Regarding institutional capacity building Mahmud said the government had already established a 'climate change unit' led by an additional secretary under the environment ministry. "The unit will also play a key role in managing the Multi Donor Trust Fund." Victims of Cyclone Aila, who have been suffering from the adverse impacts of climate change, also came up in the discussion on environment. According to the disaster management bureau, about 2.5 lakh people are still living on embankments as their homes and farmlands were still under water. Ramesh Chandra Sen, the water resources minister, said that the embankment breeches would be repaired by March and these people would be rehabilitated. Mahmud, however, clarified that only initial renovation work would be completed by March and it would take at least another year to complete the work. b
