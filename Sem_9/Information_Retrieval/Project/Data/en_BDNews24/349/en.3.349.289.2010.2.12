 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  A fire in the sprawling tower block development of Japan Garden City claimed seven lives on Thursday night, including two women and two children, officials and witnesses said. The deceased were being initially identified as brothers Tariqul and Rafiqul Islam, their two wives Rupa and Julie, Tariqul's two children Fahim, 14, and Ayesha, 11, and a maid Rozina, 12, all residents of Flat 1402 on the thirteenth floor of Building 6, a fire official said as the bodies were in the process of being recovered. The building's ground floor entrance was crowded with onlookers, while police, firemen and a fire service van were on standby. A team of police and RAB had reportedly escorted relatives of the deceased up to the 13th floor to confirm the identities of the dead. A witness had earlier told bdnews24.com that seven bodies were lying in the 13th floor stairwell of Building 6 almost two hours after the fire was doused there late on Thursday night. Dr Yahiya Khandaker, organising secretary of the flat owner's association told bdnews24.com at around 1am, "I have seen the bodies myself on the stairs of the 13th floor. Three of them looked like children, as well as two men and two women." He said there were no lights, the building was in complete darkness, but flat owners and fire officials had ascended with torches to check for casualties. The fire, which broke out on the 10th floor of Building 6 of the sprawling housing development, was finally quenched and brought under control around 11:30pm. Fire brigade's director general Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah told bdnews24.com, "The fire has been brought under control ... The extent of the fire and damage has not been confirmed yet." "No reports of any deaths have been received," he said at the time. The fire department's central office said flames broke out from Flat No 1101 on the 10th floor at around 10.18pm. Fifteen fire fighting units rushed to the location to douse the flames. Witnesses said the blaze could be seen from both the north and south sides of the building as fire fighters were struggling to tame the flames from adjacent buildings. The roads were blocked as crowds of spectators gathered at the scene. A resident of the first floor of the building, Jashim Uddin, said he and some neighbours had gone up to the seventh floor to check if anyone was left behind as residents were evacuating the building. "Everyone seemed to have locked their flats and gone. But the group was unable to check any further up because of the smoke," he said. Riaz Hassan, of the building's eight floor, said they all rushed down hearing calls of fire at around 10.45pm. He said no one was living in Flat 1101 as yet, but decoration work was going on there. Narayan Sarkar, resident of the neighbouring flat, and general manager of Bakhrabad Gas System Ltd, also said that carpenters had been working in 1101 for the last one year. "The workers came daily. The owner had not moved in yet." "My wife and I came down hearing of the fire," said Sarkar. bdnew
