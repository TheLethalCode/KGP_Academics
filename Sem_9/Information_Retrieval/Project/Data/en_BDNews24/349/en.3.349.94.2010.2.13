 Jessore, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested 29 Islami Chhatra Shibir activists in Jessore Saturday in the wake of the home ministry directive to hunt down the pro-Jamat student wing across the country. Abdul Kader Begh, Jessore's Kotwali police chief, said they had launched a drive in the Shibir lodgings early on Saturday and rounded up its leaders and activists. The arrested leaders and activists were also wanted in connection with two cases filed last month for vandalising MM College in the district town, he said. They were sent to court at around 10am. The home ministry last Thursday ordered concerned agencies to round up activists of Shibir, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student front, from campuses across the country after the killing of a pro-ruling party Chhatra League activist at Rajshahi University. Hundreds of Jamaat-Shibir activists have been arrested in the countrywide hunt including Dhaka and Chittagong in the past two days. In Chittagong, police arrested 24 Shibir activists on Saturday. bdnews24
