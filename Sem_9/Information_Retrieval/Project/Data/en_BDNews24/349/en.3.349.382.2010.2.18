 bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Senior officials of Bangladesh and India are set to discuss terms for cooperation in the power sector this week, as a team from Delhi arrives in Dhaka Thursday. A delegation from India led by Indian power secretary HS Brahma will reach Dhaka on Thursday for the second meeting of the Joint Steering Committee for Cooperation in the Power Sector. The Bangladeshi delegation will be led by power secretary Md Abul Kalam Azad. The meet is likely to focus on grid inter-connection and cooperation between Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and India's National Thermal Power Cooperation (NTPC). India and Bangladesh had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for cooperation in power sector during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi last month. Since India has agreed to provide Bangladesh with 250MW from its central grid in the initial stage, grid inter-connectivity is likely to top the agenda of the meeting in Dhaka. Brahma said that the Joint Technical Team of Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL), the BPDB and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB) had estimated that an investment of approximately Rs 869.21 crore (approx. Tk 1300 crore) would be required for grid inter-connection. While Rs 708.88 crore (Tk 1062 crore) of this would be required for works in Bangladesh, an investment of Rs 160.33 crore (Tk 240 crore) would be spent in India, he added. The Indian Power Secretary also said that the PGCIL would finance the works to be done in India. Sources in the Indian power ministry said that Bangladesh was keen to take the consultancy service of the PGCIL for works to be done in the country for grid interconnection. The PGCIL will associate the PGCB engineers in the works to help them gain experience. The PGCIL and PGCB may discuss the modalities of cooperation and decide on the terms during the meet in Dhaka. A technical team of the NTPC will also be a part of the delegation from India. The NTPC and BPDB are also expected to discuss the areas of cooperation and finalise the deals. In the first Joint Steering Committee's meet in Delhi on Jan 12 last, the NTPC and BPDB had agreed to prepare a feasibility report for two coal-based power projects at Khulna and Chittagong, each with generation capacity of approximately 1320 MW. The NTPC chairman and managing director RS Sharma said that that the Indian company was keen to develop one of the two projects in joint venture with the BPDB. The NTPC is also likely to carry out technical assessment for the BPDB's old thermal power stations for efficiency improvement, renovation and modernization. It may also take up operation and maintenance of some power stations in Bangladesh.
