 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Wealth statements of ministers and MPs will be made public before the announcement of the next national budget in June, the finance minister said on Sunday. "We wanted to publish the statements in 2009," AMA Muhith told journalists after unveiling the second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) on Sunday. But, he said, that wealth statements of the incumbent ministers and MPs had already been published as candidates in the December 2008 general election. "Therefore there was no great urgency to take wealth statements again in 2009." "But this year it will happen," muhith said. To a question on whether wealth statements of dependents and relations of the ministers and parliament members would also be published, Muhith said: "We'll do everything necessary." Referring to the chief justice's contention that wealth statement of all judges should be submitted, the minister said: "We'll publish the statements of all important officials." The new chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim told reporters at his Supreme Court chamber on Feb 7 that the judges should submit their wealth statements not only for the sake of transparency but also setting precedence for all those holding public office. b
