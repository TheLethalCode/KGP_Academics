 Rajshahi University, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League's Rajshahi University unit expelled nine of its members on Saturday for an assault on journalists at the troubled campus earlier in the week. Eight journalists and an assistant proctor, Prof Mustak Ahmed were injured in the attack on Thursday. A notice undersigned by Awal Kabir Joy and Majedul Islam, president and general secretary of Chhatra League's RU unit, charged nine members with indiscipline and anti-organisational activities. The expelled members were named as "Jewel, Rocky, Minnath, Rony, Delwar, Bill, Masud, Nayan and Monir". Tensions prevailed at the university and surrounding areas Saturday, four days after the campus erupted in violence. Student Faruque Hossain, a Chhatra League activist, was brutally killed and dozens were injured during overnight clashes between Islami Chhatra Shibir and Chhatra League on Feb 8-9. Police have since conducted mass arrests of Shibir activists in the area as well as Jamaat-e-Islami leaders in Rajshahi who are accused of inciting the campus violence. bdnews
