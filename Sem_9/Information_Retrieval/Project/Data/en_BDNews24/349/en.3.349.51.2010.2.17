<TITLE> Filipinos know little about automated voting: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANILA, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large majority of Filipinos knows little or nothing about automated elections barely four months before the Philippines uses the system for the first time, an opinion poll issued on Wednesday showed. A slim majority also expects widespread protests if the results of the automated elections are tainted with fraud or otherwise not credible, independent pollster Pulse Asia Inc said. Most said they would support, if not join, the protests. Investors and market experts have said credible results from the May 10 national elections will determine whether or not there will be more aggressive buying of Philippine assets. Manila is one of Asia's most active sovereign debt issuers. Seventy-one percent of 1,800 respondents surveyed on Jan. 22-26 have little or no knowledge about the new automated voting system, Pulse Asia Inc said in a statement. Ronald Holmes, head of Pulse Asia and a political science professor, told Reuters there was an urgent need for the elections body to raise voter awareness and confidence. Politicians, information technology experts and analysts have cast doubt over the automated process, fearing machine glitches, delays or failure in the transmission of results, resulting in a failed election. Others fear hacking and tampering of the automated vote count, which the poll body dismissed, saying they have contingencies in place. On Tuesday, the country's two largest mobile phone companies, which offered to host the main server of the automated voting system, told a congressional hearing they feared security threats to the system would endanger their entire phone network. The poll body expect to transmit results from about 77,000 vote counting machines all over the country through the phone networks operated by Smart Communications of the PLDT group and Globe Telecoms I
