 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Activists of Jamaat-e-Islami and its student front Chhatra Shibir clashed with police at Dhaka's Paltan on Friday as they tried to bring out a procession in protest against the killing of a Shibir member and subsequent countrywide crackdown on their supporters. Nine were arrested during the clash that ensued when police barred the activists from brining out a procession from Baitul Mukarram national mosque after the juma prayers, according to witnesses. The arrested are Md Sarfuddin (21), Obayedullah (28), Syed Joynul Abedin (41), Md Shahjahan (38), MA Manna (44), Md Kamal (38), Aminur Rahman (36), Ahsanul Haq Kakon (41) and Md Alauddin (28). Deputy commissioner of Motijheel zone police Atiqul Islam, however, told bdnews24.com: "They (Jamaat-Shibir activists) brought out the procession in Paltan where there was no police personnel. As soon as the police arrived, they started hurling brickbats at them, prompting police to respond." Paltan police station sub-inspector Md Shahjalal said the law-enforcers charged batons to disperse the agitators, who damaged some vehicles. Jamaat on Thursday announced a two-day agitation programme  at metropolitan cities on Friday and at district level on Saturday  in protest against the murder of a Shibir member on Thursday and countrywide hunt for Shibir activists in the wake of violence at Rajshahi University where Shibir activists allegedly killed one and cut tendons of several other Chhatra League acrtivists. Witnesses said shops and businesses in the area were closed during the clash at Paltan in Dhaka. Around 150 members of Jamaat-Shibir were arrested in the last two days. Shibir activist Shaheen of Rajshahi College died in Chapainawabganj early on Thursday in a gunfight with the police. The home ministry on Thursday ordered the police to conduct 'combing operations' in search of member of the Islami Chhatra Shibir, which is the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist party and ally of the main oppositon BNP. bd
