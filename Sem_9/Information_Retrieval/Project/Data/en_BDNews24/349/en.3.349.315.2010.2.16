 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Divorced wife of private Ekushey Television chairman Abdus Salam won a legal battle to take their son in her custody. A High Court bench, comprising justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and ATM Fazle Kabir, on Tuesday ordered sending four-year-old Shihab Salam to Farzana Islam Shilpi on a writ petition filed by her recently. Salam's lawyer SM Rezaul Karim said: "The court earlier asked for producing Shihab before it. Today his mother took him to her custody on the court order." The writ petition was filed after a magistrate court recently gave custody of Shihab to his father. Following the petition, the High Court issued a rule on Salam asking why keeping his son in his custody would not be declared illegal. Shilpi filed two suits after her divorce  one with a family court and another with the magistrate court  seeking custody of her son.
