 SEOUL, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sanctions on North Korea will not be removed until Pyongyang returns to disarmament talks and takes serious steps towards scrapping its nuclear arms programme, the foreign ministers of South Korea and Japan said on Thursday. The comments come as the North's top nuclear envoy is in Beijing in a sign the destitute state may soon end its year-long boycott of six-country disarmament-for-aid nuclear talks hosted by its key ally, China. North Korea has come under increasing pressure to return to the forum where it can win rewards for rolling back its nuclear programme as UN sanctions imposed after a nuclear test last year dry up its coffers and a currency revaluation in late 2009 adds to its economic woes.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-il told a visiting Chinese envoy this week that his country was willing to talk about how to restart the stalled international process. Some analysts said the dispatch of Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye-gwan, who represents the North at the six-way forum, to Beijing indicated that the two countries were working out a face-saving measure for Pyongyang to return to dialo
