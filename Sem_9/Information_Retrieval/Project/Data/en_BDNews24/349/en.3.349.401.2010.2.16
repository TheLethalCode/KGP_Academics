 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)Bhutan has invited Bangladesh to invest in power transmission and distribution equipment, as the Himalayan kingdom looks to greatly expand electricity coverage, the Bhutanese minister for economic affairs said Tuesday. "There's a great demand for poles, cables, transformers in Bhutan," minister Lyonpo Khandu Wangchuk said at a meeting with the International Business Forum of Bangladesh (IBFB). Wangchuk, who also served as the country's prime minister, is currently in Dhaka. The South Asian country currently produces about 15,000 MW through hydro-power plants and hopes to add another 10,000 MW within the next 10 years, he told the meeting. "We are expecting to bring at least 44,000 households under power connectivity by the next three years." Bangladesh proposed the Himalayan kingdom to export its hydro power during prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit last year. The Bhutanese minister also expressed his country's interest for importing 'pre-engineered steel buildings' from Bangladesh. He, however, declined to specify the sectors for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Bhutan. "We will submit the revised FDI policy to our cabinet by the end of March...everything would be clear once it's accepted." Replying to a query, the Bhutanese minister also said that his country was very much keen to use the Mongla port. He added that Bhutan would also announce Economic Development Policy very soon, which would chalk out all the details for doing business in the country. Wangchuk, as the director of Bhutan's trade and commerce department in the 80's, initiated the first trade agreement between the two countries, signed in 1980. The deal had a provision of an automatic extension by 10 year, which was valid up to 2000. In 2003, a five-year trade agreement was signed after a lapse of three years. The latest trade deal was signed during Hasina's Bhutan visit in last December, which increased the number of products to 90 from the previous 74 for trading between the two countries. Under the renewed trade agreement, Tamabil of Bangladesh has been introduced as a new entry and exit point for Bhutan. Bangladesh's exports to Bhutan amount to less than $1 million, and include garments, computer accessories, dry food, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. on the other hand, Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh totals around $14 million, according to the commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items include mineral products, foodstuff, fruits, beverages and oat.
