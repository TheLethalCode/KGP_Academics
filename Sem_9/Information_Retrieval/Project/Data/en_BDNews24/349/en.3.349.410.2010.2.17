 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Another pro-government student activist was murdered in Dhaka late Tuesday night, this time at South Keraniganj, just on the other side of the Buriganga. Police said Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Rajjakur Rahman Sapan, 35, was found stabbed at Subhadda Modhya Para. He was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival just after midnight. South Keraniganj police chief Nilotpol Dey told bdnews24.com at around 12.30am that he had heard of the death and was on his way to the hospital. "I do not know the details yet." Locals said Sapan was assistant organising secretary of Chhatra League's South Keraniganj chapter. Just four days earlier, on Friday, a senior pro-government student activist was shot and killed by unknown assailants in the capital. ABM Faruk, 33, president of Cantonment Thana chapter and also head of Ward 15 unit, was shot at around 9:30pm Friday at the Manikdi Adorsho Biddyaniketan playground.
