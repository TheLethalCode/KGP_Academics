 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi Metropolitan Police deputy commissioner Sardar Nurul Amin has been made officer on special duty, and two others officers of the same rank have been transferred, days after the killing of pro-government student activist Faruk Hossain at Rajshahi University. The transfers come as part of a reshuffle of 29 top police officials across the country, a home ministry release said on Wednesday. Of the two other RMP deputy commissioners, Harun-Or-Rashid was transferred to Moulavibazar and Sazzadur Rahman to Special Branch in Dhaka. Rashid and Rahman have recently returned from UN mission. Among the other transfers were a deputy inspector general of police, two additional deputy inspectors general of police and 23 superintendents of police.

Rajshahi police have been accused of negligence, while scores of Jamaat and Shibir suspects have been rounded up countrywide in connection with the RU violence. b
