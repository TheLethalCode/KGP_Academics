 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh shrugged off their woeful time so far in New Zealand, with a polished performance against the hosts on the opening day of the one-off Test at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Monday. The home side, who were put into bat, reached 258-5 before bad light ended play early with Martin Guptill unbeaten on 80 and Brendon McCullum 58 not out respectively. The pair had resurrected the innings with a 100-run stand after New Zealand were reduced to 158-5. Bangladesh, outplayed in both the three-match ODI series and Twenty20 tour opener, made good use of a greenish wicket after skipper Shakib Al Hasan called the coin correctly.

Ross Taylor was intent on dealing in boundaries striking seven in his 63-ball 40 before getting out to another loose shot off Rubel, who finished the day with 3-86. Skipper Daniel Vettori promoted up the order in the absence of key injured players, was bowled by his opposite number Shakib Al Hasan. Dropped on four, Guptill continued his sparkling form from the ODIs to end unbeaten on 80 off 154 balls with 11 boundaries. Bangladesh, who named their playing eleven on Sunday, included former ICL rebel Aftab Ahmed. The Black Caps were without fast bowler Andy McKay, who injured his foot, forcing him to put his Test debut on hold. McKay took five wickets at an average of 21 apiece in the one-day series against the Tigers, which New Zealand won
