 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Monday urged international donors to offer more grants and concessional loans to developing nations to help them offset the adverse impact of the global meltdown. Speaking at the inaugural session of the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum, which is being held again in Dhaka after a break of nearly four and half years, he also sought softer terms. "To combat the adverse effect of the economic recession, the developing countries need, firstly, grants and concessional loans that are available now at much reduced levels, and secondly, rapid commitment of external assistance without elaborate conditionalities," he said. The finance minister called for continued support to Bangladesh's march towards the goal to become a prosperous and peaceful country by 2021. "The journey (towards the goal) is not expected to be smooth. There will be many bumps ahead. But if we work together, we can overcome many of those apparently insurmountable problems." Referring to Bangladesh's founding president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's dream, he said: "We're now attempting after 38 years to fulfil the dream of Bangladesh as the Switzerland of Asia." Muhith focused on government's giving highest importance to development of human resources and good governance. He said other priority areas include power and energy, agriculture, poverty reduction, environment and climate change, transport and communications, and information technology. He told the donors that the government's long-term vision for the development of the country is going to be reflected in its long-term prospective plan for 2010-21 period. The minister said they have targeted reduction of incidence of poverty level to 15 percent of the population. DELIVER ON CLIMATE PLEDGES: PM Prime minister Sheikh Hasina also addressed the inaugural session of the forum, urging the donors to deliver on pledges alongside funds promised to counter the grave impact of climate change on Bangladesh. World Bank vice-president for South Asia region Isabel Guerrero described poverty reduction, quality investment, impact of climate change and employment as main challenges for Bangladesh and said World Bank would help it overcome the challenges. ADB director general for South Asia Sultan Hafeez Rahman said the development partners are ready to work together with Bangladesh government to deliver on its strategic priorities. The two-day forum will discuss Bangladesh's Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP II) in six sessions. The government on Sunday unveiled revised PRSP with an outlay of Tk 2814.81 billion, on the eve of the BDF meet. Japan's International Cooperation Bureau deputy director general Kazuo Sunaga also made introductory statements at the inaugural session. Economic Relations Division secretary and Local Consultative Group co-chair M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, and DFID country director and Local Consultative Group co-chair Chris Austin delivered the address of welcome. b
