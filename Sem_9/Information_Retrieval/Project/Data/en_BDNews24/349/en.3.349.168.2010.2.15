 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The government has agreed to raise power tariffs in line with suggestions made by development partners and multilateral funding agencies. Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, the PM's adviser for power and energy, told reporters on Monday that charges would be 'rationalised', a term widely used as a euphemism for increasing electricity prices. Chowdhury was briefing the press after a session on power and energy at the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum meeting between lending agencies, development partners and the Bangladesh government. He said the government had agreed to raise tariff gradually and in a manner that would ensure viability and sustainability of the power sector as the foreign funding agencies had advised. "But the rate would not be same for all consumers." Acknowledging that over half of Bangladesh's population is still outside the national power grid, he said that the government would try to bring those people under coverage. "The rural people are the centerpiece of our development strategy." Chris Austin, country head of the UK's development arm DFID and co-chair of the Local Consultative Group, comprising over 30 foreign and multilateral funding agencies, said that tariff rationalisation was a tricky issue. He said it was a matter of striking the right balance for the government. Chowdhury told reporters that the government had presented its short-, medium- and long-term goals, which he said were 'challenging', but were well taken by the forum and funding agencies endorsed them encouraging the government to forge ahead. Regarding Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC), he said the body has been strengthened recently to make it more efficient. "BERC is working on a new tariff plan," he added. The government has been facing loss in the power sector since the tariff is lower than the production cost. According to Bangladesh Power Development Board, current tariff for the households varies from Tk 2.65~5.5/kWh (subject to consumed units), for commercial usage Tk 2.65 and Tk 5.5 (peak and off-peak) and Tk 3.65 and Tk 5.5 (peak and off-peak) for the industrial plants. Asked to reply to speculations that the government might be seeking funds to the tune of $9.5 billion for the power sector alone, Mashiur Rahman, PM's economic adviser, said the forum was not so much about the volume of assistance but more about the broad principles. "The forum is about ascertaining whether our plans and goals are satisfactory and reasonable." Accordingly, he said there were no such pledges to speak of, but the government had secured overall endorsement of power sector plans. The session also discussed institution building including strengthening the regulatory commission and creating an agency to facilitate investment in power. Sustainable growth in the power generation sector was also stressed. bd
