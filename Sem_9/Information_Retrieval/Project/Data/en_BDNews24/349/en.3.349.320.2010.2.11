<TITLE> India's rise 'an opportunity for Bangladesh' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bndews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty said Thursday Bangladesh should not have any fears over India's rise as a superpower as Delhi's emergence would fetch benefits for Dhaka. Addressing a meeting on Bangladesh-US relations, the ambassador defended US-India relations, but made it clear that his country saw Bangladesh through its own eyes, not those of other countries. He also said US-Bangladesh relations would be determined by "shared interests and values". "There have been important developments within the region that benefit Bangladesh and help to forge a closer bond between our countries," Moriarty told the meeting in the capital organised by 'Group 2009', a body formed by a number of leaders of Bangladesh's main opposition party BNP. "I know that there are those who cast a wary eye on developments in the region, in particular the rise of India as a global power," said Moriarty who previously served as US ambassador to Nepal. The ambassador said he very often had questions about the impact of India's rise and the growing strategic partnership between the US and India on Bangladesh. "Speaking as the US ambassador to Bangladesh and as someone who has watched this region for many years, I can say without hesitation that the trends you are witnessing provide far more opportunities than dangers for Bangladesh and its citizens," said Moriarty who addressed the meeting first. The US envoy said his government welcomed the prime minister's India visit and the desire by both Dhaka and New Delhi to address long standing issues between the two countries. BNP standing committee member Hannan Shah, however, said, "Our experiences with the so called regional power (India) are not good. "They want to extract benefits from poor countries". He opposed Moriarty, who termed the ninth parliamentary polls the freest in Bangladesh's history, and said the Dec 29 polls were "engineered to put Awami League into power". Economics professor Abu Ahmed in his speech said India was diverting waters from Bangladesh's upstream. "We want our support while we negotiate with our big neighbour," Ahmed said. Moriarty did not make specific comment on this demand. The US envoy's earlier address, however, was seen by some as aimed at dispelling the belief that Washington tends to see Bangladesh through the eyes of India. A number of the Group 2009 members in their addresses felt the need to reminded the US envoy of BNP's good relations with the US and, conversely, the ruling party Awami League's close relations with the then Soviet Union which was a close ally of India. The US buried its cold relations with India in the aftermath of the collapse of the communist Soviet Union in 1991. Since then US-India relations have fast developed.
