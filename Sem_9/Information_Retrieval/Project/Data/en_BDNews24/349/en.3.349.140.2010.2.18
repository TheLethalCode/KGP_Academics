<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia has said her party is being forced to take to the streets in a movement against the government "for the sake of the country, democracy and people". BNP earlier in the week announced countrywide demos on Thursday to protest a number of recent government moves, including renaming Zia International Airport, abuse in parliament, repression of party leaders and activists, breakdown in law and order and spiralling prices of essential commodities. "We promised to support the government. So we did not go for any movement in the last one year," Khaleda Zia said as chief guest at an extended council of pro-BNP student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal. "But the government has failed to do anything within the period. They have turned parliament into a place to air abusive and false accusations. The treaties that have been made still haven't been placed in the parliament." She said along with reorganising the party, the opposition would also go for agitation programmes to "alleviate people's suffering". "The country's people are looking up to us. We will have to prepare for a mass movement for sake of the country, democracy and people," she said. The four-hour long closed-door extended council of the party's student wing was held at the Diploma Engineers Institute's auditorium. BNP's joint secretary general Fakhrul Islam inaugurated the council attended by leaders of JCD's 85 organisational committees from all over the country. The last JCD extended council was held in 2004. Khaleda presented plans for renovating Chhatra Dal and forming a committee "led by actual students". She urged reform of the student wing. "A congestion occurred for the last two years. Now Chhatra Dal will have to be reformed. We want to form it from actual students. Those who have become seniors due to various reasons will be taken into BNP and other associate organisations." She also advised JCD members to follow instructions of their leaders and not of MPs. Chhatra Dal president Sultan Salauddin Tuku revealed a decision to form a new committee and complete organisational restructure of the student body in the next six months. In her closing speech, Khaleda lamented the situation of educational institutes, saying: "Educational institutes including the universities are under a regime of terror for the activities of the government party's student wing. Partisanship is being practiced. Terrorists of the government party's student wing have gone around with open weapons at Dhaka University and police said nothing. No steps were taken against them." She also urged the JCD to be prepared "to confront any conspiracy against the country". She alleged of terrorism, murder, torture against the opposition. "They want to, like before, establish one-party rule. So they have joined forces with coalition parties to form the one party, the Mahajot (Grand Alliance)." She accused of control over opposition's news in mass media and said, "They are controlling the newspapers. Bangladesh Television has become a party spokesperson. Nothing other than praises of that party is aired there." The two-time former prime minister reiterated that the recent treaties with India were against the country's interest. "By making such treaties, they sold off the country and came back claiming to be winners. We have to prepare for movement and ensure that those treaties are not implemented." Khaleda Zia criticised the government's failure to control law and order situation, spiralling prices, the shortage of power, gas and water. "They cannot provide any of these to the people," she said. b
