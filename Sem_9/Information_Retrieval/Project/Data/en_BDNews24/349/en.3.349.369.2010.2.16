<TITLE> Climate fund differences 'resolved' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Differences with donors over administering climate funds appeared to be resolved on Tuesday with the government agreeing to allow World Bank provide 'technical and fiduciary' assistance. With just the finer details to be ironed out in the next couple of weeks, the Bangladesh government is most likely to finally launch its Multi Donor Trust Fund for Climate Change after almost two years of negotiations. Finance minister AMA Muhith said Tuesday that while there was no concession on the overall administration, which would be done essentially by the environment ministry, the government did seek technical assistance. While Muhith declined to elaborate on the nature of that assistance, saying that the details had still not been worked out, he mentioned that it was only for an interim period. "The responsibilities will be eventually taken over by the government in a few years." The session on environment and climate change took almost double its allotted time to conclude on the morning of the second day, which delayed the day's proceedings. Finance minister AMA Muhith began his briefing with unqualified apologies for running late. Muhith was just under three hours behind schedule by the time he made it to the briefing room at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. The focus of attention was quite predictably the Multi Donor Trust Fund that has been a source of much speculation in the last couple of days  and a report in the UK-based Guardian on Monday saying that the Bangladesh government had rejected the funds over differences with the UK's DfID, did not help matters. Briefing reporters at the end of the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum, Muhith said the latest communication with DfID, about the proposed trust fund, "seemed largely agreeable". He said the government had sought technical assistance and DfID's communication related that development partners had elected the World Bank to provide both "technical and fiduciary assistance" for the fund. "However, the government would have to give it some more attention, iron out a few details and agree upon a reply together." Muhith also explained that the Multi Donor Trust Fund for Climate Change was separate from the global climate fund that would be created from contributions under the UN system announced during the Copenhagen climate summit in December 2009
