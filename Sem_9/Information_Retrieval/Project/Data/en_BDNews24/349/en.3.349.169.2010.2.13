<TITLE> Grand alliance will be in power until 2021: Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said that the grand alliance will remain in power up to 2021 if all the allies stay together. The JP is a major ally of the Awami League-led coalition government. "No party will be able to come to power until 2021 if the grand alliance stays together. Nobody except the almighty Allah can stop it from coming to power," he told a seminar organised by the newly created Rangpur Division Development Association in the capital's LGED Bhaban on Saturday. The government declared Rangpur a division last month. He said people will return the alliance to power again and again if they work for their welfare. "I am happy with the prime minister's 'vision 2021' target. A nation cannot progress if it does not have any target. It is not possible to run a country without an aim." The former president said all should have to work together for the development of Rangpur division.
