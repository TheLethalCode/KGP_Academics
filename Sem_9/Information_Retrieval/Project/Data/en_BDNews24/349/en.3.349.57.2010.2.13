 MARJAH, Afghanistan, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led NATO troops launched a major offensive on Saturday against the Taliban's last big stronghold in Afghanistan's most violent province, a test of President Barack Obama's troop surge strategy. The assault, the first since the US president ordered an extra 30,000 troops to Afghanistan in December, is the start of a campaign to impose government control on rebel-held areas this year, before US forces start to withdraw in 2011. "The offensive in Marjah has begun. Our company is preparing to secure key terrain to facilitate stability and security for the people of Marjah," Lt. Mark Greenlief of Bravo Company, First Battalion, Sixth Marines, told Reuters. A dozen helicopters flew from south of Marjah in Helmand province and the first objective of US Marines was to take the town centre despite the risk of being blown up by bombs rigged by the Taliban. "So far there has been no contact," Gunnery Sergeant Brandon Dickinson, waiting in a muddy field, told Reuters. The US military said about 4,500 US Marines, 1,500 Afghan troops and 300 U.S. soldiers were taking part in the offensive. The operation, codenamed Mushtarak, or "together", may have been labelled as such to highlight that NATO and Afghan forces were working closely to bring stability to Afghanistan, a country battered by decades of conflict. The Marjah area was home to an Afghan-American development project and its canals, which criss-cross lush farmland, were built by the Americans. CIVILIAN SAFETY A local Taliban commander, Qari Fazluddin, told Reuters earlier some 2,000 fighters were ready to fight in the densely-populated area. The safety of civilians may be the vital issue for NATO in one of the eight-year-old war's biggest offensives against the Taliban, which have re-emerged as a powerful fighting force since they were toppled by a US-led invasion in 2001. Any heavy civilian casualties would make it even more difficult for the American-backed Afghan government to win support in towns that have been held by Taliban insurgents. NATO forces have decided to advise civilians not to leave their homes, although they have said they do not know whether the assault will lead to heavy fighting. Most of the population of the area, estimated at up to 100,000, has remained. Unlike previous military operations, the assault on Marjah has been widely flagged for months. Commanders say they hope this will persuade many fighters to lay down their arms or flee, reducing the eventual body count. Residents have been afraid to leave their homes in fear of roadside bombs planted by the Taliban to slow the US advance. The Marjah district has been a breeding ground for both insurgents and opium poppy cultivation for years. Much may depend on whether the state can ensure long-term political and economic stability to erase the conditions that have encouraged militan
