 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition BNP rejoined parliament after staging a 45-minute walkout on Tuesday protesting against renaming of Zia International Airport. The BNP MPs returned to the house at around 4:30pm. They walked out of parliament 30 minutes into the proceedings after it started at 3:15pm with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. The opposition also staged walkout twice on Monday. The cabinet in its weekly meeting on Monday decided to rename ZIA as Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. BNP has already declared countrywide programmes to protest the decision. In 1983, Dhaka's international airport was named after late president Ziaur Rahman, who was founder of BNP. bdne
