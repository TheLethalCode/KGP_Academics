<TEXT>
 JAKARTA, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's former anti-graft chief was sentenced to 18 years in jail on Thursday for his role in the murder of a businessman. The case dealt a temporary blow to the reputation of the Corruption Eradication Commission, one of Indonesia's key weapons in the fight against graft. The agency, known as the KPK, quickly resumed its work after the arrest of the former chief, Antasari Azhar. However, his trial over recent months has attracted widespread interest from millions of Indonesians because of the often lurid details. "Defendant Antasari Azhar has been legitimately proven guilty of participating in persuading the carrying out of a premeditated murder," judge Herri Swantoro told the South Jakarta court. Azhar had been accused of ordering the murder of Nasrudin Zulkarnaen after the director of a state-owned firm had threatened to reveal that Azhar was having an affair with the businessman's third wife, a caddy at a local golf club. Azhar, 56, had potentially faced the death sentence. He showed little emotion as the verdict was read out, although some people in the packed court room cried out. The former anti-graft chief had denied any wrongdoing and insisted he was the victim of a plot to remove him from his post as the head of KPK. Azhar said on Thursday he would appeal. "I respect the decision of the judges, but I still want to seek truth and justice," said Azhar, who wore a yellow batik shirt and appeared calm despite the crush in the court room. Mohammad Assegaf, one of Azhar's lawyers, said his client faced "a very clear plot" to frame him after making many enemies in his role as a graft buster. SENIOR POLICE OFFICER, BUSINESSMAN JAILED In another court, a senior police officer was jailed for 12 years for participating in the murder plot. Williardi Wizar had also been a key witness for the prosecution, but later testified that there was a plot to frame Azhar. Businessman Sigid Haryo Wibisono was also jailed for 15 years after being accused of financing the hitmen. Five men had also been previously convicted of carrying out the shooting of Zulkarnaen and jailed for up to 18 years. The months of court testimony revealed a bitter rivalry between the KPK, the Attorney General's office and the police. The KPK has spearheaded investigations into lawmakers and businessmen in a fight against graft, which has been a key deterrent to investment in Indonesia. Its officials have upset many vested interests. Azhar's deputies, Bibit Samad Riyanto and Chandra Hamzah, were detained last year for alleged abuse of power, but were freed after evidence emerged of a police plot to frame them. Adnan Topan Husodo, deputy coordinator of Indonesia Corruption Watch, said there had been initial shock over the Azhar case, but his departure may have helped restart investigations that had stalled during his tenure at the KPK. "There was a short-term impact. But now, KPK as an institution is running well," Husodo said. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has identified legal reform as a key policy in his second term in office. Transparency International has previously named the police and judiciary as among Indonesia's most corrupt instituti
