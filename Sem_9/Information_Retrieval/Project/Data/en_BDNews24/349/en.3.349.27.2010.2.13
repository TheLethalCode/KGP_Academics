<TEXT>
 Madaripur, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Over a thousand vehicles a day on average have been lined up on both sides of the Mawa-Kawrakandi ferry crossing over the past four days as poor navigability coupled with out-of-action ferries have seriously disrupted services. Passengers are facing great troubles and perishable items like vegetables bound for Dhaka have been rotting in trucks for the duration. Rahim Sarker, a truck driver carrying vegetables from Jessore to Dhaka, told bdnews24.com that he had been stranded for three days. "The jam will cost me huge financial losses," he said. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) official Shahnewaz Chowdhury said the number of ferryboats on the crossing was reduced to nine to from 12 as two boats went out of operation and another has been sent to the Doulatdia ferry route. Apart from that a rush of devotees to the Zaker Manjil congregation at Faridpur and the Shiva festival at Sitakundu in Chittagong has raised number of passengers on the ferry route substantially over the last two days, aggravating the situation," he told bdnews24.com. Shahnewaz said the ferries on service cannot run on their full capacity because of the fall in water level and emergence of shoals in the river. Leasee of the ferry ghat Abu Alam Howlader told bdnews24.com that they were trying their best to serve the passengers. "But we're unable to solve the problem immediately," he said. bdn
