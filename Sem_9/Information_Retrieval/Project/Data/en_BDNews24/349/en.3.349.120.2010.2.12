 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  The number of employees at the agriculture extension department has remained static ever since it was created decades ago. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury speaking at the Krishibid Institute on Friday said it was impossible for a workforce designed to meet the demands of 75 million when the population has doubled. The government does not have enough manpower to provide services to the farmers, she said on Friday. Krishibid Institute president Wasiuzzaman Akand said that the extension department began with 1947 employees when Bangladesh was founded. "The number of employees remain the same today." Agriculture secretary CQK Mustaq Ahmed said, "Agricultural institutions should be expanded. We want to appoint diploma agriculturalists at the union level." Matia Chowdhury said she had spoken with the finance minister regarding this issue and he agreed on principle, although the issue of "financial limitations needs to be kept in mind." She said the government wanted to create new posts across the country. "But no body wants to work in the countryside" she lamented, adding, "even if they go out of town they keep requesting for transfers." She urged the agriculturalists to stop the practice: "In a small country like this, transfers will happen." She said that the mindset of the people should change as should the administration. Farmers should be provided with every service possible. "Because it is they who have contributed to your education," Matia told agriculture experts. bd
