<TITLE> MP's torture plea sparks welcome humour </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)A ruling party MP on Tuesday demanded framing of a separate law against torture on men. "The government has framed a law to stop torture against women. But I think the government should also immediately enact a law to protect men too," Fazlul Haq, an Awami League MP elected from Sherpur's Sribardi constituency, told parliament. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was chairing the session, and other MPs started laughing. "Honourable member, are you a victim of torture at home," Hamid questioned, interrupting Haq who also began laughing as he continued his speech. At the end of Haq's speech, the women MPs in the house, both Awami League and BNP, shouted out comments. "Now I do think there should be a law against torture on men," Hamid said, creating a welcome moment of humour in the House given recent tension between opposition and ruling benches since BNP rejoined parliament after a 64-day boycott last week.
