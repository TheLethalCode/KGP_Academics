 LONDON, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Chelsea will play Manchester City or Stoke City in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup next month after the draw was made on Sunday. If Manchester City beat Stoke in a replay on Feb 24, the cup meeting could bring together former Chelsea team-mates John Terry and Wayne Bridge, who have fallen out over personal matters, face to face for the second week in succession. Chelsea are due to host Manchester City in a Premier League match on Feb 27 when left back Bridge is expected to return to Stamford Bridge for the first time since media allegations that Terry had an extra-marital affair with Bridge's former girlfriend. With four of this weekend's fifth-round ties ending in draws, the only definite pairing will see debt-ravaged Portsmouth facing Birmingham City at Fratton Park when the quarter-final ties are played on the weekend of March 6 and 7. Fulham, who saw off League Two (fourth division) Notts County on Sunday, host the winners of the replay between Bolton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur. If Championship (second division) side Crystal Palace beat Premier League Aston Villa in their replay at Villa Park they will face the winners of the all-Championship replay between Reading and West Bromwich Albion. Full draw: Chelsea v Manchester City or Stoke City Fulham v Bolton Wanderers or Tottenham Hotspur Reading or West Bromwich Albion v Crystal Palace or Aston Villa Portsmouth v Birmingham
