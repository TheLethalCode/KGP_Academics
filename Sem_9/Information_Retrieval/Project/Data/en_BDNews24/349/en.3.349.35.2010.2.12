 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Twenty-one activists of Chhatra Shibir, student front of Jamaat-e-Islami, were arrested in a pre-dawn raid in Dhaka on Friday, police said. Shahbagh police station chief Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com: "Police conducted the raid at a mess behind Bangabandhu Shiekh Mujib Medical University at around 3 am on information that an anti-state meeting was being held there." "The 21 Shibir men, including 19 Dhaka University students, were arrested from there," he said.
