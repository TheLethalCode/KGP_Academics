 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)The opposition returned to parliament Thursday after a long boycott of 64 days, presenting demands for their stay. Proceedings began at 3pm, leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia led BNP and coalition MPs into the session at 3.15pm. Speaker Abdul Hamid welcomed them. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque began by delivering a 20-minute speech, presenting a package of demands to ensure the opposition's stay. The demands included rearrangement of opposition seats in the front row, discussion on the opposition's adjournment motions, scrapping the government notice canceling the lease of Khaleda Zia's cantonment house, withdrawal of cases against Khaleda, her two sons and BNP leaders, appointment of deputy speaker from the opposition and four heads of parliamentary standing committees from the opposition. He also called for discussion on India's Tipaimukh dam, corridor to India, Asian Highway, maritime boundary, border killings, price hike of essentials, law-and-order situation, and expunging indecorous remarks against the slain President Ziaur Rhman. Farroque said the law and order situation had greatly deteriorated in recent times and referred a number of incidents. Ruling MPs protested his remark, upon which the oppsoitoin chief whip said if they were not allowed to speak in parliament they would be unable to stay in the house. Earlier in the day, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury said that they would raise issues like law and order and price escalation in parliament. "The government has failed to address the law and order problems, price escalation, and so on, faced by the people. We would like to raise these burning issues in the parliament ourselves," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "We hope the party in power will allow us to speak up. If they won't, we'll tell people that the government wants to choke people's voices, like they did in the past." He said BNP had asked all its MPs to be present at the session; three MPs from coalition partners Jama'at-e-Islami and Bangladesh Jatiya Party will also be there. A meeting of BNP's parliamentary party last week decided on rejoining parliament this session. bdne
