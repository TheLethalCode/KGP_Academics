 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday called on donors to deliver on promised funds to counter the grave impact of climate change on Bangladesh, alongside fulfilling their ODA pledges. The prime minister was addressing the inaugural session of the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum, a key meeting between the government and donors, getting underway at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. "Our development partners should  now fulfil their ODA targets of 0.17 percent of GNI (gross national income) to developing countries and 0.2 percent to least developed countries as affirmed in the Brussels Programme of Action," she said. She also listed her government's various measures for environmental protection and climate change adaptation and urged donors to disburse the funds promised to poor countries at the Copenhagen conference for mitigation purposes. "We need quick disbursement of the fund promised in the COP-15 summit in Copenhagen last December for adaptation and mitigation particularly for least developed countries and low lying coastal countries," Hasina said. She hoped the outcomes of the forum would give guidelines for development strategies, a better mechanism for effective coordination among development partners, and show a stronger alignment with the development vision and priorities of the government. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith also addressed the inaugural session. World Bank vice-president for South Asia region Isabel Guerrero, ADB South Asia director general Sultan Hafeez Rahman, and Japan's International Cooperation Bureau deputy director general Kazuo Sunaga gave introductory statements. Economic Relations Division secretary and Local Consultative Group co-chair M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, and DFID country director and Local Consultative Group co-chair Chris Austin delivered addresses of welcome. b
