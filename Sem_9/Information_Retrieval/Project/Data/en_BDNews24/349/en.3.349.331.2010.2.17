<TITLE> Razzak makes u-turn on rice price hike </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Food minister Abdur Razzak has recanted his remarks made just a day earlier about the reasons behind the recent rice price hike. The minister, at a seminar on Tuesday, told reporters that it was inadequate supply, and not dishonest traders, that was responsible for the increase in rice price in the market. On Wednesday, he, however, made a u-turn on the issue accusing the traders of creating artificial crisis in the market in order to raise the price. Inaugurating an international seminar on 'Climate Change and Violent Cyclone' at Hotel Lakeshore in Dhaka, he called the rice traders "manipulators". "The traders always scheme to elevate the rice price. Even now they are trying to do this," he said. He also said it is possible to stabilise the market with the government's current reserve. The minister, however, avoided making any remarks on his previous statement. Razzak was asked whether any punitive actions would be taken to identify and punish those manipulators. "I do not want to raise any controversy commenting on this issue," he said in an apparent effort to deflect the question. About the government's failure to procure enough rice from the market, he said, "We could not buy enough rice as the price is fairly high." Despite the government's goal of procuring 3 million tonnes of Aman within February, it has so far stored only 30,000 tonnes, said the minister. EU ambassador to Bangladesh Stefan Frowein, Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) executive director Bhichit Rattakul, Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre (BDPC) director Sayedur Rahman and Norwegian researcher Torray Forevic also spoke at the seminar. bd
