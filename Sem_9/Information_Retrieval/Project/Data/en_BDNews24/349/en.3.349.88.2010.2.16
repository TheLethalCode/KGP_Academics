 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has declared a demonstration programme across the country on Thursday to protest a number of recent government moves. The issues include renaming the Zia International Airport, recovery of a bomb-like object in front of party chief Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office, alleged torture and killing of party leaders and activists and high prices of essential commodities. "We think the government is going towards a one-party rule by renaming the Zia International Airport and torturing the leaders and activists of the opposition," senior BNP joint secretary general Mirza Fakrul Islam Alamgir told a press briefing at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters on Tuesday. Alamgir said the central protest rally will be held at 3pm on Thursday in capital Dhaka. Apart from that, demonstrations will be held in all districts. He criticised the statements of the ruling party MPs in parliament about the dead body of former president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman. The BNP leader also demanded adequate security protection for the Leader of the Opposition. Among others, BNP standing committee members Goyeshwar Chandra Roy, vice president Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and joint secretary general Amanullah Aman were present at the briefing. b
