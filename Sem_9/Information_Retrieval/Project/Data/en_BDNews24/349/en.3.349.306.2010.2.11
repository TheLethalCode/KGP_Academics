 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government is looking to significantly raise the volume of value added tax and income tax to boost revenue from internal sources, the finance minister said on Thursday. "We've to raise the number of VAT payers to 4 million from 3 million and income tax payers from 0.6 million to 30 million," Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told a meeting in Dhaka. He however, did not mention any time frame. Governments of Bangladesh, a country with a population of over 140 million, have long looked to raise tax revenue. "It's globalised world and we've to adapt to the changes", he said, adding "That's why we've to lessen our dependence on import duty by raising revenue earning from internal sources." Muhit made the remarks at a meeting titled 'Changing VAT law and rationalising Bangladesh custom tariff' at BIAM auditorium. It was organised by the National Board of Revenue. Referring to the fact that only one-third of VAT-registered undertakings submitted their returns last year, Muhith said: "We've to bring more firms under VAT registration to boost revenue." He asked NBR officials to form a committee to bring necessary changes in Value-Added Tax Act, 1991 to facilitate the increase in VAT providers' number. Changes will be brought in customs tariff law too, he said. Prime minister's finance adviser Moshiur Rahman also spoke at the meeting. He said if the government wants to raise VAT providers number, it would need to keep an eye on accounts of business ventures. "Though it will require the government to spend additional money at the initial stage, VAT providers' number will ultimately increase." For 2009-10 financial year, the revenue board has set a revenue collection target of Tk 610 billion, including Tk 232.36 billion from import-level duty, VAT and supplementary duty, Tk 203.35 billion from local-level duty, VAT and supplementary duty, and Tk 165.6 billion from income tax. The board collected Tk 525.26 billion in the last financial year. The figure included Tk 208.7 billion from import duty, VAT and supplementary duty, Tk 173.42 billion from local-level duty, VAT and supplementary duty, and Tk 138.59 billion from income tax. Bangladesh-Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Abdul Haq suggested amendment to VAT Act for attracting foreign direct investment.
