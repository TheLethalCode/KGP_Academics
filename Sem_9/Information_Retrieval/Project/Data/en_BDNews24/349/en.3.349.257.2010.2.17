 KOLKATA, India, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain and Hashim Amla frustrated India's bid for a series-levelling victory in the second and final Test against South Africa Wednesday. Only 34.1 overs were possible on a fourth day severely interrupted by bad light and rain, raising the tourists' hopes of saving the test. South Africa were 115-3 at the close, still 232 behind, but with seven wickets in hand have a good chance of seeing out the last day. They hold a 1-0 lead and are bidding to win their first series on Indian soil for a decade and leapfrog the hosts at the top of the world rankings. South Africa lost the key wicket of Jacques Kallis (20) to leg-spinner Amit Mishra just minutes before the rain came down. In-form Amla had battled to 45 not out when tea was taken early. Ashwell Prince had yet to get off the mark. Only one over was possible after tea before bad light forced the suspension of play for a second time after the start had been delayed by 93 minutes due to overnight rain. South Africa, resuming on six without loss, lost both openers either side of lunch before Amla, who scored centuries in his two previous outings, frustrated India in forging a partnership of 57 with Kallis. Earlier, Mishra made the initial breakthrough with the score on 36 when he struck with his first ball to dismiss skipper Graeme Smith (20) two overs before lunch. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh then dismissed first innings centurion Alviro Petersen, when the test debutant was caught at short leg for 21. Amla, who was lucky to escape when dropped by Murali Vijay at backward shortleg off Harbhajan on 14, and Kallis batted cautiously before Mishra struck again immediately after he was brought back into the attack by taking the wicket of Kallis. Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni had all compiled centuries to put India in control, with the hosts having declared on 643-6. South Africa made 296 in their first inn
