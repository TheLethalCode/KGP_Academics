 Rajshahi, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered two explosive devices and two machetes from Sher-e-Bangla Fazlul Haque Hall at Rajshahi University on Saturday, four days after the campus erupted in violence leading to mass arrests, with the situation remaining tense. One student was killed and scores were injured during the clashes between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir overnight on Feb 8-9. Hundreds of Shibir activists were rounded up after the clashes and killing. Provost Subhash Chandra Sheel alleged the bombs might belong to Shibir activists who are accused of butchering RU student and Chhatra League activist Faruque Hossain whose body was recovered from a manhole on Feb 9. "The Shibir activists might have left the arms there after the clashes," Sheel said. He told bdnews24.com that the hall cook had found a sack holding the machetes and a carton lying among bushes in the hall grounds and informed authorities of the matter. The hall authorities called police. Police recovered the explosives from the carton. Two days earlier, police recovered four machetes and a number of metal bars that were dumped in a pond adjacent to the campus and nearby Kajla area. RU proctor Chowdhury Mohamad Zakaria said they would carry out further raids in search of arms in the halls. Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain said the machetes and bombs were taken to the police station. bdn
