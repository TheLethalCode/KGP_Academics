<TITLE> 2nd Siddhirganj power unit goes online too 'next month' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the first of the two 120MW units of a new power plant in Siddhirganj on Sunday. The second unit is expected to begin operation next month. "We want to make Bangladesh a technology-dependent country by 2021 by increasing the total power consumers up to 100 per cent," the prime minister said while inaugurating the first unit. "We want to observe the golden jubilee of our independence in a developed Bangladesh." At present, only 47 percent of the population has access to electricity in Bangladesh. With both units fully operational, the 240 MW Siddhirganj plant could meet the entire electricity demand of Mymensigh zone and still add power to the national grid. But gas supply crisis remains a major concern, officials say. All arrangements , tender and contract for the plant were completed by previous BNP-led government and caretaker administration. Though gas crisis was not addressed. The Tk 11.3 billion contract went to Bharat Heavy Electronics Limited for engineering, procurement and construction of the plant. The project has been implemented by the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh, a newly created state entity under the Power Development Board. Asian Development Bank has contributed to the tune of Tk 769.048 crore ($109.86 million) for the project. The Siddhirganj 'peaking power plant' was originally expected to generate power during peak hours only, about eight hours daily, when the demand is highest. But given the acute power crisis in the country, the new plant may be used off peak too. The plant is the first to be inaugurated by Hasina after her government took office in January 2009 with a pledge to solve the electricity crisis. Taking a swipe at former BNP-led four party alliance government, Hasina said on Sunday not a single megawatt of power was produced during their entire tenure. Hasina also claimed that her government has managed to "bring back discipline into the chaotic power sector through necessary measures". She urged the consumers to be frugal in using gas and power. She also called upon industrialists to use alternative energy sources, adding that the prime minister's office had now installed solar energy panels. Bangladesh's 40-plus power plants have a total derated production capacity of 5,450MW, but the gas crisis is currently curbing around 1,000MW of production, according to the Power Development Board. Transmission loss also accounts for further shortfalls. Maximum power generation was 3,765MW against a peak hour demand of 4,650MW last week, PDB figures show. The shortfall was partly managed through 'load shedding'. Hasina said her government will add 1,000MW to the grid this year and wants to raise power production to 7,000MW by 2013 with more peak-hour, coal-fired and renewable energy power plants. bd
