The BNP MPs walked out of parliament 30 minutes into the proceedings after it started at 3:15pm with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. The opposition also staged walkout twice on Monday. The cabinet in its weekly meeting on Monday decided to rename ZIA as Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. BNP has already declared countrywide programmes to protest the decision.
