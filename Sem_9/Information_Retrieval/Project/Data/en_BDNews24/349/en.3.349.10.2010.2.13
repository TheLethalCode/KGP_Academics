<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Shah Rukh Khan said on Friday he was "scared" and "hurt" by Shiv Sena's reaction to recent remarks he made in support of Pakistani cricketers. The 44-year-old heartthrob, in Berlin to present his latest movie "My Name is Khan", also told reporters that he wanted to see the row settled quickly. "I really want everybody to be happy ... and I'll make sure that by the time I get back to India that everybody is happy," said Khan. "I don't want any aggression, any problem.

"We as filmmakers should never ever look beyond the fact that we are here to serve the audience. That's how I see it. I truly believe that my job is to make sure people smile. I have no self-centredness or ego about it." My Name Is Khan, directed by Karan Johar, is about a man named Rizvan Khan, a respectable Muslim played by Khan who suffers from Asperger syndrome, a mild form of autism. Khan falls in love with a single mother, played by Indian actress Kajol, who runs a hair salon.
