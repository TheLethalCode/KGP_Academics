 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque told parliament Thursday, just before his party walked out again, that BNP would not remain in the House for long if opposition MPs were not allowed to take the floor. However, another senior party figure Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar MP said BNP were there to stay this time unless the opposition faced verbal abuse from the ruling party. BNP walked out just hours after joining parliament, ending a long stretch of absenteeism, alleging the speaker did not allow them to talk. "Mr Speaker, we have returned to parliament as the president, you and the prime minister invited us to join. "But we cannot say how long we will be staying if we are not allowed to speak in the House," Farroque told parliament standing on a point of order after rejoining parliament after 64-day absence. However, Sircar, a former speaker, was firmly in favour of his party remaining in attendance. "We have come here to contribute to parliamentary practices, unless the government hurls abusive words against us with a motive of forcing the opposition out again," said Sircar. Speaker Abdul Hamid in response assured the opposition of enough floor time. "I seek your cooperation to make parliament more effective," said Hamid, who was chairing the session. He urged both the treasury and the opposition benches not to attack each other in their approaches. The opposition maintains it has never announced a "boycott", of parliament despite several previous walkouts and long periods of non-attendance. BNP RETURN WITH DEMANDS Leader of the opposition and BNP chief Khaleda Zia had earlier led BNP and coalition MPs into the session at 3.15pm. Speaker Abdul Hamid welcomed them. Proceedings opened with opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque delivering a 20-minute speech, presenting a package of demands to ensure the opposition's stay. The demands included rearrangement of opposition seats in the front row, discussion on the opposition's adjournment motions, scrapping the government notice canceling the lease of Khaleda Zia's cantonment house, withdrawal of cases against Khaleda, her two sons and BNP leaders, appointment of a deputy speaker from the opposition and four heads of parliamentary standing committees from the opposition. He also called for discussion on India's Tipaimukh dam, corridor to India, Asian Highway, maritime boundary, border killings, price hike of essentials, law-and-order situation, and expunging indecorous remarks against the slain President Ziaur Rahman. Farroque said the law and order situation had greatly deteriorated in recent times and referred a number of incidents. Ruling MPs protested his remark, upon which the opposition chief whip said if they were not allowed to speak in parliament they would be unable to stay in the house. Earlier in the day, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury said that they would raise issues like law and order and price escalation in parliament. "The government has failed to address the law and order problems, price escalation, and so on, faced by the people. We would like to raise these burning issues in the parliament ourselves," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. A meeting of BNP's parliamentary party last week decided on rejoining parliament this session. WALK OUT AGAIN The opposition returned on Thursday afternoon, but walked out en masse again at 7.05pm, protesting that they were not given the floor. Home minister Sahara Khatun was delivering a statement, under Rule 300 of parliamentary procedure, on the recent murder of a Chhatra League student at Rajshahi University. Immediately after her speech, senior BNP leader Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury demanded the floor. But the speaker rejected his request and gave floor to a ruling MP to speak on the president's speech. Headed by BNP chief and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, BNP and its allies walked out accusing the speaker of not giving floor to the opposition. Speaker Abdul Hamid said, "Members of ruling and opposition parties will talk in parliament. I want to give the chance to everyone. But I don't think it is right to create this kind of standoff." Hamid said Chowdhury was absent when he was eligible to be given the floor. "But when he returned, the home minister was delivering a speech under Rule 300. In line with the parliamentary rules of procedure, none can make comment on her speech," said the speaker. "Nevertheless, they (the opposition leaders) walked out of parliament," he added. Hamid added, "Time is not running away. Parliament will sit again on Sunday. I want everyone to get floor time."
