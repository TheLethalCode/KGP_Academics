 Chittaong, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong police on Friday rounded up about 90 Shibir activists along with metropolitan Jamaat nayeb-e-amir Md Ahsanullah from a demonstration brought out to cliam the body of slain student AAM Mahiuddin. Some unidentified attackers hacked Mahiuddin, a Chittagong University political science student, to death at the Sholoshahar rail station on Thursday evening. Both Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir leaders claimed Mahiuddin to be their worker. However, the family members of the victim refuted Shibir's claim saying Mahiuddin had no connections with Jamaat-Shibir politics. Witnesses said at around 11.30 am on Friday, more than 500 Shibir activists, led by former MP and Jamaat leader Shahjahan Chowdhury, brought out a demonstration parading towards the Chittagong Medical College Hospital morgue to claim the body of Mahiuddin. As the hospital authorities refused to comply with their demand, Shibir held an impromptu gathering in front of the morgue. A chase and counter chase ensued between police and Shibir actvists as the demonstrators arrived at Jamal Khan intersection. Chittagong metropolitan police additional commissioner Jalil Mondol told reporters that they arrested around 90 protestors for attacking the police personnel and creating disorder at the hospital. At least 10 policemen including assistant police commissioner Jahangir Alam and Kotwoali thana police chief Mahiuddin Mahmud were injured in the clash, Mondol claimed. He said, "They (Shibir activists) made chaos at the hospital demanding that the dead student was their worker. Later they brought out demonstration ignoring police order." Traffic on both the Kazir Dauri and Zamal Khan areas was brought to a standstill during the clash. The communication, however, resumed after about an hour and a half. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Chhatra league CU unit also took to the streets claiming the body to be theirs. Family declines Shibir claim Md Fazlul Qader, father of the deceased, told bdnews24.com that his family is loyal to Awami League. None of his family members are involved in Jamaat-Shibir politics. "My son had no connection with Shibir. We are Awami League supporters. I want nobody to gain political advantage out of my son's dead body." Fazlul said he worked as a store keeper of Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation. "I was dismissed from my job without any allegation in 2002 during the rule of BNP-led four-party alliance. I was reinstated by a High Court order six months ago." Provost Hossain Kabir of Alaol hall, to which Mahiuddin belonged, told bdnews24.com that Mahiuddin was an innocent boy and was never seen to be involved in Shibir politics.
