 Nilphamari, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Massive clashes between district Jamaat-Shibir activists and supporters of ruling Awami League left more than 60 injured at Nilphamari on Saturday. The clash ensued when members of local Awami League and its associate organisations attacked and set ablaze the local Jamaat-e-Islami district office at Al Helal Academy around 5pm. Nilphamari Jamaat chief Shah Mozammel Huq, district Chhatra League general secretary Wadud Rahman, central police station's officer in charge Nurul Islam, sub inspector Shahabuddin and Islamic TV's district correspondent Nur Alam Siddiqui sustained injuries amongst scores of others. Police fired 20 rounds of tear shells and 10 rounds of rubber bullets to bring the situation under control. They also rounded up 20 people from the spot and later arrested the district Jamaat chief. Witnesses said the district Jamaat unit, as part of the party's nationwide protest activities, attempted to take out a demonstration march around 4pm but failed as police opposed them. The members gathered at their district head office. A huge procession of local Awami League members and associate organisations arrived at the academy around 5pm and broke their way into the Jamaat offices. They set nine motorcycles and 26 bicycles on fire in the yard and proceeded to ransack the office. Jamaat members, in an attempt to stop them, with the two sides locked into a three-hour long clash. Police brought the situation under control firing tear gas shells and rubber bullets. A unit of the Nilphamari fire brigade doused the flames at Al Helal Academy. The Jamaat-Shibir protests come in the wake of countrywide mass arrests of their members in line with the government's directive earlier in the week for a combing operation against Islami Chhtra Shibir, the pro-Jamaat student front. The operation has also resulted in arrests of Jamaat leaders in several districts. The home ministry last Thursday ordered concerned agencies to comb out Shibir from campuses across the country after the killing of a pro-ruling party Chhatra League activist, Faruque Hossain, at Rajshahi University in armed clashes between the rival student fronts. bdn
