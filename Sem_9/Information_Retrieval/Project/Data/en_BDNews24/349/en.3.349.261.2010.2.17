 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government plans to use more surface water in Dhaka, eventually adding 675 million litres a day to the city supply, as underground sources are being depleted by an escalating population, the prime minister told parliament Wednesday. Sheikh Hasina said the level of underground water was falling 2-3 metres every year. "The government is aware of the situation and the dangers posed by this crisis such as subsidence," she said, replying to a query by a Comilla MP Nasimul Alam Chowdhury during prime minister's question time. At present, ground water makes up for 88 percent of the city's water supply, whereas surface water accounts for just 12 percent. Dhaka, with a population of around 13 million, is one of the fastest growing mega cities in the world, placing serious strains on basic water supply, sanitation and drainage services for its inhabitants. The rising demand offers a nightmarish scenario for the city with its population projected to reach 22 million in 2025. At present, delivery of services by Dhaka WASA is uneven. The water authority supplies around 2 billion litres a day, but covers only around 70 percent of the population of the Dhaka metropolitan area and its suburbs. The quality and quantity of service varies significantly and there are no piped distribution networks available in slums, which house an estimated 3-4 million of Dhaka's population. The prime minister said on Wednesday the government was committed to provide all Dhaka residents with potable water "by 2011". She reiterated the commitment as part of the government's plans to address the capital's growing water crisis. It was also an election pledge of her Awami League party in 2008. Hasina also detailed a number of projects to solve the water shortage in the metropolitan area, though not by next year. According to the plan, the Sayedabad Water Refinery (Phase-2) will be completed by June 2012. Once the project is complete, it will supply 225 million litres everyday from the Shitalakkhya river. In addition, the Keraniganj Water Refinery will be set up by June 2014, which will supply another 450 millions litres per day from the Padma river. The government is also examining the possibility of setting up a water refinery in the capital's Khilkhet area on the Meghna river, through the Dhaka Water Supply Project with assistance from development partners including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. "We have also taken steps to clean up the rivers around the capital through dredging and removing waste to raise supply and use of surface water," Hasina said. bd
