<TEXT>
 Chandpur, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  A Islami Chhatra Shibir member survived an attack with sharp weapons by unknown assailants on Saturday at the city's Shapath area. The seriously wounded victim, Md Maksud, 30, is under treatment at the district hospital, police said. His brother Tanvir said that Maksud was attacked by a group of assailants armed with sharp weapons on his way to prayers at Baitul Amin Jame Masjid. The family have not filed any complaint with the police yet over the incident. Learning of the attack, police enforced police protection around the hospital being apprehensive of further incidents. Nazrul Islam, sub Inspector of Chandpur police, said: "We have visited Maksud at hospital. However his family did not bring any specific charges against anyone in the incident." Second officer of the station, SI Monir Ahmed said, "We have heard that someone or some people assaulted Maksud. But police are on alert." "Police have been deployed at crucial locations including Shapath Chattar, Bus Stand, Natun Bazaar to prevent fall of law and order situations." The attack comes in the wake of violence between rival student fronts, Shibir and Bangladesh Chhatra League, on at least two major campuses, Rajshahi University and Chittagong University, in recent days. The home ministry last Thursday ordered concerned agencies to comb out activists of Shibir, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student front, from campuses across the country after the killing of a pro-ruling party Chhatra League activist at Rajshahi University. bdn
