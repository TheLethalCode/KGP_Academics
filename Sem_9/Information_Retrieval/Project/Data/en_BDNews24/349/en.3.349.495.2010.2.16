 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered two suspicious packages in front of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's Gulshan office Monday morning, which looked like 'cocktails', or crude explosive devices, a party official said. Ahmed Kabir, sub-inspector of Gulshan Police Station said they recovered the packages wrapped in red scotch tape some 200 yards from the opposition leader's office. "The office caretaker found the 'cocktail' in front of the gate at around 6:30am and informed police of the matter," opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque told bdnews24.com. Police came and took it to the station, he said. BNP, at a press conference at parliament's media centre later in the afternoon, called for a probe into the matter and demanded better state security for the opposition leader. bdne
