 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A witness said bodies were lying in the stairwell of the 13th floor of Building Six of Japan Garden City almost three hours after a fire broke out there late on Thursday night. The police were yet to confirm any deaths. Dr Yahiya Khandaker, organising secretary of the flat owner's association told bdnews24.com at around 1am, "I have seen the bodies myself on the stairs of the 13th floor. Three of them were children, two males and two females." The fire gutting the 10th floor of Building Six of the sprawling housing development in the capital was finally quenched and brought under control around 11:30am. Fire brigade's director general Brig Gen Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah told bdnews24.com, "The fire has been brought under control. Dumping down is being carried out now. But the loss incurred from the fire has not been calculated yet." "No reports of any deaths have been received," he said at the time. The fire department's central office said flames broke out from Flat No 1101 at around 10:18pm. Fifteen fire fighting units rushed on location to douse the flames. bdnew
