<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bndews24.com)After days of MPs hurling abuse and opposition walk-outs, Wednesday's proceedings in parliament were calm. Following pleas for decent language and behaviour by speaker Abdul Hamid on Tuesday, there was no walkout by the BNP-led opposition as ruling pary MPs refrained from hurling abuse against the party's later founder Ziaur Rahman and leader of the oppsoition Khaleda Zia. The BNP have staged five walkouts since they rejoined parliament on Feb 11 ending their boycott since June 4 last year. Hamid, who chaired the session until its adjournment before Maghrib prayers, was very strict in allocating time to all MPs. He did not allow any MPs to talk on point-of-order which sparked the recent confrontations and walkouts. As the House started its business just after 3.15 pm, Hamid suspended the scheduled prime minister's question-answer hour though Sheikh Hasina turned up at parliament on time. The chair then allowed law minister to table the Bangladesh Court Fee Bill-2010 which was later sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the ministry for further scrutiny. The House also passed the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (Amendment) Bill-2010. BNP MPs Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, Mahbub Uddin Khokon and Nazim Uddin Ahmed took part in the passage of the bill. Speeches on president's parliamentary address followed the bill's passage. Liberal Democratic Party president Oli Ahmad, Awami League MPs Monoranjan Shil Gopal, Amjad Hossain, Sohrab Ali Sana, A K M Bahar Uddin, Md Shah Alam, Solaiman Huq Jowarder Saloon and Lutful Hye, and the BNP's Nazim Uddin Ahmed and Mohzar Ali Prodhan delivered their speech on the president's address.
