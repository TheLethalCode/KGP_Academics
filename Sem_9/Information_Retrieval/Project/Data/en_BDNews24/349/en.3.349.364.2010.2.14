 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, walked out of parliament again on Sunday within half an hour of their entering. The session had resumed after a two-day gap at 3.16pm presided over by speaker Abdul Hamid. The opposition staged its walk out at 3.45 protesting against a remark regarding BNP founder and former president, late Ziaur Rahman. The remark came from ruling Awami League's presidium member Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. At the beginning of Sunday's proceedings, opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque, speaking on a point of order demanded that the speaker expunge the word 'killer' from the parliament's records. Home minister Sahara Khatun, while delivering a statement under Rule 300 of parliamentary procedure on Feb 11, had termed Ziaur Rahman a 'killer'. The opposition walked out at the time within hours of returning to parliament after a 64-day boycott. The speaker said Sunday that if anything derogatory was expressed in parliament, it would be automatically expunged. At one stage, Selim asked BNP to show him pictures of Ziaur Rahman's dead body. The opposition made a noisy protest at his statement and demanded the floor to speak. But the opposition walked out of the house even though BNP MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie was given the floor. bdnews
