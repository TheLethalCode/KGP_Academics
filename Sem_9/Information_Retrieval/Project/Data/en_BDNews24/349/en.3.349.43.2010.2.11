 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami will observe agitation programmes at metropolitan cities on Friday and at district level on Saturday in protest against murder of a member of student front Islami Chhatra Shibir on Thursday and arrest of its activists for the recent Rajshahi University campus violence and student killing. Party secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mujahid announced the programme on Thursday at its office at Dhaka's Moghbazar. He sought the prime minister's intervention to stop "heinous oppression" before the country's "overall situation goes out of control". Shibir activist Shaheen, 24, of Rajshahi College, died in Chapainawabganj early on Thursday in a gunfight with police. Police claimed that Shaheen, from Meherchandi in Rajshahi, was an accused in the killing of RU Chhatra League activist Faruque Hossain. Faruque was killed during Shibir and Chhatra League clashes at the university in the early hours of Tuesday. Two cases were filed on Wednesday against some 600 Shibir members, including 64 who were named specifically, in connection with the RU violence and Hossain's killing. Scores of Jamaat and Shibir activists have been picked up in the case. b
