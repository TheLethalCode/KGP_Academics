<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  The national consumer rights protection directorate is to commence work from Mar 15, which is International Consumer Rights Day. Four teams, with assistance from the directorate, will set out to observe whether consumer rights are being upheld at various institutions and service-oriented organisations on the day. The decision was taken at the second meeting of the national consumer rights protection council at the commerce ministry on Sunday, and marks the first time the international day will be observed with a government initiative in Bangladesh. Commerce minister and chairman of the council Faruk Khan presided over the meeting, which was attended among others by acting secretary of the ministry Golam Hossain and director general of the new directorate Abul Hossain Miah. "The newly formed directorate will officially commence its activities at field levels from March 15. The public will also be able to file complaints with the directorate from that date," Khan told a press briefing after the meeting. He also said that a separate government fund will be created for the directorate. Donations will not be taken from any individual. Funds might be accepted from foreign donors but the government currently has no intention of taking outside help, said the minister. Responding to a query about fixing discrepancies in the National Consumer Rights Protection Act 2009, Golam Hossain said, "Some discrepancies were found in the law. More may be found during implementation. They will be corrected." The secretary also revealed that drafts of the workforce, organisational structure, policies and regulations for the council are ready. They will be published at the directorate's website in a few days for public opinion. The documents will also be scrutinised to see that the council's rules and regulations do not conflict with the works of other offices including Bangladesh Standard Testing Institution and food directorate. Hossain said that a nine-member subcommittee was formed in the first meeting of the council on Dec 9. The subcommittee presented the drafts in Sunday's meeting and the council will give its comments on them on Feb 28. The 29-member council headed by the commerce minister was formed on Nov 24. It includes 13 government officials and 15 representatives of civil society.
