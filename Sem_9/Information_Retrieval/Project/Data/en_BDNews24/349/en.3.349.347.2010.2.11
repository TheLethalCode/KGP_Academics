<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A devastating fire spread from the tenth floor of a residential building in the sprawling Japan Garden City housing development in the capital on Thursday night. The fire department's central office said the fire broke out from Flat No 1101 of Buidling Six at around 10:18pm. Fifteen fire fighting units were trying to douse the flames. Witnesses said the fire could be seen from both the north and south sides of the building, as fire fighters were trying to tame the flames from adjacent buildings. The roads were blocked as crowds of spectators gathered. A resident of the first floor of the building, Jashim Uddin, said he and some neighbours had gone up to the seventh floor to check if anyone was left behind. "Everyone seemed to have locked their flats and gone. But the group was unable to check any further up because of the smoke," he said. Riaz Hassan, of the building's eight floor, said they all rushed down hearing calls of fire at around 10:45pm. He said no one was living in Flat 1101 as yet, but decoration work was going on there. Narayan Sarkar, resident of the neighbouring flat, also said that carpenters had been working in 1101 for the last one year. "The workers come to work. The owner has not moved in yet." "Me and my wife came down hearing of the fire," said Sarkar, who is general manager of Bakhrabad Gas System Ltd. bdnew
