 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)The job of political leaders is foremost to provide stability for economic development, visiting Turkish president Abdullah Gul stressed in Dhaka on Saturday. Gul said the responsibilities of the state are to guarantee fundamental rights of the citizen in a democratic environment to foster economic growth so that the people can prosper. "Our only job is to ensure these," he said during a meeting with the Bangladeshi business community. Organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the meeting was held at the Sonargaon Hotel in a bid to facilitate discussions among the business leaders of the two countries. He called upon Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to consider investing in Turkey, saying that his country already has invested significantly in Bangladesh's textile sector. Bangladesh and Turkey need to bolster ties through increased trade and investment, Gul told the meeting. "Joint venture initiatives in a third country can be also considered," he said. "The time has now come to transform this friendship into a relation that will bring mutual benefit to the peoples of both countries," the Turkish president said. Gul, who arrived on Friday, is accompanied by a delegation comprised mainly of Turkish businessmen. On the potential of bilateral trade between the countries, Gul reiterated that it can be doubled. "Bilateral trade between the two countries has already grown to almost $600 million, but it can go up to more than a billion." Finance minister AMA Muhith, FBCCI president Annisul Huq and Rifat Hisarciklio lu, president for the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) also spoke in the breakfast meeting.
