 TEHRAN, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian security forces clashed with opposition supporters on Thursday when huge crowds flocked to central Tehran to mark the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution. State television showed live footage of hundreds of thousands of people, some carrying Iranian flags and pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, walking to Azadi (freedom) Square in central Tehran. An Iranian opposition website, Iran's Green Voice, said security forces fired shots and teargas at supporters of opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi staging a rally in central Tehran.

Production of higher-grade uranium will be trebled in the near future, he added. Iran announced it had started making higher-grade atomic fuel two days ago. The West accuses Iran of covertly trying to build nuclear bombs. Iran, the world's fifth-largest crude exporter, says its nuclear facilities are part of a peaceful energy programme and has said it would retaliate for any attack on them. Israel sees Iran's nuclear programme as a threat to its existence and has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to resolve the dispute over uranium enrichment. Ahmadinejad said on Wednesday that if Israel embarked on military action in the region, it should be resisted and "put an end to," state television reported on Thursday. The Islamic Republic does not recognise Israel, which it refers to as the Zionist regi
