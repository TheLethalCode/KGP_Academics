 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A joint surveillance programme of the Department of Livestock and FAO has been successful in detecting two out of every three bird flu outbreaks in Bangladesh, enabling livestock officials to respond quickly and prevent spread of the disease. The surveillance programme, which detected 21 of the 35 outbreaks of bird flu in 2009, has been recognised nationally and internationally as an effective tool of disease control. As part of their collaboration, the two organisations arranged a four-day bird flu surveillance workshop at the Department of Agriculture in Dhaka from Wednesday for 105 upazila livestock officers. Mat Yamage, chief technical adviser of the FAO avian influenza control programme, while presiding over the inaugural session said: "This is the season when outbreaks of bird flu can occur and timely interventions are required to contain them". Md Habibur Rahman, director general and chief veterinary officer of the Department of Livestock Services, was the chief guest at USAID-funded workshop. Resource persons discussed the current bird flu situation in Bangladesh, characteristics of the bird flu virus, clinical signs of the disease and control measures to contain its outbreak. Habibur described economic importance of the poultry industry and said it provides an important source of affordable food to Bangladeshi people.
