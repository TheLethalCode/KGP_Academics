 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has unveiled a revised Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) on Sunday with an enhanced outlay of Tk 2814.81 billion more than halfway into its three-year period. Finance minister AMA Muhith and planning minister AK Khandaker presented the document, which is required by development partners including the World Bank and IMF for considering debt relief. The revised PRSP, which will expire in June next year, has raised the expenditure outlay by Tk 246.82 billion to Tk 2814.81 billion from the original. It has a resource deficit of Tk 874.84 billion. It has also targeted GDP growth at 6 percent for the current fiscal year and 6.7 percent for next FY. The title of the original document, drafted by the past caretaker government, was 'Moving Forward'. The Awami League government's new PRSP-II titled 'Steps Toward Change' has given top priority to development of human resources and infrastructure. Khandaker said the sustainability of the paper would depend on promotion of public-private partnership by determining their respective roles. The PRSP has earmarked highest allocation of Tk 579.34 billion for education, training and research, Tk 529.94 billion for power, energy and communications, Tk 300.95 billion for governance and public service, Tk 149.28 for agriculture, and Tk 144.14 billion for social safety. Muhith said the government would switch to a new Five-Year Plan after expiry of the second PRSP in June next year. The previous BNP-Jamaat government had introduced the PRSP in place of the Five-Year Plan after expiry of the fifth plan period (1997-2002) at the suggestion of the donors. The first PRSP was implemented during 2005-08 period. The last caretaker government approved the second paper on Oct 23, 2008. The revised PRSP-II said the deficit of funds, which will stand around $2.17 billion or Tk 152 billion a year, would be met from increased internal resources. It was placed before parliament on Sept 15 last year after the cabinet approved the PRSP on Sept 9. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) endorsed it in December.
