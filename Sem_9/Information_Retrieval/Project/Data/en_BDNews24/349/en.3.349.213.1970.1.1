<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the Election Commission not to declare schedule for the upcoming Dhaka City Corporation polls until Feb 23. The EC is supposed to declare the DCC polls schedule this week. The bench comprising justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin gave the order on Monday upon a petition regarding demarcation of wards. The court also asked the government and the commission to explain by Feb 23 why the wards should not be demarcated according to population. It set the next hearing on that day. Today's hearing was conducted by Election Commission lawyer Shahdin Malik. On the other hand, Amir Ul Islam represented the petitioner Sazzad Hossain, a resident of Pallabi area. The petition asking HC decision on demarcation of wards according to population was filed on Feb 7 by Sazzad Hossain. The EC was preparing to hold the elections next month. Election commissioner Sohul Hossain told journalists on Sunday that the schedule will be declared this week. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said on Monday that they would appeal against the HC ruling. "We will go to the court about the matter," he told reporters at the EC Secretariat. Hussain also urged the voters not to go to court with any further petition so that the polls of the expired DCC is not delayed again and can be held as scheduled next month. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda earlier said that since delimitation is a complicated task it will take a long time to resolve the matter. He believed that ensuring citizens' franchise is more important than demarcation. The CEC also said the commission would try to convince the court. bdne
