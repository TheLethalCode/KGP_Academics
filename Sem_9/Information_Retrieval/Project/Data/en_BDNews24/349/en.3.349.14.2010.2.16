<TEXT>
 Netrokona, Feb (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday formally launched distribution of agricultural cards aimed at ensuring that farmers do not face any hassle in obtaining subsidies and assistance from now on. Addressing a farmers' gathering at Balikandi village under Atpara upazila in Netrokona, she announced that 18.2 million (18 crore) farmers would get the cards, which would enable them to receive subsidies and other assistance "directly from the government." She said: "Introduction of the cards has opened up a new horizon to the farmer." With the cards, the farmers can open bank accounts with an initial deposit of Tk 10 to receive the subsidies, the prime minister said. She said bringing small and marginal farmers under banking service coverage would deliver a positive change to the rural economy. Terming her government as 'agriculture-friendly', she said "we've taken various measures for the benefit of the farmer". The measures have contributed to the raising of crop production, she said. Hasina said her government has cut down diesel price by Tk 2 a litre, allocated Tk 5 billion in the 2009-10 budget for distribution among share-croppers as soft loan, and expanded coverage of agriculture loans. Admitting the shortage in power supply, the prime minister said her government was trying to raise electricity production despite the fact that it requires more time. The government took initiative to give the farmers special cards amid allegations that subsidies and other assistance offered by the government do not always reach the farmers due to middlemen's intervention. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury, lawmaker Manjur Quader Koraishi, agriculture secretary CQK Mustaq and Agriculture Extension director general Md Sayeed Ali also addressed the gathering. bd
