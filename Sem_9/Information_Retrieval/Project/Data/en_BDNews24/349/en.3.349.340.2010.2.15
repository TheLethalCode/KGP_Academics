<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday quashed corruption convictions against two sons of Awami League MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. A special court sentenced Jalal Alamgir and Joy Alamgir to three years in jail on Nov 5, 2008, for failing to submit wealth statements to the Anticorruption Commission. A High Court bench comprising justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Borhanuddin scrapped the convictions of the trial court upon a petition by the convicts' father, a ruling party MP. The High Court said that the ACC issued notices to Jalal and Joy without following due legal process. It also said that the accused were living in the US at the time and hence did not receive the ACC notices for submission of wealth statements. The special court had shown Joy and Jalal as fugitive despite their family's insistence that they had been residing in the States for a long time prior to the ACC notices. Asked whether the antigraft commission will appeal against the High Court judgment, a lawyer for the ACC told reporters: "If ACC authorities want, I'll appeal. But if we do not appeal, it'll set a bad example and everybody will rush to the get their convictions overturned." bd
