 NEW YORK, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Going through a divorce or separated? Be careful what you write on social networking sites. A poll of matrimonial lawyers in the United States showed there has been an increase in divorce evidence from websites such as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter. Some 81 percent of the 1,600 members of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML), who handle divorces, prenuptial agreements, legal separations, custody battles, annulments and property division, said they have seen a rise in the last five years in the number of cases using evidence from the Internet.

"I'm amazed how people do not think about what they post on Facebook while they are in a divorce case," Altshuler added in an interview. In another case, the testimony of a man, who said he was a reformed alcoholic, was cross-examined after a Facebook photo showed him drinking at an office party. "Judges will forgive human failings, but they won't forgive lying," Altshuler explained. In addition to being aware of what they post, he advised people going through a divorce to consider who their friends are on social networking sites.
