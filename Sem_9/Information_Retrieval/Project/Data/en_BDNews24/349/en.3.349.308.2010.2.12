"It is very pleasing to see that bilateral trade between the two countries has grown to almost $600 million in a short period of time," Abdullah Gul told reporters Friday at a press briefing at Bangabhaban. "This figure can go to $1 billion, even more than that, which will be very beneficial for both "the countries", Abdullah said after a meeting with President Md Zillur Rahman. The Turkish president arrived in Bangladesh on Friday on a two-day official visit. "We also support each other in the international platform and extend cooperation in military field, as well as cultural arena," said Abdullah, speaking in Turkish. The Turkish president said Ankara wanted to maintain good political, military and international relations with Dhaka.
