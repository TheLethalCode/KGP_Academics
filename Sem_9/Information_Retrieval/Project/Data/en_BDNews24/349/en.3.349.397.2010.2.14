 Rajshahi, Feb 13(bdnews24.com)Police arrested at least 63 more Islami Chhatra Shibir members from six districts on Sunday, in line with the government's directive earlier in the week for a combing operation against the pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student front. The home ministry last Thursday ordered concerned agencies to comb out Shibir from campuses across the country after the killing of a Chhatra League activist, Faruque Hossain, at Rajshahi University. The operation has also resulted in arrests of Jamaat leaders in several districts. Police rounded up 24 Shibir suspects at Chittagong University for assaulting police and "suspicion of plotting violence". Amena Begum, additional superintendent of police of the district, said the Shibir leaders and activists were arrested under Section 54, which allows arrest on "suspicion of criminal intent". In Rajshahi, another 12 Shibir suspects were arrested in the early hours. Naogaon police arrested two Shibir workers, students of Naogaon Government College, for suspected involvement in the killing of Faruque at Rajshahi University. A Bogra report said police arrested 7 Shibir workers early hours Saturday from the town's Zohurul Nagar area. In Gaibandha, a police drive netted 11 Shibir suspects. Of them, four were arrested from Palashbari upazila and seven from the Sadar upazila. In Jessore, Kotwali police arrested seven Shibir workers with four "bombs". They were arrested from Chitramore. Police said they were armed explosive devices and sticks.
