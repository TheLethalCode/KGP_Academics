 LOS ANGELES, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Move aside Madonna and watch out Barry White. The winner of the sexiest song of all time is -- Olivia Newton-John with "Physical," according to music publication Billboard. Billboard has come up with a list of the 50 most popular songs about sex in time for Valentine's Day with each song given points according to its performance on the Billboard hot 100 chart from August 1958 until January this year. "Physical," released by Newton-John in 1981, topped the list after spending 10 weeks as No. 1 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. And while it certainly speaks to sex with lyrics such as "There's nothin' left to talk about, unless it's horizontally," the song became known as well-known as a track for aerobics classes in line with the singer's exercise-themed video. Second in the list came Rod Stewart's 1976 song "Tonight's the Night," followed by Boyz II Men's 1994 ballad "I'll Make Love To You." "Some songs are steamy slow-jams, some are hi-octane arena-rockers, but what they all have in common (and what got them on this list) is that the subject matter of each song is directly related to sex, in some way," Billboard said in a statement. Other highlights include Rod Stewart, who made the top 10 twice with "Tonight's the Night" and "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy," and Marvin Gaye hit No. 5 with the classic "Let's Get It On." Following is a list of the top 10 of the top 50 sexiest songs: 1. "Physical" - Olivia Newton-John 2. "Tonight's The Night" - Rod Stewart 3. "I'll Make Love To You" - Boyz II Men 4.
