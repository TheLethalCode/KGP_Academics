<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)The opposition staged a second walkout in the last hour of Monday's parliamentary proceedings as a ruling party MP termed the late president Gen Ziaur Rahman "killer". The BNP-led opposition walked out of parliament at the beginning of the day's business since speaker Abdul Hamid did not allow Moudud Ahmed to speak on the cabinet's decision to change the name of Zia International Airport. The opposition MPs later in the proceedings began shouting as Awami League MP Nazrul Islam Babu branded Gen Zia, BNP's de facto founder, a "killer" in his speech on the president's parliamentary address. They protested Babu's comment and demanded that the speaker expunge the unparliamentary words from the proceedings. "I have already given a ruling that any unparliamentary words used by anyone will automatically be expunged from the proceedings," speaker Abdul Hamid said. "I cannot muzzle him in the middle of his speech," said Hamid amid the shouting of the BNP MPs. The opposition MPs ignored the speaker's assurance and walked out on the proceedings at around 7.45 pm. Babu was the last MP to discuss the president's address. The speaker adjourned Monday's business after the speech. Previously, another ruling party MP, Dr Anwar Hossain, in his speech on the president's parliamentary address, demanded that Gen Zia should be tried posthumously for killing freedom fighters and soldiers. Parliament will resume at 3.00 pm Tuesday.
