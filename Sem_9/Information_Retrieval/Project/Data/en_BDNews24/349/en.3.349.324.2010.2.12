 Dhaka, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP vice-chairman Hafizuddin Ahmed on Friday demanded holding of by-election in the just vacated Bhola-3 constituency among the 'three valid candidates' who contested the December 2008 election. His claim came after speaker Abdul Hamid on Wednesday declared the seat of Awami League MP Mohammad Jashimuddin void following a gazette notification from the Election Commission. The Supreme Court earlier upheld a Feb 26 High Court ruling that declared Jashim's nomination as unlawful following a petition by Hafiz, claiming that Jashim contested the polls violating a restriction that barred a retired army officer to run in the election before expiration of a term. "We, four aspirants, contested the December 2008 election. I want the by-election to be held among the three valid candidates," he told reporters at his Banani residence. Hafiz urged the Election Commission to "play a neutral and strong role" to hold the by-election successfully. Bangladesh electoral law stipulates that none can contest the polls within three years from the date of retirement and within five years after forced retirement from any public office. Jashimuddin was forced to retire from the army on Aug 31, 2006, and contested the general election in December 2008. He won the poll bagging around 12,000 more votes than that of Hafiz, prompting him to challenge validity of his candidature in the High Court. Law provides for holding of by-election within 90 days of vacation of any parliame
