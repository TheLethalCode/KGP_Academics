 Chittagong, Feb 12(bdnews24.com)  Police filed cases against 1585 activists of Jamaat-Shibir for assault on police, setting off cocktails and involvement in sabotage. A total of 85 activists of the fundamentalist party Jamaat-e-Islami, also a major ally of the main opposition BNP, and Jamaat's student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, including Chittagong city Jamaat nayeb-e-amir Ahsanullah, city's Pahartali unit president Abdul Hannan and Jamaat's workers wing Sramik Kalyan Fedaration leader Lutfor Rahman were shown arrested in the case. The rest of the accused were not named. Police arrested 90 Shibir men on Friday as Shibir brought out a procession in the port city claiming that the slain Chittagong University student Mohiuddin was their member. Sub-inspector of Kotwali police station Jahirul Anwar told bdnews24.com that sub-inspector Ruhul Amin filed cases under sections 147, 148, 149, 427, 332 and 353. Jahir said, primarily 90 men were arrested but later five pedestrians were released. The arrestees are detained in different police stations of the city and they would be sent to the court on Saturday, he said Some 500 Shibir activists led by former Jamaat MP Shahjahan Chowdhury crowded into Chittagong Medical College Hospital morgue to receive the body of Mohiuddin around 11.00am. They staged a demonstration as the hospital authority refused to hand over the body. As the demonstration proceeded towards Jamal Khan intersection, it was intercepted by the police triggering a clash. At least 10 policemen including assistant commissioner of the special branch, Jahangir Alam, and Kotwali police chief Mohiuddin Mahmud were hurt. Shibir's claim rejected Fazlul Kader, father of the slain CU student Mohiuddin told bdnews24.com: "We are supporters of Awami League and none of us is involved in the politics of Jamaat-Shibir." "My son never engaged with Shibir politics and I do not want anyone to make political gains out of the death of my son," he said. "I was sacked from my job in 2002 during the tenure of BNP-Jamaat alliance government and I was reinstated to my service after winning a legal battle in the High Court," he said. Fazlul Kader filed a case with the Railway police (GRP) accusing 6-7 unnamed assailants on Thursday night. Abdullah Al-Mamun, younger brother of Mohiuddin said, "My brother was not a supporter of Shibir." Proctor of the residential hall to which Mohiuddin was attached told bdnews24.com that Mohiuddin was a simple soul from a poor family and was never seen in active politics. The body of Mohiuddin was sent to his village home for burial after after autopsy at CMCH morgue around midnight on Friday. bdnews2
