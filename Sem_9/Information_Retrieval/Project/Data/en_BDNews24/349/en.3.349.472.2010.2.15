 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Protest groups have accused developed nations of trying to "bypass" climate fund pledges made at Copenhagen last December, as the government sat with international donors in Dhaka on Monday at the start of the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum. Rich countries pledged adaptation and mitigation funds of $10 billion in 2010, $30 billion a year for the 2010-12 period and set a goal of $100 billion a year by 2020 in a non-binding deal agreed in Copenhagen. Equity BD, a network of 19 rights groups, formed a human chain at the National Press Club protesting the "Move to Bypass Climate Pledges" and demanding disbursement of the funds committed at the UN-sponsored conference. In a statement, the umbrella group said: "Developed nations are pledge-bound to offer financial and technical assistance to developing nations under Article Four of the United Nations Fund for Climate Change (UNFCC)." "Developed countries, specifically those of the G20, are also plotting to divert money from the UN Fund for Millennium Development Goals to deliver their climate fund pledges. This would obviously force developing nations to cut funding in education, health and poverty reduction," said the statement. The statement termed the Bangladesh Development Forum, being held in Dhaka after a hiatus of four and a half years, the "Debt Development Forum". A different group of activists also spoke out against the role of foreign lending agencies and development partners on the eve of the forum. Speakers at a discussion in the city on Monday said development assistance actually encroaches upon the national policy sovereignty by imposing restrictions on the government, the speakers demanded that the government should reject all foreign loans pegged with conditions. Criticising the secretive manner of holding this meeting, the speakers also said that sessions were not open to the civil society members, non-governmental organisations or the media. The seminar was organised by Voice, a non-governmental organisation. Ahmed Swapan Mahmud, executive director of the NGO, said loans and credit from the international financial institutions only made the people more indebted. bd
