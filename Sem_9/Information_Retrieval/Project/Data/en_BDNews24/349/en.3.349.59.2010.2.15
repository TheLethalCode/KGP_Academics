 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com) BNP has demanded a probe after the recovery of two suspect packages, thought to be crude explosive devices or 'cocktails' , in front of party chief Khaleda Zia's Gulshan political office on Monday. Police recovered the suspicious items wrapped in red scotch tape some 200 yards from the opposition leader's office after a gatekeeper had alerted them in the morning. "The law and order situation has seriously deteriorated," opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque said after a BNP parliamentary party meeting. "We want a proper investigation into the incident," he told a press conference at parliament's media centre. Farroque also demanded tightened security for Khaleda. "We earlier requested proper security for the opposition leader, but no step was taken." He said only 12 policemen are currently deployed for Khaleda's protection. "But there were 154 members from police and intelligence agencies for the opposition leader (Sheikh Hasina) during the BNP-led four party government," Farroque said. The parliamentary party meeting also criticised the government move to rename Zia International Airport, named after BNP founder and late president Ziaur Rahman. The cabinet in its weekly meeting on Monday decided to change the name of the airport to Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. "We will launch a mass movement if the cabinet has taken any such decision," Faroque said. b
