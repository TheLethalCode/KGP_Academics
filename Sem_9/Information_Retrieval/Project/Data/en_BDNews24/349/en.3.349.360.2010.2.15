 KOLKATA, India, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa were bowled out for 296 in their first innings on the second morning of the second and final test against India at the Eden Gardens on Monday. South Africa's last wicket pair of Morne Morkel (11 not out) and Wayne Parnell (12) put on another 30 runs in four overs before left-arm pacer Zaheer Khan struck after the tourists resumed on 266-9. Zaheer dismissed Parnell lbw with the new ball to finish with four for 90 after triggering a stunning collapse on the opening day in which the tourists lost seven wickets in the final session. Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh finished with three for 64 after playing a key role in India's fightback after debutant Alviro Petersen (100) and in-form Hashim Amla (114) hit centuries to give South Africa a solid start. India must square the series to hold on to the number one ranking. The tourists are bidding for their first test series victory in India in almost a decade after taking a 1-0 lead in the two-match series with an innings win in Nagp
