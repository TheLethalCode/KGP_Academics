 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)The proposed industrial policy, to be placed before senior ministers Thursday, aims to provide incentives and tax breaks to local businesses and ultimately reduce dependence on imports. The policy is tailored to make sure that there's no discrimination between public and private enterprises, industries minister Dilip Barua said. At the same time, it will put emphasis on export-oriented industries and encourage public private partnership (PPP), the policy draft says. Industries minister Dilip Barua on Wednesday told bdnews24.com that the government is eager to develop the local industrial base, a key target of the proposed policy. "I hope it will increase investments," he said in a phone interview, adding, "if we can provide a better environment with increased facilities, our economic growth will be significant." The proposed Industrial Policy-2009 will be discussed in the cabinet committee on economic affairs on Thursday. Agriculture- and labour-intensive industries will be prioritised where the government will play a facilitator's role to encourage entrepreneurs, the draft policy says. It will also help pave the way towards formulating a small and medium enterprise policy by this year, which will continue the pace of development of the rural communities. The plan also offers support to women entrepreneurs who will get special preference for SME loans. The government will establish special economic zoneshi-tech parks and private EPZsin the least developed regions of the country. The policy will also make way for separate wage boards for different industries in line with the Bangladesh Labour Law-2006. The ministry will work with the National Productivity Organisation to make local labour cheaper in real terms. The policy envisages a stronger Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute with more skilled manpower and enhanced technical capability.
