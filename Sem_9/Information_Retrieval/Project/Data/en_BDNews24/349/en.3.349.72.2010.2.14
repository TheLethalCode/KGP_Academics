<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen has said dropout rates at primary and secondary levels in Bangladesh can only be curbed by raising current educational standards and providing more organisational facilities. He also stressed the need for cross sector and multi-discipline efforts involving government and non-government agencies to address the problems in education and health, at a press conference following inauguration on Saturday of a two-day dialogue at the BRAC Centre Inn. The 'Indo-Bangladesh dialogue on Health and Education: Learning from Neighbours' has been organised jointly by BRAC, Centre for Policy Dialogue and Pratichi Trust with assistance of UNICEF. The Nobel laureate advised raising enthusiasm of parents and students for education, and easing parental worries through providing facilities such as free meal at schools to fight drop out rates. He also urged the mass media to play a strong role in disseminating importance of education among the public. Sen also pointed out that the largest problem currently facing South Asia is mother and child mortality rates. He said neglect towards women also affects development of children and ultimately the nation. Economist Rehman Sobhan, political scientist Rownak Jahan and UNICEF's Carel de Rooy were present amongst others at the press conference. b
