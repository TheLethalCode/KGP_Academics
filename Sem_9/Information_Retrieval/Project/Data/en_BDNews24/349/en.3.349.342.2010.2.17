Machu Picchu, which was built in the mid-15th century and lies some 680 miles (1,100 km) southeast of Lima, is a World Heritage Site. About a million people a year visit the ruins, which lie 7,874 feet (2,400 metres) above sea-level. Ferrocarril Transandino, the company in charge of operating the railway, said repairs were moving forward. The company is a unit of Orient-Express Hotels, whose shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose some 2.4 percent on Tuesday to close near $11.55.
