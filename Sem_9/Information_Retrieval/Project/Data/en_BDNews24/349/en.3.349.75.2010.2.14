<TEXT>
 Narayanganj, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the first of two 120MW units of a new power plant in Siddhirganj on Sunday. She formally commissioned the commercial production at the plant at 12:10pm. The 240 MW power plant, when both the units eventually operate at full capacity, would meet the entire electricity demand of Mymensingh Zone, besides contributing power to the national grid. But project director Rahmat Ullah Ahmed on Saturday expressed his concern at long-standing gas crisis which, he said, could hamper the prospect of capacity utilization of the new plant. Test run of the first unit had stalled due to shortage in gas supply. The country is passing through an acute power shortage, crippling the economy as well as causing untold miseries to consumers, while more than 50 percent of the population still lack access to electricity. This is the first power plant to be inaugurated by Hasina after her government took office in January 2009 with a pledge to solve the electricity crisis. The funding arrangement, tender and contract for the plant were completed by previous governments. But the gas shortage was not addressed. The Tk 1,133 crore contract went to Bharat Heavy Electronics Limited for engineering, procurement and construction of the plant. The project has been implemented by the Electricity Generation Company of Bangladesh, a newly created state entity under the Power Development Board. Asian Development Bank has contributed to the tune of Tk 769.048 crore ($109.86 million) for the project. The Siddhirganj plant was originally expected to generate power during the peak hours only, about eight hours daily, when the demand is highest. Bangladesh's 40-plus power plants have a total production capacity of 5,450MW, but gas crisis is currently curbing around 1,000MW of production, according to PDB. The PDB recorded a maximum power generation of 3,765MW against a peak hour demand of 4,650MW last week. The shortfall was partly managed through 'load shedding'. bd
