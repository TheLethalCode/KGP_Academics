 Rangamati, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  A special court in Rangamati will hand down the first verdict in a BDR mutiny trial on May 2. The Special Court 4, at the 12th Rifles Battalion headquarters, set the date Tuesday for the verdict against nine border guards of battalion. The nine stand accused of rebellion in solidarity with the bloody mutiny at Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in the capital a year ago. The Peelkhana mutineers killed more than 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, during the events of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. On Nov 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try some 3,500 border guards accused in some 40 cases around the country. The first of the BDR mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against the nine border guards of 12th Rifles Battalion. The Rangamati court is also trying 75 border guards in a separate trial. The 75 are accused in three separate incidents of rebellion last February in Longdu, Baghaichharhi and Barkal Upazilas of Rangamati district. Mutiny trials are also being held in Feni, Satkhira and Thakurgaon among other districts. In the event of a guilty verdict in the trials, the maximum penalty for rebellion is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson under BDR law. The killings at Peelkhana will be tried separately under civil law. bdn
