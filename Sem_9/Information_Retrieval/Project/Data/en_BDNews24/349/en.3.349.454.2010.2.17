 Gazipur, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  A BDR member, who was arrested after the mutiny last year, has died at Kashimpur Jail in Gazipur Tuesday night. Nayek subedar Golam Mostafa, 47, belonged to the Battalion 5 and was a member of the sports team at the BDR headquarters. He was from Baisha village under Jhikorgachha thana of Jessore. He was arrested in the wake of the mutiny and was sent to Dhaka central jail in April. He was later transferred to Kashimpur jail on June 26. He was found unconscious at ward 17 at building 2 of the jail. He was pronounced dead after he was taken to hospital, Md Forman Ali, jailor of Kashimpur jail, told bdnews24.com. Mostafa was already dead when he was brought to the hospital, said Tapan Kanti Sarkar, the on-duty doctor at Gazipur Sadar Hospital. Asked about the cause of his death he said, "Nothing can be said before postmortem." "Mostafa went to sleep after Esha prayer Tuesday night like every other day. Every morning he used to get up at 3 am and wake up other prisoners for Fazr prayer. But when he did not get up at 3:20 am prisoner Kana Ronny who was guarding the ward went to wake him up. When he could not wake Mostafa up he informed other prisoners," said Ali. His body will be handed over to the relatives after the post mortem. Seventy-three men and women, including fifty army officers, were killed during the mutiny at Pilkhana BDR headquarters in February last year. The authorities have charged over three thousand BDR men for their alleged involvement in the mutiny. Human rights organisations including Amnesty International have alleged that detained BDR members are being tortured. Previously, some BDR members died in custody. bd
