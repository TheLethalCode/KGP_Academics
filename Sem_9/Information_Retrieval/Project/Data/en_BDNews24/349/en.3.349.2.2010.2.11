 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Hobiganj court on Thursday ordered former home state minister Lutfozzaman Babar into remand for six days for interrogation in connection with the Shah AMS Kibria murder case. Chief judicial magistrate Rajeeb Kumar Biswas granted the remand prayer by CID's Rafiqul Islam, investigation officer of the case. Babar was taken to Hobiganj district jail from Dhaka Central Jail on Wednesday and produced before the court Thursday amid tight security. Earlier in the day, the High Court ordered the police not to torture Babar during his remand in custody. The bench of justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and justice Md Rais Uddin gave the order following a petition by Babar's wife. The court in its order asked the police to strictly follow a directive on remand issued by justice Hamidul Haque in 2003. Babar was remanded Thursday for quizzing over his alleged involvement in the 2005murder of Kibria, a sitting AL MP at the time and former finance minister. During the hearing at the High Court, attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued for the state while Rafique-ul-Huq and Mahbub Uddin Khokan represented Babar. Babar was shown arrested in the case on Feb 2, following an order by a judicial magistrate in Habiganj upon an appeal by criminal investigation department. Public prosecutor Akbar Hossain Jitu earlier said that Babar had 'confessed' his connection with the killing of Kibria, while being interrogated in the August 21 grenade attack case. CID police super Rafiqul Islam, who is the investigation officer, asked for a ten-day remand for further questioning. Babar, currently serving a sentence of 17 years, is behind bars in an arms case. Babar has already been shown arrested in connection with August 21, 2004 grenade attack on an Awami League rally when he was state minister. The CID police interrogated Babar and two other suspects last month for allegedly suppressing the grenade attack case of 2005 in Habiganj that killed Kibria and four others. bdnews24.
