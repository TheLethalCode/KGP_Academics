<TITLE> France's Sarkozy faces regional election wipeout </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French parties have started serious campaigning for regional elections in March that the opposition Socialists hope will allow them to land a significant blow on President Nicolas Sarkozy. The Socialists already control 20 of the 22 mainland regions and party leader Martine Aubry is hoping for a clean sweep at the two round elections on March 14 and 21 that will create a platform for a challenge to Sarkozy in two years' time. "What is really at issue is that this is the last vote before the 2012 presidential election," said Elisabeth Dupoirier, a specialist in regional politics at the Sciences Po institute in Paris. Aubry has quietly restored some semblance of order to the chronically divided Socialist camp since taking over last year and the left has taken renewed heart from problems that have been building up for Sarkozy over the past few months. The president has been hit by issues ranging from the dire state of public finance to internal party quarrels and a controversial debate on national identity, raising the once unthinkable possibility that he could lose in 2012. The ruling centre-right UMP party has attacked the Socialists' "arrogance" in hoping for the regional "grand slam" but the government, aware of its low approval ratings, has been careful to play down the likely impact on national politics. With a raft of reforms planned this year from pensions to the justice system, Sarkozy was originally hoping the elections would be a chance to build support for his policies, but Prime Minister Francois Fillon sounded a different note this month. "French people will choose who should run their regions for the next five or six years so we should talk about the regions and not try to interpret things in a way they weren't meant," he told the Nice Matin daily. REGIONAL REFORMS Regional governments, responsible for issues like transport, promoting the local economy and maintaining school buildings, have little financial autonomy in the highly centralised French system and normally attract scant interest from Paris. That tends to fuel local resentment, which added to the timetable of local polls between national elections, has often favoured opposition parties, as it did at the last regional poll in 2004 when the Socialists surged in on a "pink tide". A repeat this time could be the trigger for a cabinet reshuffle although Fillon at least is widely expected to be safe whatever the result. But Sarkozy has ordered his ministers to the campaign trail and eight of them are trying to become regional presidents, a post they can hold at the same time as their national portfolio. France has 26 regions (including four in the overseas territories) as well as 100 "departments" and 36,682 municipalities and plans to reduce the number of separate levels has aroused strong opposition from local politicians. A row over an associated measure scrapping an unpopular business tax that funded a large slice of local spending has not made the UMP's task any easier either. Such issues could play a role in the campaign and many voters declare that they will make their minds up based on local issues but a big loss could prompt Sarkozy to move more cautiously on some of his big reforms. According to a poll by the BVA institute, 65 percent of voters intend to vote on local issues but the same survey showed that 80 percent wanted the government to take account of the results of the vote in setting national pol
