 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has granted former BNP MP Nasiruddin Pintu three months' interim bail in the BDR mutiny case. The bench of justices Sheikh Rezowan Ali and Syed Abu Kowser Md Dabirush-shan also asked the government to explain in two weeks why Pintu should not be given permanent bail. Pintu faces charges of inciting border guards to mutiny, leading a procession in support of the mutiny during the February 2009 massacre and helping mutineers to flee the scene. The mutineers killed 73 people including 57 army officers deputed to the border force during the Feb 25-26 at the BDR's Peelkhana headquarters last year. A case was filed with Lalbagh Police Station on Feb 28 in connection. The case was later transferred to New Market Police Station. The BNP leader was arrested on June 2 in connection with the case. Mahbub Hossain represented Pintu in the bail hearing, additional attorney general AKM Zahirul Haque represented the state. b
