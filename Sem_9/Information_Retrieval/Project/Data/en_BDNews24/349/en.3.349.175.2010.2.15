 ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani on Sunday played down the threat of political instability arising from a dispute between the president and Supreme Court over the appointment of judges. Despite Gilani's comments, the row is likely to become a distraction for a government struggling to fight Islamist militants and to get a sluggish economy on track. On Saturday, the Supreme Court blocked a presidential order appointing two judges, one to the Supreme Court and the other as chief justice of the high court in the city of Lahore. "There is no threat to democracy. There is no threat to the country nor to any institution," Gilani told reporters. Pakistan has a history of disputes between the executive and the judiciary sparking instability, and, in at least one case, bringing down a government in the 1990s. A confrontation between the Supreme Court and former president Pervez Musharraf in 2007 undermined Musharraf's authority. He stepped down months after his allies were defeated in a February 2008 election. The United States, struggling to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan, will be dismayed if a political storm distracts its ally from battling militants along its border with Afghanistan. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, husband of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, has failed to match his wife's popularity but a ruling coalition led by his party has a comfortable majority in parliament. Hours after Zardari made his court appointments, a Supreme Court panel said the order had been suspended as Zardari had apparently violated the constitution by not consulting Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry. "THREAT TO DEMOCRACY" The Dawn newspaper said the country was facing a "highly arcane and technical dispute over constitutional prerogatives. (The dispute) nevertheless carries the potential for having seriously destabilising effects. "Historically, clashes between these two institutions have led to disastrous consequences for democracy and constitutional continuity," it said in an editorial. Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif, who has been largely supportive of the government, denounced the president as "the biggest threat to democracy". "We'll stop him and we call upon the government to withdraw this decision," Sharif told a news conference, referring to the president's appointments. Sharif did not say what he might do but analysts do not expect him to launch anti-government street protests. Two months ago, the Supreme Court threw out an amnesty that had protected Zardari, top aides and thousands of political activists and civil servants, mostly from corruption charges. The move sparked an uproar and raised questions about Zardari's future, even though he is protected from prosecution by presidential immunity. The Supreme Court, in blocking Zardari's appointments late on Saturday, said according to the constitution, the president must make Supreme Court appointments after consultation with the chief justice. Its next hearing will be on Feb. 18. Zardari's spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said the chief justice had been consult
