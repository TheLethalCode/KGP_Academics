 COLOMBO, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defeated Sri Lankan presidential candidate General Sarath Fonseka, now in military custody, has filed a petition against what he alleges is vote rigging in last month's poll, his lawyers and opposition figures said on Tuesday.

Analysts attribute the fall to growing political uncertainty and concerns over the standoff between the government and the opposition. On Friday, the Supreme Court admitted a petition filed by Fonseka's wife on grounds that his detention in military custody was illegal.
