 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Zia International Airport has been renamed Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport. The decision was made in a weekly cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Monday, Abul Kalam Azad, the PM's press secretary, said. The new name of the airport will be effective from Feb 15 (Monday), Azad said. Dhaka's international airport started its journey with a 10,000-foot runway and three taxi ways. In 1983, it was named after late president Ziaur Rahman, also founder of BNP, the party in opposition right now. The press secretary also said the cabinet decided to restore the names of more than 50 establishments across the countries that have been changed during the previous BNP-led administration. The cabinet also decided in the meeting to rename the Ziaur Rahman University as Barisal University. BNP has already announced it will go into movement if the name of the airport is changed. bdnews2
