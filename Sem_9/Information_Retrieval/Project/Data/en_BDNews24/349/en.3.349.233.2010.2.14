<TITLE> 'Drive against violence' to continue: Sahara </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun has said the drive against violence, which has involved rounding up Jamaat and Shibir leaders across the country, would continue until the killers of a Rajshahi University student are arrested. She rejected a demand by the opposition for her resignation. The home ministry last week ordered the law enforcers to "comb out" Jamaat-Shibir members after the killing of a RU student who was a pro-ruling party Chhatra League activist. Hundreds of leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir have been arrested across the country in the last week. "The recent killings have been carried out to create unrest in country," Sahara said on Sunday at a function marking the founding anniversary of Bangladesh Coastguard in the capital's Agargaon. The opposition have been demanding the home minister's resignation for the deterioration of law and order, including campus violence and a recent spate of student deaths in clashes among pro-opposition and pro-ruling party student fronts Shibir, Chhatra Dal and Chhatra League. Rejecting the demand, Sahara said the law and order situation has been better under the present government than it was under the previous regimes. She urged the opposition to come up with a cooperative attitude instead of a destructive one.
