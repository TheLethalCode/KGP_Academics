 BEIJING, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - This year will be one of "tiger leaps and dragon strides" for relations between mainland China and Taiwan, China's state-backed Xinhua agency said on Sunday, in defense of a charm offensive aimed at the self-ruled island. Economically booming China has wooed Taiwan with promises of better economic ties and a shared Chinese cultural heritage, reserving harsh words for US military support of the self-ruled island, including a recent arms sale deal. China's top leader, Hu Jintao, has made improving relations with Taiwan one of the legacies of his tenure.

"We will try our best in everything that will benefit Taiwan compatriots, and we will honour our words," Hu said, in comments to the Taiwan businessmen carried by state media on Sunday. He pledged to especially keep in mind the interests of Taiwan farmers, who traditionally have fewer ties to mainland China. China threatened sanctions against US firms participating in a $6.4 billion arms sale to Taiwan. While many in Taiwan fear job losses to the mainland, where wages are lower, and are wary about China's political intentions, there is no public debate in mainland China about taking control over Taiwan, by force if necessary.
