 Tanim Ahmed Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and its foreign lenders have agreed to set new benchmarks to measure progress as part of their 'joint pursuit' of the nation's developmental agenda. The so-called Joint Cooperation Strategy, to be finalised in six months, will aim to ensure aid effectiveness, finance minister AMA Muhith said after a two-day talks in Dhaka with officials from donor countries and lending institutions. "They will provide the direction and set the tone for future development work as well as assess how effectively and efficiently the government has been able to use the foreign assistance," the finance minister said. The annual review and policy-setting meeting, dubbed Bangladesh Development Forum, brought together senior government ministers and top representatives from countries that provide grants and agencies such as World Bank and ADB that lend on soft terms. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina led a team of top ministers at the opening session on Monday. In all, six formal sessions discussed a wide range of issues and heard senior ministers such as Matia Chowdhury explain Dhaka's aspirations and perspective. In August 2008, the government and 15 development partners signed a Statement of Intent to develop the Joint Cooperation Strategy. The current government's goals aim to halve the current poverty level of 50 percent by 2013, and reduce hard-core poverty from the current 20 percent to 15 percent. The government also wants to ensure full primary enrolment by 2010 and eliminate illiteracy by 2014. At present, primary enrolment stands at over 80 percent but the rate of illiteracy still stands over 60 percent because of a high rate of primary school dropout. In power production, the government plans to increase it to 7000 MW from about 4000 MW currently by 2013. In another development, the government plans to integrate its recently revised poverty reduction strategy, which will be followed by the country's sixth 5-year plan to be effective from 2011 into the budget process and the annual development programme. Together, the government's annual documents will reflect the same kinds of allocations and emphasis on certain sectors  especially education, health and agriculture  that its long-term documents envision. Muhith said: "This was fully endorsed by the development partners at the forum." Chris Austin, country director of UK's Department for International Development (DFID) and co-chair of the Local Consultative Group, said the development partners had warmly welcomed the government's initiatives. "The development partners will align their external assistance to Bangladesh in line with the government's poverty reduction strategy plan and the Joint Cooperation Strategy." ROUND OF ADMISSIONS The finance minister touched upon a number of issues that had already been discussed on Monday in his summary which included tax collection, implementation of development programmes and the much-hyped Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. Muhith admitted that the government had failed to make substantial progress in most areas. Saying that the funding agencies had stressed upon domestic resource mobilisation and expressed their concern at the low proportion of the government's revenues to its GDP, Muhith said that the government would soon take initiatives to expand the tax net. "I have to admit that we did not achieve as much as we wanted to." He also mentioned the absorption capacity of the government, which is often measured by the implementation rate of development projects, another area of concern from the so-called donors. "One must admit that our implementation rate is not satisfactory." Muhith was clearly in a mood of resignation when he spoke of PPP: "I have said quite enough about it, but nothing much has really come of it." DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS The ministers sought to assure the BDF participants that the government was doing all it could to build and strengthen the institutions to ensure transparency and better governmence. Muhith said that an independent judiciary, a reformed Anti-Corruption Commission were very high on the government a
