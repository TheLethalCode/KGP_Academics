<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Investment and employment are expected to grow significantly in the first quarter of 2010, according to a just-published business confidence survey by Bangladesh Investment Climate Fund. The survey carried out in the last quarter of 2009, published in Dhaka on Saturday, said 60 percent of businesses approached were looking to make investments in the current Jan-Mar period against 52 percent in the previous quarter. The survey showed overall business confidence, on a scale of 1-100 in three areas -- investment, employment and profitability -- rising to 56 from 51 in the previous quarter. The scenario was in line with forecasts, according to the survey report presented at a meeting jointly organised by BICF and International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh (ICC-B) at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI). The BICF, managed by the International Finance Corporation, World Bank's private sector arm, conducts the 'Business Confidence Survey' every quarter. The latest survey covered 1440 businesses in the last quarter of 2009 compared to around 700 businesses surveyed in the previous quarter (Q3 2009). The report predicted better performance by the manufacturing and service sectors  micro, small or large  for the Jan-Mar quarter than that of the previous quarter. It also said businesses in Chittagong, Dhaka, Barisal and Sylhet performed better in the previous quarter. On the scale that rates 50-plus scores as better, 50 as static and 50-minus as worse performance, Chittagong scored 89, a 25-point rise from the previous period. Rajshahi performed the worst even though it scored 65. This because the score was 28-point less than the prediction. The report forecasted that Rajshahi would perform better this quarter. The survey was conducted both in manufacturing and service sectors, consisting sub-sectors like textile, readymade garment, food, leather, pharmaceuticals and light engineering. Services included retail and wholesale firms, financial institutions, hotels, telecom and IT firms. BICF head James Crittle laid emphasis on betterment of regulatory instruments and infrastructure facilities, which will help increase business confidence and boost investment. "Higher confidence will generate more investment and more investment will create more employment that will ultimately contribute to poverty alleviation," he added. Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute CEO MA Taslim said the economy was rising despite global downturn. The findings of the survey are in line with the central bank forecast, he said, adding the survey would also be useful for policymakers. 'GOOD DAYS AHEAD FOR SMEs' Small and Medium Enterprise Foundation chairman Aftab-ul-Islam said investments will rise substantially in the upcoming days as a result of the road-shows conducted by the government in the last quarter of 2009. He said SMEs would be at the forefront of the future economic growth since their numbers are increasing. Currently, there are around six million SMEs, and over 10 million micro and cottage industries, the SME chief added. The businesses surveyed were asked about investments, employment, profitability and overall performance. GAS CRISIS The respondents singled out gas crisis as the number one factor impeding their bussinesses. They also suggested that captive power plants, run on gas, should be given higher priority. Subsidy to diesel may also be beneficial to address the problem, they added. MORE PRIORITIES AND GUIDELINES WANTED DCCI president Abul Kashem Khan said since almost 90 percent of the country's industries are situated in Dhaka and Chittagong, the survey should have covered the two cities more. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters' Association (BKMEA) president Fazlul Huq said the survey results did not say anything about which sectors to be prioritised and left no guideline for the entrepreneurs. ICC president Mahbubur Rahman agreed with the BKMEA chief's contention and said power generation and gas exploration should be the top priorities for the government. Renowned economist professor Wahiduddin Mahmud said the survey results would help promote regulatory reforms and a better business environment in Bangladesh. He added that the expectations would not be met if the constraints, especially the energy crisis, are not removed. Mahmud stressed the need for prioritising agro industries, small and cottage industries and the service sector, which helped the country to come out of the recent economic recession. Board of Investment executive chairman SA Samad said though the Board is mainly responsible for promoting investment, all other stakeholders should also come forward to help boost investment. He said since there is power and gas crisis in the country, more investments should be made in the sectors. He added that the recent road-shows in London, Singapore and New York had drew attention of many investors. b
