 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Nationalist Party questioned speaker Abdul Hamid's impartiality after walking out of parliament Sunday. "The ruling party, even today, used derogatory words about our leader (Ziaur Rahman). And the speaker did not expunge similar statements delivered in the previous sitting of parliament," opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said. "For this reason, we are doubtful of the speaker's neutrality," he said. Farroque was addressing a press briefing at parliament's media centre to explain the opposition's reason for walking out again on Sunday within half an hour of the start of proceedings. The opposition chief whip said they would not go back to parliament on Sunday. "We rejoined parliament to serve the interests of the people and the country. But you (reporters) can see from what perspective we have walked out twice." Farroque said ruling party MPs had started ridiculing BNP's late leader and president Ziaur Rahman and his last resting place, while the speaker did nothing. He also claimed "they (Awami League) killed about 40,000 opposition political activists between 1972 and 1975, now they are calling martyr Zia a killer." The opposition returned to parliament on Feb 11 after a 64-day boycott, presenting a package of demands to ensure the opposition's stay. The demands included rearrangement of opposition seats in the front row, discussion on the opposition's adjournment motions, scrapping the government notice canceling the lease of Khaleda Zia's cantonment house, appointment of deputy speaker from the opposition and four heads of parliamentary standing committees from the opposition. But the opposition walked out some hours later when home minister Sahara Khatun termed Ziaur Rahman a 'killer'. On Sunday, the opposition once again staged a walk out at 3.45pm, half an hour after the day's proceedings began, protesting another derogatory remark about Ziaur Rahman by AL MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Responding to a query at the press briefing, Farroque said the speaker had rejected 69 adjournment motions by the opposition in previous sessions. BNP MPs Mahbubuddin Khokon, Nazrul Islam Manju, Jamaat MP Habibur Rahman and others were also present at the briefing. bdnews2
