<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court asked the government why a probe commission should not be formed to investigate the recent incidents of Rajshahi University. The bench of justice Md Momtazuddin Ahmed and justice Naima Haider gave the order on Thursday. The home secretary, education secretary and inspector general of police have been asked to reply by Feb 22. These officials were also asked to explain why they should not investigate the allegations of RU vice-chancellor's and administration's involvement with the incidents. The ruling came after former law minister Abdul Matin Khasru and Supreme Court lawyer Manzil Morshed placed newspaper reports on Rajshahi University events before the court. A student was killed and scores others were injured during a fierce clash between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir on RU campus in the early hours of Tuesday. There are allegations of negligence in duty against the university administration and law enforcers deployed on campus. Nine policemen have already been suspended on charges of negligence.
