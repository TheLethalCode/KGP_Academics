<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition party BNP staged another walkout of parliament on Monday, their third in a row, though they rejoined proceedings 10 minutes later. The parliamentary session began at 3:18pm with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. BNP MPs walked out 25 minutes into the sitting protesting that Moudud Ahmed MP was not given the floor. On their return, BNP's Syeda Asifa Ashrafi MP spoke on the president's speech. BNP also walked out of the house on Sunday just 30 minutes into proceedings protesting derogatory remarks by a ruling party MP about BNP finder and late president Ziaur Rahman. The opposition returned to the House on Feb 11 ending a 64-day boycott, but walked out towards the end of the session, again protesting "unparliamentary remarks" against Gen Zia. bdnew
