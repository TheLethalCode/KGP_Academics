 BERLIN, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Karan Johar, the director of superstar Shah Rukh Khan's film about post 9/11 intolerance in the United States said on Friday he hopes "My Name is Khan" will reach a wider audience than his previous Bollywood productions. Johar told Reuters the film, about an Indian family in the United States whose happy lives are thrown into turmoil amid a backdrop of growing prejudice sweeping across America against Muslims, would surely appeal to his loyal Bollywood following.

"I was slotted as someone who makes bubble gum, candy floss, feel-good, diaspora-friendly films full of love and glamour and gloss and not really moving the cinematic bar at all. I used to wonder whether I was really capable. "I didn't know how it would turn out. But it was really an endeavour to kind of be out there in the cinematic world and say I can do something that is not within my comfort zone.
