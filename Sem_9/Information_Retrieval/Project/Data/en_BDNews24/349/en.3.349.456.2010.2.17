<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday gave a ruling asking why Proshika's sacked chairman Kazi Faruk Ahmed should not be charged with contempt for purposefully misrepresenting the court's earlier order. The former chairman and two directors, Nargis Jahan and Quazi Khaje Alam, were asked to answer the court's ruling within two weeks. The High Court bench of Justice Shamim Hasnain gave the ruling on Wednesday. Proshika's central coordinator, Shyamol Dey, told journalists that the organisation's current chief executive Mahbubul Karim filed the petition against the trio for misrepresenting the High Court order. He also said, "An earlier High Court order stayed all activities of Proshika's central office and various programmes until a pending case in the lower court is resolved. However, Kazi Faruk misrepresented the order through publishing circulars in various newspapers and attempting to take over the organisation's headquarters." On Jan 24, Appellate Division chamber judge Justice Mozammel Hossain stayed a High Court order on handover of the key of Proshika headquarters to the incumbent governing body based on a petition filed by ousted chairman Kazi Faruque Ahmed. Prior to that, on Jan 19, the High Court ordered police to return the key to the governing body and ruled that Faruque and his supporters could not go near the building until his petition was resolved in court. Police put the Proshika headquarters under lock and key on Jan 12 following clashes between supporters of the former chairman and the incumbent governing body. The governing body removed Faruque from the chairman's office last year following allegations of corruption against him. He has since petitioned the High Court challenging the legality of the decision. Following this move a number of clashes occurred between supporters of the two groups.
