 COLOMBO, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Sri Lankan lawyers staged a silent march in the capital on Friday in a third day of street protests seeking the release of losing presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka. Tensions have risen on the island since the former army commander was arrested on Monday by military police on charges of engaging in politics against his president while still in uniform.

On Friday, the Supreme Court admitted a petition filed by Fonseka's wife on grounds that his detention in military custody was illegal. The court gave the government four weeks to give its reply to the petition. "The court heard both the petitioner's and Attorney General's side and granted leave to proceed," said Chrishmal Warnasuriya, a lawyer who appeared on behalf of Fonseka. The government has not yet detailed what charges the army general will face, but Rajapaksa said earlier he was plotting a coup.
