 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury highlighted the cost of food and water security as the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum kicked off Monday. She was also firm in demanding "no conditionalities" from development partners, reinforcing the finance minister's request for more grants and concessional loans earlier in the day. Matia said just as 'donors' have become 'development partners' so 'aid' should be in the form of 'cooperation and assistance'. Briefing the press at the end of a session, on food security, agriculture and water resources, she said when the funds used to come as charity from donors, the government could not really do much. "But now that we have become partners, cooperating with each other, there should not be any question of conditionalities." The two-day meeting of foreign and international lending agencies that make up the Local Consultative Group with the government of Bangladesh discussed the country's action plan and strategy regarding agriculture and food security in what was the first day's last session. Matia said there was a stress on greater production to ensure food security, which meant enhanced technology and storage, along with new and improved crop varieties. She said it was for research and development in these areas that the country needed foreign cooperation and assistance. "Development of crop new varieties requires substantial time and resources, which a poor country like Bangladesh can hardly afford." Chowdhury also said that the government sought assistance for more environmentally friendly water usage in irrigation. "We have been using up groundwater at random and without thinking about future implications." She said the country needed assistance to develop methods to better use surface water. Abdur Razzaque, the food minister, said the weakness of water management had featured strongly during the session. "There were questions about the water ministry's activities from the foreign agencies." The food minister said another issue that emerged from the floor when discussing food security was population growth and family planning. "Without bringing it under control, we can never achieve food security no matter how much we increase food production." While the country's food production has increased three-fold since its liberation in 1971, a point that was apparently mentioned quite a few times, that growth has largely come with increased use of inputs like better seeds, chemical fertilisers and intensified irrigation, which still remain highly subsidised. It is generally a major point of contention that international financial institutions recommend abolishing subsidies and complete government withdrawal from commercial markets. But the prime minister's economic adviser, Mashiur Rahman, said there had been no objections whatsoever from any quarter about the efficiency and equitability of agricultural subsidies
