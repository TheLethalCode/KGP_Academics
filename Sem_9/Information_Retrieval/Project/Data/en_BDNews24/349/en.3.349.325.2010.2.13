 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)The conditions for economic development of any country depend on political stability and security, the visiting Turkish president said in Dhaka on Saturday. President Abdullah Gul said the responsibilities of political leaders are to guarantee fundamental rights of the citizen in a democratic environment and to foster economic growth so that the people can prosper. "Our only job is to ensure these goals," he said during a meeting with the Bangladeshi business community. Bangladesh and Turkey need to bolster ties through increased trade and investment, Gul told the meeting. He called upon Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to consider investing in Turkey, saying that his country already has invested significantly in Bangladesh's textile sector. "Joint venture initiatives in a third country can be also considered," he said. Organised by the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the meeting was held at the Sonargaon Hotel in a bid to facilitate discussions among the business leaders of the two countries. "The time has now come to transform this friendship into a relation that will bring mutual benefit to the peoples of both countries," the Turkish president said. Gul, who arrived on Friday, is accompanied by a delegation comprised mainly of Turkish businessmen. On the potential of bilateral trade between the countries, Gul reiterated that it can be doubled. "Bilateral trade between the two countries has already grown to almost $600 million, but it can go up to more than a billion." Finance minister AMA Muhith, FBCCI president Annisul Huq and Rifat Hisarciklio lu, president for the Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges of Turkey (TOBB) also spoke in the breakfast meeting. An agreement aimed at enhancing cooperation was signed between the FBCCI and the TOBB.
