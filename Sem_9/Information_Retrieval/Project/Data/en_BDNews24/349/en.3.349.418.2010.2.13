<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Progressive Democratic Party chairman Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi urged the government to work in a planned way to detect and detain the real criminals involved in a recent spate of campus-related killings, and not turn it into a politically motivated drive against its enemies. At a press briefing at the PDP Segunbagicha headquarters, Quarishi also claimed on Saturday that Jamaat-e-Islami members might have infiltrated the ruling Awami League and the government, just days after a senior AL figure claimed the same about the two party's respective student wings. AL general secretary and government minister Syed Ashraful Islam alleged that members of Islami Chhatra Shibir, the pro-Jamaat student wing, had infiltrated top ranks of the pro-ruling party Bangladesh Chhatra League. Ashraf was speaking to newsmen on Feb 9 just hours after the killing of a Chhatra League member at Rajshahi University during BCL-Shibir clashes. Quarishi, speaking on Saturday, said: "If Shibir have made their way into Chhatra League, it is a terrifying situation, for it also evokes suspicion of Jamaat's infiltrating Awami League itself. Who knows whether they have already infiltrated it?" In the wake of the Rajshahi University killing, the home ministry on Feb 11 ordered law enforcing agencies to launch a countrywide "combing operation" for Jamaat-Shibir activists. The ongoing drive has rounded at least 200 Shibir men and some top Jamaat leaders. However, the PDP chairman, indicating the government's drive against the Jamaat-Shibir activists, said the recent murder of the RU student should not be considered from a partisan point of view. Rather, he said, "the true criminals involved in that incident should be found out." "Or else, the situation will turn out to be a serious one," Quarishi said. He also urged the government to bring about a change in the process of appointing vice-chancellors and pro-vice-chancellors of the public universities and said partisan appointments in the administrative posts would not help to eradicate the crises. bdn
