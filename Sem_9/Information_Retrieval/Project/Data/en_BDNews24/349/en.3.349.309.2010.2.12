<TITLE> UK unveils new tech to tackle mobile phone crime </TITLE>

 Syed Nahas Pasha London Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Three new design innovations to tackle mobile phone crime in the UK, including a device that locks a phone and alerts the owner if it is being nabbed, were unveiled Thursday by the British Home Office. There are 75 million mobile phone users in Britain today. Some 228 mobile phones are reported stolen every hour in the UK, according to Home Office figures. Mobile phone identity fraud rose by 74 per cent in the first half of 2009 according to the UK fraud prevention service CIFAS; and Contactless transactions in the UK are predicted to account for 151 billion by 2013. The prototypes were developed by teams of designers and technology experts as part of the Mobile Phone Security Challenge, an initiative from the Home Office Design and Technology Alliance and the UK's Design Council. The aim of the challenge was to protect mobile phone users from crimes such as mobile phone identity fraud, which rose by over 70 per cent in 2009, to make phones more secure and to prevent unauthorised use of mobiles for electronic 'contactless' payments, soon to be become widespread in the UK. The solutions are: i-migo - a small device which the user keeps about their person. The i-migo sounds an alert and locks the handset if it is taken out of a set range - either through theft or loss. The i-migo also provides automated backup of important data using Bluetooth technology; The 'tie' solution - this electronically matches a handset to a SIM card and protects data stored on the handset with a password and encryption. If stolen, the handset cannot be used with another SIM and data such as saved passwords, browsed websites, and contacts cannot be accessed by criminals, who can use it to defraud victims, by hacking into online bank accounts; and TouchSafe - aimed at making "M-Commerce" transactions more secure by using a small card worn or carried by the user, who discreetly touches the phone to the card to enable the transaction. Touch Safe uses the same Near Field Communication (NFC) technology currently used by the Oyster travel card. The three working prototypes will be on display from February 15 - 18 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the mobile industry's annual trade show. The Design and Technology Alliance and the Design Council will be calling for the industry to protect their customers by adopting these innovative security technologies. Home Office Minister Alan Campbell said: "Overall crime has fallen since 1997 but as new technology creates new opportunities for the user it can also provide criminals with opportunities as well. This is where designing out crime can make a real difference and we are leading the way by using technology to protect the public." With the rapid growth in mobile phone usage, and particularly the smart phone, more and more people are carrying sensitive information on their handsets thereby increasing their vulnerability to identity theft, says Joe McGeehan, alliance member, managing director for Toshiba Europe and director for communications research at Bristol University. "It is essential that individuals have the ability to protect themselves against such crime." The technologies were developed in consultation with experts from some of the biggest phone companies and manufacturers. David Kester, Alliance member and chief executive, Design Council:"It's about thinking smarter than criminals. Designers have provided innovations that are one step ahead; new phones are still desirable to consumers but they're useless to criminals if they're equipped with these new concepts." Previous advances in technology have led to unexpected new forms of crime; email heralded the phenomenon of 'phishing', ATMs precipitated the new crime of 'card catching' and online banking gave rise to 'key logging', used by fraudsters to track the input of secret passwords and account numbers.
