 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Thailand has sent back 28 illegal Bangladeshi migrants picked up from Thai waters more than a year ago. A Biman flight carrying the 28 landed at Shahjalal International Airport in the city at around 5.30pm Wednesday. "All of the 28 Bangladeshis have returned. They have started for their respective home districts," Saida Muna Tasneem, foreign ministry director general for external publicity, told bdnews24.com Wednesday evening. She said foreign ministry officials received them at the airport. The International Organisation for Migration provided support for their repatriation, she added. Asif Munier, the IOM's media spokesperson, told bdnews24.com Wednesday one of their officials looked after their return from Thailand. The foreign ministry officials said most of the Bangladeshis were from the greater Chittagong district. Over 200 people, mainly Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, were caught by Thai coast guards more than a year ago from a boat destined for Malaysia or Singapore. The Thai authorities held them in refugee camps and then in Bangkok Detention Centre, where embassy officials interviewed them. Of the total, only 28 people were confirmed as Bangladeshis. A Thai charity organisation provided them food in the Bangkok Detention Centre.
