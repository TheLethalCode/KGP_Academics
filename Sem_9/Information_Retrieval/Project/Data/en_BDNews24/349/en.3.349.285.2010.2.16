 KOLKATA, India, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vangipurappu Laxman crafted an unbeaten 143 on Tuesday to put India in a position to retain the world number one ranking and revive memories of his epic innings in the 2000-1 series against Australia. Laxman shared in an Indian record seventh-wicket stand of 259 with skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (132 not out) which put India in sight of a series-levelling victory in the second and final Test at Eden Gardens. India posted 643 for six declared to take a lead of 347 on the third day after resuming on 342-5. South Africa were six without loss at the close. Laxman hit a magnificent 281 at the same venue to help India script a sensational turnaround after following on to end Australia's 16-match winning streak. "I really feel happy whenever I do well and bail the team out of tough situations," Laxman told reporters after scoring his 15th Test century. South Africa, bidding for their first series victory in India in a decade, had rallied with three late wickets on Monday after centuries by Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag out India in control. "This morning it was crucial because we had lost three quick wickets yesterday evening," said Laxman, who missed the opening Test due to injury. MISSED CHANCES "I thought (nightwatchman) Amit Mishra (28) played really well and he brought the momentum back to our team this morning by some of the attacking shots that he played. "Obviously then the big partnership between me and MS Dhoni took away the game from South Africa." The tourists, 1-0 in the series, delayed the second new ball by fours overs in gloomy morning coditions that allowed Laxman and Mishra settle down. South Africa failed to take at least five chances on the field, two of them off Laxman (23 and 48) as India steadily regained control. "If you don't take your opportunities against a good side, you're going to pay the price," South Africa's batting consultant Kepler Wessels said. "We expected India to come back strongly. They're a very good team under their own conditions. We certainly expected them to put up this sort of fight." South Africa will reclaim the number one ranking if they win the series. "We're in a position where we have to save the game to win the series. There's two days of tough Test cricket ahead and we'll fight as hard as we can," Wessels
