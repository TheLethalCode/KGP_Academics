 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Development Forum, a key meeting between the government and donors, is being held again in Dhaka from Monday after a break of nearly four and half years. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate the two-day programme in the morning at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Topping the government's agenda will be its amended Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-2), which is required by development partners including the World Bank and IMF for considering debt relief. The government unveiled the revised poverty reduction plan, with an enhanced outlay of Tk 2814.81 billion, on the eve of the BDF meet and more than halfway into its three-year period. Finance minister AMA Muhith told journalists on Sunday, "We are hoping that the PRSP-2 will receive endorsement in the forum." The revised PRSP, which will expire in June next year, has raised the expenditure outlay by Tk 246.82 billion to Tk 2814.81 billion from the original. It has a resource deficit of Tk 874.84 billion. It has also targeted 6 percent GDP growth for the current fiscal year, 6.7 percent for next and gives top priority to development of human resources and infrastructure. It has earmarked highest allocation of Tk 579.34 billion for education, training and research, Tk 529.94 billion for power, energy and communications, Tk 300.95 billion for governance and public service, Tk 149.28 for agriculture, and Tk 144.14 billion for social safety. Muhith said the government would switch to a new Five-Year Plan after expiry of the PRSP-2 in June next year. The previous BNP-led government introduced the PRSP-1 in place of the Five-Year Plan after expiry of the fifth 5Y plan period (1997-2002) at the suggestion of donors. The first PRSP was implemented during 2005-08. The last caretaker government approved the PRSP-2 in October, 2008. The revised PRSP-II said the deficit of funds, which will stand around $2.17 billion or Tk 152 billion a year, would be met from increased internal resources. 2-DAY PROGRAMME The BDF is organised chiefly to discuss expenditure methods of Bangladesh's internal resources and funds donated by development partners in various fields. The two-day talks will discuss six themes in separate sessions. They are (i) development strategy, good governance and human development, (ii) energy and power, (iii) agriculture, food security and water resource, (iv) climate change, (v) communication, transport and (vi) 'Digital Bangladesh' and information technology development. The forum is being organised jointly by the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and Local Consultative Group (LCG) These dialogues were held formerly in Paris and were referred to as the Paris Consortium. They transferred to Bangladesh from May 2003. The last Bangladesh Development Forum meeting was held in November 2005. ERD secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan told journalists, "The last BDF meeting was supposed to be held in November 2007, but was cancelled and not held since." b
