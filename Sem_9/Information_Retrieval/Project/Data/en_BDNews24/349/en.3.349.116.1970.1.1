<TITLE> Wounded Tigers switch focus to Test </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will switch their focus to the one-off Test against New Zealand in Seddon Park in Hamilton on Monday. The match starts at 4:00 am Bangladesh time and will be telecast on Super Sport. Shakib Al Hasan's men have not had the best of times in New Zealand having been whitewashed in the three-match one-day series and losing theTwenty20 international tour opener. Meanwhile, the Tigers have already named their playing eleven. Aftab Ahmed, the former ICL rebel, makes his return to the Test fold. He replaces Raqibul Hasan in the middle-order. The tracks in New Zealand have neutralised Bangladesh's primary weapon - spin - forcing the visitors to use a three-pronged pace attack, which has proved less effective, especially with Mashrafe Bin Mortaza absent. The wretched form of key middle-order batsmen, Mohammad Ashraful and Shakib Al Hasan, has been a huge setback for the tourists during their short trip. Meanwhile, the Herald on Sunday newspaper reports a foot injury has stopped fast bowler Andy McKay from making his Test debut. New Zealand team physiotherapist Kate Stalker said the left-armer started experiencing pain in his foot during the recent one-day series against Bangladesh. McKay took five wickets at an average of 21 apiece in the one-day series against Bangladesh which New Zealand won 3-0. "This pain intensified today during training, and a decision was made not to play him in the Test," Stalker added. Brent Arnel will replace McKay in the squad for the Test. Black Caps selector and coach Mark Greatbatch said standing McKay down was a precautionary measure. "It would be unwise to risk aggravating his injury for the sake of a one-off Test match. We want to make sure he is fit again as soon as possible. "We are all disappointed for Andy, but at this stage he needs a chance to rest his foot and recover properly. "He has been doing a lot of extra bowling recently and has been performing well." According to Cricinfo, the batting order, which has had to do without Jesse Ryder and Grant Elliott for months, has also been rearranged and has a raw top order. Tim McIntosh and Bradley-John Watling will open with 31-year-old debutant Peter Ingram at No 3. They have a total experience of 11 Tests between them, with McIntosh accounting for ten. The solidity for New Zealand, lies in the middle - Taylor, Guptill, Vettori and McCullum - and Bangladesh's best chance will be to put them under pressure early. Teams: Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Aftab Ahmed, Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah, Shahadat Hossain, Shafiul Islam, Rubel Hossain. New Zealand (probable): Tim McIntosh, BJ Watling, Peter Ingram, Ross Taylor, Martin Guptill, Daniel Vettori (capt), Brendon McCullum (wk), Tim Southee, Daryl Tuffey, Jeetan Patel, Chris Ma
