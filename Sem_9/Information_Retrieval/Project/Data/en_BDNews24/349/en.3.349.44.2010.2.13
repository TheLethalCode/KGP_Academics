 TORONTO, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - Hundreds of tech-savvy singles armed with their smartphones will gather for parties across Canada on Saturday hoping to land a date in time for Valentine's Day. Instead of resorting to the Internet or speed dating to find a potential mate, they will be attending Flitter parties, a play on the word flirting and the microblogging website Twitter.
