<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will relaunch a major drive in April aimed at recovering land along the rivers around Dhaka city from grabbers, the shipping minister said on Sunday. According to the shipping ministry, around 7,000 influential persons have grabbed land along the banks of Dhaka's major rivers, including the Buriganga. But though the ministry has succeeded in recovering some land back, it cannot keep control over it, ministry officials say. Shajahan Khan told reporters after presiding over a task force meeting on maintaining navigability of the rivers that the grabbed lands would be identified by the end of next month before launching the drive in late April. "We're also thinking of recycling the garbage being recovered from the Buriganga," he said. The government in early January launched the massive task of clearing the Buriganga riverbed of polythene bags and other harmful waste. Asked as to how the current cleaning drive will succeed when individuals are simultaneously dumping waste into the Buriganga, Hasan Mahmud, state minister for forest and environment, said: "Only blowing the whistle will not be enough to end river pollution. We need a mechanism for that and the government is working on that." He said new law on environment is being made. "It will be passed in next parliament session. Until the passage of the law actions would be taken against polluters under existing Natural Water Bodies Protection Act 2000." The ministry has said its is looking for new grounds for dumping waste as the existing ones have already been filled up with the trash excavated from Buriganga under the ongoing programme to clean up the Dhaka's lifeline. A new committee has been formed, with BIWTA chairman as its head, to determine the next course of action, shipping minister Khan said. Replying to a question on the High Court's deadline for setting up an Effluent Treatment Plant at a new tannery estate in Savar, he said the government has pleaded for some more time as it is not possible to establish such a facility within a short time. Land minister Rezaul Karim Hira, shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Howlader and other concerned officials were also present at the meeting. b
