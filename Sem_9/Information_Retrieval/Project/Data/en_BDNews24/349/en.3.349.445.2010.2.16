<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea celebrated leader Kim Jong-il's birthday on Tuesday with synchronised swimmers glorifying the "kind-hearted father" of the reclusive nation while it made overtures for dialogue with the United States. Kim, 68, is facing pressure to return to disarmament-for-aid nuclear talks due to UN sanctions and a botched currency move that nearly halted commerce late last year and worsened the destitute state's economic woes. Kim was hailed as "the peerlessly brilliant commander of the present era" who made it "the greatest fortune and privilege ... to hold (him) in high esteem," the North's nominal head of state said in a national meeting held in celebration of his birthday.

South Korea's Yonhap news agency said the North has won a massive deal from China for investment that is worth more than half its annual economic output, which could speed a return to the six-way talks hosted by Beijing. Marking his birthday called the nation's February Holiday, synchronised swimmers, figure skaters and dancing art troupe visiting from Japan sang gloriously and longingly of Kim Jong-il as the invincible and kind-hearted leader, KCNA said. "They performed on the ice-rink 'Push Back the Frontiers of Science', 'Higher and Faster', 'Let Us Meet at the Front' and other numbers reflecting the iron faith and will of the service personnel and people of the DPRK," it sa
