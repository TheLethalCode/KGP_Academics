<TITLE> Speaker raps members for 'killer' words </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid came down hard on both benches on Tuesday asking them not to use abusive words such as "killer" and "murderer" in parliament. "The way both sides have been using attacking words is really undesirable. The same point can be expressed in different ways," Hamid told parliament as opposition MP Moudud Ahmed complained of "attacking and abusive" words against late president Ziaur Rahman and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. "For instance, you can say 'someone was killed for which another should be charged' instead of using the word 'murderer'," Hamid said. The speaker has been calling on MPs to refrain from abusive language on the floor for smooth functioning of parliamentary democracy. He once again told parliament Thursday that all unparliamentary words would be expunged from the proceedings without any consideration. Home minister Sahara Khatun in a parliamentary statement termed BNP's de facto founder Maj Gen Ziaur Rahman and former president Khandker Mushtaq Ahmed "killers". The word angered the BNP-led opposition causing them to walk out of the House last Thursday. In the same way, BNP MP Shaid Uddin Chowdhury Anny in an unscheduled speech branded Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman a "killer". Anny's comment created tension inside the chamber as the ruling party MPs protested.
