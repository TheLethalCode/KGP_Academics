 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina alleged on Thursday that some quarters were trying to hike price of cereals artificially despite the fact there is surplus food in the country. "The current stock of food grain is around 1.15 million tonnes. Moreover, farmers have just harvested aman crop. Despite that a move is on to artificially raise price of grains," she told a conference of agriculturists at Krishibid Institute in Dhaka on Thursday. Referring to ruling Awami League's election pledge to reduce commodity prices and ensure food security, the prime minister said: "We've succeeded to fulfil the commitments." Listing the measures her government has taken during the past year for agricultural development, she said prices of triple super phosphate fertiliser have been cut down to Tk 20,000 from Tk 65,000 a tonne, and diammonium phosphate fertiliser to Tk 28,000 from Tk 85,000. "Smooth and timely supply of fertilisers was ensured. Prices of other inputs like diesel and seeds have also been reduced," she added. The prime minister hoped that target for production of 35.25 million tonnes food grain for 2009-10 season would be achieved. She urged the agriculturalists to promote use of eco-friendly technology and give up use of chemical ingredients. "You've to make people aware of the negative impacts of chemical fertilisers." Hasina further urged them to invent eco-friendly pest-control method. b
