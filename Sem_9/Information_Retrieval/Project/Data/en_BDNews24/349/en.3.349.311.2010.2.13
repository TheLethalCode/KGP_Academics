 Rajshahi University, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Rajshahi University vice-chancellor M Abdus Sobhan on Saturday demanded "proper investigation" into the killing of an RU student during overnight clashes on Feb 8-9, blaming police for negligence and cheating the university administration. A student was killed and scores were injured during the clashes between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir. The High Court on Feb 11 asked the government to explain why a probe commission should not be formed to investigate the violence and killing. Government officials were also asked to explain why they should not investigate allegations against the RU vice-chancellor and administration of "involvement with the incidents". There are also widespread accusations of negligence in duty against the law enforcers deployed on campus. Nine policemen were suspended on Feb 9 on charges of negligence. Vice-chancellor Sobhan, reading from a written statement at a press conference on Saturday, squarely put the blame on police. "Prior to the clash on Feb 8, the police commissioner came to visit me after inspecting the campus. He was informed of potential trouble as some suspicious characters were seen gathering in areas adjoining the university. He was also told to take preventive actions," Sobhan said. He said the police commissioner, before leaving, assured the authorities that enough force would be deployed on the campus and that the situation was under control. "It is very strange that the violent clashes that night continued for about an hour despite the so-called precautions taken by the police," the statement said. RU treasurer Abdur Rahman demanded that an enquiry should be launched to find out "the exact role of the police behind the (Feb 8-9) incidents". The university authorities also claimed they had taken all necessary actions they could perceive both before and after the clash and murder of the RU student. However, they could not prevent the situation "for lack of police cooperation", the statement said. Sobhan, also blaming Shibir for the clashes, said: "The clashes erupted on Feb 8 at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Hall when Shibir activists beat up Asaduzzaman, a student, as he went to take possession of the room he was allotted." "They also attacked his friend Kawser who came forward to protect him. Shibir activists continued a brutal assault on the campus for quite a few hours." Sobhan urged Bangladeshis to "confront" the Jamaat-Shibir combination terming it a "fascist" and "barbarous" force. The vice-chancellor said, "The anti-liberation force - Jamaat-Shibir  always find themselves psychologically cornered from December to March every year." "Therefore, they want to create disorder at the educational institutions aimed at vitiating the patriotic feeling that pervades all across during that period," he claimed. Pro-vice-chancellor M Nurullah, registrar MA Bari, treasurer Abdur Rahman and other RU administration officials were also present at the press briefing. POLICE NOW ACTIVE Meanwhile, witnesses said Rajshahi police commissioner Nawsher Ali personally inspected several RU halls on Saturday. He ordered the policemen deployed there to shoot at anybody if necessary. The commissioner also reportedly asked the police personnel "to leave their jobs and go home if any of them are loyal to Jamaat-Shibir". b
