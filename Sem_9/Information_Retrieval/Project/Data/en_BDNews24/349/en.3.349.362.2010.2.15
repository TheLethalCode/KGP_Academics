 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)--Donor agencies stressed the need for greater efficiency in execution of development projects and antigraft measures at the first session of the two-day Bangladesh Development Forum on Monday. The BDF, a key meeting between the government and donors, is being held again in Dhaka after a break of nearly four and half years. Finance minister AMA Muhith told a press briefing after the first session on development strategy, good governance and human development, that the most discussed issue was more efficient implementation of projects. "The government's capacity is limited, so projects don't take-off properly and implementation targets fall short." Development partners also asked the government for measures to raise revenue, a fast decision on empowering local governments, and focus on the population issue, added Muhith. Gender development, nutrition, maternal mortality, domestic violence and poor statistical data were also given weight by the development partners, said the finance minister. Regarding donors' concerns about corruption. Muhith said they questioned recent talk of clipping wings of the Anticorruption Commission (ACC). "We said that was not the case, reforms were going on regarding the procedures of the ACC and how to curb its arbitrary actions." He said the government did however admit that the progress rate was rather slow. Planning minister AK Khondokar told the briefing that the government tabled its recently revised PRSP-2 (Second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper) and the upcoming 6th Five-Year Plan in the session. Development partners said that the outputs of the session included endorsement of the PRSP-2 and integrating its proposals into the 5-Year Plan. "There was an important announcement made by the prime minister's adviser HT Imam of tabling the Civil Service Reforms Act in the parliament very soon," Chris Austin, country director of UK's DFID, told the media. Austin, one of the co-chairs of the Local Consultative Group, said donors also stressed continuity of civil servants' portfolios. The donors also broadly endorsed the Joint Cooperation Strategy for development partners put forward by the government, added the DFID official. The Joint Cooperation Strategy proposes increased effectiveness and impact of aid services as development partners' activities sometimes overlap, the Economic Relations Division secretary Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan said at the briefing.
