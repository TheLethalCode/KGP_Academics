<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top military commander of the Taliban, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, has been captured in Karachi, Pakistan, in a secret raid by Pakistani and US intelligence forces, The New York Times reported on Monday. Citing US government officials, the Times said Mullah Baradar, described as the most significant Taliban figure captured since the start of the Afghanistan war, had been in Pakistani custody for several days and was being interrogated by Pakistani and US intelligence.

The Times said it was now publishing the report because White House officials acknowledged that news of the capture was becoming broadly known in the region. US officials were quoted as saying that in addition to the Taliban's military operations, Mullah Baradar ran the group's leadership council, often called the Quetta Shura. The Times said the participation of Pakistan's spy service in Mullah Baradar's capture could suggest a new level of cooperation from Pakistan's leaders, who it said had been ambivalent about US efforts against the Taliban. It quoted former CIA official Bruce Riedel as saying he had not been aware of Mullah Baradar's capture before being told by the Times, but that the raid constituted a "sea change in Pakistani behaviou
