By contrast, fewer Americans (21 percent), South Koreans (16 percent), British (28 percent), and French (27 percent) think the idea of finding a partner online a good one.

The survey interviewed 10,976 adults who had used the Internet in the previous six months across 19 countries, and was conducted for BBC World Service by polling firm GlobeSc
