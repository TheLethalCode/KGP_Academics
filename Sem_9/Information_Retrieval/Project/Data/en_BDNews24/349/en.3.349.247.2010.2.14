 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun on Sunday turned down the opposition's demand for resignation. She said the drive against violence, which has involved rounding up Jamaat and Shibir leaders across the country, would continue until the killers of a Rajshahi University student are arrested. The opposition have been demanding the home minister's resignation for the deterioration of law and order, including campus violence and a recent spate of student deaths in clashes among pro-opposition and pro-ruling party student fronts Shibir, Chhatra Dal and Chhatra League. Rejecting the opposition's demand, Sahara said the law and order situation has been better under the present government than it was under the previous regimes. "The question for resignation does not arise at all," the home minister told reporters. She urged them to come up with a cooperative attitude instead of a destructive one. "The recent killings have been carried out to create unrest in the country," Sahara said at a function marking the founding anniversary of Bangladesh Coastguard in the capital's Agargaon. The home ministry last week ordered the law enforcers to hunt down Jamaat-Shibir activists across the country following the killing of a RU student. Hundreds of leaders and activists of Jamaat and Shibir have been arrested across the country in the last week. The minister said the government would work to increase manpower in the Bangladesh Coast Guard. The Bangladesh Coast Guard was officially formed on Feb 14, 1995. The force has so far seized illegal products worth Tk 575 crore.
