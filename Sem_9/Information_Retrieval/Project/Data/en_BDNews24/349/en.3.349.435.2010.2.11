 Dhaka, Feb 11 (bdnews24.com)  Mahmudur Rahman, acting editor of Bangla-language Dainik Amar Desh, escaped an attack on his car at Tejgaon in the capital on Thursday. Unknown assailants attacked the car with a hammer that shattered the rear windshield, Tejgaon zone assistant commissioner of police Mahtabuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. "However the editor was unhurt," Ahmed said. A reporter of the daily, present during the attack, said: "Assailants threw a hammer towards (Rahman's) Pajero jeep. The rear windshield was broken. The hammer was recovered from inside the car." Rahman was returning to his Uttara residence from the newspaper's Karwan Bazar office at the time of the attack. No complaint was lodged in connection with the incident, said officials of Tejgaon Police Station. Rahman is facing a number of defamation and personal injury cases filed in different parts of the country for publishing a report in his paper on December 17 alleging the prime minister's son Sajib Wazed Joy and her energy adviser Tawfique-e-Elahi Chowdhury of taking bribes to award US-based oil company Chevron a work order worth Tk 370 crore without floating tenders. bd
