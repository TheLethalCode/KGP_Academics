 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  The killing of a Bangladesh Chhatra League member, ABM Faruk, in Dhaka on Friday, was not related to campus politics, local Awami League and associated leaders have said. They speculated he was killed by drug traders or by acquaintances due to some type of "feud." Father Haji Mobarakuddin, a retired army officer, however, said the family has no idea who killed Faruk. Faruk, 33, president of BCL's Cantonment area chapter and also head of its Ward 15 unit, was shot at around 9:30pm on Friday at Manikdi Adorsho Bidyaniketon. He was the latest in a spate of student leader murders. "Faruk wanted to stop drug traders in the cantonment area. That's why they killed him in a planned way," said Bashir Ahmed, convener of Cantonment Thana Jubo League. "These drug runners are very powerful. They'll kill me if I reveal their names. I can only say that they have the backing of many big leaders and ministers. And that's why police and RAB are unable to take action against them," he alleged. Md Alamgir Kabir, president of AL's Ward 15 unit, said Faruk's killers were known to him. "Faruk went to the school after dusk with some acquaintances. Night guard Golam Hossain locked the entrance after they entered the premises," he said. "They shot Faruk at around 9pm and ran away. People from surrounding areas rushed to the spot hearing the sound of gunfire to rescue him. But he was dead by then," said Kabir. Makindi and Balughat areas have become a haven for drug traders in recent times. Police and RAB have stopped action against them "for mysterious reasons", say locals. There have been nine murders at Manikdi in the last 14 months related to the drug trade and extortion, they said. Meanwhile, RAB on Saturday arrested a man named Shahadat, the manager of a local shop, in connection with Faruk's murder. Police have also detained the school night guard Golam Hossain and two local residents Monirul Islam and Sohel Rana. "We have detained some people for quizzing," officer-in-charge of Cantonment police station Hosna Ara Begum told bdnews24.com. However, no case was filed until late Saturday afternoon in connection with Faruk's murder, she said. bd
