 MOSCOW, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia sees no reason to stall on the sale of its S-300 anti-aircraft systems to Iran, the Kremlin's powerful Security Council said on Sunday, hours before the premier of Iran's adversary Israel was due to visit Moscow. The possible sale of Russian air defence hardware to the Islamic Republic is a major irritant for both Israel and close ally the United States.

"There is a signed contract (to supply S-300 missiles) which we must implement, but deliveries have not started yet," Vladimir Nazarov, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council secretary, told Interfax news agency in an interview. "This deal is not restricted by any international sanctions, because the talk is about deliveries of an exclusively defensive weapon," he said. Nazarov also said a military strike on Iran would be a big mistake and that the problems linked to Iran's nuclear programme must be resolved only by diplomatic means. "Any military action against Iran will explode the situation, will have extremely negative consequnces for the entire world, including for Russia, which is a neighbour of Iran," he said. It was a separate issue that Russia's actions should help strengthen international and regional security, respect international law and international commitments including those within the Non-Proliferation Treaty, Nazarov said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow on Monday, planning to push the Kremlin for urgent "crippling sanctions" against Iran over its nuclear programme.
