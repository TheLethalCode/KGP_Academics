<TITLE> Shafique seeks life for killer drivers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 14 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed Sunday told parliament that the government would amend laws to award a maximum of life imprisonment for drivers found guilty of killing by reckless driving. According to the existing penal code, the highest punishment for death by reckless driving is three years in jail. Replying to a notice initiated by an Awami League MP, the minister however, rejected the demand for framing a separate law for vehicular death. "As per section 304 of the penal code, the maximum punishment for injuring or killing by reckless driving is three years in jail. "I personally think the punishment is inadequate," Shafique told parliament replying to the notice served by Tarana Halim MP, whose nephew was killed by a truck in Rampura. The law minister said his ministry would take initiatives to reform the existing laws to stop reckless driving if the home ministry and communications ministry came up with specific suggestions. "If we get specific proposals from the home and communications ministries, we will certainly make provision of life imprisonment for killing by irresponsible driving," said Shafique. "But the government has no plan to frame a separate law (in this regard)". The law minister said Bangladesh in 1984, under the martial administration of Gen HM Ershad, amended the penal code and reduced the maximum punishment from seven years to three years in the face of demands from transport owners and workers. Shafique said the current government had initiated a number of measures to reduce road accidents including forming of national road safety council, reactivating the traffic signals, constructing footbridges and speed breakers.
