<TITLE> Concerns over Aila-hit dykes being fixed ahead of monsoon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Qamrul Hasan bdnews24.com correspondent Satkhira, Feb 12 (bdnews24.com)Most of the coastal embankments damaged by Aila are yet to be repaired even nine months after the devastating cyclone battered the country's southwest coast in mid-2009. Dismayed officials and local people fear that work to repair the breaches on the embankments would not be completed ahead of the coming monsoon, which in turn could further aggravate the sufferings of millions of Aila victims. Although the reconstruction of the embankments had started in right earnest, the progress of work has rather moved in a snail's pace. Local people said the repair work is not likely to be completed by February, as envisaged earlier by the authorities. The slow progress is likley to bring fresh catastrophes to the inhabitants of three unions of Shyamnagar and Ashashuni Upazilas if the dykes are not rebuilt before the ensuing monsoon, villagers said. According to the Water Development Board Satkhira office, Shyamnagar and Ashashuni were the two worst-hit Upazilas battered by cyclone Aila, partially damaging 260 kilometres of coastal embankments and totally washing away some 37 kms of dykes. Md Isahaq Ali, former chairman of Gabura Union, said the reconstruction work is being hampered because required number of labourers could not be mobilised so far. Further compounding the problem was the unwillingness of the sub-contractors to pay an individual worker more than Tk 100 a day, althoguh the NGOs paid each labourer Tk 150 for the same work. These two factors are most likley to delay the completion of work by the end-February deadline, he added. Padmapukur Union chairman Amjadul Islam said contractors started work on five embankments located in Jhapa, Garhkumarpur, Kalitala, Chaulkhola and Chandipur areas, but the slow pace of work indicated they would not be able to repair the breaches before the onset of monsoon rains. Embankments in Lebubunia, Kholishabunia, Chandnimukha, Jelekhali and other places in Gabura Union under Shyamnagar Upazila were eroded by strong currents of the Kapotaksha and the Arhpangashia rivers that flows through the Sundarbans forest. The rivers swelled when the cyclone Aila hit the coastal areas on May 25 last year, submerging a large number of villages. Many more villages in other adjacent unions including Padmapukur also went under water as the rivers Kalindi, Madar and Shinghatali washed away the coastal dykes. On the other hand, the Kapotaksha-induced breaches inundated Pratapnagar, Ashashuni Sadar and Anulia Unions in Ashashuni Upazila. The local administration in collaboration with the villagers tried to contain the damages but failed. Subsequently, the regular high tides continued to damage the remainders of the dykes for months. As a result, homesteads, cropland and shrimp farms in those Unions experience inundation twice every 24 hours due to regular tidal surge. As the breached dykes have not been repaired fully, the villagers of the three Unions are forced to stay on the remaining stretches of the embankments over the past eight months. The area also suffers from acute drinking water shortage. Md Isahaq Ali, former chairman of Gabura union, said he already met with the local MP and the WDB officials in an effort to find a solution. "They assured me that they would urge the contractors to finish the work quickly," Ali said. The local people demanded that the coastal embankments should be built keeping in view the adverse effects of climate change and that the dykes should be upgraded to at least 100 feet in basal thickness, 20 ft in height with a 30 ft crestline. Satkhira WDB executive engineer Mujibur Rahman last month said tenders under 35 groups were floated for the repair of Aila-damaged dykes under Satkhira WDB-divisions 1 and 2. Of those, 11 groups fall in Shyamnagar, Kaliganj and Satkhira Sadar Upazilas under division 1 and 24 groups in Satkhira's Shyamnagar, Ashashuni, Kaliganj and Khulna's Koira Upazilas. Rahman said the tender was delayed because of lack of fund allocations. However, the matter was resolved and the contractors got the work orders in January and immediately began work for reparing the embankment breaches in Gabura Union. Work started in Chawkbara area under Gabura on January 29, but the local people doubt if the inexperienced sub-contractors would be able to finish the task within the stipulated time. Immediately after the repair work, some points of the dykes developed fresh breaches, which, the villagers said, had been due to the poor quality of work. Engineers said the ongoing repair work in Padmapukur union on five breaches should be completed in February. The contractors who have not yet started work after receiving the work orders have been asked to do the job immediately. bd
