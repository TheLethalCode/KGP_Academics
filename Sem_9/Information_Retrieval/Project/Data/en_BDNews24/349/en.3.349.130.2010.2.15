The bench of Justice Syed Mahmub Hossain and Justice ATM Fazle Kabir issued the order upon a petition by Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association (BELA). The secretaries of fisheries & livestock, agriculture, local government, industries and forest & environment ministries and deputy commissioners of coastal districts have been asked to implement the order.

Lawyer Iqbal Kabir argued for BELA and deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil represented the government in court on Monday. b
