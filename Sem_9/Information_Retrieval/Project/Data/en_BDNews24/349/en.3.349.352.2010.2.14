<TEXT>
 Dhaka, (bdnews24.com) - Here is a look at the state of power production in Bangladesh on February 11, 2010 PRODUCTION AND DEMAND The country's 51 power generating units, in 44 plants, had a total (de-rated) production capacity of 5450MW. Of these, only 34 were generating to capacity. The PDB recorded a maximum power generation of 3765MW against a peak hour demand of 4650MW. Dhaka zone's daily power demand was 1620MW. SHORTFALL Dhaka faced 16 percent shortfall. Shortfall was on average 23 percent in all other zones except Sylhet, which faced no shortfall. Gas crisis around the country caused 1009MW shortfall. Seven units around the country were shut down due to gas shortage while four others could not generate up to the capacity for the same reason. Six units were under maintenance reducing production by another 309MW. The shortfall around the country was partly managed with 'load shedding' of 746MW. CONSUMPTION AND CONSTRUCTION 88.54 percent of the country's power generating units consume gas, 5.37 percent use coal, 3.93 percent use oil and 2.13 percent are hydroelectric. The country's gas-based power plants consumed 692.78 mmcft of gas at a cost of Tk 51,203,370. Six more plants are under construction around the country, four of which are driven by gas, one by furnace oil and one by dual-fuel. These are expected to add more 547MW power to the national grid this year. The government is also expected to invite pre-qualification tenders by February-end for four duel-fuel power plants, which will generate a total of 800MW electricity while tenders for four coal-based plants each having 500MW generation capacity are expected to be floated in June. Only 47 percent of the population have access to electricity. SOURCES: Power Development Board and energy ministry
