 VANCOUVER, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Relentless rain washed out women's downhill training on Sunday, scrapping any alpine skiing on the first weekend of the Winter Olympic Games, while lugers aimed for gold on a track shortened to boost safety after the death of a Georgian competitor. Misfortune has haunted the Vancouver Games, with the death of 21-year-old Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died after flying off the track into a pillar during a luge training run on Friday.

Games chief John Furlong said last week: "We'd really like to get that monkey off our back." But the hosts' gold medal drought extended into a third Olympics on Saturday when American moguls skier Hannah Kearney snatched victory from Canada's Jenn Heil on the last run of the night in the women's freestyle on Cypress Mountain.
