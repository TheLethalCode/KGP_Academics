 LONDON, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday they will investigate a BBC presenter who admitted killing a former lover who was dying from AIDS, stoking the legal and moral debate over assisted suicide.

"The present law...exists because there are people who are prepared to kill for all kinds of motives -- to inherit, to be rid of an emotional or care burden and, occasionally, for what they may consider to be compassionate motives," it said. The BBC said it would co-operate with the police and Gosling insisted he had no regrets about what he did. "If he was looking down on me now he would be proud," he said.
