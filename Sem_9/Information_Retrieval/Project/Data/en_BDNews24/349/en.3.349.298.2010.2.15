 Dhaka, Feb 15 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid on Monday said emphatically that he is 'neutral', refuting BNP's allegation made Sunday questioning his impartiality in parliament. The speaker said: "I try to conduct my job in parliament impartially in accordance with the rules of business. Even though I was elected MP as a party member, I have never attended any party programmes since I became speaker." "I even quit my Kishoreganj district Awami League posts," Hamid said. On Sunday, after walking out of parliament over an AL MP's derogatory remark against BNP founder and late president Ziaur Rahman, BNP questioned speaker Hamid's neutrality. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said the fact that the speaker did not expunge such statements against the founder of the opposition party, delivered in two consecutive sittings of parliament, cast doubts on his partiality. Hamid on Monday, urging both the ruling and opposition parties to be more tolerant, said, "Aggressive attitudes should be avoided." He was addressing the unveiling ceremony of a reprinted version of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, which was first published in 1972. The ceremony was held at the parliament media centre. The reprinted version reproduces the original signatures of the then Gana Parishad members including Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hamid said Tofail Ahmed and Dewan Farid Gazi, who were among the original signatories, are members of parliament today. President Zillur Rahman , another Gana Parishad member, was also a signatory, he said. Suranjit Sengupta and late Manabendra Narayan Larma did not sign the constitution, although they were parishad members. Monayem Sarker, director of Bangladesh Foundation for Development Research, publisher of the constitution Osman Gani and other AL leaders and MPs were also present at the ceremony. bd
