 Chittagong, Feb 13 (bdnews24.com)  Police arrested 24 Islami Chhatra Shibir activists at Chittagong University on Saturday for assaulting police and suspicion of plotting violence. Amena Begum, additional superintendent of police of the district, said the Shibir leaders and activists were arrested under Section 54. Police raided five separate Shibir lodgings adjacent to the university and detained the residents in the early hours. A huge number of leaflets, jihadi literature, sticks, iron bars and brickbats were recovered from the student messes during the raid, police said. Tajul Islam, sub-inspector of Hathazari Police Station, said the arrestees were sent to court Saturday morning. Police on Friday filed cases against 1,585 Shibir activists and arrested 90 more as they brought out a procession in the port city claiming that Chittagong University student AAM Mohiuddi, slain at a rail station two days ago, was one of their members. The Shibir activists also clashed with police during the demonstrations that left at least 10 policemen injured. The home ministry last Thursday ordered concerned agencies to comb out activists of Shibir, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student front, from campuses across the country after the killing of a pro-ruling party Chhatra League activist at Rajshahi University. bd
