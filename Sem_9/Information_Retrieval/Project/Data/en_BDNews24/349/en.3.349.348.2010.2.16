 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)--A parliamentary watchdog Tuesday alerted the liberation war affairs ministry to ensure that people falsely claiming to have fought in the liberation war do not get job extensions under the recent law for increasing retirement age of freedom fighters. The parliamentary standing committee on liberation war affairs ministry made the recommendation as allegations were rife that many people with fake freedom fighter certificates had been enjoying various facilities provided by the government. The government recently passed the law to increase the retirement age of freedom fighters in public service to 59 years instead of 57 years for non-freedom fighters. "The ministry should remain cautious so that only genuine freedom fighters can take advantage of the law on retirement age extension," said a recommendation of the standing committee. Sector commander Major Rafiqul Islam, chairman of the standing committee, presided over Tuesday's meeting at the parliament building. The meeting also recommended that anyone found presenting fake freedom fighter certificates should face legal action. "Besides, they must pay back if any facilities taken from the state with false certificates," said another recommendation. At present, the government provides each freedom fighter an allowance of Tk 2,500 per month. Besides, they and their children enjoy quotas in government jobs and admissions to state-run educational institutes. The government, however, is yet to prepare an accurate list of freedom fighters who fought the Pakistan army in 1971 to liberate Bangladesh.
