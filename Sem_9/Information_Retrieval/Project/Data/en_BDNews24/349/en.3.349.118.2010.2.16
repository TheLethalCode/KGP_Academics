<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)BNP leader Moudud Ahmed on Tuesday requested speaker Abdul Hamid to intervene whenever the MPs use any unparliamentary words in parliament. In an unscheduled speech, the former law minister also said his party could not defeat the Awmai League in voice, but would be able to beat the treasury bench by logic. "Out of 345, we have only 37 MPs. We cannot beat you by shouting, but we can beat the government by reasoning and debating," said Moudud. Moudud made the request as speaker Abdul Hamid told the opposition that he could not muzzle any MP while pronouncing unparliamentary words. All unparliamentary words would automatically be expunged from the proceedings, speaker said. "My specific request to you : if anyone uses unparliamentary words you will immediately intervene not to use objectionable words," said Ahmed protesting the use of "derogatory" remarks used by prime minister and her cousin Sheikh Selim on Zia's grave. The BNP MP said most of the people in country did not know what "expunge" meant. "You expunge it later. But people listen to the unparliamentary words as the TV channels telecast the proceedings live and newspapers print it," said Moudud. He said the use of unparliamentary words had tarnished the image of the parliament to a great extent. Moudud also urged the speaker to announce the specific unparliamentary words or sentences to be expunged from the proceedings. Hamid did not tell anything in resonse as Moudud walked out of the House along with other BNP MPs. According to the rules of procedure, MPs must not use any abusive words. The rules of procedure also authorises the speaker to remind the MPs if they use unparliamentary words in the House. It also says the speaker can ultimately switch off microphone if an MP repeatedly uses unparliamentary words despite warnings from the chair.
