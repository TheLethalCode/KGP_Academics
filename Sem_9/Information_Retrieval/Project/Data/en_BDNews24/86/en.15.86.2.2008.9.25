 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone will give more time to local institutional investors to decide on its pre-IPO as it hopes to raise US$ 300 million from the capital market. "Local institutional investors need to be given adequate time to do due diligence and allocate funds for the bidding," Grameenphone CEO Anders Jensen said in a statement Thursday. "We are working with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to expedite the matter," Jensen said. GP officials dealing with what would be the largest IPO in Bangladesh said they had expected local institutional investors to respond by Sept. One official, refusing to be named as he was not authorised to brief the media, admitted poor response prompted the company to extend the time somewhat indefinitely. Thursday's statement did not mention any specific deadline for investors to respond. "We have not set any specific deadline for the time being," said Syed Talat Kamal, deputy general manager for public relations, responding to queries by bdnews24.com. "We hoped that it could be done by September, but after going through the matter, we have decided to give more time," he told bdnews24.com by phone. The company statement also admitted that it proved far more challenging for the largest phone operator in Bangladesh to convince investors. "Under the current challenging global capital market conditions in which international investors are hesitant to commit to new investments, it is important to ensure that potential investors in Grameenphone are given adequate time to make their investment decision," the statement said. The company planned to raise half the US$300 million through Private Placement Offering (PPO) prior to the initial public offering (IPO). "The shareholders of Grameenphone remain committed to the IPO to develop the Bangladesh capital market and to share Grameenphone's success with its future shareholders," Jensen said. Earlier on July 21, 2008, the Grameenphone Board of Directors approved the listing of Grameenphone's shares through an IPO. On July 29, 2008, Grameenphone filed a formal IPO application with the Securities and Exchange Commission. b
