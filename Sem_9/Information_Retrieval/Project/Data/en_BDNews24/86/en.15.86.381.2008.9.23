 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday submitted her bail bond in the Tk 3 crore extortion case. Co-accused Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, a former health minister in Hasina's cabinet, who was freed on bail a day earlier in a separate graft case, also submitted his bail bond in the extortion case on Tuesday. Hasina and Selim, cousins, submitted their bail bonds at Md Ashraf Hossain's Special Sessions Court-5. The court accepted the bonds along with the submitted fees, an advocate each and a local guarantor and set October 26 for next hearing in the case. Advocate Sahara Khatun deposited Tk 30,000 and the bail bond on behalf of Hasina and barrister Fazle Noor Tapash signed the bail bond as her local guarantor. The same procedure was repeated by the same legal practitioners in the case of bail bond submission for Sheikh Selim. Sheikh Selim appeared in court on Tuesday, while Hasina is on parole for treatment in the US. On Sept. 16, the vacation bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman halted the proceedings of the case until Oct. 19 and granted Hasina and Selim three months' bail. On June 13, 2007, businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury filed the case with Gulshan Police Station against Hasina and Selim on charges of taking Tk 3 crore in bribe for landing him contracts for three barge-mounted plants in Khulna. Chowdhury, however, subsequently admitted to reporters that he had never sued Hasina. He told the court during trial he said he had never known the former prime minister before. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the case on July 24, 2007 against Hasina, sister Sheikh Rehana and Selim. The metropolitan sessions judge on Jan. 13 framed charges against the accused. bdnews24
