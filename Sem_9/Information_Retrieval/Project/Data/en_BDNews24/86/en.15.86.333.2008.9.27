 KARACHI, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is to provide international level security for a leading domestic tournament for the first time. The country's national twenty20 championship begins next week with all the top players available following the postponement of international events in Pakistan because of security concerns. "We have held a meeting with the police officials and there will be a heavy contingents of police deployed at all entry and exit points," Colonel Zulfiqar Ahmed, the PCB's general manager for security, told reporters on Friday. "Spectators will have to pass through metal detectors." He said the measures were being taken because the current security situation in the country could not be ignored. Australia's planned test tour of Pakistan and this year's Champions Trophy were postponed due to security concerns. The first three editions of the national Twenty20 championship have been very popular and the last final drew a crowd of around 25,000 at the national stadium in Karachi
