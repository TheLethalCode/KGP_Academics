 Hong Kong, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A typhoon was gathering strength in the South China Sea on Tuesday and heading toward Hong Kong after killing three people in the northern Philippines and trapping 13 people in a gold mine. The Hong Kong Observatory raised its strong warning wind signal number 3 with Typhoon Hagupit edging west-northwest at about 30 kph toward the south China coast. "The observatory will consider the need for the No. 8 gale or storm signal around dusk today," it said. The highest signal is 10. Hong Kong kindergartens were closed for the day and the city's bustling container ports and terminals were due to suspend operations in the afternoon. Hagupit, which means "lashing" in Filipino, was estimated to be 380 km (236 miles) southeast of Hong Kong at 10 a.m. (10 p.m. EDT) and was expected to make landfall in China on Wednesday. In the Philippines, the coastguard rescued 21 people from three cargo and fishing vessels that sank in rough waters as Hagupit passed the north coast on Monday. In total, three people were killed and four were missing. Authorities in the northern province of Benguet said 13 gold miners were trapped when water levels rose after heavy rain. "We are working on rescue operations and our priority is to suction out the water first," said provincial Governor Nestor Fongwan. The Philippine National Disaster Coordinating Council said about 120 people had fled their homes in a northern mountain village due to fears of landslide as the weather bureau lowered typhoon alerts. Taiwan also lifted its land and sea warnings after the typhoon brushed the island's southern tip overnight, causing no injuries or damage, officials said. Some areas in the northern Philippines remained isolated due to floods and landslides and without power and telephone service. Tropical Storm Watch (http://www.tropicalstormrisk.com/) labeled it a category 3 storm on a scale of five. In June, about 600 people were killed and about 15 billion pesos ($325 million) worth of property and farms were destroyed by a typhoon that hit the central Philippines. Seven cargo vessels and a ferry carrying 800 people also sank. Tropical storms in the region gather intensity from the warm ocean waters and frequently develop into typhoons that hit Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and southern China during a season that lasts from early summer to late autumn.
