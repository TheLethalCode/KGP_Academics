<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, Sep 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will visit Russia early next month for talks with its leaders, Olmert's office said on Sunday. It said the visit would take place on October 6 and 7. Olmert has been serving in a caretaker capacity since resigning a week ago. He had planned to visit Moscow earlier this month, but the trip was postponed amid political uncertainty in Israel touched off by a corruption scandal that forced him to step down. Israeli officials said at the time that Olmert intended to discuss Iran's nuclear program and voice concern over reports that Russia planned to arm Syria with advanced missiles. Under Israeli law, Olmert remains in office until a new government is formed. His deputy, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, was asked by President Shimon Peres last Monday to form a governing coalition within 42 days.
