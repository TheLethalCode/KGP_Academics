<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's sports ministry has decided to take control of the country's cricket board (PCB), which has functioned independently since 1948. The ministry amended the board's constitution and issued a notification on Monday under which it will monitor the PCB's operational and financial affairs, the board said on Tuesday. Sports minister Najamuddin Khan said his ministry had taken control because the board was functioning without a chairman following the resignation of Nasim Ashraf. "Since the board chairman resigned last month, the ministry has decided to take measures to bring cricket affairs under the control of the ministry," Khan told Reuters on Tuesday. "All sports federations in the country come under our control. And we also want to have a certain level of transparency in cricket affairs as people are unhappy with the performance of the team," Khan added. Pakistan are ranked sixth in the International Cricket Council's (ICC) test and one-day international rankings. WHOLE DYNAMICS The sport's world governing body declined to comment on the sports ministry's move but a PCB official told Reuters: "This is the first time the ministry has got involved in cricket affairs and it could change the whole dynamics of the way cricket has been run in this country". The PCB, the richest sports body in Pakistan, has functioned independently of government control since it was launched as the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan (BCCP) in 1948. In the 1990s it was renamed the Pakistan Cricket Board with the president of the country authorised to directly appoint the chairman in his capacity as chief patron of cricket. Former test players and the sports minister have recently criticised the board and the state of its financial affairs. Shafqat Naghmi, the PCB's chief operating officer, said the ministry will now be in charge of policy decisions. "Apart from that, day-to-day affairs and those things which have already been approved by the board, I believe, the ministry will let the board handle them. This is my assumption," he said. But Naghmi added that until Monday's notification is clarified there would have to be a clear division of duties between the ministry and the PCB to avoid confusion
