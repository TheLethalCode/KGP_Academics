<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  A brace from Anamul Haque powered Farashganj Sporting Club to a 2-1 away win over Rahmatganj MFS in the B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium Tuesday. It was the first win for the Federation Cup semifinalist, who earlier lost to Sheikh Russel KC 3-2 and Dhaka Abahani Limited 1-0 while Rahmatganj MFS went down in their second clash after stunning holders Dhaka Abahani 2-1 in the league opener. Anamul, who struck five goals in the season-curtain raiser, put Farashganj ahead in the 11th minute before Idris Kasirye canceled the lead 10 minutes later. Anamul finally sealed the match scoring his second, seven minutes from time. The battle between the two old Dhaka outfits was mostly confined to the midfield in the first half, but Rahmatganj were forced to go back in the face of series of attacks from the opponents. M Mamun, picking a through-pass from Kabir Hossain, released a fine minus from the right for Anamul, who tapped the ball home to give Farashganj a 11-minute lead. After going down, Rahmatganj pressed hard for the equaliser and levelled the margin ten minutes later with a strike from Idris. Herok Joarder whipped a cross for Idris, who lashed a drive past Farashganj's goalkeeper Al Amin. Afterwards, Farashganj almost yielded a goal chance when Amanul picking a long ball raced past opponent defender Ashraf Hossain to see his powerful shot denied by Rahmatganj's keeper M Ali in the 38th minute. Four minutes before the break, Idris squandered a fine chance to disappoint Rahmatganj from a lead as he was denied by Farahganj's keeper Al Amin. After the resumption, Farashganj stepped up the attack and saw a long-range shot from Azizur Rahman hit the opponent crossbar in the 50th minute while M Mamun got into a better position in the Rahmatganj penalty area, but the midfielder failed to connect a brilliant cross from Kaiser Ahmed in the 73rd minute. Amamul finally sealed the match as the striker, racing past two Rahmatganj defenders, headed home a NCHE Francis cross from the left in the 83rd minute.
