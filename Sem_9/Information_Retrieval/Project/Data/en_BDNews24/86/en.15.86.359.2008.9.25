 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has yet to conclude primary investigations on the wealth statements of former prime minsters Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia, a senior ACC official said. ACC director general (administration) colonel Hanif Iqbal told reporters that a news report published on Thursday regarding the commission's findings was unsubstantiated. A Bangla-daily reported that the ACC had not found any evidence of illegal wealth belonging to the two former prime ministers. Hanif Iqbal said he did not know of any reports on the primary investigations into the wealth of the two leaders submitted to the commission. The ACC served notice on Hasina and Khaleda seeking statements of their wealth on July 17 last year. Khaleda Zia submitted her wealth statement through her lawyer on Aug 6, declaring property worth approximately Tk 3.5 crore. Hasina submitted her statement owning to Tk 3.10 crore of assets on Sept 2 through prison authorities. bdnew
