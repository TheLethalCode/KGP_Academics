 MILAN, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from Serie A ahead of Wednesday's games. AS Roma forward Francesco Totti will sit out the trip to Genoa as he continues to build up fitness following knee surgery, the club website (www.asroma.it) said. Midfielder Alberto Aquilani has been included in the squad despite a thigh strain. Roma, who claimed their first win of the season against Reggina on Saturday, will be without defenders Juan and Marco Cassetti with midfielders David Pizarro and Julio Baptista also injured. AC Milan travel to Reggina and are trying their best not to think about Sunday's derby with Inter. "Now we only have to think about Reggina, although it would certainly mean a lot to us Milan fans to win the derby," striker Andriy Shevchenko, who played under Inter boss Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, told reporters. "Mourinho hasn't changed since he was in England, as always he expresses the way he feels, which is only right." Injured Juventus winger Mauro Camoranesi misses the visit of Catania, the club said in a statement. Striker Alessandro Del Piero is back in the squad after tweaking his knee but goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is out with a thigh injury and Alex Manninger will stand in. Forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has a long-standing knee problem, is likely to be rested for Inter's home game with Lecce after a run of matches. Captain Javier Zanetti will make his 600th Inter appearance if he plays. Striker Adrian Mutu is expected to return to Fiorentina's starting line-up at Lazio after being rested for Sunday's 1-0 win over Bologna. Napoli defender Fabiano Santacroce is suspended for the visit of Palermo
