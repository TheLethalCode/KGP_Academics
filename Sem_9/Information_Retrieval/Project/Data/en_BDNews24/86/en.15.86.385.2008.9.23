 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)The inspector general of police expressed "hope" on Tuesday over the passing of the proposed new police ordinance, despite voicing strong frustrations the day before. Replying to questions from newsmen after inaugurating the new Darussalam Police Station in Mirpur on Tuesday, the police chief said: "From my point, there is nothing to say but express hope in this regard." The IGP complained earlier on Monday that the proposed new police ordinance is yet to be enacted due to lack of political will. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, the police chief had said: "I have been raising my voice to help strengthen and straighten the police force for two years." "Give the nation's police force a chance to be better by enforcing reforms," he urged the government. Asked about his comments on Tuesday, he parried and said: "It's a continuous process. It remains underway. I am hopeful." Darussalam Police Station is situated just behind the Martyred Intellectuals' Graveyard in Mirpu and covers Wards 9-11 of the Dhaka metro area. IGP Noor Mohammad was chief guest at the opening ceremonies of two new police stations in the capital Tuesday. After Darussalam, he opened Kadamtoli Police Station in Shyampur. bdnews
