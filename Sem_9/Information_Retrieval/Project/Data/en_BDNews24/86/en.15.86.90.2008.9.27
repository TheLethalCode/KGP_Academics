<TITLE> Iran dismisses draft UN nuclear resolution </TITLE>

 TEHRAN (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday a draft U.N. resolution over Tehran's disputed nuclear program was not constructive and could indicate divisions between world powers, state television reported. Six world powers handed the U.N. Security Council the draft on Friday after the United States, facing stiff Russian opposition, failed to secure agreement for new penalties over work the West believes is aimed at building atomic bombs. The Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions on Iran since 2006 for failing to heed a call to halt sensitive nuclear work, that Tehran insists is peaceful. Russia and China backed all three sets but only after watering down the sanctions. "These (resolutions) are not constructive," Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili, told state television when asked about the draft resolution. "What they need to do is to attract the trust of the Iranian nation through constructive cooperation and collective commitment." He also said the draft either showed world powers had failed to come up with a "logical response" to Iran over its nuclear work "or they have lost internal cohesion as they have acknowledged themselves, and through this action they want to show there is actually cohesion." The U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported this month that Iran was not cooperating enough with its inspectors. Diplomats said members of the 15-nation council would consult their governments and the resolution could come to a vote early next week. Previous resolutions included travel bans and asset freezes on Iranian individuals and companies. The draft was backed by the five permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- plus Germany.
