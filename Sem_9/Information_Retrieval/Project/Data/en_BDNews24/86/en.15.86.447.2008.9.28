 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsene Wenger was left with nothing to feel happy about after his Arsenal team were surprisingly beaten 2-1 by Hull City on Saturday on the eve of the 12th anniversary of his appointment as manager. It was the biggest upset of the Premier League season so far with the promoted side, playing in the top flight for the first time since their formation 104 years ago, the deserved winners. Just four days after a largely teenage Arsenal side thrashed Sheffield United 6-0 in the League Cup, Wenger was left frustrated as his first team surrendered their perfect home league record this season. Arsenal also conceded their first home goals in any competition after outscoring the opposition 14-0 in their previous four games at the Emirates Stadium. "Everything that makes you win football games was not there from the start," Wenger told Setanta Sports. "The concentration levels were not high enough from the start. When we went 1-0 up our focus dropped and we gave them too much room." OWN GOAL Arsenal took the lead when Paul McShane conceded an own goal after 50 minutes but Hull replied with a stunning 25-metre effort from Geovanni after 62 minutes and won it when Daniel Cousin glanced home a header four minutes later. "We had a bit of bad luck as well because we had 15 chances to score, but they scored two great goals and they showed more commitment," added Wenger. "We gave them too much room when we were 1-0 up and then we conceded on the corner without attacking the ball. That's focus and sharpness. You cannot say we have no problems when you concede goals but I am more disappointed than worried," he said. "I will analyse what went wrong and will try and respond in the next game." It was only the second time Arsenal had lost at the Emirates in 60 matches since they moved there from Highbury in 2006. The result left them fourth on 12 points, behind Chelsea and Liverpool, who have 14 points, and Aston Villa on 13. Hull are in sixth place and their delighted manager Phil Brown said: "We won it because we were brave today. "We knew that Arsenal had conceded goals from set-pieces and worked on that in training. However, I was disappointed with my team at halftime and felt we should have done better with the chances we created," he told Setanta Sports
