 WELLINGTON, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A nagging hamstring injury has forced New Zealand paceman Chris Martin out of next month's one-day international series in Bangladesh. New Zealand Cricket general manager Lindsay Crocker said Martin had injured himself playing county cricket in England and would be replaced on the tour by Michael Mason. "While he was able to fully contribute to their most recent four-day match, we have come to the conclusion his longer term interests are best served by him cutting short his obligations at Warwickshire, returning home for full treatment and rehabilitation before hopefully being able to head to Bangladesh to take full part in the test series," Crocker said. New Zealand are scheduled to play three one-day internationals in Bangladesh from Oct. 9-14 before the first of their two tests starts on Oct. 17
