<TITLE> Grameen Bank, Pfizer aim at global health project for poor </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Grameen Bank is teaming up with Pfizer in a project designed to extend affordable healthcare through private insurance to the world's poor, London-based The Financial Times reported. The world's largest pharmaceutical company is to loan three senior employees for a year and provide an initial $200,000 (136,000, 108,000) to expand Grameen's co-operative network of rural clinics, which are funded by cheap, pre-paid insurance premiums and low service fees. The action marks a fresh effort by Muhammad Yunus, Grameen's Nobel prize-winning founder, to provide sustainable low-cost but high-quality healthcare to developing countries where government-provided medicine is often poor or non-existent and private services are rare and expensive. It reflects Pfizer's efforts to expand its business beyond simple drug sales into providing and funding profit-making healthcare in the developing as well as the developed world. The aim is to develop a service that will provide consistently high-quality but affordable care while making a profit as a "social business" so it is sustainable and independent of government or donor support. Once the model is refined, the hope is to extend it to help reach the estimated 4bn people living on less than $3,000 a year. Vidar Jorgensen, president of Grameen America, said: "The vision is to build services that are attractive to middle and higher income people, not branded as healthcare for the poor, which would be extremely high quality and cost effective. In order to work, we have got to bring in commercial partners who will get their capital back and make the business sustainable." Grameen has 38 clinics in Bangladesh, established partly to tackle the fact that one of the main reasons for defaults on the group's microfinance loans was ill health. Each clinic serves about 20,000 people, who pay annual premiums of up to $2 a family and get large discounts on doctors' consultation fees. The clinics each make a small loss, and still require patients to buy their own medicines, which can often prove expensive. Grameen hopes to make them self-supporting, with 2,000 doctor-led clinics and smaller nurse-led satellite versions across Bangladesh. Pfizer sells 100 patented and generic medicines on the World Health Organisation's "essential drugs" list to treat common diseases. Jean-Michel Halfon, Pfizer's area president for Canada, Latin America, Africa and Middle East pharmaceutical operations, said the partnership could permit more efficient, higher volume and lower priced sales of the company's products and services within Bangladesh. The co-operation reflected Pfizer's recently launched "global access strategy" for medicines. "This is not philanthropy. We are trying to construct a business model that is commercially viable, socially positive and sustainable in the long term.
