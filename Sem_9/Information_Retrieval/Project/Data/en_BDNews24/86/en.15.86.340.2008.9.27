 BORDEAUX, France, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Having 24 teams at European championship finals instead of 16 from 2016 will not affect the quality of matches, UEFA president Michel Platini said on Friday. "I'm sure it will not change the technical level of the game," Platini said at the end of an executive committee meeting of European soccer's governing body that endorsed the expansion. "This will give teams who have never participated a chance to do so," he added. "It will not affect the quality of football, it will just increase its diversity." The expansion was approved unanimously on Friday. It was expected, despite criticism that it could dilute the quality of the event, after senior officials of all 53 UEFA member nations had backed the idea in June. The first five finals were staged as four-team events from 1960 until 1976 before being increased to eight teams in 1980. The first 16-team finals were held in 1996, but pressure has since come from some countries to make the event bigger still. The expansion means nearly half of UEFA's 53 members will take part in the finals from 2016. The format will consist of six groups of four teams. The top two from each group will qualify and will be joined in the round of 16 by the four best third-placed sides. There will be 51 matches, compared with 31 now, played over 29 to 31 days, depending on the match schedule. The traditional qualifying format, with groups of six and five teams, will stay in place
