 JERUSALEM, Mon Sep 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli President Shimon Peres is likely to ask Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni to try to form a new coalition government, a Peres spokeswoman said on Monday, a day after Prime Minister Ehud Olmert resigned. A statement issued by Peres's office said preparations were under way at the president's residence for a ceremony at 7:30 p.m. (1630 GMT) at which he would announce his choice. "(Peres) is meeting with many factions today, and something might change, so I can't say for sure he will choose Tzipi Livni, but that's how it's looking," Peres spokeswoman Ayelet Frish told Army Radio. Peres sounded out parliamentary faction leaders on their preferences for prime minister or whether they wanted an early election ahead of a national ballot due in 2010. The political uncertainty has dimmed even further prospects of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, which the United States had hoped Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas could achieve this year. Olmert, who could face criminal indictment in corruption probes, submitted his resignation to Peres on Sunday, but will remain in office until a new government is in place. He was replaced as the head of the ruling Kadima party by Livni, who narrowly won an internal election on Wednesday. If Peres gives her the nod, she will have 42 days to build a coalition and become Israel's first woman prime minister since Golda Meir in the 1970s. Failure would likely lead to a parliamentary election. WALL-TO-WALL COALITION Labour Party leader Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, told reporters he wants a broad-based government that would include left-and right-wing parties. "What Israel really needs for the challenges it faces is a national emergency government," said Barak, whose party is a key member of Olmert's coalition. Peres also held consultations with two right-wing opposition parties which said they would not join a coalition headed by Livni -- Israel's chief negotiator in peace talks with the Palestinians -- and preferred new elections. Asked about the prospects of reaching a statehood deal, Abbas, visiting Dublin, acknowledged the Israeli political situation made it "a very difficult time", but he said the plan was to continue talks. Livni met late on Sunday with Barak to negotiate a possible governing alliance. A day before he saw Livni, Barak met Benjamin Netanyahu, head of the main right-wing opposition Likud party, in a sign that Labour could seek an alternative political partnership. Opinion polls predict Likud would win an early election. "It was a good, businesslike meeting," Barak told reporters after his talks with Livni and said they would meet again
