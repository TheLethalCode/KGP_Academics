 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)The Left Democratic Alliance, consisting of 11 parties, has said it would not join with BNP or Awami League, while alleging that the government in hand with "vested quarters" was trying to stage-manage the upcoming general election. At a press conference Saturday, the Left alliance made a five-point demand including immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency for holding a free, fair, neutral and acceptable election. It's five demands were: withdrawal of the state of emergency, cancellation of the amended Representation of People Order, disqualifying the corrupt and war criminals from contesting polls, a halt to the government's unwanted intervention on the media and effective reform of the electoral process. The alliance's coordinator, Adv Abdus Salam made the demands before the press at the Topkhana Road offices of member party Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal. "There is no scope for a free, fair, neutral and acceptable election by partially relaxing Emergency Powers Rules for political parties, while keeping the state of emergency in force for the public thus suspending people's fundamental rights," he said. "It is clear that the government and different quarters are trying to hold a stage-managed election, keeping political control in their hands." Replying to a question, general secretary of Biplobi Communist Party Saiful Haque said: "The Left alliance will not join any other alliance led by BNP or Awami League in the next election." "The alliance will meet later to take a decision on joining any other alliance and participation in the Dec 18 general election." The parties of the Democratic Left Alliance are: Bangladesh Samajtantrik Dal, Communist Party of Bangladesh (M-L), Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal (M-L-M), Jatiya Gano Front, Biplobi Communist Party, Biplobi Oikya Front, Ganotantrik Majdoor Party, Gano Sanghati Andolon, Bangladesher Samajtantrik Dal, Sramojibi Mukit Andolon and Bangladesher Samajtantrik Andolon. bdnews
