<TITLE> Stopping Aguero key for Getafe in Madrid derby </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Getafe have to find a way to stop in-form striker Sergio Aguero if they are to register their first home league win over city rivals Atletico Madrid in the Primera Liga on Wednesday. The Argentine has inspired Atletico to four crushing victories in their last five matches in all competitions, where they have scored 16 and conceded just two, in the 2-1 defeat away to Valladolid. The 20-year-old Aguero, who did not start that game, has netted four in the last three outings. His low centre of gravity and explosive finishing have had local media likening him to former Brazil striker Romario. "He's very mature for his age and is starting to fulfil expectations. But it isn't just Aguero, it is the whole of Atletico that give you cause for concern," Getafe striker Manu del Moral said of his former club. Javier Aguirre's side are showing early signs of being able to handle playing in the Champions League for the first time in 11 years, and keeping their eye on the ball in the domestic competition. They hammered Recreativo Huelva 4-0 on Saturday. Getafe are unbeaten in eighth place with five points from three games, one behind their near neighbours Atletico in fifth. After a defeat and a draw, Pep Guardiola's Barcelona secured their first win when they took apart promoted Sporting Gijon 6-1 away on Sunday. Their high-tempo passing game and ceaseless pressuring of opponents deep in their own half, was reminiscent of the Barca that won back-to-back league titles in 2005 and 2006. Guardiola cuts a different figure from the laid-back Frank Rijkaard, who he replaced in the close season, prowling the touchline and barking out instructions. He was not surprised with Sunday's result. "In the previous two games we had 50 shots on target, so it was only a matter of time before the goals came," he said. On Wednesday, Barca host Real Betis, who have yet to score a goal. Sporting have failed to register a point so far and play champions Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. Bernd Schuster's side have yet to convince their demanding fans with their style, but there is no doubting their efficiency in front of goal given half a chance. Leaders Valencia, with seven points, are away to promoted Malaga on Thursday
