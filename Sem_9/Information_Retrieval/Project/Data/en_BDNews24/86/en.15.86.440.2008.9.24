 MUMBAI, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are looking to draw from former captain Greg Chappell's experience of Indian conditions in their bid to topple India in next month's four-test series, fast bowler Brett Lee said on Tuesday. The world's top ranked team arrived ahead of schedule to spend a week at the Rajasthan cricket academy in Jaipur, where former India coach Chappell is adviser, to acclimatise with the conditions. Chappell, who coached India for two years before resigning in 2007, is touring with the Australian team as an assistant coach. "He is experienced and owns a great personal record. He is second to none. We are looking up to him and he is a key member of our team," Lee told a news conference in Jaipur. In 2004, Australia won the four-test series 2-1 to record their first series victory on Indian soil in 35 years. From the current squad only skipper Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke and Simon Katich have test experience in India as the tourists are rebuilding following a series of high-profile retirements. "The younger guys coming through had to start somewhere and what better stage and what better opportunity than to play in India," said Lee, who was named in the 2004 squad before withdrawing through injury. "The cricket is pretty hard work out here as well and so we have to make sure we have our plans in place. We are looking forward to it and we are definitely up to the challenge." Lee will spearhead a largely inexperienced bowling attack with Doug Bollinger and Peter Siddle from in the pace attack and both spinners Bryce McGain and Jason Krejza uncapped. "The pitches aren't conducive to fast bowling over here. We (quicks) definitely have our work cut out," he added
