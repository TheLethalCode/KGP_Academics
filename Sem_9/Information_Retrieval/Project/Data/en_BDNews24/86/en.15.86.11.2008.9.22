 VIENNA, Mon Sep 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN nuclear watchdog chief on Monday rejected Iran's argumen t that an investigation into its nuclear programme threatened its national security. The watchdog believes Iran is withholding information needed to explain "serious" intelligence material from 10 countries that it had pursued projects to build an atomic weapon. "(We do) not seek to 'pry' into Iran's conventional or missile-related military activities. Our focus is clearly nuclear material and activities," International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed ElBaradei said. "We need, however, to make use of all relevant information to be able to confirm that no nuclear material is being used for nuclear weapons purposes," he added in a speech at the start of a meeting of the IAEA's board of governors in Vienna. "I again urge Iran to show full transparency and to implement all measures required to build confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its nuclear programme at the earliest possible date," he told delegates. A Sept. 15 IAEA report detailed Iranian non-cooperation with agency requests for documents and access to sites to back up Iran's denials of the allegations. Senior UN officials said the IAEA had "reached gridlock" with Iran. The intelligence material suggests Iran in the past linked projects to process uranium, test high explosives at high altitudes and modify the cone of a long-range Shahab-3 missile in a way that would fit a nuclear payload. Iran says the intelligence is forged and sites the IAEA wants to examine are purely conventional military facilities any nation would keep off-limits on security grounds. It has also said it wants to see originals or copies of any documentation. GET SPECIFIC, ELBARADEI TELLS IRAN ElBaradei said IAEA member states which provided the agency with documentation related to the allegations should share it with Iran and the Islamic Republic should then clarify what was factually correct. "Unless Iran provides such transparency ... the agency will not be able to provide credible assurances about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran," he added. The IAEA has struggled for six years to get to the bottom of Iran's nuclear work. The United States and European allies say Iran is just stringing U.N. investigators along while pushing ahead with a sensitive nuclear fuel enrichment programme. Enriched uranium can be used either in power plants or -- if refined to a much higher degree -- in a nuclear bomb, although Iran says it only wants atomic energy in order to generate electricity. Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Ali Asghar Soltanieh, said there was no evidence of any diversion of nuclear material and activities for what he termed "prohibited purposes". He accused the United States of putting a "stumbling block" in the way of the IAEA's work by not providing enough evidence to back up its claims about Iran's nuclear activities. "We have to stop this process because it is putting the credibility of the (IAEA) in serious jeopardy," he told reporters on the sidelines of the Vienna meeting. "Iran has not created any difficulty for access to all nuclear material and facilities. This will continue." A Western diplomat said Iran's demands for more evidence were an effort to deflect attention from the "real problem", Iran's "failure to cooperate" with the IAEA. But ElBaradei said that to encourage Iranian transparency, countries behind the intelligence should allow the IAEA to share the details in hard-copy form with Tehran. Iran has slowly but steadily expanded its uranium enrichment campaign in defiance of Security Council demands. It now has almost 4,000 centrifuge machines refining uranium with 2,000 more being installed, the IAEA report said. U.S. analysts said Iran seemed to be nearing the capacity to produce enough fuel for a nuclear weapon within two years
