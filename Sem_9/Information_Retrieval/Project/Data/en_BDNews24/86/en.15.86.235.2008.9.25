 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  Democracywatch, a local election monitoring organisation, issued a statement Thursday claiming itself to be a completely neutral and professional organisation. "Democracywatch has been working as a completely neutral and professional organisation since its inception 13 years ago," said the statement signed by the organisation's executive director, Taleya Rehman. The statement came following an allegation of the organisation's political bias that stemmed from a meeting of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at the residence of Shafik Rehman, husband of Taleya Rahman. "Since September 16 2008, when Mrs Khaleda Zia, chairperson of BNP, held a meeting at 15 Eskaton Garden, some people have launched an unjust campaign against me and Democracywatch," the Democracywatch statement said. "The meeting was held on the office premises of Shafik Rehman located at a completely different building from our residence at the same address. It is only polite and customary to receive a guest by the host and hostess," the press release said. It said that the present 'campaign against Democracywatch' and Talyea Rahman was a setback for women's emancipation. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia met former BNP leaders and a group of retired army officers at the home of Shafik Rehman, former editor of daily Jai Jai Din, from Sept 16 to Sept 22. b
