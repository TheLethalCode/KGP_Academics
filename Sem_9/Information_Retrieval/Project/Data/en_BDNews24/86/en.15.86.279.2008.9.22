 Chittagong, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Nabab and Company is the only firm to bid to run the Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Kamalapur, an official of Chittagong port said on Monday. "Over thirty firms collected application forms but only one company submitted the application," said Lt Col SM Firoz Ahmed, director (traffic) of Chittagong port. Handling of export and import goods at the lone public sector inland container depot came to standstill after the caretaker government cancelled an agreement with Global Agro Trade Company in May and floated a fresh tender. Ahmed said the proposal of Nabab and Company would be sent for evaluation to a committee of the Chittagong Port Authority. The proposal would then be passed on to the shipping ministry, he said. He ruled out the possibility of inviting further bids anytime soon for the purpose, saying the purchase rules do not pose a problem to evaluation of the company's proposal. The CPA opened the bid documents on Monday for work order to run the ICD for 10 years, Ahmed said. Project director Saiful Alam of Nabab and Company told bdnews24.com that his firm made a Tk 142.47 crore proposal to run the ICD. According to the terms of bidding, the company that will win the work order will have to collect necessary equipment for container handling at both Dhaka and Chittagong ends of the ICD. Alam said his company worked 24 hours in this sector. The CPA cancelled the agreement with GATCO on March 2 last year for breaking conditions of the agreement and called a fresh bidding on April 25. But the process of bidding remained suspended as GATCO, supposed to run the ICD for seven years, went to court. GATCO lost the appeal and the bidding process resumed in May this year. The BNP-led four-party alliance government had appointed GATCO for the job although it failed to win the bidding. The Anticorruption Commission filed a case with Tejgaon Police Station against former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her son Arafat Rahman Coco and 11 others on Sept 2 last year. It accused them of awarding GATCO a cargo-handling deal through misuse of power. bd
