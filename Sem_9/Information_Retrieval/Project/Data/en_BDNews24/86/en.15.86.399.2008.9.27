 ROME, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A. Ronaldinho and Andriy Shevchenko are vying to take injured forward Marco Borriello's place in AC Milan's starting lineup for Sunday's derby against Serie A champions Inter Milan (1830 GMT). The illustrious new arrivals started their team's victories over Reggina and Lazio on the bench, as Milan recovered after losing their first two league games. Coach Carlo Ancelotti, however, may opt to keep them both in the dugout and move Brazil playmaker Kaka up alongside his compatriot Alexandre Pato, who has scored three goals in the last three games. Borriello, who hurt his thigh after netting the opener in Wednesday's 2-1 win at Reggina, joins Alessandro Nesta, Philippe Senderos, Andrea Pirlo and Filippo Inzaghi on Milan's injured list. Inter coach Jose Mourinho will be unable to use Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari, who serves the last part of a three-match suspension on Sunday. Midfielder Luis Jimenez is injured for the leaders, while Maxwell and Luis Figo are doubts because of their respective calf and foot problems. Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi is expected to come back from an ankle knock for Juventus's visit to winless Sampdoria on Saturday (1600). Alex Manninger is likely to stand in again for goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who has a thigh strain. France's Philippe Mexes is tipped to return to bolster struggling AS Roma's defence for Sunday's game at home to Atalanta (1300), who are joint-second with Lazio with nine points from four games. But last year's runners-up cannot call on midfielder Daniele De Rossi, who is suspended after being sent off in Wednesday's 3-1 defeat at Genoa. Roma, who have just four points, also have a raft of injury problems affecting Juan, Marco Cassetti, David Pizarro and Julio Baptista while captain Francesco Totti is still battling for full fitness following knee surgery
