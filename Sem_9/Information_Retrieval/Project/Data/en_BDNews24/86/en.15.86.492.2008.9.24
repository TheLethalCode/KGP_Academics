 HONG KONG/LONDON, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett bet on a Wall Street revival by buying a $5 billion stake in Goldman Sachs and a Japanese bank looked ready to follow but markets were on edge as US lawmakers clashed over a financial sector rescue. Architects of the proposed $700 billion bailout for financial firms faced a second day of grilling by US lawmakers on Wednesday as the debate threatening to postpone a decision until next week. "We believe the buyout package that has been proposed by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve will be passed," said Andrew Barrett, managing director and strategist with Citi Private Client Investment in Hong Kong. "Markets will need to see this happen or we will have another leg down in the major global indices." Asian and European stock markets rose fractionally on Wednesday amid uncertainty about the bailout. The MSCI index of Asian shares outside Japan edged up 0.16 percent, and Tokyo rose 0.2 percent and Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 index of top companies was up 0.36 percent at 6:07 a.m. EDT. US stock futures were up just over 1 percent, pointing to a stronger start on Wall Street. "Buffett's legendary status as a value investor gives the bulls reason for optimism," said Chris Hossain, senior sales manager at ODL Securities. FBI REPORT US lawmakers set to discuss the size and content of the bailout on Wednesday will consider a CNN report that the FBI was investigating potential mortgage fraud involving firms and senior executives at the heart of the crisis. CNN said the FBI was trying to determine whether anyone in those financial institutions had any responsibility for providing "misinformation." It said these included mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc and insurer American International Group Inc. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will buy up to 9 percent of Goldman, which also announced plans to sell $2.5 billion in common stock. Berkshire will buy $5 billion of Goldman perpetual preferred stock which carries a 10 percent dividend. It also will receive warrants to buy $5 billion of common stock, or 43.5 million shares, at $115 per share, within five years, which could give the United States' second richest man and his investment vehicle roughly 9 percent of Goldman. Japan's third-largest bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, also plans to invest in Goldman, Japanese media reported on Wednesday. Japanese financial firms this week have already bought Lehman Brothers assets and a stake in Morgan Stanley as they take advantage of global upheaval to expand abroad. Sumitomo has had a long relationship with Goldman but spokeswoman Chika Togawa said: "At this point it is not true that we've decided to invest in Goldman Sachs." A Goldman spokesman said he could not confirm the Japanese media reports. While billions of dollars have poured in to buy up operations and stakes on Wall Street this week, political debate rages over the extent to which the US government should help financial firms stranded with toxic assets. Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, the Senate Banking Committee's top Republican, said the plan was aimed at rescuing the same institutions that created the crisis with "sloppy underwriting and reckless disregard for the risks they were creating, taking, or passing on to others. "What troubles me most is that we have been given no credible assurances that this plan will work. We could very well spend $700 billion and not resolve the crisis." Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and US Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke face a second day of questioning from lawmakers a day after Paulson told them during five hours of hearings that the bailout, while "sad" and "embarrassing," was needed to stave off a deep recession and restore confidence in markets. The financial crisis has become the No. 1 issue leading up to the November 4 US presidential election, and many lawmakers seeking re-election to Congress want to appear vigilant. A Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that Democrat Barack Obama has opened a 9-point lead over Republican John McCain in the US presidential race amid turmoil in the financial system and growing pessimism about the economy. $2,300 EACH The bailout, potentially the United States' biggest ever, could cost every American man, woman and child $2,300. At $700 billion it would eclipse the roughly $550 billion which the United States has spent on the Iraq war since 2003. Paulson and Bernanke said the plan might cost less once the government is able to resell mortgage securities. "We've still got plenty of uncertainty ahead of US Congress approving the rescue package," said Sarah-Jane Wagg, president director of UBS Securities Indonesia in Jakarta. Wall Street's woes are having far-reaching impact, with investor nerves frayed by two weeks of unprecedented markets turmoil
