 Shehabuddin Kisslu bdnews24.com New York correspondent New York , Sept 25: Chief advisor Fakhruddin Ahmed has brushed aside allegations that his interim administration violated the constitution by not staging the general elections by the 90-day deadline. "We did not violate the constitution delaying the national parliament elections beyond the 90 days time period," he said at a news conference in New York on Thursday. "This caretaker government is a constitutional government," he said and referred to a High Court verdict. Fakhruddin denied allegations that his administration had struck a compromise deal with political parties and corrupt power lobby under which all politicians facing graft charges were bail out of prison. "No questions about compromise." "When the accused were denied bail there was criticism too. "All will be served justice under the existing law." The interim government head took questions from journalists. On whether former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia were eligible to run for the general elections slated for Dec. 18, Fakhruddin said the government would not interfere in the issue. On electoral reforms, he said, "Reforms are not to be forced on political parties. He asserted that political parties had been involved in the process of the amendment to the Representation of the People Order by engaging in discussions and making suggestions. On the Election Commission's indication of rescheduling the Upazila elections, the chief advisor said, "It is the Election Commission who are the authority to change election schedule." He added that the government made sure the commission got all the cooperation it needed.
