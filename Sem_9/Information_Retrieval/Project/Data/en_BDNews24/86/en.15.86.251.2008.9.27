<TEXT>
 Bhola, Sept 27 (Bdnews24.com) Ferry movement resumed on the Bhola-Laxmipur river route on Saturday after 20 days. It was halted on Sept 6 due to the reduction of navigability over submerged chars in the Meghna River. Shah Alam, deputy director of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, told reporters: "A three-member team (led by Alam) surveyed the route up to Bhola's Ilisha from Laxmipur's Maju Chowdhury Hat from Sept 23-25 and recommended restarting ferry movement with the tide." "Until the Banger Char and Ramdashpur channels are dredged, ferries can ply only during high tide," he said. He added: "Regular ferry schedule will be resumed after 15 days if ferry movement becomes easy without the tide." Ferry Ketoki travelled to Ilisha from Maju Chowdhury Hat. The ferry service was introduced on Feb 27 this year between Bhola's Ilisha and Laxmipur's Maju Chowdhury Hat aiming at making river travel easier from Bhola and its surrounding areas to Sylhet and Chittagong. Three ferries, the Kishori, Kamini and Ketoki, ply the route. After the route was closed on Sept 6, the Kishori and Kamini were relocated to Mawa ferry terminal. Asked about the relocated vessels, Alam said, "We will decide later about this." bdnews24
