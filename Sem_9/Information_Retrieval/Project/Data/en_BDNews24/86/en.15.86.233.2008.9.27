<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)  Veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed struck Citycell B. League's first hat trick to power Sheikh Russel KC to a massive 5-0 home win over Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra at Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. Alfaz's hat trick not only gave Sheikh Russel its big win in season but also took them to the top of the points table with title contenders Brothers Union with seven points each from three outings before the Eid-ul-fitr break, beginning Sunday. Holders Abahani Limited are just one point behind the joint leaders having played three matches. Dhaka Mohammedan SC and Chittagong Abahani Limited have four points each with Mohammedan playing a match less than the Chittagong side. Apart from the Alfaz treble, winger Monwar Hossain and Moroccan medio Ezzansoun Said struck one each for Sheikh Russel, who were held to a 1-1 draw against hosts Chittagong Mohammedan before their first home win over Farashganj SC by 3-2. The new football powerhouse, Sheikh Russel, dominated over the visitors throughout the game on the rain-soaked pitch and produced a plenty of chances, but converted only two of them in first half before adding three more after the break. Khulna Abahani, who stunned Muktijoddha Sangsad 2-1 and went down 3-1 against Brothers Union at home, were a pale shadow of their previous performance though the visitors sometimes cracked Russel's feeble backline, without injured Hasan, Burdeep and suspended Parvez Babu, but they could not break the last wall of keeper Khaled Azam Biplob. Sheikh Russel went ahead in the very sixth minute when Aminul Islam whipped in a cross from the right that beat Abahani two defenders and goalkeeper and fell to unmarked Monwar, who didn't hesitate to send the ball to the open net. Afterwards, Alfaz and Said came close to a second at least thrice with edgeless finishing before Alfaz doubled the lead in the 25th minute as the ace striker, capitalising on a back-pass from Said inside the box, fired a left footer home. Sheikh Russel should have got the third in a reminder of the first half, but Alfaz hit goalkeeper Nahiduddin from a handshaking distance while Monwar floated over and Moroccan Ighir Mohammad drove wide of the near post from close. After the breather, Sheikh Russel's coach Wazed Gazi sent Mobarrak Hossian to add to the pace on the right and the little man did his job accordingly with his some threatening crosses. Five minutes into the second half, Said ran middle of the left to release a ball to Ighir on the top of the edge to advance into the danger zone before poking the ball home into keeper Nahiduddin's legs after collecting a backheel from Igir to make the margin 3-0. Alfaz then struck his second in the 71st minute when Said from the left advanced into the box to release a nice ball from the touchline with Alfaz tapping the ball home to make it 4-0. The ace striker, who also smashed the first hat trick in the inaugural professional league, completed his treble with a dazzling fashion as he dodged past two defenders and substitute goal keeper Foyez Ahmed and sent the ball home from a seemingly difficult angle in the 78th minute. Alfaz will join the national camp Sunday as 26 players out of 30 selected players had already joined the residential camp at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. "I am trying to prove myself as I am yet to lose, though some people say it," Alfaz after the match told reporters adding that a recall for the national team was inspiring him much to play better.
