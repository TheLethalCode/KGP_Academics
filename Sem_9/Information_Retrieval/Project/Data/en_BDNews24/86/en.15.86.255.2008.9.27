 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)Saudi Arabia has promised initiatives to improve the quality of life for Bangladeshis working in the kingdom, an adviser said Saturday. During a UNGA sideline meeting in New York between foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, the latter acknowledged the contribution of Bangladeshi workers in his country and assured welfare measures for them. The foreign adviser proposed setting a minimum wage for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia. Prince Saud al-Faisal said the proposal would be conveyed to the labour ministry for scrutiny. "We have agreed that both sides will initiate measures to advance the quality of life of the workers and promote their welfare," Iftekhar Ahmed said in a statement issued from New York. "Prince Saud al Faisal noted with appreciation their contribution," the statement said. Dhaka's concern over the welfare of Bangladeshis in Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia, has been raised by recent events highlighting poor working conditions and wages of unskilled and semi-skilled workers. Bangladeshis are the largest group of foreign nationals in Saudi Arabia. According to the kingdom, more than 1,765,000 Bangladeshis live and work there. While the government has been trying to persuade the Saudi government through diplomacy to raise wages, the kingdom has deported hundreds of Bangladeshi workers for violation of local laws. Saturday's statement said the adviser briefed Prince Saud al Faisal on the recent political developments and the chief adviser's address to the nation announcing national polls on 18 December. Prince Saud al Faisal thanked him for the briefing and assured him of the continued support of the Saudi government in the fulfilling of the government's goals, it said. The Saudi Minister conveyed his "warm invitation" to Iftekhar Chowdhury to visit Saudi Arabia at a mutually acceptable date. bdn
