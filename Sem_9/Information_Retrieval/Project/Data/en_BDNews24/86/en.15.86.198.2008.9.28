 Chittagong, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Ten people were injured when transport workers and the police fought pitched battles at an inter-district bus station in the port city on Sunday, halting bus operations and stranding homebound people. The police and local people said shortly before midday a patrol police had beaten the driver of a bus of Palki Paribahan after he had tried to drive the bus off the queue at Kadamtala inter-district bus station. The violence erupted when transport workers attacked the police and blocked Kadamtali-New Market road. The workers alleged that police fired gunshots to disperse them. Some of the injured have been identified as bus driver Shukkur Miah, worker Babul, police sub- Mujib, constables Musa, Lal Miah, Osman, Morshed and Mintu. Transport worker Afzal Hossain told bdnews24.com that the police roughed Shukkur up on charges of breaking the queue. The angry workers also swooped on the police, he said. Homebound people faced trouble as the buses for Feni, Noakhali, Comilla and Chandpur districts failed to leave the station. The police were trying to douse the tension on the scene, said Chittagong metropolitan assistant police commissioner Iltutmish. "We are trying to find the reason behind the clash and will take action if any policeman is found responsible," he said. On whether the police fired on the angry workers, he said: "We will investigate the matter also." Deputy commissioner of police Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the police held a meeting with Kadamtali Inter-District Bus Owners' Association. "We have reached an understanding and the bus movement resumed from 2:30pm," the association's general secretary Md Sharif said. bdnew
