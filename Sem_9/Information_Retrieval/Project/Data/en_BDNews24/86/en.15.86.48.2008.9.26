 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Sector Commanders' Forum, a platform of independence war commanders, on Friday urged the government to publish a list of 1971 war criminals by Oct 15. Otherwise, the Forum said it would prepare the list. Coordinator of the Forum former army chief retired lieutenant general Harunur Rashid made the demand at a views exchange meeting with the editors and senior journalists at Dhaka Club. He said, "If the government does not publish the list of war criminals by October 15 the Forum will publish the list based on the information and evidence it has." He dismissed the Election Commission's announcement that the war criminals would not be allowed to run elections as a 'trick'. Because, he said, the commission had made the announcement without identifying the war criminals. "As a nation we will have to decide whether the war criminals will come to power through next election. The list of the war criminals will be prepared so that they cannot participate in the election and the people will be motivated not to vote them." General Harun referred to chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda's recent comment after dialogue with Jamaat-e-Islami where he said, "Oh my God, what do I hear from the hujoors (religious leaders) in the holy month of Ramadan!" He said, "Since its birth Jamaat has been involved with unholy activities in the name of religion. They speak one thing and do another. This is their character." Jammat-e-Islami has long been accused by freedom fighters, politicians and historians of harbouring war criminals who collaborated with the Pakistani occupation forces in the genocide in the county's independence struggle. The party and its top brass are also accused of siding with the Pakistani rulers. The Forum said if any political party forged electoral alliance with the war criminals, they would boycott that party. President of the organisation retired air vice marshal AK Khandker said, "After 1991 the nation has now reached a juncture which is important for the future generation. "We will have to remain alert so that those who do not believe in our independence, those who opposed our liberation war cannot come to power." "We will make the list of war criminals with evidence so that it sustains." He asked the editors not to publish the news of the war criminals. "We seek all-out cooperation of the media." The deputy chief of the Liberation War stressed on motivating people with two slogans "We will not vote for war criminals" and "We will not vote for anti-liberation elements." Retired major generals KM Shafiullah and CR Dutta, journalists Golam Sarwar, Hasan Shahriar, Jaglul Ahmed Chowdhury, Baby Moudud, Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury, Manzurul Ahsan Bulbul, Farid Hossain, Harun Habib, Saiful Alam, Shyamol Dutta, M Hamid and retired brigadier Khurshid Alam were present. bdne
