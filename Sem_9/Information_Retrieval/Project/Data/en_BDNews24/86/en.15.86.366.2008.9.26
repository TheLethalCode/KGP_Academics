 Mumbai, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, jointly organised by the Australian, Indian and South African boards, will be played at three venues in India from Dec. 3 to 10, organisers said on Thursday. An off-shoot of a highly successful Indian version, the $6 million prize money Champions League will feature eight teams, two each from Australia, India and South Africa and the champions of the English and Pakistani domestic leagues. Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai will host the league matches with the final being played in Mumbai on December 10. The tournament will be contested by 12 teams in year two, organising chairman Lalit Modi said. The eight teams will be divided in to groups of four and the leaders of Group A will meet the runners-up of Group B and vice versa in semi-finals. The prize money up for grabs for the tournament is US$6 million, which is five times what the Rajasthan Royals got for winning the IPL earlier this year. The Champions League organisers had earlier announced a prize pool of $5 million but that has now been raised.
