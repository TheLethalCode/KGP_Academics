<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 23 (bdnews24.com)The capital market has bucked a trend this year; with only two trading days to Eid, the Dhaka Stock Exchange saw its turnover still hovering around the Tk 3 billion mark on Tuesday. The market is known to suffer an annual fund crisis prior to the country's major religious festival of Eid-Ul-Fitr as investorsespecially small-scale onessell-off their holdings to meet holiday expenses. This time, however, the scenario is quite different. Market watchers said profit-taking was still there this year, but the impact was not so great as the market had grown substantially over the past one year. "In the past, at this time of year, the market faced serious lack of funds," DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. "But over the past year, the number of investors in the market almost tripled." The impact of profit-taking prior to any occasion is not so hard felt in a market of this size, he said. Market expert Abu Ahmed echoed the bourse official. "In a market where the number of investors is more than a million this level of sell-offs does not affect the market liquidity." He added, however, that around 10 percent of investors have already withdrawn their funds from the market to meet festival expenses. But, more and more money is being pumped into the market every day. Market analyst and CEO of private assets management company AIMS of Bangladesh, Yaweer Sayeed said cash was abundant. "And people have a taste for gambling." Speaking on the impact of price hikes and Eid expenses on the market, Sayeed said since prices are skyrocketing people are investing in a bid to supplement their incomes. MA Kashem of Prime Securities agreed with Sayeed and added that profit-taking before Eid was not affecting the market in a major way. bdn
