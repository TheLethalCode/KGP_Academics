 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Thursday the sincerity of the caretaker government about staging general elections should not be questioned. "Date of the national polls was at the centre of the people's demands. The announcement of the election date removed all uncertainty about polls. We are now working to ensure quality," the adviser said at a press briefing at communications ministry. "The government wanted to keep the atmosphere of faith in it intact." Communications adviser Ghulam Quader, Local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, all of whom along with Hossain Zillur have been engaged in the government's dialogues with political parties, were present. "We hope everything will be alright soon. We have been working to fulfil the expectations of the people of the country." The adviser said the government wanted to achieve its goal avoiding the culture of dispute. He said they wanted to take the dialogue to the people to know their expectations about the elections. Hossain Zillur reiterated that the government would organise three policy-framing conferences to discuss policies for the country after the polls. "We've received feedback from the political parties on the matter. It will be arranged in discussion with them," he added. On the meeting between advisers and Awami League Sheikh Hasina in New York, the adviser said, "We are trying to create a level playing field. That is why we are having talks with all including the top leaders." On the development on a proposed meeting between BNP chief Khaleda Zia and Hasina, the adviser said, "The government is thinking about the matter. People view it positively. But they (Khaleda and Hasina) need to be interested." "It can take place if only they are interested. Nothing can be imposed." bdne
