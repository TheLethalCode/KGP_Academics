 NEW YORK, Mon Sep 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sought shelter with the Federal Reserve to survive a financial storm that destroyed their rivals, and Wall Street braced for a week of political wrangling over a proposed $700 billion bailout for troubled banks. Morgan Stanley went a step further and struck a deal with Japan's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, which agreed on Monday to buy up to a 20 percent stake in the prestigious 73-year-old investment bank, sending Morgan Stanley shares up 10 percent in morning trading. The Fed's agreement to convert the once high-flying investment banks into more conventional depositary institutions was Washington's latest effort to restore calm to chaotic markets. It followed frantic talks between the Bush administration and Congress to prevent the crisis from pushing the economy into severe recession. The agreement announced late on Sunday effectively scraps the investment bank model synonymous with Wall Street, ensuring Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley avoid the fate of rivals that either collapsed or were taken over in the worst U.S. financial crisis since the Great Depression. Both will face a thicket of new regulations, including the capital requirements that have insulated conventional banks from the year-old credit crisis. The changes will bolster their resources but also curb the spectacular profit growth that have made investment bankers among the highest paid in the nation. Markets remained skeptical. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 1.2 percent, led by falls in bank stocks on uncertainty over the proposed $700 billion financial sector bailout, the largest-ever bank rescue. While U.S. congressional Democrats expressed support on Sunday for quick approval of the rescue plan, they cautioned that it must include provisions to guard against potential abuses, raising questions over how long it will take to be passed and what it will ultimately look like. Democrats, who control both chambers of Congress, expressed concern that the bailout program could expand the powers of the executive branch without adequate oversight -- a frequent Democratic criticism of President George W. Bush. The rescue plan would give sweeping powers to the U.S. Treasury to buy up toxic mortgage-related debt from financial groups, including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks. "We need to see more details from the rescue package. What is missing is the price the U.S. authorities are going to pay for the toxic assets," said Heino Ruland, analyst at FrankfurtFinanz. Markets elsewhere in the world were helped as a movement to curtail short selling gathered force: the Netherlands, Taiwan and Australia all announced various curbs over the weekend. The rescue was cobbled together late in a week of seismic shifts on Wall Street that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc file for bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc agree to sell itself to Bank of America Corp, and the Fed stage an $85 billion rescue for insurer American International Group Inc. LAST SURVIVORS Goldman and Morgan Stanley were the last surviving of the big five investment banks that shaped 20 years of Wall Street history. Bear Stearns collapsed earlier this year. In their heyday, the investment banks took greater risks than their Fed-regulated rivals were allowed to. In return for tighter regulation, Goldman and Morgan Stanley will gain greater access to central bank funds and will find it easier to buy retail banks. "It creates a perception of greater safety and supervision," said Chip MacDonald, mergers partner at law firm Jones Day. After the Fed move, a mooted merger with banking group Wachovia Corp was no longer Morgan Stanley's priority, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group moved quickly to announce plans to buy up to one-fifth of Morgan Stanley as part of a strategic alliance that would cost about $6 billion based on Morgan Stanley's total market value of $30 billion. Elsewhere, Japan's biggest brokerage, Nomura Holdings Inc, is to buy the Asian operations of Lehman, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said. In Europe, Nomura and Britain's Barclays Plc have pitched bids for parts of Lehman's business, as administrators seek to save as many jobs as possible. Barclays is interested in Lehman's European equities business, a person familiar with the matter said. That could include 1,000 to 1,500 bankers and support staff, mostly in London. AIG's former chief executive, Robert Willumstad, has decided to forego a $22 million severance payment because he was unable to implement a restructuring plan he developed, The Wall Street Journal reported. Major shareholders concerned about the government takeover plan to meet on Monday to discuss alternatives, the newspaper said. As the crisis reverberated across the globe, the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors said they were maintaining "heightened close cooperation" to safeguard the international financial system. World stock markets were battered last week before the bailout plan sparked a rebound on Friday that added more than $1.5 trillion to the value of stocks. STOP THE BLEEDING With the economy the No. 1 issue in a presidential election less than six weeks away, lawmakers are striving to get a plan in place by the end of the week, fearing delay could send markets reeling again. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said he thinks Congress can give U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the authority and the resources he needs. "It's important we act quickly and but more important that we act responsibly," Dodd told the CBS Early Show. Two key questions remained unanswered even after Paulson appeared on four television talk shows on Sunday to press his case for emergency action: What price will the government pay for these bad debts, and when will it start buying them? Paulson cast the proposed market intervention as a lesser evil, arguing the consequences of inaction would be more dire than the large burden on taxpayers, while Democrats began to swap proposals with the Treasury. "Democrats believe a responsible solution should include independent oversight, protections for homeowners, and constraints on excessive executive compensation," said California Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House of Representatives. Both Democrats and Republicans predicted lawmakers were likely to pass a bill by week's end. Paulson said the final cost of the bailout should fall well short of the $700 billion initial price tag since the government would be able to hold the debt until markets stabilize and prices recover. "This is the least costly path," he said
