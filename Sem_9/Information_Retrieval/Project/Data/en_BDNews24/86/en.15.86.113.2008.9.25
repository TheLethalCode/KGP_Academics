 MADRID, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid new boy Rafael van der Vaart scored a hat-trick to help the champions thrash promoted Sporting Gijon 7-1 in the Primera Liga on Wednesday. Sporting were subjected to a 6-1 beating at home to Barcelona on Sunday and were quickly on the back foot at the Bernabeu as Netherlands midfielder Van der Vaart completed his hat-trick in the 46th minute. A brace from Raul and further goals from Gonzalo Higuain and Arjen Robben completed a miserable four days for the top-flight newcomers.

The Argentina winger crossed for Eto'o to tap in from close range, but Barca were knocked back after the break when Luciano Monzon drove a free kick through the wall for his side's first goal this season. Jose Mari's clever lob levelled the match before the home side got back into gear.
