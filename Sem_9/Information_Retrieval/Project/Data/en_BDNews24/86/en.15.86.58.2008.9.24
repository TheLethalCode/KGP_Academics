 VIENNA, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia's new coach Radomir Antic said on Tuesday he wanted to rebuild the country's football landscape by helping to clean up corruption and fan violence. "With the help of the police, our new FA president (Tomislav Karadzic) and I want to get rid of corruption in the game in our country, as well as halt the outbreaks of fan violence." Serbian FA (FSS) president Zvezdan Terzic stepped down in March this year over charges of fraud and abuse of power brought by the country's interior ministry. Antic also told the UEFA Conference for European National Coaches: "I'm very pleased with my new job because it gives me the chance to help rebuild Serbian football. "We need team spirit on and off the pitch. "Serbs are hot-tempered people but they love football. We have to turn this emotion into positive energy again. People must come to the stadiums to celebrate our sport." Serbian soccer has been rife with violence and corruption in the past 15 years as the effects of isolation and economic mismanagement crippled the game amid a series of bloody conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. Last week, the Serbian authorities showed a new level of determination to crack down on violence after a Red Star Belgrade fan was sentenced to 10 years in jail for assaulting a police officer with a burning flare during a league match last December. Antic, the 59-year-old successor to Miroslav Djukic, who was fired after Serbia came bottom of their group at this year's Olympic Games, said he was ready to straighten up domestic football. "We have already set up training programmes for all ages and are currently refurbishing the infrastructure." Antic, the only man to have managed Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, has not been a coach since leaving Celta Vigo four years ago and has worked as a media commentator. Antic, whose team face a tough 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign in a group including France and Romania, claimed "the problems in our country have led many players (to go) abroad. "However, several of them may have signed on with big clubs, but are only substitutes. Therefore, it is tough for me to find a decent bunch of players with enough match practice." In their first two Group Seven qualifiers, Serbia beat the Faroe Islands 2-0 at home but lost 2-1 to France in Paris. "Our group is very open, so it is vital to win the home games and take as many points on the road as possible. "In order to 'stay alive' we must beat Lithuania now, before we travel to Vienna. Austria defeated France, so they can beat anybody in our group." Serbia host surprise group leaders Lithuania on Oct. 11 before visiting Austria four days later
