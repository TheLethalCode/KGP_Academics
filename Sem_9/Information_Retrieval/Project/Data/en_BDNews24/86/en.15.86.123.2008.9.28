"They made life difficult for us. It's credit to the defences that it was a draw and credit to Samp, who closed down the gaps," Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri told Sky television. "The only time we had a counter-attack we hit the post. We are not thinking about the standings, there's no anxiety." Nevertheless, Ranieri will be worried about his side's lack of success in front of goal as they have scored only four times in their first five league games. Later on Saturday, Fiorentina beat Genoa 1-0 at home thanks to a second-half Alberto Gilardino strike to rebound from Wednesday's 3-0 drubbing at Lazio.
