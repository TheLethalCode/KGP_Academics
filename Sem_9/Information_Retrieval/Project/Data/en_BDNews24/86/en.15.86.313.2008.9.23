<TITLE> China avoids direct comment on new Japan leader Aso </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Tue Sep 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China avoided commenting directly on the election of hawkish Taro Aso as Japan's new leader, with a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman saying on Tuesday only that good ties were in the interests of both countries. An outspoken nationalist, Aso won the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership vote on Monday, succeeding Yasuo Fukuda, who had focused on improving long-strained ties with Beijing. Aso, a former foreign minister, has been wary of China and wants Japan to wield more regional clout. But he has also said he will not visit the Yasukuni Shrine, a memorial to Japan's war dead seen by many in Asia as symbolizing the nation's past military aggression. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu did not even refer to Aso by name when asked about his election. "Japan's election is its own internal affair," Jiang told a regular news briefing. "To maintain healthy and stable Sino-Japanese relations accords with the interests of both countries and peoples." She added that China was willing to work with Japan to deepen ties but did not elaborate further. But a commentary in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, was more forthright. "With Fukuda gone and Aso stepping up, without doubt a lot of uncertainty will come to Sino-Japanese relations," said a commentary written by Jin Xide, a Chinese expert on Japan. Fukuda sought to ease contention that marred Sino-Japanese relations during the 2001-2006 tenure of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, who repeatedly visited the Yasukuni shrine. Fukuda met Chinese President Hu Jintao in Tokyo in May in high-profile talks to cement warming ties. The two sides announced an initial agreement in June on ending friction over gas beds under the East China Sea
