<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)Speakers at a discussion Wednesday called upon Dhaka City Corporation to play the key role in celebrating Dhaka's 400-year anniversary. Emphasising the need to overhaul the capital, they said DCC must take radical measures to fittingly mark the occasion. The preparatory meeting for the upcoming anniversary celebrations was hosted by DCC at the city's Hotel Purbani, with mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka in the chair. "We want to celebrate this anniversary with the inclusion of all people irrespective of caste, creed, and religion," said the mayor. He pointed out that there was some dispute over whether Dhaka's origins as a city should be dated from 1608 or 1610. "The anniversary celebrations may continue therefore for two years," he said, adding that a decision on this would be made at a later date. Sirajul Islam, president of Bangladesh Asiatic Society, said: "The anniversary should be observed in such a way so that another four hundred years of inspiration arise from it." "Celebrations of urban life, including arts, culture, and sports, may be organised by various organisations. But DCC must coordinate the finance, management, and publicity sides," he said. Dhaka University professor Muntasir Mamun also called on DCC to "spearhead the anniversary programmes". "For those who have started organising among themselves, DCC must take initiates to bring them together." "If the anniversary celebrations are to continue until 2010, there needs to be coordination by DCC in such a way that if a new mayor is elected, the anniversary won't be hampered." He urged DCC to reclaim encroached public lands and parks, to protect water bodies in the city, make the city pollution-free, and launch the first urban museum in South Asia. Emaj Uddin, ex-vice chancellor of Dhaka University said, "Dhaka has fallen into awfully bad shape. There need to be short-term and long-term measures to tackle the urban problems." Speaking of the need to restore the lost glory of the capital, he said: "A central committee led by the DCC mayor has to be formed, with the necessary sub-committees to tackle the myriad issues at stake." Mayor Khoka assured that the formation of appropriate committees would be decided at the next such meeting. Shamsuzzaman Khan, former director general of the National Museum, writers Mafidul Huque and Imdadul Huq Milon, M Hamid, president of Bangladesh Group Theatre Federation, and Enam Ahmed Chowdhury, former chairman of Privatisation Commission were present among others. bdnews
