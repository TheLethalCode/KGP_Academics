<TITLE> Fabregas points to Arsenal success up north </TITLE>

 LONDON, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  A wonderfully acerbic collection of soccer cliches entitled "Football Lexicon" cuts to the heart of the debate over London club Arsenal. Under the entry Wednesday night in Rochdale the authors refer to a location ("usually northern") and a date ("invariably midweek") when foreign players of suspect temperament fall apart. Arsenal, their critics argue, fall into this category, dazzling at the Emirates Stadium but failing against inferior but harder-edged northern teams in the depths of the English winter. Failure to win a trophy of any type after promising Premier League and Champions League campaigns in 2007-08 gives weight to the sceptics' claims. At the launch of a video game "Real Football 2009" at a London nightclub on Thursday, Cesc Fabregas, the 21-year-old Spain midfielder who has matured into one of Arsenal's most influential players, was asked to define why this season should be any different. In reply, Fabregas pointed to Arsenal's recent visit to the north-west where they scored seven goals and collected six points from matches against Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers. "I think we have seen a nice difference playing these last two games at Bolton and Blackburn," he told Reuters television ahead of the league leaders' home game with Hull City on Saturday. "It was a long trip and we were maybe not at our best. Normally in these games against Bolton and Blackburn we are always struggling. We scored seven goals and only conceded one." ATTACKING ETHOS Arsenal won against both sides by staying true to the attacking ethos preached by manager Arsene Wenger, who transformed a club once castigated for their dour attritional football and remains dedicated to youthful flair and promise. Yet even the professorial Frenchman's most devoted supporters were concerned when midfielders Aleksandr Hleb and Mathieu Flamini left in the close season with no obvious replacements in sight. Did Fabregas ever doubt his mentor's judgment? "Never," said the Spaniard, who signed an eight-year contract with Arsenal two years ago when he could have conceivably gone anywhere in Europe. "I will never do that. You know him and you know he will always have something that not me, not you, not nobody, will know. "You have to trust him and respect him for what he has done in football. All you can do is try to play your football and he will do the rest. He does it his way and he does it very well." Dressed in a black sweater, jeans and white trainers, the deceptively simple kit of a wealthy man, Fabregas demonstrated a composure beyond his years, befitting a man who has played in European Championship, Champions League and FA Cup finals. Responsibility sits comfortably on his slim shoulders. "There are still a lot of players older than me," said Fabregas. "I feel important to the team, I will try to help them with all my powers
