 HONG KONG, Wed Sep 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A powerful typhoon plowed into a densely populated area of south China Wednesday, triggering a "once-in-a-century storm tide" in several cities, state media said. Authorities evacuated more than 100,000 people before typhoon Hagupit made landfall around dawn. The storm killed at least eight people in the Philippines earlier in the week. Streets were deserted and shops and businesses shuttered as the storm uprooted trees and brought down billboards in cities across the booming southern Chinese province of Guangdong, including Maoming where the center of the storm made landfall. The state news agency Xinhua said a fishing boat sank but no casualties were reported. It described typhoon Hagupit as "the worst to hit Guangdong in more than a decade," but it was not clear by what gauge it was measuring the storm when typhoons in the past have triggered heavy death tolls. High winds destroyed a petrol station along the Zhanjiang section of State Highway 325 and a factory under construction. The local government said no casualties were reported in either accident. Hagupit triggered a once-in-a-century storm tide -- a high flood period in which water levels can rise to more than 5 meters above the normal tide -- in several coastal cities including Foshan, Zhongshan, Zhuhai, Jiangmen and Yangjiang. "The water level at Dashi hydrological station in the provincial capital Guangzhou was 2.73 meters, a 100-year record, and it showed no sign of subsiding by midday," Xinhua said. It did not say if there was imminent danger of flooding from the tide. Hagupit whipped past Hong Kong overnight, uprooting trees and causing flash floods in low-lying areas including Lantau island where the city's airport is located, with dozens of people injured across the territory. Tropical storms in the region gather intensity from the warm ocean waters and frequently develop into typhoons that hit Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines and southern China during a season that lasts from early summer to late autumn. Another storm was brewing to the east of the Philippines. Tropical Storm Risk said the storm, named "nineteen," was expected to strengthen and head west toward China, following a similar path to Hagupit which was headed into north Vietnam
