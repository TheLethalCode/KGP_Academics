<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com)Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Qader claimed there was no legal bar against his travelling abroad for medical treatment, after he was stopped from boarding a flight to New Delhi on Saturday. "There is no legal impediment to my travelling abroad, as reports of the medical board were submitted to the court. The home ministry had given permission for me to go abroad for treatment," Qader told reporters BSMMU Hospital. The AL leader was set to fly to the Indian capital on a Jet Airways flight at 9.20am, but was forced to return to the hospital after being barred from boarding the flight. Party official Tareque Shams Himu, who was to accompany Qader, told reporters: "An immigration official, after making us wait for one and half hours, told us that he was prohibited from travelling abroad." His lawyer AKM Amin Uddin said that they had applied to the home ministry on Sept 17 seeking permission to send Qader abroad for treatment. "We were verbally informed by the ministry that he could go abroad," the lawyer said. "If I am accused, try me. But until then I have the right to survive as a citizen," Qader said back at the hospital. "Why should I be allowed to die slowly? Why such injustice?" he asked. Qader did not reply when asked whether he would challenge the government as to why he was not allowed to fly. "I will follow the medical board's suggestion." "If the board says that it will be possible to get my treatment here, I will do that. I won't urge to the government to send me abroad for better treatment," he said. "I don't want to do politics from a hospital bed," the AL leader said. Qader has been suffering a number of serious ailments, including a neurological disease causing muscle wastage and weakness. He was released on bail at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital on Sep 5, where he remained for treatment. He was arrested on March 9, 2007 on graft charges. bdnews24.
