 Dhaka, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com)  GrameenPhone and Bangladesh Post Office (BPO) have closed a deal that allows the country's largest mobile phone operator to supply over 24,000 SIMs to staff working in more than 8,000 post offices countrywide. GP chief executive officer Anders Jensen and BPO director general Mobasherur Rahman inked the agreement on Wednesday at the city's Westin Hotel. Special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of post and telecoms ministry MA Malek, secretary Iqbal Mahmud and other officials of ministry were also present at the ceremony. In March, the BPO invited expressions of interest asking for solution that would help postal employees generate income and facilitate communications among them. The GP's proposal was picked as it was deemed as 'the most economical', said BPO chief Mobasherur Rahman. Malek thanked the GP for the initiative that he believed would enhance the state postal entity's services. He however, said that GP should increase its infrastructure base since its subscriber base had almost touched 20 million. "We get complaints especially from rural areas," he said. Jensen said he believed the partnership would usher in another 'new dimension' to the services provided by the postal services. The connections provided by GP to the BPO's rural post office employees blends recharging facilities, Flexiload, with voice and data services, Health Line and Bill Pay services. The endeavor is believed to enable revenue-generating source for rural post office employees and the BPO headquarters as GP would share 5 percent of the revenue generated from these connections with the BPO. bd
