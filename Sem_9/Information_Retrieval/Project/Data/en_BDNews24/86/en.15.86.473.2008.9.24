<TITLE> China official says milk scandal 'under control' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China has brought a tainted milk scandal in which thousands of children fell ill with kidney stones under control, a senior official said on Wednesday, as Premier Wen Jiabao vowed tougher controls. Beijing is battling public alarm and international dismay after close to 13,000 Chinese children crowded hospitals, ill from infant milk formula tainted with melamine, a cheap industrial chemical that can be used to cheat quality checks. But Xiang Yuzhang, the national quality watchdog's chief inspection official, told reporters that consumers could now rest easy after a widespread recall of tainted products and increased testing of dairy goods. "The Chinese government has taken a series of very strong measures to get to the bottom of this matter," Xiang said on the sidelines of a food safety conference in Beijing. "I have just returned from an inspection trip to the regions. At present, there is basically no melamine problem anymore in the Chinese market, including for producers... "There is no problem. It has been brought under control, more or less. There are no more problems in the market," he added. "As far as I know, there will be no more bad news." So far, four deaths have been blamed on kidney stones and complications caused by the toxic milk. China's latest food safety crisis has triggered arrests, official sackings and bans and tightened inspections in trade partners.

China would "strengthen institutional development, and take seriously supervision and inspections in every link of production, truly ensuring the interests of consumers," Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying. This was not the first time that a Chinese leader has sought to reassure a foreign audience that the country was cracking down on unsafe products. Last year, China launched a quality drive after a surge of scares over toys, toothpaste, pharmaceutical ingredients and pet food ingredients -- which were also laced with melamine. At that time, Chinese officials often said foreign media and critics had exaggerated the country's problems. But now they are focused on quelling domestic alarm and anger, with 54,000 Chinese children affected and over 100 in a serious condition, revelations of a government-blessed cover-up, and consumers wondering just what milk products might be safe. China has said it found melamine in nearly 10 percent of milk and drinking yoghurt samples from three major dairy companies. Robert Madelin, director-general for health and consumer protection at the European Commission, told the same conference which Xiang attended that the scandal had implications beyond China. "In an area such as melamine, what we can say is that all big players are in a world market. So what happens in China is affecting also foreign investors in China, with European capital or American capital. It is affecting traders in Europe with interests in China, with friends in China, with sources in China," he said. New Zealand dairy export giant Fonterra Co-operative Group slashed the value of its big investment in China's Sanlu Group by nearly 70 percent on Wednesday. Sanlu has been at the center of the scandal, with many of the infant poisonings linked to its popular milk powder. The official Xinhua news agency reported that Sanlu knew for many months that its infant milk powder was tainted. Fonterra repeated that it first knew of the contamination in early August, and took what it regarded as the best action by working with local Chinese authorities on a product recall. "If something did exist prior to that we're shocked that it did and we obviously feel that if people were aware of it it should have gone to the board," chief executive Andrew Ferrier told a media briefing in Auckland. Fonterra cut the value of its 43 percent stake in Sanlu to about NZ$62 million ($42 million).
