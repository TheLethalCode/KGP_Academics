 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has returned Sheikh Hasina's bail petitions in two corruption cases, involving Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd and the setting up of three barge-mounted power plants, her lawyer says. The vacation bench of Justice AKM Fazlur Rahman and Justice Sheikh Abdul Awal on Tuesday returned the two appeals on the grounds that the court did not have the jurisdiction to hear them. "The bench led by Justice AKM Fazlur Rahman returned the two bail prayers as the bench did not have jurisdiction to hear such appeals. Later, we took the matter up with chief justice MM Ruhul Amin," said the former prime minister's lawyer Fazle Nur Taposh. He said the chief justice assigned the vacation bench of Justice Anwarul Haque and Justice Jubayer Rahman Chowdhury to hear the two appeals on Monday. "We will file the two appeals of Sheikh Hasina with the vacation bench led by Justice Anwarul Haque." The petitions for bail for the Awami League chief were filed on Sept. 22. The vacation bench of Justice Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Justice Md Raisuddin is set to hear the former prime minister's bail petition in Noor Ali extortion case on Wednesday. The appeal was launched with the bench on Sept. 21. Hasina is on parole for treatment in the U.S. bdne
