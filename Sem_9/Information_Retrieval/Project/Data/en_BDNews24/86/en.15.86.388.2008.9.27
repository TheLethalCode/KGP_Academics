 JOHANNESBURG, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plans to play the next round of African World Cup qualifiers at the same time have been ditched after complaints from participating countries. FIFA had ordered 22 matches across 12 groups to kick off at 1300 GMT on Oct. 11 to avoid any side having an advantage before playing their final game of the second round group phase. The decision has since been reversed after protests from several teams, notably from west African countries who would have had to kick off in blazing lunchtime temperatures of around 40 degrees Celsius. A FIFA spokesman admitted on Friday that their original decision had "proved difficult due to climatic challenges." He added: "Therefore it was decided that matches would be played simultaneously only in those groups where the first and/or second places in the standings have not yet been determined." Matches will now be played on both Oct. 11 and 12. The 12 group winners plus eight best-placed runners-up advance to the final group phase next year. Seventeen of the 20 places are still up for grabs. Benin, Cameroon and Nigeria are already assured of advancing to the last phase
