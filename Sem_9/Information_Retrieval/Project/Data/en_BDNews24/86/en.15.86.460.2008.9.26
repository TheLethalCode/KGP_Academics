 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)  Time will tell if the system of caretaker governance will continue to play a role when necessary, said the Awami League's acting president Zillur Rahman on Friday. "Time will tell if the caretaker government system has to go in the future," the AL acting president. Zillur made the comment to reporters at his residence when they had asked for his reaction to the chief adviser's address to an audience of Bangladeshi expatriates in the US. Fakhruddin Ahmed had hinted on Wednesday to a New York audience that the caretaker system of governance could be re-evaluated. "I believe the caretaker government is not a permanent solution. An elected government should govern the country." "The caretaker government system is provisioned by the Constitution. But we should think what is required in the future," he chief adviser said. Zillur, however, said the AL, should it be elected to office, would endorse all the initiatives and reforms effected by the current interim administration that were just and benefited the people. "Our leader Sheikh Hasina hasn't committed any mistake so far," said Zillur. He alleged the government was not sincere in taking measures to curb soaring prices of essentials weighing on the people. He asked the government to release Hasina and other political leaders. The stand-in AL chief urged authorities to defer the Upazila polls for a month. "If the dates are not shifted, the grassroots leaders will be naturally busy organising for the Upazila polls, which will jeopardise the Jatiya Sangsad elections." Urging all leaders and activists to stay united, he said: "We'll tell you when to do what. Do not create confusion." Zillur was speaking after a meeting with Bangabandhu Shangskritik Jote (BSJ) members on the occasion of the 28th founding anniversary of the the party's cultural wing. bdnews24.c
