 LONDON, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Tottenham Hotspur will face Liverpool in the fourth round of the League Cup following the draw made on Saturday. Spurs, who have made a poor start to the Premier League season and are bottom of the table, will be at home for the tie in the week beginning Nov. 10. The two sides are also due to meet in the league at White Hart Lane on Nov. 1. Chelsea, last season's beaten finalists, will be at home to Championship (second division) side Burnley, who beat their west London neighbours Fulham in the last round. Arsenal, who fielded a largely teenage side and beat Sheffield United 6-0 in the third round, were handed a home tie against Premier League rivals Wigan Athletic. Manchester United will also be at home against Championship side Queens Park Rangers, who upset Premier League Aston Villa in the third round. Brighton, who upset Premier League Manchester City on penalties in the second round, will face fellow League One (third division) side Leeds United if they defeat Derby County of the Championship in their delayed third round match
