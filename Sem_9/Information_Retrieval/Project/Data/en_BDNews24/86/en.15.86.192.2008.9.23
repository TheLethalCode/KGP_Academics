<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Tue Sep 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African President Thabo Mbeki has filed an appeal against a judge's suggestions of political. interference in ANC leader Jacob Zuma's graft case, which led to the president's resignation, a spokesman said. Mbeki resigned on Sunday under pressure from the African National Congress over the suggestions of official meddling. Mbeki's spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga said the president had lodged the appeal against the judge's ruling. "The papers are themselves public documents now found in the Constitutional Court," he said, without elaborating. ANC militants led the charge to force out Mbeki after Judge Chris Nicholson threw out graft charges against Zuma and suggested there was high-level political meddling in the case. Zuma had alleged that Mbeki was waging a campaign to undermine his chances of becoming South Africa's president after the general election next year. Mbeki has denied accusations that he interfered in Zuma's case
