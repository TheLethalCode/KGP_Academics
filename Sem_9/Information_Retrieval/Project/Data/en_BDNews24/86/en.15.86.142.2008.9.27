 Washington, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush on Friday said he told British Prime Minister Gordon Brown that the US financial bailout was big enough to make a difference to ease financial market turmoil and would be passed. "I told him the plan is big enough to make a difference, and I believe it is going to be passed," Bush said, seated next to Brown in the White House Oval office after they met. The White House and Congress are trying to work out agreement on a $700 billion financial rescue plan that Bush has said is urgently needed to address financial market turmoil. Brown said Britain supported the bailout plan. "America and Britain have always stood together and as one in times of difficulty and challenge," Brown said. "Britain supports the financial plan," he said, adding it was "the right thing to do" to get through the current difficult circumstances. "We will continue to support the administration and the government in everything that it is doing to try to restabilize the financial markets," Brown said
