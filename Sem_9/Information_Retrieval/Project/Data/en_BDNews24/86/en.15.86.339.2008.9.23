 BERLIN, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Franck Ribery and Miroslav Klose return to beef up the Bayern Munich attack but Juergen Klinsmann will be more concerned with the state of his defence in Wednesday's German Cup derby at home to Nuremberg. Bayern fans were shocked on Saturday as Werder Bremen took a 5-0 lead on their way to a 5-2 win at the Allianz Arena. Michael Rensing had a terrible afternoon in goal, casting further doubt on whether he is good enough to be Oliver Kahn's successor, while Klinsmann's three-man defence gave a series of gifts to Werder forwards who could hardly believe their luck. It was Bayern's heaviest home league defeat since 1979 but with Hamburg SV, who had led the table, also losing the damage was limited, and they are just three points off the pace. They need a win against Bavarian rivals Nuremberg to stay in contention for another domestic double. Klinsmann said on Sunday that Ribery would definitely play  either from the start or as a substitutefor the first time since suffering an ankle injury at Euro 2008. Klose also stands by to return from a thigh injury and Klinsmann hinted that further changes would be in order. "We maybe should have shaken things up a little more," Klinsmann told the club's website (www.fcbayern.de). "You're always a little wiser with hindsight. "We have a lot of games so we have to pick the right players and hope things work. A few things didn't work out on Saturday." The second round of the Cup begins with seven ties on Tuesday. Bayern's game against Nuremberg is one of the remaining nine ties on Wednesday
