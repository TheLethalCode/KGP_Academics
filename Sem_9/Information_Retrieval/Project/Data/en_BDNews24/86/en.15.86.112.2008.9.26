 WASHINGTON, Fri Sep 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bush Administration tried to tighten the screws on squabbling members of Congress on Friday as an increasingly bitter Washington debate over a $700 billion financial rescue held Wall Street in thrall. President George W. Bush acknowledged that there were disagreements over the plan, which is aimed at getting bad debts off of banks' books and reviving frozen credit markets that threaten to plunge the US economy into a deep recession. But he said he expected Congress to end up passing legislation. "There are disagreements over aspects of a rescue plan but there is no disagreement that something substantial must be done," he said told reporters at the White House. As stock markets fell over concern that a deal would not come as quickly as expected, Vice President Dick Cheney canceled a trip to New Mexico and Wyoming to help push the legislation through Congress. Lawmakers began reviewing a 102-page proposal based on a consensus outline hammered out by members of the House and Senate on Thursday. With elections less than six weeks away, some Republicans in Congress have objected to what they see as the heavy hand of government interfering in a private-sector problem that ought to involve more of a private-sector solution. Both presidential candidates, Republican Sen. John McCain and Democratic Sen. Barack Obama, flew to Washington on Thursday to try to help negotiate a deal, but deep divisions remained over how to shield taxpayers from losses that could reach hundreds of billions of dollars. The Treasury Department wants authority to buy $700 billion worth of assets that banks are struggling to value, but it has been a tough sell on Main Street where many voters see it as a taxpayer-funded bailout of wealthy Wall Street. "The legislative process is sometimes not very pretty. But we are going to get a package passed. We will rise to the occasion. Republicans and Democrats will come together and pass a substantial rescue plan," Bush said. The White House said it was willing to give some ground to get a deal done. "Their concerns are legitimate. Their ideas are good ones. We've been able to accept many of them and we're open to accepting more." Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Bush, told reporters at the White House. In addition to the presidential campaign, the entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate is up for re-election on November 4. McCain went to Capitol Hill on Friday to try to negotiate a compromise. Obama was scheduled to leave at midday for Mississippi, where the first presidential debate was to be held Friday night. McCain had asked that the debate be canceled in light of the financial crisis, but his campaign said he would participate. LOOKING FOR CLARITY The push for a consensus plan that Congress could pass in short order was dealt a blow on Thursday, when House Republicans made clear they were not on board. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters the process of reaching a bill had been set back by "presidential politics," the Nevada Democrat said, adding that it was unclear where McCain stood on the issue. The Dow Jones industrial average was down slightly in late-morning trading, giving back some gains recorded on Thursday when investors thought a deal was imminent, and prices for U.S. government debt rose on the fresh uncertainty. "We in the Treasury market are still eternally mesmerized by the goings-on in Washington -- we want to know what the bailout will look like," said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at RBS Greenwich Capital, in Greenwich, Connecticut. Democrats had accused McCain of complicating matters by jumping off the campaign trail to join the negotiations. "This is a plea to President Bush ... please get your party in line (and ask) Sen. McCain to leave town and not throw fire on these flames, and maybe we can get something done," said Sen. Charles Schumer, the New York Democrat who chairs the congressional Joint Economic Committee. Reid said the Senate would resume negotiations on Friday and would likely delay its scheduled recess next week. He called on both McCain and Obama to "leave us alone here.
