<TEXT>
 Washington, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The odds of the US-India civil nuclear cooperation agreement being approved by the US Congress improved on Thursday when a key lawmaker embraced a bill to end the three-decade ban on nuclear trade with India. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Howard Berman introduced a bill to approve the deal identical to Senate legislation, dropping his own competing version and eliminating any need to reconcile the two. The California Democrat introduced the bill after getting a telephone call late in the day from US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, said House Foreign Affairs Committee spokesman Lynne Weil. She declined to elaborate on his decision, but said he expected "to address the matter in greater detail tomorrow." Congressional blessing is the last hurdle to the pact, which the Bush administration believes will forge a strategic partnership with the world's largest democracy, help India meet rising energy demand and open up a market worth billions. Critics argue the deal undermines efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and sets a precedent allowing other nations to seek to buy such technology without submitting to the full range of global nonproliferation safeguards. The agreement has drawn criticism from nonproliferation advocates because India has shunned the Nonproliferation Treaty meant to stop the spread and production of nuclear weapons as well as a companion international pact banning nuclear tests. Asked about Berman's decision to abandon his competing version of the bill, Sharon Squassoni, a Carnegie Endowment for International Peace nonproliferation expert said, "I think it improves the chances that Congress will approve the bill. While Berman's decision may improve the probability of the legislation passing this year, it must still be voted on by both houses of Congress, which is striving to reach agreement on a $700 billion bailout to save the U.S. financial system. Members of Congress are also rushing to complete all other business in the next few days so that they can go home to campaign ahead of the Nov. 4 election. The congressional maneuvering over the agreement occurred as US President George W Bush met Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the White House. Bush, who wants to get the deal approved before he steps down on Jan. 20, told Singh he hoped Congress would approve the civil nuclear agreement in a form satisfactory to India. "It's taken a lot of work on both our parts, a lot of courage on your part," Bush said seated next to the Indian leader in the Oval office. "We're working hard to get it passed as quickly as possible," he said. Singh echoed those sentiments, saying "I know these are difficult issues," but that he hoped the Congress would approve the deal in a manner acceptable to both countries. Bush and Singh were to have dinner together
