<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Werder Bremen survived a scare to beat third division Erzgebirge Aue 2-1 and make it through to the last 16 of the German Cup on Tuesday. Werder, 5-2 winners at Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga at the weekend, found their latest away game a much tougher assignment, as Aue took the lead with a dream long-range strike from Fabian Mueller early on. The five-times Cup winners got back on level terms when a Claudio Pizarro free kick evaded everyone and drifted in at the far post. Markus Rosenberg grabbed a second for Werder after the break and they managed to hold on despite relentless attacks from the home side. There were two minor upsets among the seven ties on Tuesday, with Eintracht Frankfurt going out 2-1 in extra time at home to second division Hansa Rostock and Cologne losing 3-1 at second division Mainz. Holders Bayern are in action at home to Nuremberg in one of the nine remaining ties in the second round on Wednesday
