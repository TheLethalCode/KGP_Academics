<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Customs House will have a fully automated taxation system in three months as major problems have been fixed , an official says. He says a full automation would greatly help to curb irregularities and corruption at the customs house in the port city. "Nothing will be handled manually at Chittagong Customs House after three months," Brigadier General Hasan Nasir, convener of the committee on supervision of the implementation of automation system, told reporters after a meeting on Wednesday. General Nasir said efforts were on to fix a few minor problems. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to inaugurate the automation system at a function at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre on Oct 6. Chittagong Customs House has already started working using automation system. The first phase of automated taxation system was introduced on Aug 8, with the online submission of export and import accounts by selected firms. The Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry initiated the installation of the automation system with Tk 2 crore in line with a memorandum of understanding between the customs authorities and the CCCI on April 13. The operation of Import General Manifest (IGM) and Export General Manifest (EGM) module was initially launched. General Nasir said everything from submitting IGM and EGM to clearing goods were being done online and the automation had significantly shortened the process of clearing and forwarding. Nineteen entities have been brought under automation system in the first phase, he said, adding the documents were now being checked both manually and automatically. The National Board of Revenue will directly be linked to Chittagong Customs House Thursday enabling NBR officials to supervise the export and import activities from Dhaka, General Nasir said. Operations at the Container Terminal Management System were being done manually but it would also be brought under automation system in three months, he added. The full automation of Chittagong customs and implementation of the recommendations made by a taskforce would boost revenue collection by "several thousand crores of taka". He claimed revenue collection in the county in past fiscal year rose by Tk 3,000 crore thanks to reforms to the revenue collection system. Tk 1.6 crore has already been spent on automation system, and the full automation and maintenance in next five years would cost Tk 13 crore. bdnew
