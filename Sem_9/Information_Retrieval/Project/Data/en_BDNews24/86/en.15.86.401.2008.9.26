 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com) -- The Awami League has told the Dhaka-based diplomats that the party will continue to pursue the corrupt impartially if voted to power, but does not support purging of politicians. Hosting an Iftar Friday attended by diplomats and donor agency officials, acting president Zillur Rahman said the party was ready for the Dec 18 polls but that "unconditional" release of Sheikh Hasina was paramount. "Awami League believes in the politics of constructive engagement rather than politics of denial. "But without complete release of Sheikh Hasina it is impossible to go forward. Withdrawal of all false cases against Sheikh Hasina is essential to creating congenial atmosphere for free, fair and transparent election," Zillur said. "If Awami League is voted to power, we shall definitely continue impartial and lawful drive against corruption," he said. "But we will never support drive against politicians in the name of drive against corruption," he said. "Institutional reform was indeed our demand, we shall continue this reform." Zillur said much depended on the donors as Bangladesh pursued the 2020 dream. "Diplomats and the development partners have been playing a very important role in the development process of the country. "More help and effort from you are very vital to make us fulfil our dream of making this country a mid-level developed country by 2020," said Zillur. Speaking on behalf of the diplomats, Swiss ambassador Dora Rapold urged the politicians to take the challenge for the Bangladesh's return to parliamentary form of government. "As friends of Bangladesh, we follow the developments with a mixture of hope, concern and sometimes anguish," the dean of the Diplomatic Corp in Dhaka said. "Bangladeshis and in particular their leaders are challenged to play their part and assume responsibility -- for a successful transition to parliamentary government and a sustainable democracy where understanding, cooperation and the pursuit of the interests of the whole country prevail," the Swiss ambassador said. "We extend our best wishes for a peaceful transition, and a bright future for Bangladesh", she said. US ambassador James F Moriarty, Saudi ambassador Abdullah Bin Naser Al Busairi, German ambassador Frank Meyke, French ambassador Charley Causeret, Japanese ambassador Masayuki Inoue, Australian high commissioner Douglas Foskett, Dutch ambassador Bea ten Tusscher, Italian ambassador Itala Maria Marta Occhi, Danish ambassador Einar Hobegaard Jensen, Swedish ambassador Brit F Hogstrom, Iranian ambassador Hassan Farazandeh, World Bank chief in Bangladesh Zhu Xian, UNDP Resident Coordinator Renata L Dassalien and mission chief of other countries attended the Iftar party.
