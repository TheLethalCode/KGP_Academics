 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Monday for the verdict on Sheikh Hasina's petition for bail in Noor Ali extortion case after it ended hearings on Wednesday. Her chief counsel barrister Rafiqe-ul Huq later said to reporters, "We submitted to the court that Sheikh Hasina is on parole (but) the polls are at hand. She should return home as a free person, hence the bail petition." Barrister Rafique told the vacation bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Raisuddin at the hearing that Appellate Division and the High Court had granted bail to BNP leaders Tarique Rahman, Sigma Huda, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Awami League leader Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and many others. Similarly, he argued, Hasina, the Awami League president, was also entitled to be released on bail on 'health grounds.' The former prime minister is currently undergoing treatment in the United States. bdne
