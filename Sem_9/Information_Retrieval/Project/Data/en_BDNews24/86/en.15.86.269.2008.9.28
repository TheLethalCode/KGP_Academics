 SCOTTSDALE, Arizona, Sat Sep 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc has filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors in US bankruptcy court in Delaware. In the voluntary petition filed late Friday, the company listed assets of $32.9 billion, and debts of $8.2 billion, putting it in the top 10 largest US bankruptcy cases ever filed. Bank of New York Mellon, as a trustee for debtholders, was listed as the company's largest creditor. According to the petition, Washington Mutual is being represented by New York law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges, which also represents Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in its Chapter 11 case. Its subsidiary, WMI Investment Corp, also filed for bankruptcy protection, Washington Mutual said in a statement. The bankruptcy filing is a procedural step, as Washington Mutual was closed by the US government this week in the largest US bank failure in history. Its banking assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $1.9 billion
