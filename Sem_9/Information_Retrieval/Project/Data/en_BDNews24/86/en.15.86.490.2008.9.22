Kaniz Fatema was on her way to Dhaka from Thakurgaon, the officer-in-charge of Tangail Police Station Ashraf Hossain said. The police officer said the Pajero crushed Raihan, son of Mintu Miah of Khudirampur, killing him on the spot. The car, however, was slightly damaged after hitting a roadside tree. The driver was released after he signed a bond, he said. The jeep was kept in the police custody, but its passengers were sent to Dhaka with the help of the district administration, the officer said. bdnews
