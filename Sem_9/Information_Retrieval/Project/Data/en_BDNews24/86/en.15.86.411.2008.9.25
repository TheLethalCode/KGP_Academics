<TEXT>
 New York, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin met on Wednesday with leaders of international hot spots, part of a carefully choreographed campaign to expose the candidate to foreign affairs while shielding her from the media. Only brief glimpses of Palin, running mate to Republican presidential nominee John McCain in the November 4 election, were permitted as she met with leaders from Georgia, Ukraine, Iraq, Pakistan and India who are in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. A better look came in an interview of Palin by anchor Katie Couric on the "CBS Evening News", which aired on Wednesday evening. It was only Palin's third nationally televised interview since she was nominated earlier this month. In her answers, Palin largely stuck to McCain's campaign lines, such as "inaction is not an option" regarding the nation's financial crisis. She also said she believed "Americans are waiting to see what John McCain will do on this proposal." But pressed to provide an example of how McCain had sought more regulatory oversight of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in his 26 years in Congress, Palin replied, "I'll try to find you some, and I'll bring them to you." In her meetings, Palin, who as governor of Alaska lacks foreign policy experience, could be heard chatting politely during the fleeting seconds the media were allowed to witness. "There's plenty to do here, isn't there? Plenty to see," said Palin to Iraqi leaders as she perched in an upholstered chair in a New York hotel, her hands folded in her lap. "I have plenty to do at home also," replied Iraqi first lady Hero Ahmed. The exchange was warmer at Palin's meeting with Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, who called her "gorgeous" and said he understood why many Americans "are crazy about you." Palin told reporters the day was "going great." "The meetings are very informative and helpful. A lot of good people share an appreciation for America," she said. Before Tuesday, when Palin met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, she had never met a foreign leader. Aides say she got her first passport in 2006. Her lack of foreign policy expertise has been the subject of criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans. The McCain campaign has been readying her for an October 2 debate with her Democratic counterpart Joe Biden, a veteran senator from Delaware who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has broad knowledge of foreign policy issues. Palin foreign policy adviser Stephen Biegun said afterward that topics at the meetings ranged from energy issues to security in Georgia and the situation of Kurds in Iraq.
