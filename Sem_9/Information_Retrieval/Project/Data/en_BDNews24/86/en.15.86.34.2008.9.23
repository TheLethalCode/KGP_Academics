 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  Pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza was also offered to play in the breakaway Indian Cricket League, but the Bangladesh vice-captain turned down the Tk 15 crore offer. Mashrafee himself broke the news to reporters on Tuesday after the provisional squad's second-day practice at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur ahead of the next month's home series against New Zealand. "Before the Australia tour last month, they (ICL authorities) had rung me up several times offering to build a team, but I showed no interest in the ICL although they had contacted me many times," said Mashrafee. The 24-year-old cricketer said he had been initially offered Rs. 8 crore before it was raised to Rs. 10 crore, which equals close to Tk 15 crore. "My mind did not spontaneously respond to the proposal. Besides, no member of my family would speak to me if I had joined the ICL," said Mashrafee. "I will say that I must play for money, but in addition, to play for the country is equally important and I think the first priority should be the country." Seven top Bangladeshi cricketers  former captain Habibul Bashar, former vice-captain Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed, Nazim Uddin, Alok Kapali, Dhiman Ghosh and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel  retired from international cricket last week and signed up for the ICL. The void prompted the selectors to pick six new faces along with four experienced players for the home and away series against NZ and South Africa. Mashrafee saw the exodus not having an impact on the team and the future of Bangladesh cricket, but he believed a few of those cricketers who had retired still had a lot to offer to the country. He urged them to reconsider their decision and come back to the national fold. However, the vice-captain wants to focus on the players in hand. "They already left the national team on the basis of their own decisions and we should now think about the players available instead of them." "If I also leave the team, it will create a void but a backup would definitely be there in my place. Besides, say, if one of [those of who joined the ICL] was injured supposing that he was still in the side, we'd still have to play without him. "So, we should think positively about those who are now in the squad," said Mashrafee. The fast bowler said the players doing the camp were in great mood and hoping to perform as expected of them. "It seems the players are very much interested in playing better cricket this time." "We'll play better cricket this time compared with what we had done in the Australia tour as the players will play on their familiar wicket," said Mashrafee. b
