 Dhaka, Sep 22 (bdnews24.com)  Standard Chartered Bank senior manager Zia Hasan Chowdhury secured bail after turning himself in to a Dhaka court on Tuesday in a car snatching case. The bank's CEO Osman Morad, the other accused in the case, has yet to surrender or be arrested after the court ordered their arrest, the plaintiff's lawyer SM Rifaz Uddin told bdnews24.com. Afroza Jamil, a client of the bank, sued them and 15/20 unidentified others for allegedly taking away her car by force on Monday. Metropolitan magistrate Saifur Rahman Siddiqui granted Chowdhury bail on a bond of Tk 1 lakh. The magistrate ordered the investigation officer of Kafrul Police Station to submit a report on the real ownership of the microbus to the court by Oct 6. The car is now with Kafrul Police Station. The case mentioned the Gulshan address of the bank's chief executive officer Gulshan police sub-inspector Imtiaz AKM Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com in the evening, "We have to see whether any arrest warrant against any official of Standard Chartered Bank has reached us." Jamil complained in the case her businessman husband Gazi Md Shahadat Hossain in 2006 borrowed Tk 16,65,000 from the bank to buy a microbus and was to repay in 60 monthly instalments. He paid back Tk 7 lakh in 19 months and then missed three consecutive payments. She alleged the bank had not given any notice before taking away the microbus using "the hired goons" of a debt collection agency called Credit Care. The case was filed back in March this year and the police conducted a five-month inquiry. The court order was based on the police report, private TV station ATN Bangla said. The officer in charge at Dhanmondi Police Station, Syed Mohsinul Huq, confirmed the warrant of arrest against collection manager Zia Hasan Chowdhury. "I've received one warrant," he told bdnews24.com on Monday. bdnews24.c
