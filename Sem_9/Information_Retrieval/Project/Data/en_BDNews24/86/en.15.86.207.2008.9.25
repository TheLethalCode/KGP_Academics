 TORONTO, Sep 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Toronto-area man has been found guilty by an Ontario court on Thursday of being part of an al Qaeda-style terrorist conspiracy, the first verdict tied to an alleged plot to bomb key Canadian landmarks. The man, who cannot be named under Canadian law because he was under 18 when the crime he was charged with occurred, was one of the "Toronto 18" suspects arrested in a police sting in 2006. Charges against several of the 18 men and teenagers originally arrested have since been dropped. The guilty verdict was on a charge of participating in a terrorist organization, and not the more serious charge of planning bomb attacks, a charge that some in the group face. The members of the group were arrested after allegedly trying to buy three tons of what they thought was ammonium nitrate -- a bomb-making ingredient used in the 1995 Oklahoma City blast that killed 168 people -- from undercover police officers. Police alleged the group planned to bomb landmarks including the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. The arrests reignited criticism that Canada is a breeding ground for terror cells that could pose a threat in the United States.
