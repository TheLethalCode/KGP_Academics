 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)With only a week to the biggest religious festival, Eid shoppers are cramming the city's mega shopping mall Basundhara City bearing with the annual traffic gridlock around Panthapath, but shop-owners there are hardly in festive mood. The authorities claim that shoppers have been flocking to the country's largest shopping complex in the lead up to Eid in much greater numbers than they had last year. But shop-owners and salespeople complain the volume of business has not increased proportionally. Quamrul Mehedi, in charge of administration and security at Basundhara, told bdnews24.com: "The number of people visiting the complex has risen this year, reaching around two lakh daily through weekdays, swelling even more during the weekends." Outside the two annual Eid periods, the mall receives on average 50,000 visitors every day, said Mehedi. But MA Hannan Azad, president of Basundhara shop-owners association, was less than enthusiastic. "It doesn't seem like Eid time at all." "Total sales have plummeted because the common man's purchasing power has nosedived. People are frequently haggling with us, looking around and leaving without making any purchases at all." Shopper Sabbir Hassan agreed, saying he had been forced to curtail other household expenses this Eid to buy a new saree and outfit for his wife and small son. Of the total 2,327 shops occupying eight floors of Basundhara City, 1,850 have been opened to date. Despite the country's largest volume of Eid stock under one roof, Azad said he believed the volume of business was proportionately low this year. "Very few people are buying more than one punjabee or saree this Eid. People of late have been rather hard-pressed for money." Various textiles and handloom fairs hosted by a number of organisations throughout the city also ate into Basundhara's turnover, he said. Kabiruddin Sunny, a dealer in children's wear, said of his Tk 6 lakh worth of Eid stock, he had only sold about Tk 1.25 lakh of product so far. Owners and sellers of a number of other boutiques including 'Dorjibari', 'Jyoti' and 'Regent Shoes' also expressed their disappointment over Eid sales. They said people only started frequenting the market halfway through the Ramadan. Erfan Sharif of 'Men's Club' clothing store and Ashoke Devnath of 'Apex Gallery', however, said they were doing brisk business this year. bdnews24.
