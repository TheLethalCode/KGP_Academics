 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnew24.com)BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain said Thursday a level playing field for participation of all political parties in elections has yet to be created. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the UK acting high commissioner, Delwar said the amended Representation of the People Order, deadline for registration of political parties and the state of emergency were hindrances to a fair election. Acting high commissioner Duncan Norman met with Delwar for an hour at his NAM flat home. They spoke about election related issues, they said. Norman also met with Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam on the same issues. After his meeting with Delwar, Norman told reporters the two had discussed strengthening of democracy, holding fair elections and continuing reform programmes. The British government wanted to see a peaceful election in December with the participation of all parties, he added. Replying to a question, he said the UK was optimistic that a free, fair and neutral election will be held in the country. Delwar told reporters: "BNP has projected its party position on the election." "There are some obstacles to fair elections. Those have to be removed. We think the amended Representation of People Order, party registration rules and the state of emergency are all hindrances to a free and fair election." "The state of emergency must be lifted before the election," he stressed. "Equal opportunity for all parties in elections has not been created." "BNP is an election-oriented party. If the environment is right, BNP will participate in the parliamentary election," the secretary general said. BNP standing committee members RA Gani, Chowdhury Tanveer Ahmed Siddiqui, and Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmad, joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present.. bdnew
