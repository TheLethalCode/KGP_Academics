<TITLE> China's Wen reassures world after milk scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TIANJIN, China, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao tried to reassure the world on Saturday that his government was serious about food safety in the light of a scandal over tainted milk powder. Thousands of Chinese children have become ill after drinking milk formula contaminated with melamine, which can cause kidney stones, and countries around the world have rushed to ban or recall China-made dairy products. "It shows that any country, when it is developing, should pay particular attention to corporate, professional and social ethics," Wen told a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin. The scandal also showed China still faced many problems and needed to improve its production processes and quality supervision, he added. "This issue is not over yet, but please be assured that we will soon unveil plans to boost the food industry," Wen said. "My government and I will lead our people through this hard journey." On Friday Cameroon was the latest nation to suspend the import and sale of fresh and powdered milk from China, following Benin which imposed a ban on Thursday. China would do all it can so that people at home and abroad can have confidence in the made-in-China brand and know that its products are of a high standard, he added. The country could have a hard time winning back the trust of the rest of the world though, especially as this is just the latest in a series of scares involving Chinese goods. The government has also said local officials delayed reporting the incident when it first became clear there was a problem with the milk powder. In 2003 China also initially covered up the SARS epidemic. "China did not intend to cover the truth when the incident happened," Wen said. "Instead, it frankly faced and bravely tried to solve the problem. I believe we will not disappoint the entrepreneurs here, as well as our people and people in the rest of the world," he added. Though the government has insisted there would be "no more bad news" and that the most recent tests show no melamine in goods leaving the factory, new cases of sick children keep appearing. The Beijing Times reported another 176 new cases of kidney stones amongst children had been found in the capital.
