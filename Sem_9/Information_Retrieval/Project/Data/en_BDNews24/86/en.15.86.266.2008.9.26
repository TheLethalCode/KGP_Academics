<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com)Tangail experienced a mild tremor Friday morning, recorded by Dhaka University's Earth Observatory. Observatory director Prof Syed Humayun Akhter told bdnews24.com: "The epicentre of the minor jolt was located at Mirzapur in Tangail, 64 km northwest of Dhaka city." The quake, occurring at 10am, measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, he said. Professor Akhter added that the same area had experienced at least 12 tremors during the preceding week, which may have been caused by an activation of the Madhupur fault. Describing such tremors as 'foreshocks', the geology professor said: "The same area has been rocked on numerous occasions recently, which may foretell of a larger quake in the near future." On Sept 20 and 21, the same area was rattled about a dozen times, according to the DU Earth Observatory. bdnews24.c
