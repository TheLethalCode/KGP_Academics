 Dhaka, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com)Submarine cable SEME-WE-4, which snapped Saturday morning in Egypt, was restored at 9pm Bangladesh time after a break of twelve hours. Connectivity had been maintained through a back-up cable in Egypt, but this was also interrupted later in the afternoon. Golam Mostafa, divisional engineer (fault control and testing) at the Submarine Cable Landing Station in Cox's Bazar, told bdnews24.com that the line was restored around 9pm and they went back to the main cable. Monowar Hossain, managing director of Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd (BSCCL), told bdnews24.com the second break partly disrupted internet connectivity to America and Europe. The connectivity had been maintained through satellite, he added. Internet speeds to USA and Europe were reduced to half, but link speed was normal for Middle East connections. Monwar said the SEME-WE-4 crossed 375 kilometres of desert inland between the mouth of Egypt's sewage canal to the capital Alexandria. Authorities do not allow the cable to pass along the sewage canal. He said the cable was cut at some point in the desert. bdnews2
