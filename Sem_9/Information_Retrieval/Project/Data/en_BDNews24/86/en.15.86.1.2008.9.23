 LISBON, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Benfica recorded their first Portuguese Premier League victory of the season when they beat Pacos Ferreira 4-3 away on Monday. Nacional Madeira, who won 2-0 at Vitoria Guimaraes, and Sporting are the only teams with perfect records after the opening three matches. Benfica coach Quique Flores's first league win at the helm started when striker Nuno Gomes tapped home a perfect cross from the left after seven minutes. Seven minutes later Brazilian defender Ozeia levelled for Pacos, bundling the ball home after a mix-up in the Benfica defence. Uruguayan defender Maxis Pereira put Benfica in front again with a close-range shot after Pacos goalkeeper Bruno Conceicao had parried a header from Nuno Gomes after 31 minutes. Paraguayan striker Oscar Cardozo doubled the lead for the Lisbon team with a penalty after Pacos defender Tiago Valente handled just before halftime. A blunder by Benfica keeper Quim allowed Rui Miguel to reduce the deficit after 63 minutes. Defender Jorge Ribeiro scored his first league goal of the season with a 25-metre angled shot to restore the two-goal cushion on 76 minutes. William pulled one back for Pacos four minutes from time. Champions Porto, who drew 0-0 at promoted Rio Ave on Sunday, and Benfica are both four points behind the leaders
