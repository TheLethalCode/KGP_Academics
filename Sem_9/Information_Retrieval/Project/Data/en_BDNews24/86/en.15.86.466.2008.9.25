 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Political Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League says it has reports that attempts may be made on the life of party chief Sheikh Hasina when she hits the campaign trail ahead of the general elections slated for Dec. 18. "I've information of impending attacks (on Hasina)," acting Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said to reporters on Thursday. He spoke to reporters after his meeting with deputy British high commissioner Duncan Norman at his NAM flats residence. He would not disclose the source of his intelligence, though. The former prime minister had a brush with death when she narrowly escaped a series of grenade blasts on a rally at the party's headquarters on Aug. 21, 2003. The Awami League blames the attack, the left 24 including a top party leader dead and scores injured, on the BNP-led coalition that was in office at the time and the Islamist militants. "We all want the polls to be held peacefully, but even the British diplomats here are apprehensive about atrocities and militant attacks that might affect us." "JMB (banned militant outfit Ja'matul Mujahideen Bangladesh) elements are still active, I'm afraid. The militants don't respect democracy; they're liable to destroy any institution." He quoted the diplomat as saying that they were worried about the safety of people through the electioneering. He feared professional terrorists and political militants might turn out to be more and more active and launch violent attacks on the people. "We're worried about out chief's security. We'd like the government to ensure her safety through Special Security Force." Norman later said to reporters: "I came to meet the Awami League acting general secretary to convey three messages. One, the two major political parties must participate in the elections; two, violence and excesses must be shunned and three, democratic institutions have to be strengthened." "The national parliament and the Election Commission have to be made more effective. I'll convey the same message to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party too." The British diplomat said, "Bangladesh has its share of bloodied political past, which is not good for its people and the land." Asked if a level playing field had been readied for the polls, he said: "We think people must have the opportunity to choose their leaders and governors." bdnew
