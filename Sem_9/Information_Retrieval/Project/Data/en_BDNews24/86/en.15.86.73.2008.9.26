 Washington, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain has made no decision yet on whether he would attend a debate on Friday with Democrat Barack Obama, McCain's campaign said on Thursday. After McCain took part in talks with President George W Bush, Obama and other congressional leaders at the White House, it was unclear if sufficient progress had been made on a financial bailout for troubled banks and markets for McCain to travel to Mississippi for the debate. A campaign spokeswoman, Kimmie Lipscomb, said McCain would spend Thursday night in the Washington area. "No decision has yet been made on whether the senator will attend the debate. We're optimistic that John McCain will bring the House Republicans on board without driving other parties away, resulting in a successful deal for American taxpayers," Lipscomb said
