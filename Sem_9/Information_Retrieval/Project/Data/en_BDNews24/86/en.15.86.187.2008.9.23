 S Africa,(bdnews24.com/BBC online)-- South African Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and nine other cabinet members are resigning along with President Thabo Mbeki. The BBC's Peter Biles says the resignations are a major blow to the African National Congress government. Mr Manuel is however ready to serve the new president, his spokesman says. The ANC is divided between supporters of Mr Mbeki and ANC leader Jacob Zuma. Mr Zuma's supporters had said they wanted the cabinet to stay in place. On Monday, Mr Zuma had sought to reassure the business community and said there would be no change of economic policy. Mr Mbeki is to leave office on Thursday after accusations that he interfered in the prosecution of Mr Zuma on corruption charges. KEY RESIGNATIONS Trevor Manuel, finance Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, deputy president Jabu Moleketi, deputy finance Sydney Mufamadi, local government Mosiuoa Lekota, defence Ronnie Kasrils, intelligence Essop Pahad, minister in the presidency As ANC leader, Mr Zuma is favourite to become South Africa's next president. A statement from the presidency said the resignations of 10 ministers, three deputy ministers and Deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka would also be effective on Thursday. A close ally of Mr Zuma - ANC deputy leader Kgalema Motlanthe - is to replace Mr Mbeki as president until next year's elections, the ANC has confirmed. Mr Manuel's spokesman said he would be ready to serve the new administration, if asked. He is seen as instrumental in South Africa's recent economic stability. Our correspondent says his departure could trigger political and financial uncertainty in South Africa. Mr Mbeki on Saturday accepted a decision by the ANC to recall him as president. Correspondents say the ANC's hopes of managing a stable transition have now been thrown out of the window. Meanwhile, Mr Mbeki has lodged a legal appeal to clear his name after a judge said there was evidence that he may have interfered in the prosecution of Mr Zuma. He said the "vexatious, scandalous and prejudicial" judgement had already cost him his job and damaged his reputation
