 JAIPUR, INDIA, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)- Australia have enlisted the help of the former India coach Greg Chappell as they prepare to defend the Border-Gavaskar Trophy away from home. Chappell is travelling with the Australia squad as an assistant coach and he will pass on plenty of advice to the players and support staff about cricket and life in India. "It's good to be involved this time," Chappell told the Herald Sun. "Obviously it's a transition period and always an exciting time. "I'll have the opportunity to work with some of the young players. Just talk about the conditions in India, generally, will be part of the role, just what to expect in India, conditions, weather, food - all those different things. "We'll be talking about the whole strategy involving bowling and batting in India. There will be discussions certainly with the coaching staff and probably with the individuals." Chappell was the coach of India from 2005 to 2007 and still works with the Rajasthan Cricket Academy. The new role touring with Australia follows his appointment as the head coach at the Centre of Excellence in Brisbane. "It's a role that the Centre of Excellence head does from time to time," Chappell said. "Tim Nielsen obviously did it with the team on various occasions when he was with the academy, so it's no different to the past. Some people will want to make it look different, but it's not." Chappell's inclusion in the off-field staff will be a major boost for a squad that has only four men who have played a Test in India: Ricky Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke and Simon Katich. The Australians arrived in Jaipur on Monday and they will have two warm-up games before the Test series begins on October 9. Courtesy : Cricinf
