 Sylhet, Sept 25 (Bdnews24.com)  Three pro-Awami league (AL) councilors have been elected panel mayors in Sylhet City Corporation (SCC) on Thursday. Of the 33 councillors, 30 voted to elect the three including a woman. There were 13 candidates. "We failed to reach a consensus on the panel," mayor Badraddin Ahmed Kamran told bdnews24.com. "So we arranged the voting. Md Shahjahan got 14 votes, Shahnara Begum 9 votes and Mokhlesur Rahman 12 votes to make the panel," the mayor said. The mayor, SCC secretary Harunur Rashid and chief executive officer (CEO) Kazi Abdun Nur conducted the election. The city council at its first meeting sought to nominate the panel by consensus but failed after as many as 18 showed interest. Later a committee, assigned to find three names acceptable to all, reported its failure to the council meeting Thursday, forcing a vote.
