 LONDON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kevin Keegan will return as Newcastle United manager when the Premier League strugglers are under new ownership, according to caretaker Joe Kinnear. Kinnear, who last managed a Premier League side in 1999, was appointed by Newcastle on Friday on a short-term contract he calculated would last six to eight matches. He told British media he was merely a stop-gap ahead of the return of the much-loved Keegan to Tyneside. Keegan, who was in his second spell in charge of Newcastle, resigned three weeks ago over differences with owner Mike Ashley who is on the verge of selling the club. "(Ashley) informed me the new owners coming in had Kevin Keegan in mind to come back. I'm aware of that but I want to get the place in shape before Kevin comes back," said former Wimbledon manager Kinnear. Kinnear, 61, added former England and Newcastle captain Alan Shearer to the mix when he said Ashley "assures me they have a buyer and the consortium coming in have Kevin Keegan lined up and possibly Alan Shearer. SAME OUTCOME "I hope to do exceptionally well but I'm well aware if I were to win all six games the outcome would probably be the same." Newcastle, who are at home to Blackburn Rovers on Saturday, have been playing under caretaker coach Chris Hughton. Kinnear, who managed Wimbledon in the Premier League from 1992-99 and whose last job was at Nottingham Forest four years ago, faces a huge task to win over the Newcastle fans still seething at Keegan's departure. "They've only got one love at the moment, as far as I can see it is Kevin Keegan and Alan Shearer," said Kinnear. The club are second from bottom and Ashley put United up for sale after saying it was no longer safe for him to take his children to St James' Park stadium. Fans blame Ashley and director of football Dennis Wise for Keegan's decision to walk out. Newcastle's lowest crowd for 15 years watched them lose 2-1 to Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup on Wednesday, their fourth defeat in a row in all competitions
