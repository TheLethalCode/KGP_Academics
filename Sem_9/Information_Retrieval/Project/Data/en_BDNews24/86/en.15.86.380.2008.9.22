 SYDNEY, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- Australia captain Ricky Ponting has vowed there will no repeat of the bitter feuding that marred his team's last series against India when the sides lock horns again next month. Ponting is expecting both teams to be on their best behaviour for the four-Test series, to be played on the Indian subcontinent in October and November. Both teams have been put on notice by their boards after relations between the sides plunged to an all-time low during India's tour of Australia last season, forcing the International Cricket Council to intervene and broker a truce. The Indian board suspended the tour for two days after their spinner Harbhajan Singh was found guilty of racially abusing Australia's only black player Andrew Symonds. The crisis was averted when the ICC agreed to India's demands to sack West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor and Harbhajan's charges were downgraded to the lesser offence of using abusive language. Ponting said before the team flew out of Sydney on Sunday that he expected the series would be played hard but fair. "There's been a very healthy rivalry between India and Australia in one-day and Test cricket and our last few Test encounters have been very good and some very close results," he said. "Hopefully this is another great series played in the right spirit." Ponting also expressed his confidence in the security arrangements for the tour after the trip was almost cancelled because of a bombing in New Delhi last week. Australia's planned tour of Pakistan and this year's Champions Trophy in Pakistan were both postponed because of safety fears. "Our advice was not to go to Pakistan and the advice that we received the last few weeks to tour India has been positive," Ponting said. The Australians have dominated world cricket for the past decade but India pose the biggest threat as they continue rebuilding after the retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Adam Gilchrist and Justin Langer. The Indians won last year's inaugural Twenty20 World Cup, beat the Australians away from home in their triangular one-day series and only lost the Test series 2-1. Australia are also missing key all-rounder Symonds. "There's no doubt they have got a lot more experience than we have going into this series," Ponting said. "But I think we made too much of the conditions in India a lot of the time before we get there. "I think quite often the less that you talk about it and the more you just get to understand it, the people and the conditions, the better off you are over there
