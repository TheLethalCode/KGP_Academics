 MUMBAI, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's most prolific batsman Sachin Tendulkar was declared fit on Friday for the four-test home series against Australia starting in Bangalore on Oct. 9. Tendulkar, 35, pulled out of a domestic match this week to recover from an elbow injury sustained during the third test in Sri Lanka last month which forced him out of the subsequent one-day series. A board statement said the physiotherapist who assessed Tendulkar's fitness at the National Cricket Academy had declared him fit. It said Tendulkar would join a training camp in Bangalore next week. Tendulkar, who has become increasingly injury prone, is 76 runs short of retired West Indian Brian Lara's world record 11,953 test runs
