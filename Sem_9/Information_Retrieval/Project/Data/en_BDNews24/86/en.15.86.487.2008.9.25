 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The FBCCI, the country's apex trade body, has said they businesses urged former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to sit together for the sake of business. "I think he (Syed Ashraful Islam) is right. Businesspersons should do business and lawyers practice law. But we get worried when politics hurt business," Annisul Huq, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "A businessman may too have great desire. It is his democratic right," he said in response to the remarks of acting Awami League secretary general earlier in the day. Ashraful had suggested business leaders and top lawyer Barrister Rafiqul Huq  without taking names  that they had better not intrude in political affairs since the party had not received any message from the interim government about the proposed dialogue. Barrister Huq defends Hasina and Khaleda standing trial on a slew of graft charges and is trying to seat them together to discuss national issues. Following suit, Annisul also said they were also trying to get the two arch political rivals to sit across the table. "But interestingly, a lawyer and business people seem to be overly intrigued by the possibilities of the meeting between the two leaders. I'd advise them to pursue their own professions and not bother the politicians," Ashraful had said to reporters after a meeting with acting British high commissioner Duncan Norman at his house. Annisul said: "Like ordinary people, we too believe that a meeting of the two leaders would be good for Bangladesh and resolve the political crisis in the country," he added. "It is up to them whether they will have talks in the interests of democracy in the country and a free and fair election. We have nothing to do with it," he said. b
