 Washington, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States' ongoing review of its strategy in Afghanistan is unlikely to lead to any major policy changes during the last four months of the Bush administration, a senior US official said on Friday. William Wood, the US ambassador to Afghanistan, also said he did not expect a shift in strategy as happened in Iraq. President George W Bush ordered 30,000 additional troops to Iraq in 2007 after a similar review of US policy there. "It is a question of the next stage in what has been a fairly steady refinement of our thinking. I don't think anyone is anticipating any fundamental shifts in direction," Wood said. The review, which other officials said began in earnest this week and would be completed in less than a month, was expected to be of most benefit to the next administration, Wood told reporters in Washington. Bush leaves office in January after the presidential election on November 4 from which Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain will emerge victorious. "It (the review) is an effort to constantly re-evaluate what is going on. It is also an effort to bring the key questions into the sharpest possible focus, to assist the next administration to have the quickest start it possibly can," Wood said. Asked how it would compare to the earlier review of US policy in Iraq, he said: "At this point I would not draw the comparison, not least because of the difference in the stage of the administration." The Iraq review led to a boost in U.S. troop numbers in the country, a move credited with helping to sharply reduce levels of violence. Bush ordered a rethink of US strategy after spiraling sectarian violence threatened all-out civil war. Violence has risen sharply in Afghanistan over the past two years as Taliban militants and other insurgents have mounted more attacks on NATO and Afghan forces and civilians. Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this month that he was not convinced the United States was winning in Afghanistan. The Afghan review will include assessments from the departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Agriculture as well as intelligence agencies. The United States has 33,000 troops in Afghanistan, including 13,000 who operate as part of a 47,000-strong NATO-led force. Bush said recently about 8,000 more American troops would go to Afghanistan by early next year. Wood said the United States would consult with the Afghan government on the review "to make sure this is not simply another memo written in Washington for Washingtonians.
