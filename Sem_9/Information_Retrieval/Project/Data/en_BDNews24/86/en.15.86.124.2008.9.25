 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  The US government's Diversity Visa (DV) Programme-2010 starts on October 2, an US embassy official said on Thursday. People could apply online for the DV programme between October 2 (10pm Bangladesh time) and December 1 (9pm Bangladesh time), Laurie Trost, first secretary and consul of the US embassy in Dhaka, said at a news conference at the National Press Club auditorium. Candidates aged at least 18 years and having minimum HSC or equivalent educational qualification could apply for the DV programme, she said. The web addresses for filing application are : http://www.dvlottery.state.gov, and http://www.dhakausembassy.gov/diversity_visas.html All necessary instructions for filing applications are available on the websites. "This year, results of DV programme will be available on the website. Previously letters were sent to the successful candidates only," said Trost. "We encourage candidates with all educational backgrounds including madrasa to apply for the DV programme," she said. "Each year 50,000 diversity visas are made available worldwide. But it is not possible to say how many Bangladeshis will be selected this year as the candidates are chosen on random selection technique." She said more DV entries came from Bangladesh than any other country in the world, and more DV were issued here than any other country in Asia. Filing the application is completely free. "After getting selected, the successful candidate will have to pay Tk 60,000 at the time of interview. The money will be used for meeting the passport, visa and other charges," Laurie told bdnews24.com. Providing any wrong information or making mistakes to fill the applications would disqualify the candidates, she said. According to the consul, the selection process will finish by March to April next year. The interviews would continue up to September 2010 starting in October 2009, she said. She suggested the candidates fill out the application form with the help of trusted friends or family members, not by the agents who could extort money from the candidates. Laurie said since 2000, over 17,000 Bangladeshis went to the United States on diversity visa. bd
