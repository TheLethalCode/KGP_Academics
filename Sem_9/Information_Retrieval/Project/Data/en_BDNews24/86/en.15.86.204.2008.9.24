 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited survived a second-half scare to blank Chittagong Mohammedan 2-0 in their Citycell B. League home match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. Jahid Hasan Emily gave the Sky-Blues the lead and Emeka Christian ensured Abahani's second triumph in three matches. The Dhanmondi-based outfit faced a strong challenge from the port city side in the second half, though, because of poor defending. Abahani, who recorded a narrow 1-0 away win over Farashganj, saw off their shaky performance from the word go and it took only 11 minutes to take a deserved lead when Emily headed a Nazrul Islam cross home. Visitors Mohammedan appeared to have come here to keep their two-match unbeaten run after playing a 1-1 draw in both matches against giants Brothers Union and emerging-power Sheikh Russel KC. They almost scored in the 19th minute before conceding the second goal three minutes later. Sharif whipped a cross and Touhid headed the chance wide of the Abahani far post with keeper Biplob Bhattacharya staying close to the near post. Emeka struck his second goal in the league in the 22nd minute to double Abahani's lead. Ghanaian striker Awdu Ibrahim raced past two Mohammedan defenders down the right to chip a nice ball for the Nigerian, who headed the ball past opponent goalkeeper Mamun Khan to confirm Abahani's win. The Nigerian midfielder came close to a third, but he shot lamely from close to waste a hard work between Ibrahim and Emily in the 25th minute. Biplob denied an attempt from Mohammedan's Touhid in the 38th minute. Abahani defender Sujan picked up an injury and left the field after the play resumed after the break and the Abahani defence missed his presence dearly in the second half. Mohammedan squandered a great chance to reduce the margin as Touhid, who just needed to keep the ball on the open post, sent a brilliant Sharif cross wide eight minutes into the second half. Five minutes later, Abahani medio Mehdi Hasan Ujjal saw his close-range shot saved by Mamun while Abahani netminder Biplob thwarted two close calls from Raphael and Anthony Doe at the cost of corners. It was again Raphael, who, capitalising on a Abahani defender's back pass, darted in the danger zone to lash a drive, but Biplob again salvaged Abahani in the 62nd minute. Abahani's Abul took a shot on the target in the halfway of the second half before Doe, taking a through-pass from Raphael, forced Biplob to palm his powerful shot away in the 79th minute. Abahani looked totally disorganised in both backline and midfield but it did not cost them as much as their 2-1 drubbing by Rahmatganj MFS in the league opener. b
