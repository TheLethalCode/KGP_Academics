 MILAN, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Substitute Julio Cruz struck 11 minutes from time to give leaders Inter Milan a laboured 1-0 win over promoted Lecce in Serie A on Wednesday. Improving AC Milan, who meet their city rivals on Sunday, also had to work hard to secure a 2-1 victory at Reggina thanks to Brazilian forward Alexandre Pato's winner. The Milan derby promises to be an intriguing affair but both sets of fans will hope for more imagination than their sides showed on Wednesday.

"We had a great reaction to the equaliser. We are improving bit by bit," Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti told Sky. Juventus also tried hard to find a winner in their home clash with Catania but had to settle for a 1-1 draw. Striker Amauri scored the opener with a difficult header but the defence was all at sea when Gianvito Plasmati nodded in the leveller. Amauri and striker partner Alessandro Del Piero then both hit the bar in the same move but the ball would not go in. AS Roma's poor start to the season continued when they went down 3-1 at Genoa with striker Diego Milito scoring twice. Daniele De Rossi, who grabbed Roma's goal, was sent off for two bookings in the second hal
