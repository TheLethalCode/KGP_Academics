 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has started dispatching the first batch of transparent ballot boxes Wednesday out to five districts, an official said. The upcoming national elections, slated for Dec 18, will see the EC use these transparent ballot boxes for the first time, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters. He said it would not be possible to use the transparent ballot boxes in the Upazila polls. "The Election Commission has a separate set of steel boxes that will be used in Upazila elections set for Dec 24 and 28." The first shipment containing 35,000 transparent ballot boxes were received from Kamalapur Inland Container Depot by the EC Secretariat for dispatch on Wednesday, Sakhawat said. EC Secretariat joint secretary Rafiqul Islam received the boxes at Kamalapur ICD earlier in the day. "Of them, some 17,000 boxes have been sent to five districts, Narsinghdi, Shariatpur, Manikganj, Gazipur and Munshiganj, and the remaining boxes will be sent out on Thursday," Rafiqul told bdnews24.com. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is providing financial assistance to the Bangladesh government and UNDP for procuring the ballot boxes. The boxes reached the Dhaka ICD on Sept 16 and more shipment of boxes will come in phases, the joint secretary said. "Some 237,500 boxes will arrive by ship by October. If necessary, some boxes will be transported by air," he added. The Economic Relations Division and the UNDP agreed on the Tk 45.37 crore "Translucent Ballot Boxes" project following consultations held with the political parties. For the scrapped election originally scheduled for Jan 22, 2007, the EC had arranged a total 178,000 polling booths in 33,318 centres across the country, with the number of ballot boxes estimated at 211,369. The commission assessed the probable demand for transparent ballot boxes at 2.4 lakh in the upcoming polls. bdnews24.com/
