 Bhubaneswar, Sep 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government deployed hundreds more central police to Orissa on Friday after one person was killed and several injured in fresh clashes between Hindus and Christians triggered by religious conversions. More than 700 federal police are being sent to Orissa after the death in rural Kandhamal district following clashes between Christians and Hindus on Thursday. Several houses were also set on fire. The violence came after a string of attacks on Christians in three Indian states that has left at least 20 people dead and dozens of churches damaged in the last month. Christians have responded with some violence in Orissa. More than 3,000 central police have already been deployed in the region. Violence first erupted in Orissa after the killing of a Hindu leader linked to the main opposition Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and four others last month. "We have moved seven more companies of paramilitary forces to the troubled areas," Orissa's inspector general of police in charge of law and order, Pradeep Kapur, said. The attacks on Christians in India have been condemned by Pope Benedict and Roman Catholic bishops have urged the European Union to treat persecution of Christians as a humanitarian emergency. But violence has continued, especially in Kandhamal where thousands of Christians now live in government camps because their homes are destroyed or they are too fearful to return. Religious clashes have also been reported in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. India does not have a long history of attacks on minority Christians, but intolerance has risen in the past two decades with a revival of Hindu nationalism. Many Hindu nationalists say they are determined to fight Christian missionaries they accuse of converting poor Indians. Christians say lower-caste Hindus convert willingly to escape discrimination. In Karnataka, at least 20 churches have been burnt by Hindu mobs in the past two weeks. Hindu nationalists rule outright or share power in the three states where Christians have come under attack
