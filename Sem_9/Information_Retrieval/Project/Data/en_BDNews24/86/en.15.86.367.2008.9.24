<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of the midweek matches: Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola will have to decide whether to change the team that earned him his first league win on the weekend, now that France striker Thierry Henry has recovered from a throat infection. The versatile Andres Iniesta was outstanding on the left flank in the 6-1 win away to Sporting Gijon but Guardiola will have one eye on Saturday's city derby at Espanyol. Barca's visitors Real Betis have not scored in their opening three matches and last won at the Nou Camp ten years ago. Champions Real Madrid have problems in midfield with playmaker Guti joining Wesley Sneijder and Fernando Gago on the injury list for Wednesday's match at home to bottom club Sporting Gijon. New signing Rafael van der Vaart could start. Atletico Madrid travel down the road to face neighbours Getafe on Wednesday with Florent Sinama Pongolle likely to partner Sergio Aguero in attack again. Diego Forlan is injured. Either Pablo Ibanez or Luis Perea will deputise for injured Netherlands centre back John Heitinga, who also missed the last game. Villarreal have Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi back for the first time this season after injury, for the visit of Racing Santander on Wednesday. Racing striker Jonathan Pereira, on loan from Villarreal, is prevented from playing by a clause in his contract. Valencia striker David Villa continues to have treatment for a twisted ankle which did not stop him from playing and setting up the winning goal against Osasuna on Sunday. The league leaders are without injured midfielders David Silva, Vicente and Ruben Baraja, as well as defender Carlos Marchena for Thursday's trip to face Malaga. Espanyol are set to rest captain Raul Tamudo for Wednesday's match away to Sevilla, with Jonathan Soriano taking his place up front. Steve Finnan could get his first start at right back with Gregory Beranger injured
