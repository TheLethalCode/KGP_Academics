 COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nishantha Ranatunga, brother of Sri Lanka Cricket chairman Arjuna Ranatunga, has been appointed the new manager of the Sri Lanka team. Nishantha Ranatunga was appointed for the team's tour to Canada later this month for a Twenty20 tournament also involving Pakistan, Zimbabwe and Canada. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's selectors made several changes to the one-day squad for the tour, calling up Twenty20 specialist all-rounders Dilhara Lokuhettige and Jeevantha Kulatunga. Sri Lanka A captain Thilina Kandamby also returned to the senior squad while middle-order batsmen Chamara Silva was axed. Off spinner Muttiah Muralitharan and left-armer Chaminda Vaas were both rested for the short tour but all-rounder Farveez Maharoof returns after injury. The four-nation tournament runs from October 10 to 13 in Toronto
