 JAIPUR, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India coach Greg Chappell has advised leading Australian batsman Ricky Ponting to trust his technique in order to overcome his poor Indian record in the four-test series next month. Ponting is one of seven batsmen to have scored over 10,000 test runs but the 33-year-old right-hander averages just 12.28 in eight tests in India. "He has to trust his methods and I have no doubt he will succeed," Chappell told reporters on Friday. "There have probably been a few occasions earlier in India where he has gone away from those methods and that has been part of his failure in India." Australia arrived on Monday ahead of schedule to spend a week acclimatising at the Rajasthan cricket academy. The first test starts in Bangalore on Oct. 9. The remaining matches will be played in Mohali, Delhi and Nagpur. "I can see a steely glint in (Ponting's) eyes and that means a few runs around in India this time," said Chappell, who is an assistant coach with the touring party. Australia won a four-match series 2-1 on the previous tour in 2004 to record their first series victory in India in 35 years. From the current squad only Ponting, Matthew Hayden, Michael Clarke and Simon Katich have test experience in India. "The team is in transition after the retirement of some great players, but with that comes the opportunity for somebody to step up and win for Australia," Chappell said. "Historically, whenever such an opportunity came, somebody had matches for Australia. We are hoping that happens in this series. It is an exciting time for Australian cricket
