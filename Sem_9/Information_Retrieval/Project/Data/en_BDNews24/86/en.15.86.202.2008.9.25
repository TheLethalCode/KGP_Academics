<TITLE> Brothers on top of B. League points table </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com) - A first-half strike from Michael Oniya took favorites Brothers Union on the top of the Citycell B. League points table with a 1-0 home win over Chittagong Abahani Limited at Bangabandhu National Stadium Thursday. With two straight wins in three outings, Brothers secured seven points, one point ahead of holders Abahani Limited and three points ahead of Chittagong Abahani, Sheikh Russel KC and Dhaka Mohammedan. However, the last two teams played a match less than the leaders. Nigerian striker Oniya struck the all-important goal in the 34th minute, but coach Wasim Iqbal would have been wondering why his side had not won the match with a big margin against Chittagong Abahani, who tasted its first defeat in three matches. Brothers Union, clad in their second choice blue jerseys, enjoyed superior ball procession throughout the game and produced a lot of chances, but failed to cash in due to poor finishing by strike duo Oniya and Mehdi Hasan Tapu. Oniya found the back of the Abahani net with a seemingly harmless grounder after squandering at least three good chances. The Nigerian striker shot lamely from inside the box with Abahani goalkeeper Kiran Kumar facing no trouble to grip the ball in the eighth minute while two minutes later winger Jahid Hasan ran down the right to advance into the Abahani danger zone to hammer a grounder, blocked by Kiran. Brothers' best chance to take a deserved leader came in the 14th minute when Shakil Ahmed raced past an Abahani defender to set Oniya and Tapu inside the box, but it seemed both strikers were in the hesitation on who should take the shot and Tapu sent it wide despite only the opponent goalkeeper being in the way. In the 30th minute, Oniya rattled the Abahani sidebar with a half- hearted shot before the striker, capitalising on a square pass from Tapu, struck his second goal in the league. After going down, Ctg Abahani came close to an equaliser in the 36th minute, but Nepalese striker Santosh Shahukhal's grounder to the near post went narrowly wide. After resumption, the ball was mostly confined to the midfield though Brothers produced a few good chances, but they again saw their efforts go down the drain due to poor finishing. Tapu headed a Jahid corner wide in the 61st minute before Oniya missed from close being cleared by Abahani captain-cum-defender Mintu for a corner in the 71st minute. Afterwards, Oniya got into a better position inside the danger zone with only to beat keeper Kiran, and the Nigerian striker sent the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper, who finally managed to get a hand to the ball to salvage his side at the cost of a corner in the 74th minute. Manju and Liton came in place of Oniya and medio Motiur Munna, but the duo could not make the margin wider and Brothers had to be satisfied with the lone goal win.
