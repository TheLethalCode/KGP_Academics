 MADRID, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: France striker Thierry Henry has recovered from a throat infection and will start in his first league outing with Barcelona this season for Saturday's derby with Espanyol. Cameroon striker Eto'o will be keen to better his compatriot Carlos Kameni after scoring both of Barca's goals in a successful partnership with Argentine striker Lionel Messi against Real Betis on Wednesday. Espanyol's captain and Spain striker Raul Tamudo is expected to return for the home game against Barcelona after being rested for his club's mid-week defeat to Sevilla. League leaders Valencia will host mid-table Deportivo Coruna on Sunday with Spain striker David Villa, who has returned to form after injury with a brace in his side's 2-0 victory at promoted Malaga on Thursday. Second-placed Villareal travel to Gijon on Sunday to play Sporting, who have yet to earn a point while conceding 19 goals in just four games since promotion to the top flight. Real Madrid's Netherlands midfielder Wesley Sneijder has returned to training with the rest of the squad after recovering from his knee injury picked up in the pre-season, but is unlikely to make the squad to face Real Betis. The champions' Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may be back from resting mid-week when his side humiliated Primera Liga newcomers Sporting Gijon with a 7-1 rout. Real Betis Brazilian striker Edu is recovering from injury and hopes to make the lineup who will host Real Madrid. Atletico Madrid's Portuguese winger Simao Sabrosa will be out for three weeks after straining a ligament in his right knee during Wednesday's meeting with local rivals Getafe. Compatriot Maniche is doubtful for Sunday's home clash with Sevilla after the midfielder took a knock to his lower spine in the Getafe match. Dutch defender John Heitinga has been training and may be back to relieve manager Javier Aguirre's squad woes, but Uruguayan striker Diego Forlan is still on the injury list. Sevilla's Colombia defender Aquivaldo Mosquera will be out of action for three weeks with an ankle injury. Osasuna defender Nacho Monreal will be out for two months with a ruptured right ankle ligament
