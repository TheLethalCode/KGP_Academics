 WASHINGTON/LONDON, Fri Sep 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure mounted on lawmakers to agree a $700 billion financial rescue plan on Friday after talks at the White House broke down in acrimony and the biggest bank closure in US history put global markets under massive stress. US authorities shut bank Washington Mutual Inc on Thursday, selling its assets to JPMorgan Chase, while in Europe Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis denied it had a liquidity problem after its shares tumbled for a fifth day. Global money markets dried up, forcing increased injections of cash from central banks on Friday as dollar borrowing rates stayed high, particularly for three-month money. The market stress was exacerbated by the looming quarter-end next week. After Washington's efforts to contain the credit crisis descended into angry clashes between Republicans and Democrats, the dollar and Asian and European share markets fell, while Treasuries rose. Europe's biggest bank HSBC Holdings said it was cutting 1,100 jobs or 4 percent of its workforce citing the crisis and US stock futures indicated shares would open lower. Fortis shares fell nearly 10 percent on market concerns about its liquidity, which its president said was not a problem. The bank's woes extended to China, where shareholder Ping An Insurance sank 9.7 percent. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke put together the bailout proposal but hopes for a speedy deal dimmed when a group of conservative Republican lawmakers proposed an alternative plan on Thursday. The heated political debate comes just weeks before the November 4 election as many lawmakers try to hold on to their seats. The conservative group wants the government to offer insurance coverage for the roughly half of all mortgage-backed securities that it does not already insure. Lawmakers critical of the Paulson deal are concerned that freewheeling bankers will get off too lightly, and have doubts over whether the plan can solve the wider credit crisis. An emergency White House meeting between Congressional leaders, President George W. Bush, Republican presidential candidate John McCain and Democratic candidate Barack Obama "devolved into a contentious shouting match," according to a statement from the campaign of McCain, who was accused by some of stalling the process. "What this looked like to me was a rescue plan for John McCain for two hours," U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told CNN. "To be distracted for two to three hours for political theater doesn't help." McCain has told rival Obama he does not want to attend the first of their televised presidential campaign debates set for Friday without a deal being reached on the bailout. Obama has insisted it go ahead either way, arguing the American people want to have the issue aired. Lawmakers face the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, with the $700 billion price tag bigger than the cost of the Iraq war and topping all International Monetary Fund lending since its inception after World War II. Democratic Rep. Barney Frank, who has played a key role in the bailout talks, said negotiations would continue on Friday, but with no sign that Republicans in the House of Representatives would take part. He said he hoped Bush and McCain could convince them to join the talks, where Senate and House Democrats, Senate Republicans and the Treasury Department were working together and "there aren't huge differences." "I can't believe that House Republicans are going to continue to defy George Bush or that John McCain isn't going to try to help," Frank said. "There is optimism." He said the deal would allow the government to take part-ownership of banks and ban companies that sell toxic assets to the government from paying massive "golden parachutes" to executives being fired. Washington Mutual saw its market value virtually wiped out because of massive amounts of bad mortgages. Buyer JPMorgan said it would be business as usual on Friday for WaMu's depositors and customers. The 13-month old credit crisis has come to a head this month, after the US government's takeover of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bailout of insurer American International Group Inc, and the bankruptcy filing of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Bush this week in a televised speech warned of a looming economic disaster if Congress failed to act swiftly to fund a bailout. On Thursday he warned: "We're in a serious economic crisis in the country if we don't pass a piece of legislation." German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said the United States risked losing its "superpower status" in the world financial system. He joined a growing chorus of international leaders and lawmakers who have blamed the United States for spawning the global financial crisis with a blind drive for higher profits and insufficient market regulation
