 Dhaka, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, at present in the US seeking medical treatment, is expected to return home after Oct 17, a senior party leader said on Sunday. "Hasina has an appointment with a doctor on Oct 17, she will be back home after the check up," Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a gathering to mark the 62nd birth anniversary of the party president at her political office in Dhanmondi. "We are awaiting her return; she will lead the party and the nation on her return home after treatment," he said. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman, also speaking on the occasion, demanded withdrawal of all cases filed against Sheikh Hasina. "All the cases filed against Hasina were baseless. The cases were filed in a bid to keep her away from her people." "There is no alternative to her release to handle the crises the country is currently facing," Zillur said. bdnews
