 RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Out-of-sorts Ronaldinho has been dropped by Brazil for next month's World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Colombia while his AC Milan team mate Kaka has been recalled to the squad after knee surgery. Ronaldinho missed a penalty in the 3-0 win away to Chile and was jeered off the pitch when he was substituted in a dismal goalless draw at home to Bolivia earlier this month. Dunga said the forward, who had an indifferent Olympic Games after being included as an overage player for the under-23 tournament, needed a break. "Ronaldinho is a player in who we have great confidence," Dunga told a media conference. "He had a very good period with us during the Olympic Games and it's perfectly normal that, after changing club, he needs time for training." "Now, he's going to have more time to train and improve." "We're going to do all we can to help him get back to being the Ronaldinho that everyone knows." Brazil visit Venezuela, who beat them 2-0 in a friendly in June, on Oct. 12 and host Colombia three days later. Kaka has not played for Brazil this year, having undergone a knee operation in late May. The timing of the operationimmediately after the end of the last Italian season and before Brazil's matches against Paraguay and Argentinawas widely criticised in Brazil. "He's playing again and he's in good condition so the normal thing is for him to come back to the Brazil team," said Dunga. Brazil are second in the 10-team South American qualifying group but Dunga is under increasing pressure after only one win in their last four games. The win in Chile briefly eased the pressure but Dunga was under fire again after a dismal performance at home to Bolivia.
