 Istanbul, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Turkish court on Saturday ordered six people, including a former television station owner, to be remanded in custody accused of involvement in a plot to overthrow the government, state-run Anatolian news agency said. The six are being held in an Istanbul prison and face preliminary charges of "membership of the Ergenekon terror group and working on its behalf," Anatolian said. The probe into the ultra-nationalist Ergenekon organization has been a factor in increased political tension in Turkey this year. Some 100 people, including two retired generals, have been arrested in connection with the investigation. Those remanded in custody on Saturday included a former senior Istanbul police officer, a former mayor and a former military judge. Police have been questioning the six since detaining them on Tuesday after carrying out a dawn search of the Istanbul house of Tuncay Ozkan, former owner of television station Kanalturk. The Ergenekon investigation has highlighted a conflict in Turkey between the Islamist-rooted government and the secular establishment, including the military. Akin Ipek, owner of the religious-leaning newspaper Bugun, bought the anti-government broadcaster Kanalturk in May. Kanalturk played a key role in large anti-government rallies in 2007. A top Turkish court agreed in July to hear a case against 86 of those detained on charges of trying to trigger a military coup through street violence and assassinations
