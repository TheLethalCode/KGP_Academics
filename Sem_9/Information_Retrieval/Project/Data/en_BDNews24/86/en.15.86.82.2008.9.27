 LONDON, Sept 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Round-up of news before this weekend's Premier League games: Leaders Arsenal should have Gael Clichy available for the home match against Hull City after recovering from a shin injury sustained against Bolton last week. Fellow Frenchman Mikael Silvestre is also fit and could make his first appearance since joining from Manchester United. Theo Walcott has also shaken off a knock as the Gunners enjoy a virtual fully fit squad. Hull are without Greek midfielder Stelios Giannakopoulos and defender Anthony Gardner. Edwin van Der Sar is expected to return in goal for Manchester United at home to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday after being substituted against Chelsea last week. Reserve team keeper Ben Amos is likely to be on the bench as cover because both Ben Foster and Tomasz Kuszczak are injured. United are without midfielder Michael Carrick and Rodrigo Possebon but have no other injury concerns. Bolton Wanderers are boosted by the return of defender Gary Cahill after he served a three-match suspension. Joe Cole is set to make his 100th Premier League appearance for Chelsea against Stoke City on Saturday. Stoke have Amdy Faye back from suspension although strikers Ricardo Fuller and Mamady Sidibe are doubtful because of injuries sustained in Tuesday's League Cup tie against Reading. Liverpool will give late fitness tests to midfielders Javier Mascherano and Yossi Benayoun before Saturday's Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park. However, Brazilian defender Fabio Aurelio is available after recovering from injury. West Ham United striker Dean Ashton has suffered another injury blow and needs arthroscopic surgery on his ankle, the club said on Friday. With Ashton likely to be unavailable for a month, West Ham manager Gianfranco Zola will assess his striking options for Saturday's trip to Fulham. Teenager Freddie Sears could play as Craig Bellamy and Carlton Cole are injury doubts. England goalkeeper Paul Robinson is ruled out of Blackburn Rovers' trip to struggling Newcastle United with a calf injury. Robinson limped off during Blackburn's League Cup victory against Everton this week and is expected to be out for two weeks. Newcastle are without Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins who has a knee injury. Finland midfielder Teemu Tainio will miss Sunderland's trip to Aston Villa because of a shoulder injury while central defender Nyron Nosworthy is also out for three weeks with a hamstring injury. Michael Johnson is in contention for a return to league action for Manchester City at Wigan Athletic on Sunday after he came through Wednesday's League Cup tie at Brighton with no recurrence of a groin strain that sidelined him for three weeks
