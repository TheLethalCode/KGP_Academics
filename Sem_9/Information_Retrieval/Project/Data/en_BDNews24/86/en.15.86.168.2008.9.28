 KATHMANDU, Sun Sep 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shops were closed and vehicles stayed off the roads across Nepal on Sunday during a strike called against a plan to turn the Himalayan nation into a federal state, officials and witnesses said. Major political parties and the Maoist-led coalition government have agreed to split Nepal into several autonomous provinces under a federal structure after preparing a new constitution likely in two years time. "A small and poor country like Nepal should not be turned into a federal state," said Chitra Bahadur K C, chief of a leftist group, National People's Front, that called the day-long strike to oppose the plan. "The federal system will weaken national unity." Activists pelted stones and set fire to half a dozen vehicles in Kathmandu. Others trying to enforce the strike also clashed with police but officials said there were no injuries. Nepal abolished the 239-old monarchy in June, part of a 2006 peace deal with Maoist former rebels ending their decade-long civil war which caused more than 13,000 deaths. During their war that started in 1996, the Maoists promised to create autonomous provinces but critics said Nepal had no infrastructure and resources required to turn it into a federal state
