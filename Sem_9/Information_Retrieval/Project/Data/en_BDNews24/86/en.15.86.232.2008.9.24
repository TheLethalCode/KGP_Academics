 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  Nine companies, vying to operate WiMAX or Broadband Wireless Access, were bidding in auction at the capital's Radisson Hotel on Wednesday. The nine companies were Aguri Wireless Broadband Bangladesh Ltd, Bangla Lion Communications, Bangladesh Internet Exchange Ltd, Brac Bdmail Network Ltd, Clearstream Ranks (Bd) Ltd, Mango Teleservices Ltd, P-1 Consortium, Telestar Communications Ltd and Vtel Bangla. Bangla Lion Communications began by offering 27.50 percent of the revenue to the government, before the contest heated up. The three companies that win licences will run WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) technology that allows wireless data to travel over long distances by various means, from point-to-point links to full mobile cellular type access. The chief adviser's special assistant MA Malek, in charge of post and telecommunications, told reporters at the auction venue: "I have come here to observe whether the auction is being held transparently." On ISPs cutting internet fees, MA Malek said: "This is the responsibility of BTRC to regulate. The commission did not have full regulatory powers in the past, but it will get them soon." Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, who will issue the three licences, has estimated that once WiMAX is functional the number of internet users across the country will cross one crore. Sept 11 was the deadline for submission of applications. BTRC, who invited applications in August, said a total 12 bid documents were sold, with nine companies eventually submitting their documents. Internet service providers had originally asked the government to open up WiMAX licensing to Bangladeshi organisations qualifying on merit. Mobile operators in Bangladesh and anyone having invested in them have been barred from bidding for a BWA licence. The licence acquisition fee will be fixed by the BTRC auction, and the annual licence fee will be Tk 3 crore [BDT 30 million]. According to the licence conditions, the winning companies will set up at least 90 base stations in the first year, and the whole country will have to be brought under WiMAX network within three years. Foreign investment in the licensed companies should not be more than 60 percent and non-resident Bangladeshis are allowed to invest at 70 percent ownership. The licensee will have to file for initial public offering (IPO) within three years of the issuance of a licence, and will not be allowed to transfer any shares before issuance of the IPO without prior written permission from the commission. bdnews
