 MUMBAI, Sept 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The touring Australian team said they were awaiting a security update from Cricket Australia (CA) after a bomb blast killed two people and wounded 18 in a New Delhi marketplace on Saturday. The Australians were playing a warm-up match against a local side in the northern Indian city of Jaipur when the incident occurred in the Indian capital, where the third test is to be staged. "If we have to do anything besides the normal security drill we will do only after getting instructions (from CA)," Australia's spokesman Matthew Slade told Indian media. Australia decided to go ahead with the tour after a security review following blasts in the Indian capital on Sept. 13 that killed at least 20 people and injured more than 90. Australia captain Ricky Ponting said ahead of arrival on Monday that the safety of the touring party would continue to be monitored throughout the tour. Australia's planned tour of Pakistan and this year's Champions Trophy in Pakistan were both postponed because of security fears. The first test starts in Bangalore on Oct. 9. Senior Indian Cricket Board official Rajeev Shukla told reporters in Mumbai: "The Australians should not fear about their security. We are in touch with the home ministry. There is no need to panic." Australia were bowled out for 218 in their warm-up match against Rajasthan Cricket Academy
