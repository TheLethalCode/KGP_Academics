 BHUBANESWAR, India, Wed Sep 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Officials in eastern India struggled to provide aid to tens of thousands of flood victims after riots broke out on Wednesday, as floodwaters lapped the Taj Mahal compound but posed no immediate threat to it. Monsoon rains, burst dams and overflowing embankments have unleashed bouts of flooding in South Asia this year, killing about 1,500 people, mostly in India but also in Nepal.

Yadav, a police officer. The flooding in the Yamuna, which also flows through New Delhi, was caused by the release of water from two barrages following heavy rains upstream.
