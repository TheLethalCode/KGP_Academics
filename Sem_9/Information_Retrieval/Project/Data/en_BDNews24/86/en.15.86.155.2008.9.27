<TITLE> Still no deal on US bailout; McCain, Obama spar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Sep 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The biggest bank failure in US history and nose-diving banking stocks added pressure on the US Congress to agree this weekend to a $700 billion financial bailout to breathe life back into credit markets. That left the bailout as the contentious issue that dominated barbed early exchanges on Friday night in the first presidential debate between Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama in the run-up to the Nov. 4 election. A second day of intense negotiations between rancorous Democrats and Republicans failed to reach accord on how to structure a deal allowing the government to buy up toxic mortgages choking credit, but congressional leaders promised to stay all weekend until a compromise was reached. Talks on Thursday collapsed in acrimony and roiled global markets. But President George W. Bush expressed optimism on Friday that Congress and the White House would come together on the proposal. Still, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson huddled in talks on Capitol Hill, global financial turmoil deepened. Shortly after US stocks closed higher in hopes of a bailout deal before markets open on Monday morning, US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised that Congress would work through the weekend and said progress was being made. "The markets need a message from us ... that we understand time is important," Pelosi told reporters. During the debate, Obama said America's biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s was the "final verdict on eight years of failed economic policy promoted by (President) George Bush and supported by Senator McCain." Obama said he was "optimistic" a deal could be reached. McCain said he favored a plan where the government would give loans to failing financial institutions rather than buy their soured assets, such as bad mortgages. McCain said even once a deal was reached, "we've got a lot of work to do." He accused Obama of favoring wasteful spending amounting to "nearly a million dollars for every day that he's been in the United States Senate." BANK STOCKS TUMBLE Just before Wall Street trading closed, The New York Times said Wachovia Corp, the No. 6 US bank, was in early talks with Citigroup, but no deal may emerge. Stock in Wachovia, the sixth-largest U.S. bank, tumbled 36 percent on Friday before closing 27 percent lower on the possible deal. A subsequent report said several other banks were considering buying Wachovia. Midwest regional bank National City Corp skidded 29 percent and California's Downey Financial Corp tumbled almost 48 percent amid a rising tide of home foreclosures and loan defaults that has spawned the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. In Europe, Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis NV denied it had a liquidity problem after its shares tumbled more than 20 percent to a 14-year low. Later, Fortis sacked its interim chief executive. US regulators seized savings and loan Washington Mutual Inc late on Thursday, the biggest ever US bank failure, and sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Banks worldwide hoarded cash and showed a growing reluctance to lend, driving rates that institutions charge each other on loans to a record high in London. "What you're going to see is the strong stronger, and the weak are going to die off," said William Smith, president of Smith Asset Management in New York. Global money markets dried up, forcing increased injections of cash from central banks. With no relief in sight, investors flocked to the safety of cash and U.S. government securities. The view of many experts was that Congress had better reach a deal before the stock market's opening bell rings on Monday morning or there will be carnage on Wall Street. "Wall Street is banking on a definitive agreement in place before markets open on Monday," said Fred Dickson, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "The plan is crucial to keeping the economy afloat." Pelosi sought to reassure markets, saying talks were back on track. "We will not leave until legislation has passed that will be signed by the president." Powerful Democratic US Sen. Charles Schumer told CNBC there was an "impasse" and offered to add a mortgage insurance measure to the bailout. Conservative Republicans have called for the government to offer insurance coverage for the roughly half of all mortgage-backed securities that it does not already insure. The $700 billion bailout, the largest of its kind in US history and more costly than the Iraq war, aims to remove soured assets from the books of fragile banks and revive frozen credit markets. The value of the assets, mostly mortgage-related, tumbled as the US housing market slumped. Even with a deal, the US economy faces serious problems -- sluggish growth and rapidly falling home prices. Further US interest rate cuts may not help, said James Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. "The consequences of this turmoil on real economic performance entail clear downside risk," he said. Adding to the anxiety, reports showed US economic growth was weakening and consumer confidence diving. Citing the crisis, Europe's biggest bank, HSBC Holdings Plc, said it was cutting 1,100 jobs, adding to more than 80,000 job losses across the banking landscape in the past 18 months. Friday's US stock gains came at the end of a week that was still the worst for the benchmark S&P 500 since May. "The markets are just caught like a deer in the headlights, watching Washington, trying to figure out what the next step is," said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York. The crisis reverberated in the world's ports as banks ceased lending, leaving some cargo stranded on docks and slowing trade. QUESTIONS SURROUND BAILOUT Hopes for a speedy deal on the plan, crafted by Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, had faded after a group of conservative Republican lawmakers proposed a radical alternative that provides for no government money up front. House Minority Leader John Boehner said most of his fellow Republicans may not go along with a bipartisan proposal favored by Democrats unless their alternative is considered. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid complained that presidential politics had hurt the talks. Although Democrats control Congress, they are hesitant to pass a bailout bill without rank-and-file Republican support because it could leave their party politically exposed just weeks before the presidential and congressional elections. The 13-month-old credit crisis came to a head this month after the US government's takeover of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bailout of insurer American International Group Inc, as well as the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers
