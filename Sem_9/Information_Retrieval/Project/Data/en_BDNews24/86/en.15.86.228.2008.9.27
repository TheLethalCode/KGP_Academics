<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 27(Bdnews24.com) A group of 27th BCS examinees on Saturday demanded cancellation of the recent exam results and ousting of the PSC chairman, accusing him of discrimination and irregularities. Mahfuzur Rahman, who had stood first among the customs cadre in the previously published results, read out a written statement to reporters at a press conference at Dhaka Reporters' Unity. Mahfuzur said Public Service Commission chairman Dr Sadat Hossain failed 67 percent of students who achieved success through the quota system in the first published results. The BCS examinee alleged that Dr Sadat himself took advantage as a freedom fighter to have his service tenure increased two years and be promoted to cabinet secretary. Such double standards are not acceptable, said Mahfuzur. He demanded a "judicial investigation" into the disputed results, punitive measures those who meddles with the results, an end to decisions imposed upon civil service recruitment, and reconstitution of the PSC. Examinees Mohammad Sohel Rana, Mohsin Sikdar, Anwar Sadat Muhammad Sayem, Farrukh Ahmed, Abu Sayeed Mohammad Faysal, Prosenjit Guha and president of Amra Mukti Joddhar Santan Humayun Kabir were present. Mahfuzur said they would submit memoranda to the president and chief adviser on Sunday and stage a symbolic hunger strike at the Central Shaheed Minar on Eid day to press for their demands. bdnews
