 PARIS, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has been criticised by UEFA president Michel Platini for caring more about business than football. Platini, in an interview with French newspaper Le Dauphine Libere published on Tuesday, also rejected calls by Wenger and other coaches for video replays to help referees. "I am talking about football, he is talking about business. Please stop with Wenger and the others. All that interests Arsene is looking after number one," Platini said. Asked if video replays will one day be available to referees, the head of European soccer's governing body added: "I'm looking forward to Arsene Wenger never seeing that happen". Former France playmaker Platini also said he was delighted with Romanian side CFR Cluj's shock 2-1 Champions League win at AS Roma on their debut in the competition last week. "That is what makes football beautiful. That is what people like Wenger do not want to see, minor teams beating major ones, because they only want their business," he added. Fellow Frenchman Wenger told French sports daily L'Equipe: "I'm surprised by the aggressive tone used by Platini. "I am a supporter of good management of clubs, for financial equilibrium, and UEFA must equally support this idea. I am fighting for the future of the game and of football. Wenger also defended his support for the use of video replays, saying it would bring more justice to the game. "It is true I am in favour of video assistance to referees, just as all coaches are, and I think UEFA have an important role to play in that process. I defend sporting justice and UEFA should be responsible for that," he added
