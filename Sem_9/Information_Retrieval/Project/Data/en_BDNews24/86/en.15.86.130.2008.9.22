<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com) Awami League acting chief Zillur Rahman says his party will take part in the parliamentary polls but insists the upazila polls be deferred. "It would be better if the upazila polls were deferred by one to two months," he told reporters Monday evening. Reacting to the chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda relaxing registration rules Monday, he however said he was just giving his personal opinion, and not as the acting AL president. Zillur Rahman said: "It will be difficult to hold both elections at the same time." "Even if the present government announces the date for upazila polls, the voting can take place under the next government." Zillur hailed the CEC for his announcement and said: "The Election Commission has done it in response to the Awami League demand."
