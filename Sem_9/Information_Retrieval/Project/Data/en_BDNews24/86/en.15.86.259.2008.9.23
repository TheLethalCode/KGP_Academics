 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP said on Tuesday that it would register and join the general elections in line with new electoral laws and registration rules in a shift from its previous demand for holding parliamentary polls under unamended laws. BNP senior vice president MK Anwar announced the change of heart to reporters after a four-member BNP delegation emerged from a meeting with the Election Commission. "The Election Commission will change a number of provisions in the amended Representation of the People Order. We have presented our standpoint to the commission on the matter," he said. "BNP will participate in the elections after being registered as a political party," he added. The party said it still opposed holding Upazila polls just five days after national elections and suggested that they be deferred by one month. It also demanded immediate lifting of the state of emergency. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda hoped that BNP would register with the commission by Oct 15, the previously announced deadline for registration. "We are happy that BNP has shown interest in getting registered. We hope other parties will also accomplish the task by this time," Huda said. But, the CEC said the dates for Upazila polls would not be deferred. "The chief adviser has already said so." The commission has made preparations to hold Upazila polls on the fixed dates, he added. The Election Commission announced Monday that it would ease registration rules, in response to demands by parties in the last round of electoral talks. Huda had said changes would be made to some sections of the recently amended Representation of the People Order, but the ninth Jatiya Sangsad election would be held under new electoral laws and re-demarcated constituencies. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, former state minister Abdul Mannan and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and M Sohul Hussain were present at Tuesday's meeting. bdnews
