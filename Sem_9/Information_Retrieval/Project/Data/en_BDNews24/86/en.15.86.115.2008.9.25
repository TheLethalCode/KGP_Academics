 Dhaka, Sept 25 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina's personal physician Syed Modasser Ali lashed out at additional attorney general Mansur Habin for his statement in court opposing the former prime minster's bail. "The additional attorney general should apologise to the nation for such a statement made in a court of law. He gave wrong information," Modasser Ali said at a press briefing at Mujibunnesa Eye Hospital in Dhanmondi. Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud, speaking to bdnews24.com Thursday, also termed the statement of Mansur Habib indecent and politically motivated. On Wednesday, Mansur opposed Hasina's bail petition in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. He told the court that Hasina was freed on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, but "now she is doing well and travelling various countries in Europe." Mansur also mentioned that Hasina attended a wedding ceremony in Finland when she was ill. Modasser Ali said: "Hasina is suffering from glaucoma, permanent damage in her left eye, problems in the right eye, allergy, and high blood pressure." A glaucoma patient may turn blind if it is not treated at the right time, he added. "But I did not find anything in medical science that a person with such diseases should not be able to fly, travel or attend a function." Modasser Ali, briefing journalists about the health condition of Hasina, said the former PM was scheduled to see her doctors on Oct 17. It will take her up to four more days after that date to return home, the physician said. Modasser said her US doctors had changed Hasina's medication. A final report on her health would be available after two weeks of observation, he said. bdnews24.c
