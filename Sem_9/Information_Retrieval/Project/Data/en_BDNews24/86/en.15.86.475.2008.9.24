 Dhaka, Sept 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth Commission has extended the deadline for filing mercy petitions to Oct. 30 in the wake of poor response, its chairman said on Wednesday. "The commission has received complaints against petty officers. Have the top-level officials not committed corruption?" Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said in a weekly press briefing. "Under the circumstances, the deadline for submitting applications has been extended until Oct. 30," he said. The last date for submission applications was Sept 1. "We hoped to deal with lots of cases. But that did not happen," Habibur said. He asked the reporters: "You enquire about the officials and provide news." If nobody else comes or the Anticorruption Commission or any other organisation does not send files, the commission will be able to finish its tasks within the timeframe, the TAC chairman said. The clemency commission has so far exempted four persons of charges, he added. "Many people who have been sent to the commission are very sick. They have a very few properties. But they have been enlisted anyhow." "Truth commission has heard statements of 103 persons in total 17 working days. Documents of two cases have been sent back to National Coordination Committee on Curbing Serious Crimes as clemency was not sought," he said. "Of them 57 were ordered to submit Tk 16.44 crore to the state coffers and 25 people have so far submitted Tk 8 crore." "The commission will give letters of mercy to those who have submitted money from Thursday," the chairman said. President Iajuddin Ahmed signed the "Voluntary Divulgence of Information Ordinance 2008" into law on June 8, paving way for the commission to come into being. The commission started operations on Aug 3 and hearing on Sept 1. bdne
