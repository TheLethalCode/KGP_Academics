 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League says it will pick candidates for the general elections in line with the procedure set in the new electoral laws. The party is also contemplating fundraising to finance campaigns for the elections, acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said in an exclusive interview with bdnews24.com senior reporter Sumon Mahbub on Tuesday. He said two members of the party's advisory council had been tasked with suggesting the changes to the constitution to make the party eligible for registration with the Election Commission. Ashraful said all party operations were focused on the national elections slated for Dec. 18. The election coordination committee headed by HT Imam, a member of advisory council, had started preparatory activities. Imam will be assisted by a number of retired civil and military bureaucrats, the stand-in general secretary said. "The committee will organise training for the polling agents, publish leaflets, collect voter lists, start campaigning and many other related things." "The polls committee formed prior to the forestalled Jan 22, 2007 polls were mandated to assist (party chief) Sheikh Hasina. What exactly the committee should do this time should be decided by the party president herself when she returns," said Ashraf about the terms of reference of the polls coordination committee. The AL will go for election-focused advertisements through the print and electronic mediathe newspapers, radio and the TV, he said. Adverts through SMS and e-mail should would also be used, he said. Asked if they would start fundraising through public announcements to ensure financial transparency, he said they would like to adopt measures similar to the ones they had preferred after cyclone Sidr. Asked how the party should nominate candidates for the parliamentary polls, Ashraful said, "We'll follow the detailed procedure delineated in the RPO, which involves the grassroots compulsively." He said the AL will register with the EC after the Eid-ul-Fitr. HT Imam and Abul Mal Abdul Muhit have been vested with the responsibility of locating and determining the changes required in the constitution for subsequent approval by the executive council and deposition with the EC, he added. On the rejuvenation of the 'grand alliance', he said, "The party president will make a decision about that. The alliance this time might turn out to be a bit different though." Any party may join the 'grand alliance', Ashraful said, adding, however: "I am not referring to those parties born after [Jan 11, 2007]." "Parties such as CPB (the Communist Party of Bangladesh) may join; we will try and bring them in to the alliance." On Hasina's return, he said it was becoming "a little uncertain" whether the AL chief would be back in the first week of October. bdnew
