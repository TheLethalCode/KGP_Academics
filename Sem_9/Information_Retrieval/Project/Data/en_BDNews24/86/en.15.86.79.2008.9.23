 LONDON, Tue Sep 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Tuesday while demand for safe-haven government bonds grew as investors awaited details of Washington's $700 billion bailout plan from US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. But the dollar found traction having tumbled to a six-week low versus the euro on Monday as the Bush administration and Congress haggled over details of the rescue package. Initial exuberance about the plan to buy up toxic mortgage debt has given way to concerns about how the US government would fund it and whether the package would be enough to boost the world's biggest economy, which is facing a recession. "The bailout plans are coming under severe pressure now and there are more concerns surfacing then questions being answered. What're we going to need is a little more clarity," said James Hughes, market analyst at CMC Markets in London. "Something needs to be said, which is going to calm markets down a little bit and that should start to stabilize things a little bit." Nervous investors were also eyeing crude oil, which soared nearly 16 percent in its biggest one-day gain ever on Monday due to the expiry of the front-month futures contract and weakness in the dollar. November crude oil futures fell $2.51 to $106.85. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares shed 1.2 percent in morning trade, adding to Monday's 2.1 percent slide, while Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent. This followed a decline of 2.1 percent for Asian equities excluding Japan. Japanese financial markets were closed for a holiday on Tuesday. MSCI's world equity index shed 0.4 percent. Government bonds benefited from weakness in equities, pushing yields lower. The 10-year Bund yield slipped 3.2 basis points to 4.219 percent, while the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield eased 5 basis points to 3.80 percent. DOLLAR STEADIER The dollar edged up 0.4 percent versus the Japanese currency to 105.80 yen while the euro fell 0.6 percent to $1.4704. But analysts say the dollar's outlook remained negative. "While this bailout package does remove some of the systemic risk from the U.S. financial system, it's also clear that the potential rise in U.S. debt ratios and the effect on their fiscal balance will hurt the dollar in the medium term," Dankse Bank currency strategist Kasper Kirkegaard. More bad news on the euro zone economy was revealed with a closely watched survey showing services sector in Germany, the region's biggest economy, edged into contraction in September for the first time since January and manufacturing industry slumped to its weakest performance in over five years. However, all eyes are on Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who will testify before the Senate Banking Committee at 1330 GMT. "The focus for the market will be on further details that Paulson offers, if any, about the structure of the proposed fund to purchase 'troubled assets'," said analysts at Barclays Capital. Major central banks around the world have been pumping cash to improve interbank money markets, which practically seized up last week following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. There have been signs of improved liquidity conditions, with the overnight US dollar borrowing rate stable around 2.0 percent -- on a par with the Fed funds rate
