 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)  Transparency International Bangladesh does not consider that corruption is decreasing in the country, though it gained three places in this year's TI Corruption Perception Index (CPI) report. TIB's board of trustees chairman Muzaffer Ahmed said: "This is not a significant change in terms of statistics. With an increase in the amount of the data or sources surveyed, the score also increases." "Previously, the position of Bangladesh was identified on the basis of three data sources. This time data has been compiled from seven different sources. This does not help to understand whether the situation is changing or not," he said. "There are questions about index every year, as this year. In the past, Nigeria was almost in the same position with Bangladesh. There was sufficient graft in Nigeria last year, but this year it went down 121st position. We don't have any explanation of it." Data and sources are changing every year; it is not right to compare the current score with the previous one, Muzaffer said. The TIB chairman said: "Our parliament is not working. Graft cases are stuck in the judiciary." "We have observed that civil society was not very active over the last two years. Many discussions and seminars were held but none raised a strong voice against corruption." "Corruption remains in our country. We have not made significant advances in institutional reforms. The incumbent government has not taken adequate initiatives in this sector. Minor graft has also increased," he said. On the interim government's anti-graft drive, the TIB chairman said: "We have seen that the government failed to follow up its initiative. The drive was undertaken hastily." "It raised people's expectations. But the required pace of judicial procedure for fulfilling the expectations was not satisfactory. We also see inefficiency in investigation. People are disappointed." But, he continued: "The steps of the current government against corruption will help the elected government to press forward. People have expectations about the future of the drive." "We hope the next democratic government will fulfill people's expectations through various measures." TIB executive director Iftekharuzzaman said: "Our score has increased by a little. The score was identified from the data collected up to July 1, 2008." "Corruption is a worldwide problem. Nobody could score 10. Corruption prevails in every country. But many developed countries scored lower this year," he said. "There have been doubts about the anti-graft drive. The score might have been higher if the judiciary was not influenced," he said. "Bangladesh did not do better this year due to administrative graft, influence on the judiciary and uncertainty in the business sector," he added. Somalia, as previous year, remained bottom of the list meaning corruption in the country is perceived to be the highest, followed by Myanmar and Iraq in joint second from last position. Haiti is in third from last while Afghanistan is fourth. Denmark, New Zealand and Sweden have been ranked at the top, each scoring 9.3, closely followed by Singapore with 9.2, the only Asian country that has consistently been in the group of top 10 countries with the lowest perceived corruption. bdnews
