<TITLE> Malaysia's Anwar calls for patience in power bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, Wed Sep 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia's opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Wednesday appeared to backtrack on claims that he was poised to win power, saying he would "proceed cautiously" in his bid to unseat the government. Anwar has said repeatedly he had won over enough defectors from the government to form a new administration. But a self-imposed deadline of Sept. 16 passed and his calls to recall parliament for a confidence vote were denied. "I appeal to my Malaysian citizens, and particularly those who want to see a change, to understand, to be a bit more patient," he said after appearing in court on what he says are trumped up sodomy charges aimed at derailing his bid for power. Anwar did not set a new date and also denied that officials from his party had held talks with the government, contradicting a statement made by his spokesman on Tuesday. Anwar's claims to have enough MPs to take over have been mocked by the government that has ruled Malaysia for 51 years as a "mirage" and the press has started to question whether he can indeed deliver. The 61-year old opposition leader again challenged Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi to meet him and to hold a confidence vote when parliament returns from recess on Oct. 13. He said he had written to the country's king, who has the power to ask for a confidence vote. "The point is if they really believe I am a liar, put it to a test in the proper constitutional and legal framework. Put it to the test in a vote taken in parliament," he told reporters after his hearing. SODOMY TRIAL ADJOURNED Anwar was bailed and his sodomy trial was adjourned until Oct. 7 amid a legal wrangle between the defence and prosecution over whether the case should be transferred to the High Court. That would be normal procedure in a case as serious as the one Anwar is facing, but his lawyers fear the government will influence the choice of judge if the case is moved. Their objection was on the basis that Attorney General Abdul Gani Patail should not have played any role as he was being investigated following a complaint that he had tampered with evidence in Anwar's cases 10 years ago. Abdul Gani signed the transfer of court petition. Anwar, a former deputy prime minister, was convicted and imprisoned on charges of sodomy and corruption, derailing a career which had looked set to take him to the top. The erosion of Malaysia's steady political state has hurt the confidence of investors. Although many admire Anwar's plans to liberalise the economy, they fear that there will be a prolonged period of uncertainty. Data released on Tuesday showed 24 billion ringgit ($7.04 billion) of portfolio money flowed out of the country in the second quarter of 2008 -- after the March election -- compared with a 21.1 billion ringgit inflow in the first quarter. At the same time as Malaysia has been hit by political unease, the world has been thrown into turmoil by a U.S. banking collapse. The government has flip-flopped on key economic decisions, inflation has risen to levels not seen in a quarter of a century and the budget deficit is set to hit 4.8 percent of gross domestic product this year. Abdullah cut petrol prices by 4 percent after data showed the annual inflation rate remained at 8.5 percent in August, the same as in July. Rising petrol prices have been responsible for the spike in inflation and have hurt voters. As the political situation has deteriorated there have been attacks from senior officials from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the main party in the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition on Abdullah. Abdullah has said he will stand aside in 2010 to make way for his deputy, but some commentators are now questioning whether he will even stand in a party leadership election for which he has to nominate by Oct. 9. Two MPs from a small party in the coalition have already jumped ship, although they have not declared for Anwar. The losses have cut the government's majority to 56 in the 222-seat parliament. Anwar has said he has 30 Barisan Nasional legislators willing to join him
