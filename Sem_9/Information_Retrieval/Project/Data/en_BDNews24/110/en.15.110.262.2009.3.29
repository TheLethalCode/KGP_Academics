 Naogaon, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  Another case has been filed against former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui Saturday, pushing the cases against him to four since his arrest on Mar. 21 for allegedly voicing 'anti-state' sentiments. District Awami Ulama League joint secretary Ashek Elahi filed the latest case on charges of physical assault against Siddiqui, also district BNP leader, with Mahadevpur Police Station, where the three other cases were filed. Siddiqui was arrested at his home under the Special Powers Act following a general diary filed by Mahadevpur Police Station officer-in-charge Ilias Fakir and was detained for a month under the act. On Mar. 22, two extortion cases and two more general diaries were filed against him. A third extortion case was filed on Mar. 27. Fakir confirmed the fourth case Saturday. Elahi in the case statement said Siddiqui and his associates severely had beat him tying him up on May 25, 2005 on charges that Elahi had given anti-BNP statement during a religious gathering. At one stage, he said, they plucked his beard and forced him to promise that he would leave Awami League and take militancy training to stop AL. Elahi said had he not promised so, they would have killed him. Along with Siddiqui, seven more people, all BNP or its student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal supporters, were accused in the case. Fakir said they also received a few more allegations and were looking into those. bdn
