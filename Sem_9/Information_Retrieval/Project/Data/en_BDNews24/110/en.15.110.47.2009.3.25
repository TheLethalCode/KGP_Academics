<TITLE> 10 judges take oath </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) Ten High Court judges, who were dropped by the past BNP government and took up a years-long legal battle to be reinstated, finally took oaths to the Bench on Wednesday. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin administered swore in judges Md Abdus Salam, Mamtaj Uddin Ahmed, Md Shamsul Huda, Faruk Ahmed, Md Marziul Haque, Md Abdur Razzak, Hassan Fayez Siddiqui, AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury, Md Abdul Hye and Md Nizamul Haque Nasim, at the Judges' Lounge. The Supreme Court upheld a ruling earlier this month ordering reinstatement of the ten judges. The Appellate Division delivered its five-point verdict on Mar 2, disposing of a leave to appeal by serving judges against a previous High Court order to reinstate the ten judges with seniority. The legal fight began in 2003, as two of the judges originally petitioned the High Court, challenging the legality of the then-BNP government's decision to not award them permanent appointments. bdnews24
