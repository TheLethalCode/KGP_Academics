 WASHINGTON, Mar 27(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama said on Friday that many nations, including NATO partners and also countries like Iran, India and China, have a stake in achieving security in Afghanistan and Pakistan. "From our partners and NATO allies, we seek not simply troops, but rather clearly defined capabilities: supporting the Afghan elections, training Afghan Security Forces, and a greater civilian commitment to the Afghan people," Obama said in a speech outlining a new strategy for Afghanistan. He said he wanted to form a new contact group for Afghanistan that would include Iran, Russia, India and China, as well as NATO allies.
