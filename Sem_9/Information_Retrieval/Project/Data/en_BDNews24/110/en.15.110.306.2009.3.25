 SRINAGAR, Mar 25(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan-based militant group blamed for the Mumbai attacks threatened on Wednesday more violence in Kashmir after a five-day gunbattle with troops that killed 25 people. "The Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) will continue to render sacrifices for the freedom of Kashmir and coming days would prove costly for Indian forces," Abdullah Gaznavi, the spokesman for the group, told Reuters by telephone. Indian soldiers shot dead 17 militants and eight troops were killed in the gunbattle that began last Friday in Shamsbari forest near the Line of Control, a ceasefire line that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, officials said. Brigadier Gurmit Singh, a senior Indian army officer, said the militants were "well-trained, heavily armed and indoctrinated". An LeT spokesman said the group, established in the 1990s to fight Indian rule in Kashmir, had laid an ambush for Indian soldiers who were patrolling in the area. "India should understand the freedom struggle in Kashmir was not over, it is active with full force," Gaznavi said from an undisclosed location. "The gun battle should be an eye opener for New Delhi." Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan both claim Kashmir in full but rule it in parts and have fought two of their three wars over the Himalayan region. The Indian army said a large number of Islamist militants were waiting to infiltrate into the Indian side of Kashmir. "We are prepared for that," Singh told a news conference. India has blamed the LeT and other Pakistan-based militant groups for last November's Mumbai attacks, in which 166 people were killed. Pakistan denies any state agencies were involved. India also accuses Pakistan of arming, training and sending militants to its part of Kashmir, a charge Islamabad denies. India was forced to send more troops to the Shamsbari forest area to end the firefight against the heavily armed militants. "The firefight has stopped, combing operations are still in progress and the entire area is being searched and sanitised," Singh said, adding maps and communication equipment had been found which indicated Pakistani involvement. Tens of thousands of people have been killed since a revolt against Indian rule broke out in Kashmir in 1989. Officials say violence has declined in Kashmir since the two south Asian neighbours began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. New Delhi paused that dialogue after the Mumbai attacks.
