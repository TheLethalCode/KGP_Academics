<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)War crimes, committed during Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, will be tried under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973, said the law minister on Wednesday. "The government has made a final decision for trial of the accused under this Act," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the secretariat. He was speaking after the first meeting of the inter-ministerial committee on war crimes to examine if the trials would be possible under the existing law. One or more tribunals, of three to four members each, will be formed under the Act for the quickest trial of those accused of 1971 war crimes, said Shafiq. The process of bringing the accused to trial is already under way in many cases, he said. The law minister said the accused would have recourse to their own lawyers, and all legal rights would be guaranteed, including the right to appeal. "Anyone committing or abetting in the 1971 killings, rapes, arson or other anti-humanity crimes will be tried under the act," the minister said. "Whoever the criminal regardless of their political identity will be brought to justice." The trial procedure will begin soon by appointing prosecutors and the investigating agency, he said. A number of people have filed cases across the country demanding punishment for war criminals. The minister said everyone has the rights to demand justice, but the war criminals could be cleared if the allegations are not properly proved. "And one man cannot be tried twice on the same allegations." Questioned about the barring of BNP standing committee member Shamsul Islam from flying abroad, among others, Shafiq said: "Ask the government, not the law ministry." bd
