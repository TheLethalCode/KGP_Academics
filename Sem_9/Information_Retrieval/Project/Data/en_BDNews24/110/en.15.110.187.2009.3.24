 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan on Tuesday criticised detention under Emergency Power Rules by 'a democratic government', referring to the recent detention of a Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal leader in an illegal wealth case. The BNP joint secretary general told a press conference organised by the BNP-backed Sramik Dal that the past caretaker government sued labour leader Zafrul Hasan unfairly. "He has now been sent to jail under emergency powers rules by a democratic government." Hasan surrendered to a special judge's court Sunday in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission under EPR and ACC laws during the caretaker government's antigraft drive. The court denied him bail, ordering him to jail pending charges. "Both Zafrul and his wife are taxpaying citizens. They were sued unjustly and now he's been detained unjustly," said Khan on Monday. "If the emergency powers rules are not annulled immediately, it will impede justice during the democratic government's regime," the BNP leader said. "No one has ever alleged that Zafrul ever resorted to unfair means. He should be freed immediately." "We'll get him released legally," said Khan. "The government should not stop us from doing that on political differences." He demanded release of other Sramik League leaders at the same time. Sramik Dal senior vice president Abul Kashem Chowdhury, acting general secretary Anwar Hossain, metropolitan leader Nurul Islam Khan Nasim and others were present. bd
