 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  Some 30 people were injured as members of Hizb ut-Tahrir Bangladesh clashed with police at the Baitul Mukarram national mosque on Friday. Police arrested 10 members of the Islamist outfit, said Paltan police station officer-in-charge Farid Ahmed. Aged between 22 and 29, they were named as Sheikh Farid Babu, Sajjad Hossain, Ifran Mahmud, Manirul Haque, Ahmed Nizam, Maniruzzaman, Sohel Ahmed, Delwar Hossain, Imran Arif and Minhaz Zibran. A case has been filed against the ten along with over 300 unnamed agitators, said Farid. The Tahrir men, gathering at the north gate of the mosque after Jummah prayers, were demonstrating for withdrawal of a recently filed sedition case against a number of their leaders and workers. They also demanded release of arrestees in the cases and 'a proper investigation into the BDR mutiny incident'. At one stage, agitators blocked nearby roads hindering traffic movement, Farid said. "As police asked them to free the roads, the agitators pelted police with brickbats." Police charged with truncheons to bring the situation under control, triggering the clashes, while bystanders ran for cover, said witnesses. bdnews
