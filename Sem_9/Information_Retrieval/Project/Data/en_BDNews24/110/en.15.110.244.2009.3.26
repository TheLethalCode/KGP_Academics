 NAPIER, New Zealand, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ross Taylor and Jesse Ryder combined for a record 271-run partnership to help New Zealand recover from a disastrous start and reach 351 for four at the end of the first day of the second test against India. Taylor (151) and Ryder (137 not out) had come together at 23-3 within the first hour when Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma destroyed New Zealand's top order after the hosts had won the toss and opted to bat on a good wicket at McLean Park. The pair, however, rescued the hosts with their partnership, surpassing the record for any New Zealand wicket against India after tea. Mark Richardson and Lou Vincent scored 231 for the first wicket in Mohali in Oct. 2003. James Franklin survived a dropped catch by Yuvraj Singh in the slips and three confident lbw shouts in the final few overs of the day to remain with Ryder at stumps on 26 not out. India, who won the first test in Hamilton by 10 wickets, are seeking their first series win in New Zealand since 1968 but were dealt a blow when captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni sustained a back injury during the warm-up and was replaced by Dinesh Karthik. Virender Sehwag took over as captain and the absence of Dhoni did nothing to prevent opening bowlers Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma from reducing taking three New Zealand wickets in the first hour. The scenario was reminiscent of the first test in the three-match series at Seddon Park when New Zealand never recovered after slumping to 61-6 in the first session of the match. AGGRESSIVE APPROACH The 25-year-old Taylor however, chose not to temper his aggressive strokemaking despite the precarious position before lunch. He produced several anxious moments while on 99 and almost ran out Ryder while searching for a quick single after lunch. He brought up his third test century with an edged drive behind point for his 18th boundary from 151 balls to help the hosts to 233-3 at tea. After the break, the pair set the partnership record before Ryder brought up his second test century, when he guided a Zaheer delivery past backward point for his 14th boundary. Taylor finally departed when he top-edged Harbhajan Singh and was well caught by Yuvraj in the shadows of the main stand in the outfield. India's only other success occurred in the first hour when Ishant and Zaheer exploited what grass there was on the pitch. They had their first success when Tim McIntosh, who had played and missed several times to Ishant, was caught behind by Karthik for 12, though television replays showed he had not touched the ball. Jamie How, who replaced the injured Daniel Flynn, was then bowled by Zaheer for one on the last ball of the ninth over. Zaheer then gave himself the opportunity of a hat-trick after the first ball of the 11th over when a superb bouncer smashed into Martin Guptill's gloves and a diving Sehwag held the catch in the gully to dismiss the tall opener for eight. Ryder successfully fended off the hat-trick delivery before he and Taylor embarked on their record-breaking partners
