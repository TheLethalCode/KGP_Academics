<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has ordered the government not to harass or arrest Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak following a summons by CID investigators for questioning in the BDR mutiny case. The court also granted Razzak anticipatory bail Sunday up to Apr 5. CID investigation officer, Abdul Qahar Akhand, sent a letter of summons Saturday to the Jamaat leader to appear in his office Monday for questioning in the mutiny case. Sunday's High Court orders allow him to be questioned, but his passport cannot be seized. Razzak told reporters after the court orders: "I was summoned for questioning by the CID to be harassed." He said he had filed a contempt of court case against the government and airport police after he had been barred from flying out of the country despite court orders. "I was sent the summons for questioning immediately after that." He said he filed a petition Sunday challenging the summons and seeking a stay on the proceedings. His lawyer, Ajmalul Hossain QC, said in the hearing that his client had been summoned "with a motive". As there was no charge against Razzak in the case, he could not be summoned for interrogation, the lawyer pointed out. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said it was not against the law to summon him. Prevented from flight On Mar 7, immigration officials at Zia International Airport prevented Razzak from leaving the country. The following day, on a petition by Razzak, the High Court directed the government not to create any hindrance to his going abroad. On Mar 18, Razzak, with his wife Saleha Siddique, was again stopped at the airport. Airport police said they attempted to board a flight "by force" without proper documents. The following day, Razzak filed a case against the government for 'contempt of court' by failing to heed the High Court's 'no bar' orders. On Mar 22, the High Court granted the couple two months' anticipatory bail in a criminal case filed against them by airport police for trying to "forcefully" board a plane and for obstructing immigration police in their duty. The court also stayed the case proceedings. bd
