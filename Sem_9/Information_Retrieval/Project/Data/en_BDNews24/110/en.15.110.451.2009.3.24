<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Tue Mar 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An alliance led by the ruling Congress Party has lost ground over the last week amid coalition squabbles, but is still likely to win India's next general election, a Reuters poll of 14 leading analysts has predicted. The main battle of the April/May election will be between the Congress Party-led coalition, known as the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) led by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. A group of smaller political parties, including the communists, have formally launched a "Third Front" in a bid to provide an alternative to the two main national coalitions. On average, analysts said there was a 25 percent chance a Congress-led alliance, without communist support, would win. That was down from 27 percent in last week's poll. Congress has struggled to put together its alliance, unable to secure agreements for seat sharing with some key partners in states like Bihar and Tamil Nadu. There was a 31 percent possibility the Congress would win with leftist support, one point down from the previous week. The chance of an NDA victory was 24 percent, the analysts predicted, up from 23 percent last week. There was a 19 percent possibility of a Third Front government, up one point. India holds its general election from April 16 to May 13. Counting will be on May 16. Reuters surveyed analysts from a variety of backgrounds, including universities, pollsters and banks, on Monday and Tuesday. The poll does not aim to be scientific but to give readers a snapshot of how some of the leading India analysts are thinking. The following are the results of their replies. Reuters will repeat this survey on a weekly basis each Tuesday. Last week's results are in brackets. 1) HOW MANY SEATS DO YOU THINK CONGRESS AND THE BJP WILL WIN?
