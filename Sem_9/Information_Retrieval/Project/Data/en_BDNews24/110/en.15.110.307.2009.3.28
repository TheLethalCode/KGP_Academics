 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Hilsa trade, one of the Bangladesh's prime commodities, has netted an extra Tk 7,680 crore since the introduction of a programme to preserve jatka , or immature fish, five years ago. The sixth Jatka Preservation Week 2009 will begin on Sunday across the country to continue to April 4. As a single species, Hilsa is the most significant resource in the country, amounting to around 12 percent of the country's total fish catch and contributing 1 percent to GDP, said the fisheries and livestock minister on Saturday. "An extra 3.84 lakh metric tonnes of Hilsa fish have been netted in the last five years, worth Tk 7,680 crore, because of preservation of jatka ," Abdul Latif Biswas told reporters at the ministry. Bangladesh meets about 60 percent of the global Hilsa demand, with some 500,000 fishermen directly involved in the catch and around two million people involved in transportation, marketing, processing and export of the valuable fish. The government launched the preservation programme in rivers and seas in 2004. The annual Hilsa catch has been boosted to around 2.90 lakh metric tonnes last year, from 1.99 lakh tonnes five years ago, said the minister. Catching jatka was prohibited by a 1950 fish preservation act, said Biswas. "But the law was not properly implemented in the past. Only now is it being effectively enforced." Some 20 districts and 91 upazilas have been included under the programme, said the minister. Alongside fisheries officials and local administration, police, navy and coast guard are responsible for its success, he said. The government also started rehabilitation of fishermen under the programme, from 2004-05, by helping them with alternative employment during the low season. Some Tk 2 core was allocated for 11 districts in 2007-08 and 16,985 people were benefited, said the minister. The government is going to take the programme, rehabilitation and alternative employment, to 59 upazilas in 10 districts this yearChandpur, Lakshmipur, Barisal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Jhalakathi, Borguna, Shariatpur and Munshiganj. There are also Hilsa sanctuaries established in four districts of the country. Of them, the government has banned fishing of Hilsa and other fish in Chandpur, Lakshmipur and Bhola between March and April and in Patuakhali between November and January. Measures, such as sanctuaries, jatka preservation and Hilsa fishing bans in the reproduction season, have been applied as a result of research, Biswa said. The fish research institute and many universities are continuing to study the habitat, migration and reproduction of the highly prized species, said the minister. b
