<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)  The stalled work to make a four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway will start by June, the communications minister said Wednesday. The government will soon float tender for implementation of the project once the scrutiny of pre-qualification of the construction firms ends, Syed Abul Hossain told reporters at the ministry. The first tender for the Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane expansion project was invited in Sept. 2006, but the work is yet to start. The construction of Padma Bridge will start at the beginning of the next year and is expected to complete by three years, the minister added. Hossain said there was no more fund crunch for the bridge construction. A consultant has been appointed to design the bridge by Dec. Bids will be invited once the design is finalised and the construction will start from both ends to complete it in three years. More than one construction firm will be given the task to ensure transparency, the minister further said. On news reports of his office being decorated and a luxury car bought for him, Hossain said the Public Works Department was told to decorate the office as part of routine tasks. The department has completed the task by approving budget; the communications ministry or he did not have any hand on it, the minister said. The Roads and Highways Department moved to buy the car, but the process was postponed because wrong information was provided, he added. bd
