 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has urged all not to fear the "deep recession" but face it with "great courage". "There's nothing to fear; if we take up necessary preparations to combat the great crisis, we shall overcome," Yunus, 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, told reporters emerging from a meeting of the government taskforce to offset the impact of global recession. The government formed the 27-strong high-powered taskforce inclusive of treasury bench and opposition MPs, economists, business representatives and experts earlier in the week in line with election pledges to tackle the effects of the global crisis. The first meeting was held at the finance ministry with finance minister AMA Muhith in the chair. Yunus said since Bangladesh is not responsible for the crisis the developed countries, responsible for the crisis, must extend cooperation to combat it. Those countries are announcing economic recovery packages for their own economies, but they have been keeping mum about what will happen to countries like Bangladesh, he said. Yunus, managing director of Grameen Bank, with which he shared the Nobel Prize, was present at the taskforce meeting as an invited guest. bdn
