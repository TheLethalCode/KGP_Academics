 GUWAHATI, Mar 25(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen shot dead an editor of a newspaper in revolt-racked Assam, police said on Wednesday. Police said a group of gunmen fired several bullets at Anil Majumdar, editor of the Assamese daily 'Aji', while his driver was opening the gate of his house late on Tuesday in Guwahati, the state's main city. "The attackers fired indiscriminately from pistols from close range," G.P. Singh, a senior police officer said, adding Majumdar was killed instantly. The killing came days after security officials warned journalists that rebel groups could target some of them ahead of an upcoming general election in India. Majumdar, who had been campaigning for peace talks between the separatist United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) with the government, was in his late 40s. Police detained his driver for questioning.
