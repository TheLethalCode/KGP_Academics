 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vangipurappu Laxman scored his 14th test century after Gautam Gambhir had batted for almost 11 hours to ensure India secured a draw in the second test against New Zealand on Monday. India, who had been forced to follow on, declared their second innings closed at 476 for four shortly after Laxman had scored his century, and with New Zealand needing 163 to win in less than 17 overs, both captains agreed to call the match off. Laxman was unbeaten on 124, while Yuvraj Singh was 54 not out for India, who lead the three-match series 1-0 after a 10-wicket victory in the Hamilton test. Gambhir, who batted for 642 minutes and faced 436 balls, was finally dismissed for 137 after being trapped in front by offspinner Jeetan Patel before tea. It was the fourth lowest score in tests for anyone who has batted over 10 hours in a single innings. Only New Zealand's Jeff Crowe (120 in 609 minutes), Sri Lanka's Asanka Gurusinha (128 in 607 minutes) and West Indies' Shivnarine Chanderpaul (136 not out in 675 minutes) have scored fewer runs. Gambhir had produced a near chanceless innings before he reached 125, whereupon he hit the ball straight to mid-on where pace bowler Iain O'Brien proceeded to juggle then drop a sitter. India's lead at the time was just 13 runs after they were forced to follow on after being bowled out for 305 in their first innings, a reply to New Zealand's 619 for nine declared. Tendulkar was the only wicket to fall on the benign McLean Park wicket in the first session when he was caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Chris Martin for 64. Tendulkar, who had begun the day on 58, punched the fourth ball of the day through backward point to signal that he did not want to waste any time getting to his 43rd test century. The 35-year-old, however, added just two further runs before he was drawn forward by a Martin delivery that shaped away and a diving McCullum completed a superb catch to end his 97-run third-wicket partnership with Gamb
