 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)A "politically sensitive" statement made by the Bangladesh labour counsellor in Kuala Lumpur might have caused the cancellation of thousands of Malaysian visas for Bangladeshi workers, the foreign minister said on Wednesday. Malaysia cancelled the 55,000 visas earlier this month for workers expecting to join an estimated 500,000 Bangladeshis already in the country. Hours before her departure for Malaysia on Wednesday, Dipu Moni said labour counsellor Talat Mahmud had earlier told a Malaysian TV channel that his country had no problem amid the world recession as 70,000 more Bangladeshis were going for jobs despite the economic slowdown in Malaysia. The counsellor told the same to Malaysia's state-run news agency. "This was a really politically sensitive statement," Dipu Moni told journalists at her first press conference since her appointment as foreign minister on Jan 6. "It might have led to the cancellation of the visas for Bangladeshi workers." She said the demand for Bangladeshi workers in Southeast Asian nations was still high, however, despite the global recession. Mahmud, whom the Bangladesh media, quoting migrant workers, have branded a 'key person' for labour problems in Malaysia, has been stand-released, foreign ministry officials said. "The demand for labour in Malaysia, the sectors in which Bangladeshis work, still remains and will remain in the near future," said Dipu Moni. The foreign minister added that Malaysia had cancelled visas for Bangladeshis several times in the past but later relented. "I hope our workers will ultimately be able to go to Malaysia," she said. The foreign minister said she would 'informally' discuss the problem with the Malaysian leadership. "We can discuss this formally with the Malaysian authorities after formation of a new government there," she said. "If necessary, I will go to Malaysia again." The foreign minister was set to leave for Kuala Lumpur later in the day to attend the general assembly of the ruling party of Malaysia. Labour and overseas employment minister Mosharraf Hossain will join her, flying from Geneva. "If our visits are not enough the prime minister herself will go to Malaysia to resolve the issue," said Dipu Moni. The minister said there was some good news too. "Libya is recruiting more Bangladeshis. We also have got opportunities to export manpower to new countries like Jordan, Lebanon, Mali and Sudan," she said.
