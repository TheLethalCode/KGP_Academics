<TITLE> West Indies threaten boycott of final one-dayer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BRIDGETOWN, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies could boycott the fifth one-day international against England due to a dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), captain Chris Gayle said on Saturday. Gayle told reporters that pay talks between the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA) and the WICB have been inconclusive and that a boycott of the final match of the series in St.Lucia was being considered. "There's a possibility, I can tell you straight up. I am not going to go around any corner. We need this to be solved before the series is finished and forget about all these disputes, so it's a possibility," said Gayle. The West Indies skipper said that the players wanted to see, if not a complete deal, some sort of settlement before the end of the current series. "There are a lot of issues, but at some point we should actually reach some sort of agreement. This is the right time. "There should be some sort of guarantee to actually make sure things will be resolved and then maybe later on after the tour I am sure we can finish the rest of the issues," he said. Gayle said the dispute focused mostly on pay and conditions for first-class players in the regional competition rather than the international squad. "It's about more so the first-class players. We need a better structure when it comes on to match fees. We just want everybody to benefit out of this. "This has been going on for years and it is about time some sort of progress is made. Guys play first-class cricket for how many years and have nothing to show really. You have to play for the West Indies to earn some sort of living, which is very disappointing. "It's not about us really. We are just actually trying to help other players to benefit, so whatever strike there might be, it's for the other rest of players, definitely," he said. West Indies, who beat England 1-0 in the test series, are 2-1 up in the five match one-day series. The fourth game takes place at the Kensington Oval in Barbados on Sunday with the St.Lucia fixture on April 3. TOOK AIM Gayle also took aim at England batsman Kevin Pietersen for comments about West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul made in a British newspaper interview. Pietersen suggested that Chanderpaul's absence from the field after big innings, "leads me to think he plays for himself." "He has no right to make these sorts of comments. Whatever issues he had, he should have kept to himself," said Gayle. "I've played with Shiv for years and, as a captain, I get tremendous support from him both on and off the field. "I spoke to him [Pietersen] and told him I was very disappointed in him," Gayle added. "He didn't need to stoop to that level and I let him know straight up that I was disappointed in what I had heard. "He didn't actually apologise and if he could apologise that would be nice. "We're all big men, but there's no need to go to that level and degrade other players," he said
