 JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Didier Drogba marked his return to competitive internationals with two goals on Sunday, captaining the Ivory Coast to a crushing 5-0 win over Malawi in their opening World Cup qualifier.

Ghana were also victorious in Group D but two heavily fancied teams, Egypt and Nigeria were held to draws in Sunday's qualifiers. The Ivory Coast Coast made a perfect start with a first- minute goal from Christian Koffi Ndri before Drogba's double ensured a 3-0 halftime lead. His Chelsea team mate Salomon Kalou added a fourth midway through the first half before Marseille striker Bakary Kone completed the rout. The Ivorians share top place with Burkina Faso, who claimed a 4-2 home win over Guinea in Ouagadougou on Saturday. Ghana's Black Stars also scored a first-minute goal in their Group D qualifier against Benin in Kumasi but were unable to add to Prince Tagoe's effort. African champions Egypt suffered a major setback when they let a lead slip in their Group C match at home to Zambia in Cairo. They were held to a 1-1 draw after taking a first-half lead through striker Amr Zaki, who sneaked behind the defence to convert a clever cross. But a simple corner routine enabled Francis Kasonde to equalise 10 minutes into the second half. Mozambique had two efforts disallowed in their 0-0 draw at home to Nigeria, who might have snatched an undeserved win at the end of the Group B game in Maputo when Obafemi Martins shot into the side nett
