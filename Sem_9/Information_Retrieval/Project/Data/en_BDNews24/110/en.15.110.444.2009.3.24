 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Insurers say they are sitting on a pile of cash that could be invested in key development projects such as the Padma Bridge. "For projects like the Padma Bridge, insurers can mop up funds," AKM Rafiqul Islam, the president of Bangladesh Insurance Association (BIA), told a seminar on Microinsurance. The prime minister's adviser on economic affairs, Mashiur Rahman, who attended as chief guest, told the insurers to go rural, with products to boost agriculture. "Potential of policies for agricultural products should be explored," he said. Rahman said microinsurance has not reached the targeted population as the premium is not affordable for poor people. Rahman responded positively to demand that Insurance Ordinance 2008 and the proposed Insurance Regulatory Authority Ordinance be made laws.

"Sooner or later they [policyholders] are going to find it out," he said, warning of potential loss of confidence in the industry. He said a solution lay in a simplified procedure to deal with issues like record keeping, payment of claims and maturity values. Mohammad Sohrab Uddin, a former central bank deputy governor, said every insurer is required to determine premium rates using a mortality table prepared by the regulators. "However, no such mortality table has yet been prepared." Microinsurance, a product designed for the poor, entails a small premium on a small sum assured; premiums are paid more frequently in instalments. Introduced in the UK during the 1940s just after the Second World War, it targeted low paid wage earners. In Bangladesh, life insurance companies started offering the product in the late 1980s. Of late, micro-financing NGOs have also been offering such polici
