<TITLE> German unions find new allies in crisis </TITLE>

 BERLIN, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anna has worked for German conglomerate Siemens AG for more than 20 years and never saw the need to join a trade union -- until now. After the company urged her to take voluntary early retirement, Anna signed up with IG Metall, Germany's largest union, and she was not alone. The 40-year-old is one of more than 2,000 workers in Berlin who have joined the engineering union over the past year, giving the local branch its first membership increase since German reunification nearly 20 years ago. "I wanted to have someone strong in the background to support me in these times," she said, declining to give her full name to preserve the anonymity offered by the union. "Accepting (early retirement) would mean I'd be unemployed from May. I won't do that. Where would I find a new job in this crisis?" Across Europe, trade unions -- whose force in collective bargaining had been weakened by the availability of cheap labor in emerging markets -- are regaining influence in the crisis, rallying large crowds to call on governments to protect workers. From France to Greece, Portugal to Britain, unions have organized rallies to protest against government policies, demand more job protection, or help for the poor. In Germany, few union protests have so far been directed against the government. The crisis has instead pushed politicians and employers into unusual alliances with lobby groups. After years of decline, Germany's two largest unions, IG Metall and services union Verdi saw their members hold steady last year at 2.3 million and 2.2 million, respectively. "New members tell us they are worried about the overall economic situation," said Klaus Abel from IG Metall's Berlin branch. "Many also want to address wider questions linked to this crisis, such as how to regulate capitalism." The challenge for German unions over the coming years will be to make the recent pick up in membership last and translate those gains into concrete results in wage talks -- a tough task against the backdrop of the global economic crisis. UNLIKELY ALLIES The unions' political clout has been boosted by new-found support from mainstream parties and through alliances with previously union-wary employers, who are siding with the lobby groups in their shared pledge for state aid in the crisis. At carmaker Opel, management and unions joined forces to call for government help for the struggling General Motors unit. Billionaire widow Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler also held a joint rally with unions at her family-owned bearings maker, calling on the state to help her group, which is heavily indebted after buying control of auto parts maker Continental. Schaeffler, who had long rejected calls for more worker influence in the group employing 220,000, also reversed course on that and struck a deal with IG Metall last month. "It's a tactical move," said Heiner Dribbusch, senior researcher at the WSI Institute of Economic and Social Research. "Companies like Schaeffler, which weren't particularly union-friendly before the crisis, are now discovering the benefits of having a good partnership with the unions ... But it's still open whether this will become a trend." Some politicians, except perhaps the pro-business FDP opposition party, are also being drawn into the fray. "All parties, except maybe the Free Democrats are making an effort to get closer to the unions," Dribbusch said. Six months ahead of a general election, politicians in Germany's grand coalition of Social Democrats (SPD) and Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives seem already to have embraced some union ideas and moved closer to them. Merkel's SPD challenger, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, addressed Opel workers last month, making clear he was on their side. "You didn't cause this mess," he said. "You prepared Opel for the future. Staff and management did that. You have proved what strong unions and strong work councils can achieve." Hagen Lesch from the IW economic institute said trade unions had benefited from recent government decisions: "The public notices that the government is taking up union proposals and this boosts the perception of unions' competence." RISKS But the crisis is not without risks to unions, as examples from Germany's neighbors show. With companies starting to cut jobs, Spain's largest union, the CCOO, said some members have stopped paying dues. And in France and Italy, latent divisions between union movements risk deepening over strategies on the crisis. With Italy's center-left political opposition divided, the largest and most militant union confederation, CGIL, has become the country's main focus of opposition to the government and accused moderate CISL and UIL unions of being "pro-government." In France, the small, radical union Sud doubled its score in December elections for labor tribunals, boosting its potential to pressure bigger unions to become more radical. Union expert Lesch said German unions' main challenge was to make the current pick-up in membership last. "To have a sustained impact on wage policy, unions need more members... It's key for the unions to reach new sectors," he said, adding unions should try to recruit among those hit hardest by the crisis -- such as temporary workers
