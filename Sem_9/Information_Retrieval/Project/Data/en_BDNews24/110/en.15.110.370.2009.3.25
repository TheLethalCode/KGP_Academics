 SOFIA, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgarian champions CSKA Sofia are in danger of being excluded from European competition for a second consecutive year because of debts, a Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) official said on Tuesday. Bulgaria's most successful club with 31 league titles, CSKA did not take part in this season's Champions League after failing to meet the BFU's licensing criteria. "It's true. CSKA are in real danger (of losing their licence)," BFU licensing manager Krasin Krustev told Reuters. "There are several other teams who have debts but CSKA are in the most difficult situation. "They still owe a significant amount of money." However, Krustev said CSKA had until a March 31 deadline to meet their financial obligations. "We'll see, they still have time," Krustev said. "But the clubs will not be allowed to make amendments to their balances after March 31 and there will be no compromise." CSKA are second in the domestic league with 44 points from 19 matches, a point behind city foes Levski Sofia. "I hope we won't see a repetition of last summer's events," added Krustev. "This is a club with a lot of supporters and big traditions.
