 JAKARTA, Fri Mar 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A wall of water from a burst dam killed 52 people on the outskirts of the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Friday, crashing into hundreds of homes while many residents slept, officials said.

Rustam Pakaya, a health ministry official, said 52 bodies had been recovered, while hundreds of houses were under 2 meters (7 feet) of floodwater.
