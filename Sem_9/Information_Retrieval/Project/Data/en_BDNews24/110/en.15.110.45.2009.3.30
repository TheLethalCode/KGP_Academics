<TITLE> Australia PM Rudd's popularity near record peak: poll </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CANBERRA, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is at near-record levels, a poll showed on Monday, with a recession-fighting economic stimulus package making him one of the most popular leaders in the country's history. Rudd, who faces re-election by late next year, had risen four points to 74 percent approval with voters as economic turmoil gripped the country late last year, the Nielsen poll in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper showed. Support for Rudd's centre-left Labor government picked up three points since the last poll in November to hold a 58 percent to 42 lead over the Liberal Party when votes were distributed to the two major parties. "I guess people like and trust him, and see him as competent and doing a good job. I guess he's just perceived as a safe pair of hands," Nielsen pollster John Stirton told state radio. Rudd's approval level was close to the all-time poll popularity record of 75 percent set in November 1984 by former Labor prime minister Bob Hawke, who had wide appeal with voters due to his past drinking feats and easy-going personality. The poll was carried out while Rudd was in the United States for talks with President Barack Obama ahead of a meeting of the world's major economies this week in London. Factoring in a 2.6 percentage point margin of error, Rudd's popularity had actually equalled Hawke's, Stirton said. A rival Newspoll last week showed Rudd with a 65 percent to 20 percent popularity chasm between himself and Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull, while the government had a 56 to 44 percent lead over the conservatives. Australia moved a step closer to recession earlier this month when the country reported its first contraction in eight years, with the economy shrinking 0.5 percent. Year-on-year, the economy grew by 0.3 percent, the slowest pace of expansion since the country's last recession in 1991. The government hopes its A$42 billion ($29 billion) stimulus package, including cash handouts and infrastructure spending, will help the economy weather a downturn tipped to see joblessness hit 7 percent in mid-2010, up from 4.8 percent now
