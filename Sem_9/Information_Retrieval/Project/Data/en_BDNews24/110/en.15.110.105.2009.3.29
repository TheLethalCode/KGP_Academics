<TITLE> Bangladesh may play in first flood-lit Test at Lord's? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh are likely to be part of cricket history when they feature in a Test match under lights at Lord's next year. The England and Wales Cricket Board is yet to place the proposal to the ICC, but it is likely to be discussed in a meeting of the game's highest body in May, according to a report published in the Sunday Telegraph. 'As this would involve a change to the standard Test playing conditions and the clothing and equipment regulations for Test cricket, it would require our proper consent and the ECB has not approached us yet for any such approval,' Telegraph quoted Dave Richardson, the ICC general manager, as saying. Richardson, however, said that the ICC was supporting the research by the MCC, which included whether a white ball could be developed that could last longer and be suitable for the longer versions of the games. The change in playing condition could prompt a change in the players' traditional white kit and the red ball, which will no be easily visible under the floodlights. 'This matter will definitely be on the agenda of the ICC cricket committee meeting in May. Overall the ICC remains committed to the promotion of Test cricket, and if this means playing some Tests under lights, we should certainly consider it,' added Richardson. 'We need to play Test cricket at times when it is convenient for people to watch,' added the former South African wicketkeeper. The move has already infuriated the traditionalists and the Bangladesh Cricket Board also gave a lukewarm response. BCB spokesman Jalal Younus said, 'It's little bit surprising why they have chosen Bangladesh to start with?' He said they came to know abut the idea only from the media. Younus said that the ECB was yet to propose them officially. "We will not reject the proposal if it comes and the board will decide about it," said Younus. The main problem for a flood-lit Test will be the colour of the ball, Telegraph pointed out. The traditional red balls cannot be seen against a night sky, while trials with other coloured balls such as pink or orange have proved unsuccessful. bd
