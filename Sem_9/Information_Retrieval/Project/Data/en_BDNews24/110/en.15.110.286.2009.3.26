 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)- President Md. Zillur Rahman's message on the occasion of Independence and National Day: "On the occasion of the great Independence and National Day, I convey my heartfelt greetings and felicitations to the countrymen living at home and abroad. The historic Independence Day is a glorious day in our national life. We achieved our Independence through nine-month long armed struggle and immense sacrifices of lives. On this solemn day, I recall with utmost respect and pay my deep homage to the martyrs of the liberation war who made supreme sacrifices for achieving the Independence in 1971. I pray for the salvation of those immortal souls. On this memorable day, I remember with profound respect the Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who proclaimed country's Independence on March 26, 1971. Responding to his clarion call people from all walks of life participated in the war of liberation and snatched the Independence. I also recall with deep respect the four-National Leaders; valiant freedom-fighters and organizers who rendered their dedicated efforts and enthusiastic support that accelerated our great victory. The freedom fighters are regarded as the greatest sons of the soil and the supreme sacrifices of them would be ever remembered in the history of our Independence. One of the prime objectives of our hard-earned Independence was to build a happy and prosperous Bangladesh. Bangabandhu's cherished dream was to turn the country into 'Sonar Bangla' (Bengal of Gold) which is yet to be fulfilled. Keeping that in mind, the Government has been rendering untiring efforts in materialising the objectives of Independence. With the span of time, we have achieved some significant progresses both at national and international arena. Despite attaining the progress, we have to go a long way for attaining the cherished goals of Independence. I believe continued democratic process and united efforts from all are imperative in this regard. It is a matter of satisfaction that the democracy is re-established and the People's Government has been formed through the ninth Parliament. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the daughter of Bangabandhu has declared the 'Charter for Change' vis-a-vis 'Vision-2021' for beaming at the common mass. I am confident our country would be a happy and prosperous 'Sonar Bangla' through materialising the 'Vision 2021'- Inshallah. On this great Independence Day, I urge all, living at home and abroad, to work unitedly imbued with the spirit of War of Liberation to expedite economic self-reliance and democratic advancement. Khoda Hafez, May Bangladesh Live Forev
