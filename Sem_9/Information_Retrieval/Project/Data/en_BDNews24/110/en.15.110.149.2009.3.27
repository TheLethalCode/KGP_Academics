<TITLE> Tibetans need reminding of bad old days: cadre </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Fri Mar 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's newly declared Serfs' Emancipation Day will help convince young people that pre-Communist Tibetan society was oppressive, an elderly cadre known for his hard-line views on Tibet said in a rare interview. Still influential today, Yin Fatang was Tibet's Communist Party secretary from 1980-1985, when the region was just emerging from the devastation of the Cultural Revolution. A Han Chinese, he is one of the few high-ranking officials from outside Tibet to learn the language fluently. He is considered to belong to the dominant policy view that Tibet needs economic development, but not religious concessions. Yin, a lieutenant general, remains adamantly opposed to the influence of traditional religious institutions and of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader whom Beijing brands a separatist. His views give a glimpse into Chinese policymakers' interpretation of Tibetan unrest. "Western countries always want to use the Tibet problem to create trouble for us. Another point is that the Dalai clique will never let go of the idea that pre-reform Tibet was their paradise," Yin told Reuters at an exhibition on Tibet in Beijing. "On our side, some have forgotten what the past was like, therefore they caused trouble too." China declared March 28 Serfs' Emancipation Day, a public holiday, after the Tibetan plateau erupted in protests against Chinese rule, following deadly riots in Lhasa, on March 14, 2008. China has all Tibetan areas under tight lockdown this March, which also marks the 50th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule and the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in India. The 2008 riots, like unrest in 1959, were a "rebellion", Yin said, adding that the 1959 event was an "act of treason". "The March 28 anniversary is partly to counter-attack our enemies," Yin said. "I believe using this holiday to educate will strengthen the thought work in Tibet and make it more effective." Yin was singled out as a "leftist" whose hawkish policies have helped block any detente with the Dalai Lama. "There's been a struggle in the leadership (over Tibet) since the 1950s," said A. Tom Grunfeld, a professor at Empire State College of State University of New York. "In its simplest form, it's between a group that believes Tibetans should assimilate into China, and a second, that believes minorities should have their own specific policies." Yin entered Lhasa in 1951 and stayed for 20 years as a local cadre. He left in 1970 amid the Cultural Revolution in which fanatical Red Guards destroyed hundreds of temples. He returned as party secretary before being replaced by a man more sympathetic to Tibetans. "Yin not only went in early, he stayed. Most people didn't stay, because it was very hard," Grunfeld said. FAMINE From 1959 to 1961, during the famine years of the Great Leap Forward, the government bought grain from India to stave off hunger in Tibet, Yin said. Yin was one of a generation respected for its commitment to ideals of equality and service, but is also blamed for the recent destruction of a Buddhist community in western Sichuan, Robbie Barnett, a Tibet expert at Columbia University in New York, said. China has long defended its rule of Tibet, saying not only did it end centuries of serfdom, but it brought badly needed economic development. The Dalai Lama and other supporters of Tibetan self-rule say China is strangling cultural and religious traditions and subordinating Tibetans to an influx of Han Chinese migrants and investment. Strolling around the photography exhibit, Yin happily pointed to places he remembered, and to long-dead cadres who, like him, shared power with a Tibetan cabinet in the 1950s before gaining full rein to redistribute land through "democratic reforms". "Seeing people being oppressed I feel as sad as they are, and seeing them benefit from the democratic reform I feel as ha
