 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Journalists and workers of once top-selling daily The Bangladesh Observer, going without pay for the past 78 months, submitted a memorandum Tuesday calling on the prime minister to immediately intervene. They marched toward the prime minister's office from the office at Motijheel at 11am, but were stopped by police at Shahbagh intersection. Tarunatama Chakravarty, senior sub-editor of the broadsheet that is at death's door over money tangles and legal wrangles, said they formed a human-chain protest there after the interception.
