 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)  A Tk one-crore payday awaits either B. League champions Dhaka Abahani or Federation Cup champions Mohammedan Sporting Club when they square off in the Citycell Super Cup final at the Bangabandhu National Stadium at 5:00pm on Friday. Although this will be their fourth meeting this season, both teams are still keen to put on a spectacle worthy of the occasion. President Zillur Rahman is expected watch the game as well as the place-deciding match between Brothers Union and Chittagong Mohammedan that precedes the final. But both finalists are apparently struggling to pick their preferred starting line-up due to suspensions and injuries. Abahani, who had struggled to overcome Brothers in a two-legged semi-final, are concerned how to compensate for suspended midfielders Arif Khan Joy and Pranotosh Kumar. "No doubt we will miss Arif and Pranotosh in the final, but we have a strong reserve bench that can make up for this position," Abahani coach Amolesh Sen said at a preparation briefing at BFF House on Thursday. However, there is some good news for Abahani, who will see the return of Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim, who missed the second-leg semi-final due to suspension. Ibrahim's inclusion will bolster the depth of the Sky Blues' midfield that comprises promising Mamunul Islam, Abul Hossain and Jahed Parev Chowdhury. The Sky Blues stormed into the last four with a hundred percent record, but they toiled hard against Brothers before ensuring their final berth. "There is always tension when it comes to a Abahani-Mohammedan clash, but all of my players are eagerly waiting to prove themselves," said Amolesh under whose guidance the Dhanmondi-based outfit emerged champions twice in the B. League. Captain Nazrul Islam also said that the players had set their sights on the inaugural Super Cup trophy. "We are just one match away from the biggest prize and so we want to finish the tournament on a winning note," said defender Nazrul, who was dropped from the starting- line-up in the second-leg semi-final. With Joy and Pranotosh not available, Nazrul might return to the fold with Mohammad Sujan, Ghanaian Samad Yousuf and Wali Faisal protecting the defence. Jahid Hasan Emily and Nigerian Emeka Christian will be in attack and try to break the Mohammedan defence, which looks still vulnerable compared to previous matches. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq, however, said he had no major injury or suspension problems to worry about. Defender Hasan Al Mamun and Mofazzal Hossain Saikat are still recovering form groin and forehead injuries, so Rajani Kanta Barman, Ripon Khan, Kamal Hossain and Nigerian Emanuel Dami are entrusted to safeguard the defence. The Black and Whites' midfield comprises creative Arman Aziz, Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmud, hard-working Enamul Haq Sharif and Nasir Hossain. The Mohammedan coach also claimed that his midfield was much stronger than Abahani's though his main concern was over his strike pairing of Mohammad Robin and Nigerian Alamu Bukola Olaleken. Olaleken is still suffering from a stomach pain and was dropped against Chittagong Mohammedan, who went down 3-2 in the tie-breaker to give Mohammedan a final ticket. Maruf can call up another weapon Nigeria striker John Goodwin, who found the target in his debut match and that was his lone success in three matches. "We don't want to look back and hope the players will justify the name of Mohammedan by clinching the title," said Maruf, whose side, however, could hardly impress in previous matches. "I don't want to compare the performances of Mohammedan and Abahani, but it is always special when we both meet," said the young coach, who guided the Motijheel-based outfit to clinch the season curtain-raiser Federation Cup title. Captain Arman Aziz said, "Most of us are always ready to play in any position and we will play for the championship." bd
