 LONDON, Sun Mar 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior minister, who is in charge of British security, was forced to apologise on Sunday for using public money to pay for adult films, an embarrassment for Prime Minister Gordon Brown as he prepares to host a G20 summit. In the latest in a series of political rows over lawmakers' expenses, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, already under investigation over her housing allowance, said she mistakenly claimed for pay-per-view television when she submitted a bill for her Internet connection.

Smith said in a statement, "I am sorry that in claiming for my Internet connection, I mistakenly claimed for a television package alongside it." Her husband said he was sorry for the embarrassment he had caused his wife. "I can fully understand why people might be angry and offended by this," he told reporters outside his house. "Quite obviously a claim should never have been made for these films." Parliament's sleaze watchdog is already looking into Smith's claims for 116,000 pounds to pay for accommodation in London when she was staying with her sister. Smith says she followed parliament's rules and has done nothing w
