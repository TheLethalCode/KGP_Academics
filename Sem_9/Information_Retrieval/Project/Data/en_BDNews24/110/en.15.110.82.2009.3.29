 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) - Hail swept Dhaka on Sunday evening, along with ear-splitting thunder and a welcome downpour of rain, though power supplies were disrupted as strong gusts swept through the capital and its surrounds. The met office said the city saw 23mm of rainfall in just half an hour, from 6pm to 6:30pm. Signs of rain had been blowing through the city for days, with residents holding their breath in soaring temperatures for the coming storm. When it finally hit on Sunday, people caught unawares on the streets ran for cover and traffic came to a standstill as visibility was reduced to near-zero in the downpour. Polythene bags, curtains or any form of rainproof item was suddenly in demand at roadside stalls and shops. And then came the hail. The Mirpur Stadium ground was white with the stones, said a bdnews24.com correspondent caught in the downpour. Huge rickshaw tailbacks were seen at Kathalbagan Bazar in the city, said another, as pullers had to take shelter from the hard-hitting stones. Power tripped The control room of Dhaka Power Distribution Company said a strong gust of wind tripped an 11kv line in Dhanmondi and power was also disrupted at Banglamotor, Mirpur, Kalyanpur, Goran and several other areas in the city due to "gusts". Power supply was also interrupted in surrounding Demra, Narayanganj and Siddhirganj.
