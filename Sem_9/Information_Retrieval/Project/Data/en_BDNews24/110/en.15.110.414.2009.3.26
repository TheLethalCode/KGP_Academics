<TITLE> Muted joy as Bangladesh turns 38 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh celebrates 38 years as an independent nation state on Thursday, in an uneasy calm over security concerns, and without the traditional National Day parade by the armed forces. The government has ordered beefed-up security in all its cities, towns and major installations. The president, Md Zillur Rahman, will go ahead with the annual party at the Bangabhaban and customary gatherings, cultural programmes and other events will be held throughout the country. But the day falls exactly a month after the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters, dampening the celebrations. On March 26, 1971, independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed Bangladesh free after the Pakistani military rulers refused to honour a popular vote in Dec 1970. The announcement followed weeks of protests, violent campaign, the historic Mar 7 speech at the Race Course by the man who came to be lovingly called Bangabandhu (friend of Bengal), and a bloody crackdown on innocent civilians on the fateful night of Mar 25, 1971. The public holiday gives millions of city dwellers an extended weekend this year, but many remain apprehensive in the wake of speculation that the mutiny had external links, cautions by some government ministers that militants may attack civilian targets and a massive arms haul at a Bhola madrasa earlier in the week. Officials say there will be greater-than-normal security measures everywhere, while the government cancelled parade plans with the country still reeling from the massacre that killed 75 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the BDR. The capital will receive the most attention. "Around 2,000 additional security personnel as well as regular patrol teams will be deployed," additional deputy police commissioner Mohammad Walid Hossain told bdnews24.com on the eve of the celebrations. "About 1500 additional Rapid Action Battalion members will be on duty in the capital," Abul Kalam Azad (legal and media) director of Rapid Action Battalion told bdnews24.com. He said all other RAB battalions across the country will take similar steps. The Shaheed Minar in Dhaka University and the National Memorial in Savar, key spots for the day's celebrations, will be under extra security surveillance. bdnews
