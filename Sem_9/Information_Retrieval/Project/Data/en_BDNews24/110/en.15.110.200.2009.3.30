 LAHORE, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)Militants holed up in a police training centre in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Monday after storming the complex and mowing down cadets, killing, according to private TV station Geo, at least 26 and wounding 90 others. Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said 52 police were wounded in the attack but gave no word on the number killed. Punjab Governor Salman Taseer said the authorities had reports of four people confirmed killed, though television news channels put the number of dead at over 20. Army and paramilitary troops laid siege, firing from rooftops of surrounding buildings, while the gunmen returned fire and threw grenades to keep security forces at bay. "Our elite squad has surrounded the area. God willing, now we will get into the building," Mushtaq Sukhera, a senior police official, told journalists at the scene. "I have counted 12 bodies but I don't know exactly how many have been killed," said Mohammad Raza, another police officer. Governor Taseer said up to 10 gunmen carried out the assault, though one wounded policeman told Geo News channel there were up to 20 gunmen in the compound. It was unclear if any police were being held hostage. The assault came less than a month after a dozen gunmen attacked Sri Lanka's cricket team in the city, killing six police guards and a bus driver. Those gunmen escaped. The training centre is on the outskirts of the city, on the road to the nearby border with India. "It's a continuation of the series of attacks carried out by the terrorists," Taseer told journalists, adding that a curfew has been imposed in the area. The latest brazen attack will inevitably heighten fears about the mounting insecurity in nuclear-armed Pakistan. Islamist militants have launched a campaign of violence to destabilise the Muslim state of 170 million people and the one-year-old civilian government's ability to meet the challenge. U.S. President Barack Obama made support for President Asif Ali Zardari's government a centrepiece of a review of policy towards Afghanistan and Pakistan that was announced on Friday, and which made annihilation of al Qaeda the United States' principle objective. ATTACKED DURING MORNING DRILL Police official Sukhera said around 850 young cadets attended the training centre but police were unsure how many were inside at the time of the attack, which began at around 7.30 a.m. (0230 GMT). Television channels said several hundred trainees were at the centre when the attackers, some dressed as policemen, struck. Taseer said some were in civilian clothes and wore masks. An eyewitness told Reuters the gunmen attacked in groups of three or four from four sides, and lobbed grenades before opening sweeping fire on cadets assembled on the parade ground. The attack came as the police recruits were doing their routine morning drills, said a police officer. A police armoured personnel carrier (APC) entered the compound and an exchange of fire, including what appeared to be a grenade explosion, broke out, a Reuters photographer at the scene said. The APC then withdrew. One television station showed about a dozen police lying on a parade ground. Some appeared lifeless while others were crawling to cover. An army helicopter circled overhead, and police and soldiers were seen carrying wounded to ambulances. Militant violence has surged in Pakistan since mid-2007, with numerous attacks on the security forces and government and Western targets. Most violence has been in the northwest in areas along the Afghan border, but there have been attacks in all main cities. Despite the violence in Lahore, Pakistani stocks and the rupee were both firmer in early trade
