 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Sunday passed the Right to Information Bill 2009, exempting eight intelligence and law enforcing agencies, but making it mandatory for all other public-funded agencies to seek permission before refusing any information to citizens. The house unanimously voted the bill through as information minister Abul Kalam Azad proposed its passage. The main opposition party BNP was not present as it had earlier staged a walkout. The information minister first placed the bill in the house on Feb 25, containing almost no changes from the caretaker government's ordinance of the same name. The parliamentary standing committee on information submitted its recommendations on the bill to the House on March 15 supporting the provision to exempt intelligence and some law enforcing agencies from providing information. The agencies are: the National Security Intelligence, Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, the defence intelligence agencies, Criminal Investigation Department, Special Security Force, the intelligence cell of the National Board of Revenue, Special Branch of police and the intelligence cell of the Rapid Action Battalion. Under the new law, all other organisations funded by public money are obliged to reveal information to citizens. The past caretaker government passed the Right to Information Ordinance in October 2008 "to ensure transparency and accountability, reduce corruption and facilitate good governance". The law gives people the right to seek information from public offices and appeal if denied information. The government will set up an Information Commission to enforce the law and deal with appeals from information seekers. Organisations are not bound to provide information that might go against national security or sovereignty, confidential information received from foreign governments or information on affairs under trial and investigation. But none can refuse to provide information without prior approval of the commission, says the newly enacted law. Another three billsthe Speedy Trial (Amendment) Bill 2009, the Padma Multi-Purpose Bridge (Land Acquisition) Bill 2009 and the Public Procurement (Amendment) Bill 2009were also tabled in the House Sunday. Abdul Jalil, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce, also presented recommendations on the Consumers' Rights Protection Bill 2009.
