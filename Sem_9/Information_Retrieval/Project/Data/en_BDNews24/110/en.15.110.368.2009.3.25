 MILAN, March 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Giancarlo Camolese was appointed Torino coach for a second time after the Serie A strugglers sacked Walter Novellino on Tuesday. Former Sampdoria coach Novellino was dismissed after Sunday's 3-1 home defeat by his old side left the Turin club third-bottom and inside the relegation zone with nine matches remaining. "Torino announce the dismissal of Walter Novellino. The new coach is Giancarlo Camolese," a statement said on the club website (www.torinofc.it). Camolese was sacked by Livorno last April before they were relegated to Serie B. He was still under contract at Livorno but the Tuscan side earlier announced that he was free to leave. Italian clubs often keep sacked managers under contract so they can recall them to the dugout for no extra cost if their successors also leave. Camolese played for Torino before coaching the side to promotion to Serie A in 2001. Novellino had only become Torino coach for a second time in December
