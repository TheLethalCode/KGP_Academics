 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com) - The Rapid Action Battalion turned five on Thursday, with around 45,000 arrests, including 475 suspected miltants, under its belt. The agency, with members of the army, police, Ansar, BDR, Armed Battalion, and Coast Guard forces, made its debut on March 26, 2004, to crackdown on serious crime across the country. The elite anticrime force, with its hardline tactics, is widely held to have considerably surpassed other law-enforcing agencies in its various drives against militancy and terrorism, arms, narcotics and illegal VOIP. But the agency has also faced strong criticism over extra-judicial killings, usually described as deaths due to 'crossfire' or 'armed encounters'. Home minister Sahara Khatun told parliament this month that 373 people had been killed in 'RAB crossfire' during the BNP-led government's tenure. According to RAB headquarters, the 8,000-strong force has arrested 44,828 crime suspects to date, recovered more than 5,000 firearms and over 51,000 rounds of ammunition. It has arrested 449 members of the banned Islamist group Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh, including its top leaders, and another 26 militants of other outlawed groups. The elite force also showed much success in anti-narcotics operations, recovering 150kgs or 42,561 puria of heroin and 164,000 Yaba tablets among other drug seizures. Around 250 RAB members have been brought under punitive measures so far due to negligence of duty, misconduct or indiscipline. The agency was celebrating its fifth anniversary with a subdued programmes in the wake of the tragic Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny that left 75 dead at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters exactly a month ago. bd
