 Rajshahi, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com) - Six educational institutions in the divisional town that shut their doors in the wake of student violence at Rajshahi University, will reopen soon, the mayor said Tuesday. However, the re-opening two universities, Rajshahi University and Rajshahi University Engineering and Technology, is still uncertain, AHM Khairuzzaman Liton said. The decisions came from a joint meeting of local administration presided over by divisional commissioner Hafizur Rahman Bhuiyan and attended by vice chancellors and principals. Those to open their doors again are Rajshahi Medical College, Rajshai College, New Degree College, Government City College, Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute and Paramedical College. The meeting also decided to slap a ban for two to three months on political activities at the institutions, following their re-opening to prevent a repeat of violence. Clashes between Jamaat-backed Islami Chhatra Shibir and Awami League-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League at Rajshahi University left a Shibir leader dead and scores injured earlier in the month. The violence spread to other educational institutions prompting the authorities to close their doors sine die. bdnew
