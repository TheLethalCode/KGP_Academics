 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga, usually seen as a tough, uncompromising figure, touched on a personal drama and came close to tears in a television interview on Monday. Dunga, a hard-tackling former midfielder who snarled his way through three World Cups, became emotional when he was asked about the pressures involved in his job, one of the sport's toughest.

Dunga added that Brazil's European-based players also wanted to be popular in their homeland. "They loved us in Europe but this wasn't enough for us," he said referring to his playing days.
