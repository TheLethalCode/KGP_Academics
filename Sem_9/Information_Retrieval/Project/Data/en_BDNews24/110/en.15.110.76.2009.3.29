<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)The law minister has asked for another week to further review a bill to amend the Criminal Procedure Code, that had been expected to be passed in parliament Sunday. The review amis to iron out any possible "conflict" between the metropolitan police and executive magistrates. Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with senior police officers Sunday that his ministry had asked for seven more days to scrutinise the bill before presenting it to the House. The new bill recommends empowering the government to appoint executive magistrates in every district, when necessary. "Police officers fear that the CrPC amendment, if passed, will give rise to conflict between the powers of the executive magistracy and the metropolitan police," the minister said. They have asked that the Metropolitan Police Act 1976 be given due weight, he said. "We don't' believe any conflict will arise," said the law minister. "But in light of their request, we've decided to take a little more time to examine the bill more closely. We'll ask for a week more to do so." Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told reporters, "We discussed the CrPC Amendment Bill with the law minister." "We told the minister that that as far as we are concerned, the law that has been governing the metropolitan police administration and operations since 1976 should suffice. Nothing new needs to be added." The state minister for law Qamrul Islam, Sanjida Khanam MP, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, additional IGP Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura, RAB director-general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker, DMP commissioner AKM Shahidul Islam were among those present at Sunday's meeting. bd
