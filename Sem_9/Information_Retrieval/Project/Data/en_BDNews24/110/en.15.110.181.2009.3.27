 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com) - Brothers Union finished third in the Citycell Super Cup after coming from behind to defeat Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club 3-1 in the place-deciding match at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Friday. Nigerian Henry Quaye, Rezaul Karim Liton and Mehdi Hasan Tapu struck one goal apiece for the Oranges while Guinean Raphael Sagno netted the long goal for the Black and Whites of the port city. Brothers conceded a goal within a minute of the match getting underway. Raphael, following a centre-kick, shrugged off his marker Amit Khan Shuvo to advance into the Brothers box before unleashing a low shot past advancing goalkeeper MN Shakil to give Mohammedan a 20-second lead. But Brothers hit back in the ninth minute when referee Azad Rahman awarded a penalty after defender Prodip Barua fouled Tapu inside the box. Henry converted the spot kick to level the margin. In the 30th minute, Henry put a Rikto throughpass to Tapu, who got into a better position with only goalkeeper Mamun to beat, but the striker floated over the post while Ridon shot a Raphael pass lamely to ruin Chittagong Mohammedan's chance of regaining the lead. Mohammedan came close twice to going in front. Substitute Zitu's powerful shot to the near post was brilliantly saved by goalkeeper Shakil in the 49th minute. Eight minutes later, a speedy Zitu was brought down by Liton inside the Brothers box and Raphael squandered the penalty hitting the sidebar. Brothers Union then went ahead with another penalty in the 61st minute when the referee adjudged defender Khan Sharif of fouling Shakil Ahmed. Substitute Liton converted the spot kick to give Brothers a 2-1 lead before Tapu sealed the match 10 minutes from time with a powerful shot inside the box. Brothers were awarded Tk 7 lakh while Chittagong Mohammedan got Tk 6 lakh. bd
