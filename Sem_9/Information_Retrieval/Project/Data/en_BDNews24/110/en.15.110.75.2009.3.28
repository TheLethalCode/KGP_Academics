<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Friday the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny was meant to plunge Bangladesh into civil war and wipe out the people's mandate in last year's national polls, but failed in its objective. "The Peelkhana carnage was part of a deep-seated conspiracy," she said at an awards ceremony of the Bazlur Rahman Memorial Medal 2008 for journalism on the independence war. "The mutiny was staged as part of a plot to push the country into civil war," said Hasina at the National Museum ceremony. "It was meant to foil the verdict of the people in the December elections." "But it failed." The prime minister urged all to be vigilant, nevertheless, as "the conspirators were still active". "They will strike again," she said. 'Learn from four-party fate' Speaking at a separate gathering on Friday, to mark the country's independence anniversary, Hasina cautioned her party to learn from the consequences of BNP's past actions. "We must learn from the fate of BNP and the four-party alliance," she said, of the opposition alliance who lost disastrously in the Dec 29 general election. She told party leaders and activists, gathered at the IEB auditorium, that power was not an end in itself. "We must put the needs of the nation first." "God doesn't give power in everyone's hands. Those to whom power comes shouldn't abuse it," she said.
