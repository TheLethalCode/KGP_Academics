 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Mar 29 (bndews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has recommended passage of the Upazila council bill in such a way that would make elected chairmen virtually toothless. According to the final recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee on local government, MPs would be the ex-officio advisers to the 482 Upazila councils where the chairmen must accept their recommendations. The draft bill, placed in parliament on Feb. 24, had a section where MPs were made advisers but their recommendations were not mandatory for the councils to heed to. The committee at a meeting Sunday made the Upazila Nirbahi Officers the members-secretary to the councils while the elected chairmen would be in charge of planning and monitoring development programmes at the grassroots. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was in favour of making the MPs advisers but not making their recommendations mandatory, had to cave in to the pressure of MPs. "[The prime minister] deleted a section for making MPs recommendations mandatory," committee chairman Rahmat Ali told bdnews24.com after the meeting at parliament building.. "But the MPs questioned what was the point to be advisers without work." He said that the committee, which was the right authority to change draft bills, had unanimously finalised the recommendations and that he would place the report in parliament Monday. "The committee unanimously recommended that the MPs will be advisers to all Upazila councils which must accept the MPs recommendations," said Ali. "We have also made the Upazila Nirbahi Officers the members-secretary who will provide secretarial assistance to the councils. "The Upazila councils, not the Upazila chairman, will implement the recommendations to the MPs," the committee chairman said. He said as the bill was placed in parliament for the revival of the Upazila Act 1998, the MPs must have the role specified in the act. 'City coporations too' The standing committee will also recommend making the MPs advisers to all city corporations, Ali later said. He, however, did not make it clear whether recommendations of the MPs would be made mandatory for city corporations to conform to. Local Govt Ordinance The military-installed caretaker government passed an ordinance in 2008 and annulled the Upazila Act 1998 in an extra-constitutional move. The Local Government (Upazila) Ordinance 2008 deleted a section of the Local Government (Upazila) Act, 1998 which forced the Upazila councils to accept the MPs' suggestions. "The Upazila chairmen have enough powers as per the schedule of the Upazila Act of 1998," Ali added. The schedule stipulated 18 functions of Upazila chairmen, mainly planning, monitoring and implementing some local development programmes including road construction, water supply and managing sanitation. Once the bill is placed in the recommended form, the House will discuss it for passage. Making the MPs' recommendations mandatory for Upazila councils was a controversial issue. Striking a balance Prime minister Sheikh Hasina recently said her government would strike a balance between the MPs and Upazila chairmen. Successive governments since passage of Upazila Act of 1998 failed to hold the Upazila polls in the face of strong opposition from the MPs. The MPs used to control the development activities at the local level in absence of an Upazila council nurtured by the bureaucrats. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, state minister Jahangir Kabir Nanok, Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, Ali Ashraf Khan Khasru, Monowar Hossain Chowdhury and Abul Khayer Bhuiyan attended the meeting as committee members.
