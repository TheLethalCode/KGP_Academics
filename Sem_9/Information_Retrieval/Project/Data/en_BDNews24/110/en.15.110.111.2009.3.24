 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)The government fears militant attacks on the readymade garment factories, the state minister for home said Tuesday. "Some militant outfits have been on the prowl to carry out sabotage in and around Dhaka City," Tanjim Ahmed Sohel said after a meeting with the newly elected BGMEA office bearers at his office. "We've alerted the law-enforcement agencies to the threat. Whoever should try to mess with the RMG sector must be ruthlessly dealt with. Each and every offender will be searched out and punished." He, however, said the government didn't have specific information about any impending militant attacks "(But) the turns and twists of recent events have compelled us to be apprehensive of such ominous forebodings." "The recent phenomena made us consider the chances of workers being instigated or militant attacks in the RMG units." The new BGMEA leaders headed by president Abdus Salam Murshedi duting the meeting with the home minister and the junior minister discussed the government's steps in handling the global recession, security of commodities in transit, raising an industrial police force and curbing terrorist acts. Asked if the BGMEA had any information on any impending militant attacks, Murshedi circumvented the issue. "We've discussed different problems faced by the RMG sector, the mainstay of Bangladesh's economy." bdne
