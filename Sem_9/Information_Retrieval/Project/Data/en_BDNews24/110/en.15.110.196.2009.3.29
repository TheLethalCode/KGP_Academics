<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Emile Heskey has been ruled out of England's World Cup qualifier against Ukraine on Wednesday after injuring himself in the 4-0 friendly victory over Slovakia at Wembley on Saturday. "Emile Heskey has been withdrawn from the squad because of a hamstring injury and has been sent back to his club," an FA spokesman confirmed on Sunday. The Aston Villa frontman's withdrawal means England coach Fabio Capello is short of strikers for Wednesday's Group Six clash after Carlton Cole, who came on to replace Heskey on Saturday before also hobbling off, suffered a groin injury. Heskey, who scored his first England goal for six years against Slovakia, underwent a scan on Sunday. Fellow striker Peter Crouch, who also went off with a knock against Slovakia, will be fit. "He was taken off as a precaution," the spokesman said of the Portsmouth player. "He is okay for Wednesday." Tottenham Hotspur's Darren Bent has been added to the squad for the visit of Ukraine but coach Fabio Capello resisted any temptation to call on Newcastle United's Michael Owen despite his record of 40 goals in his 89 England appearances. "No, he only played 20 minutes of his last match and is not in the best form," Capello said of Owen. Kevin Davies of Bolton Wanderers, who has scored 11 goals in the Premier League this season, has also been overlooked. Better news for England, who lead Group Six with four wins out of four, is that Wayne Rooney appears to have re-discovered his best form for England. The Manchester United player scored twice against Slovakia to make it seven goals in his last four appearances for England. "He is the joker in the pack, he can play in any position," Capello said of Rooney who may even play as a lone striker against Ukraine
