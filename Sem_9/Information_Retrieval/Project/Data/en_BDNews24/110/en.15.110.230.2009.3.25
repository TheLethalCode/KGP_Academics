 JAKARTA, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesian police were searching parliament in central Jakarta on Wednesday after receiving a phone text message warning a bomb had been planted there, they said. "The information about the threat was received in a text message sent to a police office and police have been securing and checking the place," said Chrysnanda Dwilaksana, a spokesman for the Jakarta police. The assembly is in recess as Indonesia holds parliamentary elections on April 9 and presidential elections on July 8. "Many police are here but I don't know whether they have sealed the area off or not," Dwi Haryanto, an official in the parliament building, told Reuters
