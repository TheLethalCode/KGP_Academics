 Gazipur, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)  Unknown gunmen terrorised workers of MT Sweater and Banga Fashions on Saturday over control of the rag business at Gachha in Gazipur's Sadar Upazila. According to factory workers and witnesses, some 25-30 people riding a dozen motorcycles tried to storm into the garments factory at 1pm. Security guards prevented them entering, but they smashed windows of the five storied-building with bricks. They also fired four to five rounds of bullets that spread panic among the factories workers. Five workers, including 38 year-old security worker 'Shamsher', were wounded with bricks pelted at them. Law-enforcers were deployed shortly after the incident. Factories authorities alleged the attackers were local hoods, who unleashed the attack as they did not receive Tk 2 lakh per month that they demanded. However, some workers said people sided with the owners were dealing in the rag business. Of late, "a group of youth" were trying to grab the business. Abdur Rashid, officer in charge of Joydevpur thana, said a case was underway. bdn
