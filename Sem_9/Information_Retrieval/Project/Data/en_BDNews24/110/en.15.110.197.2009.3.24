 LONDON, Mon Mar 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Executions rose more than 90 percent to 2,390 last year, with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States responsible for over 90 percent of those, Amnesty International said on Tuesday.

Nevertheless, Amnesty said there was increasing evidence that the United States was turning away from the death penalty -- executing 37, the lowest number since 1994 -- Argentina had abolished the death penalty and there was a "clear move toward abolition" in central Asia.

"Belarus is the last country in Europe and the former Soviet Union that is still carrying out executions," it said. Four people were executed there in 2008. Amnesty said 25 of 59 countries with death penalty laws on their books carried out executions last year.
