<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club set up a Super Cup final clash with arch-rivals Abahani after a 3-2 shoot-out win over their Chittagong Mohammedan SC in the return-leg semi-final on Tuesday following a 1-1 aggregate result. The eagerly awaited final is on Friday. The match rolled into extra time and later penalties after Akbar Hossain Ridon struck an 80th minute goal to give Chittagong Mohammedan a lead in the regulation time, meaning a 1-1- aggregate result following Dhaka Mohammedan's 1-0 win in the first-leg semi-final. The hero of the match was Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Haq, who blocked three consecutive spot kicks from Camara Saifullah, Nasir Hossain and Kamrul Islam Pavel before being beaten by the last two shots taken by Raphael Sagno and Prodip Barua. Mohammedan's John Goodwin first shot outside, followed by Paul Emanuel Dami, whose shot was blocked by Chittagong goalkeeper Mamun Khan, who, however, faile to stop the last three spot kicks taken by Maruf Ahmed, Enamul Haque Sharif and Khaled Hazem Mahmud. "We actually lost to Aminul not to Mohammedan," said Chittagong coach Nazrul Islam Ledu. "It was tough to beat Dhaka Mohammedan with a 2-0 margin though we were successful in taking the match to a shootout after a 1-0 win in regulation time," said Ledu adding that they were also unlucky in the match. All credit went to country's number one goalkeeper Aminul, who had foiled a lot of scoring efforts to frustrate the port city team. "From the beginning of my career, I am quite confident under the post in the shootout as my target is always to block one or two shots to give the side an advantage," said Aminul. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq praised Chittagong Mohammedan for the way they played from the word go, but he thought that his side had started slow but was steady. Given the performance on the pitch, Dhaka Mohammedan did not appear like a giant on the field as they were beaten in all three departments by their opponents. Following suspension in the first-leg semi-final, midfielders Arman Aziz and Enamul Haq Sharif returned for the second match, but they had virtually no impact on the pitch rather the Chittagong trio midfielders Camara, Anthony Pele and Mousa Fontain Camara controlled the midfield. Besides, without injured striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken, the Mohammedan attack looked toothless, which hardly troubled the opponents. "Our play was centred round Bukola and we fell in trouble with his absence as we could not keep the ball on the offence. That's why Chittagong Mohammedan dominated us," said Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz. It was almost a pedestrian first half except for an attempt from Touhid, who dodged past two Mohammedan defenders to hammer a powerful drive outside the box, but Aminul gripped it at his second attempt two minutes from the breather. After resumption, Chittagong Mohammedan sent on Ridon in place of Anthony to sharpen the attack and they almost got the dividends in the 80th minute with Ridon taking a lofted volley past Aminul. Mohammedan, however, were deprived of a certain goal in the 40th minute when a free kick from Hazem returned after hitting the Chittagong Mohammedan post. bd
