 Dhaka, Mar 26 (bdnews24.com) - Talk of militancy is undermining the country's independence, security and sovereignty, Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami said on Thursday. Claiming that manifold conspiracies are being hatched against Islam and Islamic leaders, he urged all to be united to counter the plotters. "There was a plot to undermine the country's defence through the Peelkhana carnage. Those who do not want the Bangladesh Army self-reliant hatched the plot," he said, while addressing an Independence Day discussion at Al-Falah Auditorium in the city's Moghbazar. "Those who say that there is no need of Army in the country are initiating propaganda," he said. "To make the country's independence meaningful, national unity has to be built through people's direct participation in running the country," he also said. He spoke for protecting national security, sovereignty and strengthening defences along with economic prosperity and better education. Jamaat assistant secretary general ATM Azharul Islam, Dhaka metropolitan unit secretary Hamidur Rahman Azad, assistant secretaries Nurul Islam Bulbul and Abdul Hamid spoke among others at the discussion. Jamaat-backed student organisation Islami Chhatra Shibir brought out a procession to mark the day from the northern gate of the Baitul Mokarram National Mosque. The procession ended at the National Press Club. b
