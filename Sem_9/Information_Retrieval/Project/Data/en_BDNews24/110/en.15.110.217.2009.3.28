<TITLE> Muhith backs 'crisis fund' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister AMA Muhith has said he prefers subsidies over cash incentives, and also backs the idea of a special public-private 'crisis fund', for recession-hit exporters. On the much publicised demands for cash incentives by businesses facing global recession fallout, Muhith said it would be unrealistic to expect the government to just dole out money. "I prefer expanding subsidies rather than cash incentives." Muhith, however, supported the idea of creating a 'recession fund', with contributions from government and the private sector, where businesses could get soft loans to overcome the present difficulties. Former finance adviser to the caretaker government, AB Mirza Azizul Islam, suggested the same in an interview with bdnews24.com earlier in the week. He said the government should form a crisis fund for loans at low rates, rather than a proposed recovery package. "I personally believe no extra facility is required for any sector in the face of the global economic downturn," Mirza Aziz said. "Let's follow the directions of the budget in terms of assistance to any sector," he said. "But as an additional contingency plan for the recession, a special fund at government and private initiative can be formed." They would repay the loans once they get over the situation. The government according to its ability and well-heeled big businessmen can contribute to the fund, said the former adviser. New budget to cater to PPP Muhith said Saturday the government was also planning to introduce a new allocation in the next budget for private-public partnership (PPP) schemes. The initiative aims to take PPP beyond infrastructure development, he said. He stressed the potential of public -private investment in avenues like education, health and human resources development in overcoming those challenges. Muhith said PPP had to be introduced in the budget and expanded as fast as possible. "The new budgetary provision would also allow more investments from foreign and local entities." He spoke too of the need of increased public investment saying that the country's public expenditure is the lowest in the region. The finance minister was speaking Saturday at the start of a two-day conference, titled 'Development with Equity and Justice: Immediate Tasks for the Newly Elected Government' and organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue. The talks aim to identify, with inputs from key civil society stakeholders, a set of actionable agendas to overcome the challenges facing the country's economy today, says CPD.
