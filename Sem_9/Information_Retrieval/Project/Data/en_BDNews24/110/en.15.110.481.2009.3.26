 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)-Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's message on the occasion of Independence and National Day: "Today is the 26th March, the great Independence and National Day. At the very first hour on this day in 1971, the greatest Bangalee of thousand years, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh. Under his undaunted leadership, the independence of our beloved motherland. Bangladesh, was achieved through a 9-month bloody war and supreme sacrifices of 3 million martyrs, agonies of two lakh women and sufferings of millions of people. On this memorable day, I pay my deep respect to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives during the War of Liberation. I recall with deep gratitude the greatest hero of our national freedom struggle, Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. I pay tributes to the four national leaders and the valiant freedom fighters. I recall with deep gratitude those who lost their near and dear ones, who were subjected to inhuman torture and repression and the freedom-seeking people in achieving the independent and sovereign Bangladesh. I also recall the overt and covert support and cooperation of the friendly foreign countries and their citizens in attaining our long-cherished independence. On the occasion of the great Independence and National Day, I convey my best wishes and congratulations to the countrymen as well as all Bangalees living abroad. On the eve of the Independence Day, I call upon the countrymen to remain alert against the concerted evil activities of the anti-liberation, communal, autocratic and identified reactionary forces. The anti-liberation forces are still desperate to nudge their claws aiming at shedding blood, like the past, they are still engaged in plotting designs and hatching conspiracies to obstruct the national progress and advancement. I urge the people to get united to resist their evil acts. The Independence earned through the bloody war is the noblest achievement in our national history. The spirit of Liberation War would have to be spread everywhere to make this glorious achievement meaningful and sustainable. Equally important is to ensure justice, good-governance and higher living standard for our people. To achieve the objective, we have to work with highest sincerity and honesty being imbued with the spirit of Liberation War and patriotism. Our government is committed to establishing the values of the Liberation War and fulfilling the election pledges. We are also committed to building a 'Golden Bengal' free from poverty, hunger and illiteracy as dream by Bangabandhu. Retaining the true history of the War of Liberation in our hearts, we would have to go ahead to achieve the objective of 'change' through building a Bangladesh free from corruption, mal-governance, terrorism, hunger and poverty. I am looking forward to see that the spirit of the great Independence and National Day is reflected in our all activities. Joi Bangla, Joi Bangabandhu. May Bangladesh Live Forever." bdnews24.com/wz/1323h. Mahmud/M
