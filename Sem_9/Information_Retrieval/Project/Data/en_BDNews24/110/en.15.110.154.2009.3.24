 NEW DELHI, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone raised the glamour quotient at one of Indias premier fashion events, walking down the ramp and enjoying the throwback to her modelling days. Padukone, 23, was the show-stopper twice -- for designers Ranna Gill and Rina Dhaka -- on day four of the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week in New Delhi. The actress dazzled audiences in a multi-hued full-length gown and a short brown-and-white dress on a day when ballroom gowns and cocktail dresses ruled the ramp. Its great to be back with the people I started off with and to know that they feel the same way for me, Padukone told reporters after the show. It's really nice to come back to where I started off from. Brown and black dresses dominated Rina Dhakas autumn/winter designs while Ranna Gill featured dark brown, green and blue gowns and mini-jackets in her collection. Earlier on Saturday, designer Renu Tandon draped nine career women from different fields -- including actress Chitrangada Singh -- in black and grey balloon dresses and golden sarees. Designer duo Swapan and Seema also put the spotlight on the feminity, power and success of women in their Champagne and Roses autumn/winter collection
