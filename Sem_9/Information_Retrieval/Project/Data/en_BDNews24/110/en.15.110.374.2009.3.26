 Chittagong, March 26 (bdnews24.com)At least seven holidaymakers were killed and another 30 injured as their bus skidded off the Chittagong-Cox's Bazaar highway and crashed into a roadside ditch on Thursday. bdnews24.com correspondent Ruhul Amin Rana said the bus was returning to Bogra from a holiday outing at Cox's Bazar when it crashed trying to take a turn near Chunati in Lohagara at around 9.30am. At least seven passengers were killed on the spot, said Rana. Lohagara police chief Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com, "The identity of the deceased could not be known immediately, nor do we know which Bogra organisation they belonged to." "Emergency workers are trying to pull the bus upright. At least 8 to 10 people are still stuck inside the bus," he said around midday. "Around 30-35 passengers were rescued." The injured have been admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Lohagara General Hospital and Satkania General Hospital, said Kabir. Ziaul Haque, a local reporter, said a two-kilometre tailback was created on the highway, holding up traffic headed both ways.
