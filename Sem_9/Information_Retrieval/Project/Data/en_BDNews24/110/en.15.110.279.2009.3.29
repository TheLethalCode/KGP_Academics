<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP staged a walkout from parliament Sunday, alleging the speaker violated the Rules of Procedure over Sheikh Selim's "derogatory" remarks on Ziaur Rahman. Sheikh Selim said Ziaur Rahman, then a major in the Pakistani army, was involved in the mass killings in Chittagong on March 24 and 25 in 1971. BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury hinted that his party might resort to continuous boycott of parliament in view of Selim's comment on the BNP founder. "We have walked out protesting the speaker's role," Chowdhury told reporters afterwards. "The BNP will not return tomorrow. It is difficult to say when our MPs will rejoin. "We will discuss the issue at the party's highest level," he said. Earlier, with deputy speaker Shawkat Ali briefly chairing the session, Rehana Akhter Ranu, one of BNP's new women MPs to take up a reserved seat Sunday, had launched an attack on Sheikh Selim. "Some ruling party MPs and ministers including Sheikh Selim are suffering from a disease. The victim of this disease tells lies," she said. Two other women MPsAsifa Ashrafee Papiya and Rasheda Begum Hiraalso protested remarks on Ziaur Rahman. Since Ranu mentioned him personally, Selim sought, and was granted, opportunity to give a personal clarification under the parliamentary rules. With speaker Abdul Hamid back in the chair, Selim spoke for 12 long minutes. "It was the Bangabandhu who declared independence on March 26. It was mentioned in our declaration of our war of independence. "According to the message sent by the US Information Centre said Bangabandhu declared the war of independence. "Our liberation did not come as a result of any announcement from any goats and or insane persons. "Only the Bangabandhu had the political and moral authority to declare the war of independence," said Selim. He alleged that Ziaur Rahman tried to unload arms, which were supposed to be used against Bangladesh, from a ship in Chittagong port in the days before the Mar 25 crackdown by the Pakistani army. "Ziaur Rahman was involved in the massacres that took place in Chittagong on Mar 24 and 25 in 1971," said Selim. At this stage, the BNP MPs started shouting and banging their desks, trying to draw the speaker's attention. Selim argued that the three BNP MPs made irrelevant statements instead of reading out notices, and asked Hamid to expunge the "irrelevant remarks". Hamid announced that everything other than the written notice would be expunged. But BNP's Chowdhury said the speaker had no authority to expunge the statement of the BNP MPs. Chowdhury said the three new MPs did nothing wrong, they only expressed "the party position". "The Rules of Procedure does not give the speaker the right to expunge the statement," he said, citing Rule 71. But, he said Sheikh Selim talked with the leader of the House before taking the floor and made a "derogatory" statement on Zaiur Rahman. "As per Rule 307 of Procedure, the speaker has the right to expunge any 'unparliamentary' and 'derogatory' comments of any MP. "But he did not expunge Selim's remarks," he said. bdn
