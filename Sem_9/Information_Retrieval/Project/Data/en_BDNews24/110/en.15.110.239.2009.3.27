<TEXT>
 NAPIER, New Zealand, March 27 (Reuters) - New Zealand batsman Jesse Ryder repaid the faith shown by national selectors that he would kick an alcohol problem after scoring his first test double century against India on Friday. The 24-year-old made 201 out of New Zealand's 619 for nine declared in the second test, raising valuable partnerships with Ross Taylor (151), James Franklin (52) and Brendon McCullum (115) to put his side in command after the tourists slumped to 79 for three at stumps. Ryder had combined with Ross Taylor in a record partnership of 271 after the hosts, down 1-0 in the three test series, were reduced to 23-3 in the first session of play. Resuming on his overnight 137, he played a true test innings with few false shots, batting for more than eight hours until he completed his double century. He hooked Zaheer Khan behind square for his 24th boundary to reach the mark, but played on the next ball while chasing a wide delivery. The burly left hander, dismissed the next ball after reaching his maiden test century in the first game in Hamilton, was visibly angry with himself, smashing his bat into the ground. He also banged his bat against his pads several times as he trudged back to the stands and threw the bat into the seating area outside the New Zealand dressing room. "It was a wide half volley. I was disappointed in going so far and working so hard to get to where I did. To get out like that really angered me," Ryder told reporters. "It probably looked a lot worse than what it was. I was just disappointed at the time; what happened, happened." Ryder's innings was the third highest by a New Zealander against India. It caps a remarkable month given his international cricketing future appeared in tatters just after it had begun a little over a year ago. He required surgery to reattach tendons in his hand after he punched a window in a nightclub following a late night drinking session after a one-day match against England in Feb. 2008. The months of rehabilitation forced him out of the return tour last May. When he returned to the team late last year, he promised to abide by team rules about alcohol consumption. His guarantees appeared to ring hollow when he was stood down for a one-day match against West Indies in January for missing training, again after a heavy drinking session. However, the selection panel kept faith with him which he has repaid in bundles in this series. Ryder scored his first one-day century against India and his first test century in the 10-wicket first test loss in Hamilton. His innings is also the highest test score at McLean Park, surpassing West Indies captain Chris Gayle's 197 last December. "It's definitely a good feeling. I just stuck to my gameplan and I came off with a double," he said. Ryder, playing his eighth test, has scored 768 runs at an average of 64 since making his debut against Bangladesh last October. "I can't ask for anything more at this stage of my career," he sa
