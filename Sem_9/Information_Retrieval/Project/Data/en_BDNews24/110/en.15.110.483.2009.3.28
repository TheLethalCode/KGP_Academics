 Naogaon, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com) - Former deputy speaker and BNP leader Akhtar Hamid Siddiqui faced a third extortion case Saturday, said police. "A sacked police constable, Julfikar Ali, filed the case with us," said Ilyas Fakir, Mohadebpur police officer in charge. Julfikur accused the deputy speaker of taking Tk 1.5 lakh to reinstate him in the job, said Ilyas. "However, the complainant says he did not get his job back." "He (the deputy speaker) even threatened murder, according to the complainant," the OC said. Siddiqui was arrested from his home on Mar 21 under the Special Powers Act for allegedly expressing 'anti-state' sentiments. He was detained for a month under the act. The next day two extortion cases were filed against him. Saturday's case was the third. Two general diaries have also been filed against him since his arrest and detention. bdn
