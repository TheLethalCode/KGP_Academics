 Bhola, March 26 (bdnews24.com)Four officials of the Green Crescent Madrasa and Orphanage, where huge quantities of arms were seized two days ago, were being grilled by police from Thursday. A Bhola court remended madrasa 'trainer' Russel, 30, caretaker Hamid, 30, Abul Kalam, 32 and Jasim, 35, into police custody for 10 days' interrogation. Rapid Action Battalion arrested the four Tuesday in a raid that unearthed a huge cache of firearms, ammunition and bomb-making equipment at the heavily secured madrasa compound at Ram Keshobpur in Sachra union, Borhanuddin, some 20 kilometres from Bhola district headquarters. Massive haul The recovery included four handguns, four shotguns, 3000 'splinters' for bombs, 900 rounds of bullets, eight magazines, two binoculars, two remote-control devices, six life jackets, 20 facemasks, two walkie-talkies and as many mobile phones. A number of books on Jihad were also recovered. There were 11 children, aged between 5 and 6 years, present during the raid. UK-based charity Major Mamun Ur Rashid Mamun who led the operations said Green Crescent, which began constructing the madrasa-cum-orphanage on the 12 acre site four years ago, was found to be a UK-based charity organisation. A man known as 'Faisal', living in London but now in Bangladesh, funds the institutions and oversees the operations, said Mamun. The UK's regulatory Charity Commission has announced it will investigate the alleged links between Green Crescent and the arms haul. The commission's website said that in 2008, Green Crescent had a turnover approaching 70,000 ($102,733). 'Preparation for major operation' Mamun said the suspected militants, including the four arrestees, were preparing for a major operation. The four were initially sent to Barisal RAB camp after arrest for interrogation, he added. Fortified compound Another sweep for weapons was made Wednesday at the compound that was fortified by a 'drawbridge', closed at night, over a large pond leading to the madrasa entrance. RAB combed the pond but found no further weapons. Two acid bottles were found in trainer Russel's room. The investigators also searched the entire compound with metal detectors for underground caches. RAB-8 deputy assistant director Md Ali Wednesday filed a case with Borhanuddin police accusing the four arrestees under the arms and explosives acts. Borhanuddin police SI and investigation officer of the case, Rafiqul Islam, produced the four in court before chief judicial magistrate Md Jakaria midday Thursday. The court granted his request for 10 days' remand. 'NGOs' under scrutiny 'NGOs' under scrutiny The government just last week said it would examine NGO financing and activities and take strict measures against those found to be channelling funds to militants in Bangladesh. Finance minister AMA Muhith said on Mar 18 "the large number of NGOs" approved during the past four-party alliance government by the then social welfare minister and Jamaat-e-Islami leader, Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed, would be audited meticulously. He said funding of militants came through many sources, both individuals and organisations. bdnews2
