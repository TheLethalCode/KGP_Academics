 KABUL,Tue Mar 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai will attend a conference in the Netherlands next week where the United States, the UN and Afghanistan's neighbors, including possibly Iran, are to discuss ways to end the Afghan conflict. Karzai will also travel to the Turkish capital in early April, a spokesman for the Afghan president also said on Tuesday, but declined to say whether the trip to Ankara would coincide with a visit there by US President Barack Obama on April 5-7. The flurry of diplomatic activity comes as the United States is due to unveil its new strategy on Afghanistan and Pakistan that is expected to include a greater emphasis on economic assistance, more troops and a regional diplomatic approach.

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is also due to attend the Ankara meeting, diplomats said, part of a series of talks hosted by Turkey to try to bring the two often feuding US allies closer together to combat the Taliban insurgency that threatens both the neighbors. Afghanistan is suffering its worst levels of violence since 2001, with Afghan forces and 70,000 international troops engaged in daily firefights with Taliban insurgents mainly in the south and east who have also launched scores of suicide bomb attacks. Some 5,000 people, including more than 2,100 civilians, were killed last year alone, a 40 percent rise on 2007, the United Nations says.
