 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court sent 60 more border guards, accused in the BDR mutiny case, to jail pending charges on Saturday. Chief metropolitan magistrate Minhajum Munira also ordered two days' fresh remand for five BDR men and sent another two to jail after their remand ended. Around 700 border guards have been arrested in connection with the mutiny case filed by Lalbagh police last month. Amnesty International has expressed concern over illegal detentions, interrogations and treatment in custody and the recent deaths of BDR soldiers in the aftermath of the mutiny. The global rights group, in a statement released Friday on its website, said "all detainees should be promptly released unless charged with recognisable criminal offences". It urged the government of Bangladesh to ensure that detainees are not subjected to torture, that they have access to lawyers, family visits and courts and that they can challenge the legality of their detention. Amnesty also called on the country's authorities to institute an independent, impartial and competent body to investigate the deaths of four border guards who died in the past two weeks. Two reportedly committed suicide and two died of heart attacks, according to authorities. Amnesty said, "There are credible reports suggesting that these detainees may have died as a result of torture." bdnew
