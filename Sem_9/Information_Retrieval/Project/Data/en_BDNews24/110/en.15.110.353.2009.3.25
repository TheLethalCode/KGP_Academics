 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com)The dead body of a BDR jawan of 38 Rifles Battalion was found Wednesday at BDR's Sylhet headquarters in Akhalia. The dead soldier was identified as 23 year-old Waliullah Sheikh of Vandartake village in Batiaghata Upazila. Mokshed Ali, BDR assistant director at the Sylhet headquarters, told bdnews24 that an executive magistrate and assistant commissioner of police recovered the body from a toilet. "He appears to have committed suicide," said Ali. "He was at Peelkhana during the February 25-26 BDR rebellion and later reported at Sylhet's Kotwali police station," the AD added. The body was sent to Osmani Medical College Hospital for autopsy. A case of unnatural death has been filed with Kotwali police, said Ali. At least two previous 'suicides' of BDR soldiers and three deaths after hospitalisation, for unspecified reasons, have been reported in the capital and elsewhere since the BDR mutiny. Rights bodies, including the US-based Human Rights Watch, have expressed concern at the spate of sudden deaths. bdn
