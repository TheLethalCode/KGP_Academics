 LOS ANGELES, Fri Mar 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sharon Osbourne lashed out on Thursday at suggestions that her family's history of drug and drink addiction made them unsuitable to host a TV variety show. Osbourne, her Black Sabbath husband Ozzy and children Jack and Kelly -- who shocked and delighted audiences on their reality show "The Osbournes" -- make their return to US television as a family next week as hosts of a show featuring, skits, audience pranks and a sprinkling of four-letter words.

Sharon Osbourne acknowledged that some of the skits might prove controversial but said that none were mean-spirited. "I don't care (about the reaction). As far as my barometer goes, we weren't being mean. It was all in good fun," she said. The heavily-bleeped MTV reality show "The Osbournes" about the family's dysfunctional life in Beverly Hills ran for three years and won an Emmy award before ending in
