 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)Low rainfall and increased soil salinity is threatening Boro production over 2,200 hectares of land in the southwestern coastal region, says an agricultural official. "Paddy plants in the Khulna region have already become reddish and the plants may perish if there is no immediate rainfall," Anil Chandra Sarkar, deputy director (monitoring) at the agricultural extension directorate, said on Tuesday. Anil told bdnews24.com cultivation in some northern districts is also at risk as water levels in some areas of Jamalpur and Mymensingh are falling and shallow tube wells cannot lift adequate water for irrigation. "We have been informed that, for lack of rainfall, salinity in the southern zone, especially Khulna area, has risen to the surface. As a result, paddy is threatened," he said. "If rain is delayed, paddy over 2,200 hectares may perish. Immediate rainfall may save some." In the current month, the Khulna division saw just one mm rainfall in Mongla on March 3 and Chuadanga on March 10. On March 12 Mongla received 2 mm rainfall and Chuadanga one mm. In February, it rained for just one day in Khulna, Mongla, Satkhira, Jessore and Chuadanga. Meanwhile, Z Karim, former chairman of the Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council, told bdnews24.com, "If there is no rainfall soon in the coastal area, salinity may increase. But the crops can be saved with sweet water irrigation.." He also said if there was rainfall to meet the needs of the land "within ten days", it may be possible to avoid crop loss. Chief met officer Sujit Kumar Sharma told bdnews24.com that there was rainfall in some places. "It may increase in the next one or two days." "The unusually dry weather is due to lack of the southern wind," he said. Under such a situation, he said, "If good irrigation can be managed, production can be safeguarded as adequate sunlight is available". The area of Boro cultivation in the current season is estimated to be 4,675,000 hectares. But Sarkar said, "Cultivation at the field level is reportedly more than that. Boro production target is one crore and eighty lakh tonnes." bdnew
