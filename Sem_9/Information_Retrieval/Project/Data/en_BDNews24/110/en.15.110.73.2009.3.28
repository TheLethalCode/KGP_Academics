 Morshedur Rahman bdnews24.com Dinajpur correspondent Dinajpur, March 28 (bdnews24.com)  Tens of thousands of residents around the Barapukuria Thermal Power Plant in Dinajpur have been facing a pure water crisis as underground water levels have dropped over the past two years, say locals and officials. Over 40,000 people in 34 villages of Parbatipur and Phulbari upazilas, around the power plant, are suffering from water crisis, Sakhawat Hossain, chief engineer of the local public health engineering office, told bdnews24.com. Authorities have sunk 14 deep tube-wells in Yusubppur village, in Hamidpur union, Parbatipur, just to serve the power plant. Of them, at least seven to eight are pumping water round the clock, as the plant requires 2,500 metric tonnes of water each hour, said Hossain. The water table is dropping fast under nine villages of Habrha union and 17 villages of Hamidpur union in Parbatipur and eight villages of Shibpur union in Phulbari, he said. Water cannot be lifted in these villages with shallow tube wells, of less than 30 feet depth, he said. Villagers say there has been no water all year in their area, except during the rainy season, since the set up of the power plant two years ago. Drain water for washing "We stock up on drinking water for two to three days from deep tube wells, but we have to use the drain water of the power plant for everyday washing and everything else," Hasna Banu, a villager of Hamidpur union said. The power plant's used water is dumped in the river via a seven kilometre long drainpipe. "Villagers get infections and skin diseases as the water as it contains many chemicals," said Hasna. To meet the crisis of pure drinking water, the Water Development Board provided every family a pipeline at a cost of Tk 200 to deliver water from deep tube wells some two and a half months ago. But the promised water has yet to appear. The power plant's chief engineer, Abdul Malek, also admitted to the water crisis. "We have prompted the Water Development Board to solve the problem immediately," he told bdnews24.com. He hoped the crisis would be solved within weeks. On the use of drain water by villagers, Malek said: "As ammonia and phosphate are being mixed in the water used for power plant, problems are likely." Sakhawat Hossain said a high level meeting of LGRD ministry, Power Development Board and Petro Bangla officials, in Dhaka on March 15, decided to introduce powerful pumps for more deep tube wells in the villages. The power ministry would provide the funds and tenders would be invited soon, he said. bdnews2
