 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  The government has given the national committee investigating the Feb BDR mutiny 30 more work days to submit a report, a committee member said Monday, the deadline to submit the finds. Additional home secretary Golam Hossain, a member of the 11-strong government-installed panel, told bdnews24.com they had sought the time for a proper investigation. The committee applied to the home ministry Sunday requesting more time. The committee was re-constituted on Mar 2 and it began work the following day. The first deadline for its report, Mar 9, had already been extended by seven working days. On Mar 23, the committee got another four days. Earlier on Feb 26, the government had formed an inquiry committee headed by the home minister, but later reformed the committee to be headed by retired civil servant M Anisuzzaman amid calls for removal of ministers. The state minister for law was also dropped. The Feb 25-26 mutiny at the border guards' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka left at least 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force killed. bdnew
