 NEW DELHI, Fri Mar 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A government ally in Tamil Nadu will forge a new regional alliance in a blow to the ruling Congress party's attempts to secure a national coalition weeks before the general election. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) party said it would join Congress opponent the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in the April/May poll. The ruling United Progressive Alliance (UPA) suffered another potential setback when three of its regional allies formed what local media called a "Fourth Front" or "front within a front" to run in the heavily populated states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The following are answers to questions about the PMK's pullout. WHO ARE THE PMK ... The PMK's support base is a caste concentrated in the northern half of Tamil Nadu. The party supports the Tamil Tigers' fight against the Sri Lankan government for a separate Tamil homeland. It has in the past been a fickle regional ally to the central government but prides itself on having supported the winning coalition in every general election it contested. ...AND WHY DID THEY JUMP SHIP? The PMK said it had been consistently ignored by its former ally in Tamil Nadu, the state's ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party, which is part of ruling Congress-led coalition at the centre. The party also believes that the DMK will fare badly as an incumbent in the general election. HOW BIG A BLOW IS THE PMK PULLOUT? The PMK has only six parliamentary seats, but Tamil Nadu was a swing state in the 2004 election. The PMK's move to join with a rival state party could strengthen the "Third Front" -- a group of smaller, regional parties presenting an alternative to India's two main national groupings -- if the PMK decides to join it. IS THE PMK LIKELY TO REJOIN THE UPA AFTER POLLS? Analysts see the PMK as largely opportunistic in its choice of allies. It could wait to see which way the wind blows, especially if Congress and/or the DMK do badly in the election and the Third Front does well. DOES THE BJP GAIN? The BJP is not strong in Tamil Nadu and the PMK would gain little from allying with India's main opposition party. But it was once part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and if the bloc regains power, a return to the NDA cannot be ruled out. IS CONGRESS IN TROUBLE NOW? Possibly. A Reuters poll of analysts still tips Congress in favour of others despite squabbles with its regional allies. The "Fourth Front" could damage Congress' bargaining power in coalition-building after the polls, even though its leaders have pledged support to Prime Minister Manmohan S
