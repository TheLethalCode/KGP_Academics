<TITLE> Obama enters history text books </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, March 26 (bdnews24.com)In a moment of 'living history', the 2008 presidential election brought an African American into the White House for the first time in the country's 233 years, and just four months on, the US Education Department has decided to capture the moment in the history text book for high schoolers. The newest edition of "United States History", a text for high school kids will be launched this fall containing a picture of Barack Obama at his election night rally in Chicago next to the red-lettered headline "An historic moment". The newest editions of middle- and high-school history and government textbooks by McGraw-Hill, also scheduled for a fall release, include an eight-page supplement with a picture of President Obama on the cover and the words "A New President." And information on the impact of Obama's campaign is strewn throughout two college-level government textbooks by CQ Press, which are already in use on campuses nationwide. "History  there's no end to it," said Randy Roberts, a history professor at Purdue University, who is also an author of the history text book. "It's a work in progress." Textbooks are updated regularly, but publishers say they went to extra lengths to capture the 2008 election by delaying publication and using the Internet. The election of Obama gave them even more to write about. "We want our students to sense how important, how historic, how momentous it is," Prof Roberts said. Of course, history in its first form is still a bare-bones account. As Roberts put it, he was able to write about what happened but could not yet address the effects of Obama's election. But in some ways, the campaign and election have provided a window into the evolution of how textbooks cover history. With news available instantly on the Internet, textbooks must keep up with the times. The day after the inauguration, McGraw-Hill put up a web site about the Obama administration and the issues it faces. The site, updated regularly, is written like a textbook and includes questions and exercises. For its history textbooks for kindergarten through fifth grade, McGraw-Hill did not print a new edition but supplemented the books with a Web site. "This is how students learn," said Steve Waldron, editorial director for McGraw-Hill. "I think the major issue is we want the books to be as up to date and as relevant to students as possible.
