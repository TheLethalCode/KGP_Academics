<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangabandhu National Stadium is likely to see the highest turnout in six years when arch-rivals Dhaka Abahani and Mohammedan SC lock horns in the Citycell Super Cup final on Friday. The much-talked about Super Cup has already created a buzz across the country with the winners being awarded a record Tk one crore and football-lovers scrambling for tickets to the final showdown. President Zillur Rahman is expected to attend the match while sports minister Ahad Ali Sarker, BFF president Kazi Salahuddin, Citycell CEO Michael Seymour, co-sponsor Nitol Tata chairman Matlub Ahmed will also be present. "Some 10,000 tickets have already been sold today (Thursday) till 3:30pm and we are trying to increase seats at the stadium," said tournament committee chairman Harun-ur Rashid before the preparation briefing of Abahani and Mohammedan at BFF House on Thursday. "We hope that we will be able to see the past glory of our country's football return through the Super Cup final," said the BFF member. Nearly 40,000 fans turned up at the big bowl to see the SAFF Championship between hosts Bangladesh and the Maldives in January 2003 where Bangladesh clinched their maiden SAFF Championship title beating the opponents 5-3 in the shootout following a 1-1 draw in regulation time. But this is the first time that advance tickets to a football match have been sold in the country. "I can't remember whether advance tickets to watch the football matches were sold and it may be the first time that the tickets are being sold in advance," said BFF vice-president Sawkat Ali Khan Jahangir. He also expects a good crowd would turn up for the final on Friday. Some 400 seats have been reserved for women spectators while the eastern galleries will remain open for school-going students, who will be able to enter the stadium wearing uniform or showing identity cards. A pick-up van will be given away to a winning spectator through a lottery while the best player and the best goalkeeper will also be awarded a car and Tk one lakh respectively. bd
