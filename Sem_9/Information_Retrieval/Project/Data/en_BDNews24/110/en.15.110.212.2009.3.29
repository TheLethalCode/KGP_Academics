 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury Sunday urged the non-governmental organisations to help dredge rivers to enhance their navigability. "ActionAid is working with communities living on the chars. We'll have to dredge the rivers and raise the homesteads of the charlanders, if we want them to live better," the minister said, inaugurating UK-based NGO's Silver Jubilee celebrations Sunday at the National Museum. She told bdnews24.com, "River dredging will soon begin. The prime minister is seeing to the matter herself." During the last stint of Awami League rule, the Garai river dredging was begun at the Padma-Garai confluence, which should have continued downstream. But, she said, it was abandoned after the BNP-led alliance government took over. "Though we haven't yet decided where exactly the dredging will begin, it may very well be with the Garai," Motia said. ActionAid resident representative Farah Kabir said, "We as an organisation cannot participate in dredging itself, but we may offer assistance in lobbying and such activities." Speaking on militancy, the minister said, "Absence of democratic practices is giving rise to militancy and ignorance. To root these negative trends out, we have to reach the roots of the menaces and mend them." Advising the government on economic reforms, former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal said, "Poverty is not leaving Bangladesh as we have so far failed to attain equity in resource distribution." People's involvement in the democratic practices crucial for success of any democracy, she reiterated. ActionAid CEO Ramesh K Singh said they had proposed to the G-20 and G-8 leaders to declare a 400 billion dollar incentive package for the farmers to face the ongoing recession. The NGO began operations in Bangladesh in1983 to enhance the quality of life of the disadvantaged, especially women, children, disabled, indigenous communities and char inhabitants. The two-day celebrations are being attended by 168 associate organisations. The activities will include seminars, video shows, youth fair, debates and cultural soirees. b
