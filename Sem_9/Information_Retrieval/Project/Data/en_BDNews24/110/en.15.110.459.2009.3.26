 Chittagong, March 26 (bdnews24.com)At least nine holidaymakers were killed and another 30 injured as their bus skidded off the Chittagong-Cox's Bazaar highway and crashed into a roadside ditch on Thursday. bdnews24.com correspondent Ruhul Amin Rana said the bus was returning to Bogra from a holiday outing at Cox's Bazar when it crashed trying to take a turn near Chunati in Lohagara at around 9.30am. At least seven passengers were killed on the spot, said Rana. Police and locals identified the dead as: Anwar Master (70), Shahidul Islam, Halima Khatun, Junab Ali, Matiur Rahman, Quamruzzaman, 'Sani', 'Gulnahar' and the bus helper, whose name could not be known. All the victims were students, teachers or guardians from Fapar High School and Koichar Madrasa in Bogra. Lohagara police chief Humayun Kabir told bdnews24.com earlier, "The number and identity of the deceased could not be known immediately." "Emergency workers were struggling to pull the bus upright. At least 8 to 10 people were stuck inside the bus after the accident as it turned turtle making it difficult for rescuers." The injured were admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital, Lohagara General Hospital and Satkania General Hospital, he said. Ziaul Haque, a local reporter, said a two-kilometre tailback was created on the highway in the morning, holding up traffic headed both ways. "Police were working for several hours to rescue the trapped and ease the traffic gridlock," Chittagong additional police super Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com. The number of casualties rose from seven in the morning to nine after the bus was pulled upright, said police. bdnews
