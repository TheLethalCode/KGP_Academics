 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)The European Union Election Observation Mission in its final full report has endorsed the Dec. 29 polls. Presenting the report Wednesday, the visiting mission head Alexander Graf Lambsdorf said the general election met international standards. "Simply speaking, this election was not rigged," the Euro MP told reporters at a press conference in the city. Lambsdorf said registration of political parties, disclosure of wealth statement of candidates and the photo-attached voters roll made the Dec. 29 polls different from previous elections. He praised the role of the Election Commission. "The Election Commission discharged its duties neutrally," he said. He also suggested that parliament and the political parties should guarantee the Commission's independence. The EU mission presented a preliminary report on Jan 31. The full report took in the pre- and post-election situations, said the mission chief. The EU fielded 150 polls observers who worked across the country from Nov 7 to Jan 16. "Minor difficulties aside, the EU EOM concluded that professionalism, transparency and credibility were the hallmarks of the election and the election broadly met international standards," said Lambsdorf. "The outcome of the election appears to reflect the will of the people of Bangladesh and EU EOM observers did not report patterns of fraud in the process," he said. However, the report said the postal voting did not work. Advanced voting for the police personnel can be introduced, for example 10 days before, it said. Landorff also recommended that the EC should make a provision so that a candidate could not contest more than one seat. Candidates can now run for election in as many as three separate constituencies. "We recommend to limit it to one to create a level playing field for everyone and avoid costly by-elections," he said.
