 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government will finalise by June the allocation of plots at Uttara Model Town (third phase) and Purbachal New Town projects, the state minister for housing said Friday. "Transparency will be ensured so that those who won the draw get the plots," Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters as he visited the site of the construction of Bijoy Sarani-Tongi link road's flyover in the capital. He urged all to cooperate with to city development authority RAJUK to complete the allocation in time. Khan said after speaking to residents of the area and experts the flyover's length was stretched to 473 metres from 411 metres. And the length of its ramp was shortened to 80 metres from 143 metres. The changes mean no underpass will be needed to get to the flyover. The army-installed caretaker government had taken up the initiative to construct the Bijoy Sarani-Tongi link road. A multi-storey Rangs building was demolished to make rooms for the road. bdnews24
