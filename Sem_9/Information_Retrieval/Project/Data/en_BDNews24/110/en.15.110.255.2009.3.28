<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 28 (bdnews24.com)The government is planning to introduce a new allocation in the next budget for private-public partnership (PPP) schemes, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said Saturday. The initiative aims to take PPP beyond infrastructure development, he said. The minister was speaking at the start of a two-day conference, titled 'Development with Equity and Justice: Immediate Tasks for the Newly Elected Government' and organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue. The talks aim to identify, with inputs from key civil society stakeholders, a set of actionable agendas to overcome the challenges facing the country's economy today, says CPD. Muhith stressed the potential of public -private investment in avenues like education, health and human resources development in overcoming those challenges. He said PPP had to be introduced in the budget and expanded as fast as possible. "The new budgetary provision would also allow more investments from foreign and local entities." He spoke too of the need of increased public investment saying that the country's public expenditure is the lowest in the region. The minister also said he would be seeking more aid and budgetary supports form donor agencies. On the much publicised demands for cash incentive by businesses facing global recession fallout, Muhith said it would be unrealistic to expect the government to just dole out money. "I prefer expanding subsidies rather than cash incentives." Muhith, however, backed the idea of creating a government and private sector contributed fund where businesses could get soft loans to overcome the present difficulties. The inaugural session of the conference, at the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre, also heard from CPD chairman Rehman Sobhan, the prime minister's economic affairs adviser Mashiur Rahman, BNP lawmaker MK Anwar and former finance minister M Syeduzzaman. The talks aim to cover issues of microeconomic management in the wake of global crisis, energy and food security, ICT for development and employment generation.
