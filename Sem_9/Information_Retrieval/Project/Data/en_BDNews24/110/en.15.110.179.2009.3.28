 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com)Is President Obama taking a new approach to dealing with the mainstream media? The question is being bandied about ever since his second news conference at the White House earlier this week, where he pointedly ignored the major newspapers. As in his first press conference on Feb 9, President Obama took just 13 questions on Tuesday. But, in a marked departure from the established tradition of White House press conferences, he did not take questions from any of the nation's top newspapers, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times and the USA Today. In exchange, Obama opened things up to a wider variety of outlets, including Spanish-language television, a military news outlet, and black-oriented media. It's another example of the White House going over the typical Washington press corps 'filter'. Here's the list of reporters who got the opportunity to ask questions, selected by Obama from names provided by his press secretary Robert Gibbs. They were: Jennifer Loven (AP), Chuck Todd (NBC), Jake Tapper (ABC), Chip Reid (CBS), Lourdes Meluza (Univision), Kevin Baron (Stars and Stripes), Ed Henry (CNN), Major Garrett (Fox News), Mike Allen (POLITICO), Kevin Chappell (Ebony), Ann Compton (ABC Radio), Jon Ward (Washington Times) and Stephen Collinson (AFP). This, not surprisingly, has the Washington press corps buzzing and pundits are busy trying to analye the reasons behind this departure. So the only newspapers that got a question were the Washington Times, Stars and Stripes, and POLITICO  although the latter is known by many, especially outside DC, as primarily a website. Similar to the first time around, Obama provided lengthy answers and took follow-ups, which is why just thirteen reporters got a chance in about an hour at the podium
