 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni says she does not see 'militancy' as a threat to Bangladesh's external image. Hours before her departure for Malaysia on Wednesday, the foreign minister told journalists: "Right at this moment, I don't consider militancy, if the situation does not deteriorate further, as a challenge for the country's image." "Many countries in the world have been facing the menace of terrorism and militancy. This is not a problem only in Bangladesh or any particular country," Dipu Moni told reporters at her first press conference since her appointment as foreign minister on Jan 6 "Like many countries, business activities, investments and their foreign relations go uninterrupted despite terrorist and militant attacks. These are also going in our country," she said. With the foreign minister preparing to leave for Kuala Lumpur later in the day, she also revealed that a "politically sensitive" statement made by the Bangladesh labour counsellor in Kuala Lumpur might have caused the cancellation of 55,000 Malaysian visas for Bangladeshi workers. She, however, said the demand for Bangladeshi workers in Southeast Asian nations was still high despite global recession. Dipu Moni is set to attend the general assembly of the ruling party of Malaysia as representative of the prime minister. Labour and overseas employment minister Mosharraf Hossain will join her, flying from Geneva.
