 Dhaka, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com) - Forty-five new women MPs, elected to reserved seats, will be sworn in on Mar 29, deputy speaker Shawkat Ali said on Wednesday. Speaker Abdul Hamid will administer oaths to 36 new Awami League MPs, five of BNP and four of Jatiya Party, said Shawkat. The candidates were elected unopposed on Mar 19, as parties nominated exactly 45 candidates to the reserved women's seats, allotted on strength. The Election Commission published their names on Tuesday. A copy of the gazette has been sent to the parliament secretariat, said election official Farhad Ahmed Khan. The Election Commission held the presidential election, followed by elections to the women's reserved seats, on schedule following the Dec. 29 general elections last year. bdnews
