<TEXT>
 Bhola, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)RAB made another sweep for weapons Wednesday at the Green Crescent Orphanage and Madrasa and retrieved two bottles of acid, after the elite force seized a massive cache of arms and ammunition the previous day. They combed the pond but found no further weapons. The acid bottles were found in the room of 'Russell', a trainer who was arrested Tuesday. They searched the entire compound with metal detector for anything beneath the earth. Major Mamun Ur Rashid Mamun who led the operations said they would hand in the arrestees, weapons and ammunition to police by the end of the day, as the raid came to an end at around 6pm. The RAB-8 search team had detained four suspected militants the day before, including two employees of Green Crescent Madrasa and Orphanage at Ram Keshobpur in Sachra union, Borhanuddin, some 20 kilometres from Bhola district headquarters. Mamun said London-based NGO Green Crescent constructed the madrasa-cum-orphanage on the 12 acre site four years ago. These started operations three months ago. A man known as 'Faisal' who lives in London but is now in Bangladesh, funds the institutions and oversees the operations, said Mamun. The RAB officer said they were trying to locate and arrest him. The recovery included two pistols, two revolvers, four shotguns, eight magazines, two binoculars, two remote-control devices, 700 pistol and 200 shotgun bullets, 3000 splinters, six life jackets, 20 masks, two walkie-talkies and as many mobile phones. A number of Jihadi books were also recovered. The detainees include madrasa trainer 'Russel', 30, caretaker 'Hamid', 30, Abul Kalam, 32, and 'Jasim', 35. All of them have been sent to Barisal RAB camp for interrogation, Major Mamun added. He said the suspected militants were preparing for a major operation. bdnews24.
