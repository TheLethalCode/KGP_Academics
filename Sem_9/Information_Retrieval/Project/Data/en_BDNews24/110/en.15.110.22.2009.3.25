 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has uncovered 'irregularities' amounting to Tk 1132 core in the accounts of the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh over the last eight years. The parliamentary standing committee on public undertaking gave the CAAB 10 days on Wednesday to submit replies to the allegations of financial irregularities, which came to light after examining audit objections since 2001, said committee members. Civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader issued strong warnings to the CAAB officials, said committee chairman Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir MP. "This is a horrible situation. They sucked up Tk 1132 core without implementing any development projects," Alamgir told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "Where did the money go?" he asked. Khan said, "The authority could not give us any reply against the allegations." "The committee members including the civil aviation minister were seriously angry at these irregularities". Alamgir said owing to paucity of time, it could not discuss the audit reports thoroughly at the meeting. "We will discuss these at our next meeting after the submission of their replies within the next 10 days," he said. Committee member Moin Uddin Khan Badal MP told journalists, "The minister said the wrongdoers would not be spared". Another committee member and chief whip of the opposition, Zainul Abdin Farroque MP, whose party BNP ruled from 2001-2006, told reporters there were corrupt practices during the subsequent two-year caretaker regime. "During the immediate past caretaker government, the Civil Aviation Authority appointed 77 employees against the posts of 25 persons. "This is a massive irregularity," Farroque told reporters. The CAAB officials told the meeting that around 800 audit objections were made by the audit department in the last eight years. Committee members Fazle Rabbi Chowdhury MP, Dhirendra Chandra Devnath MP, Biren Shikder MP, SK Abu Baker MP and Bazlul Haq Harun MP attended the meeting.
