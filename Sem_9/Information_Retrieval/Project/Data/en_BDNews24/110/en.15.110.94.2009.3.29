<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary standing committee will also recommend making the MPs advisers to all city corporations, its head says. Rahmat Ali, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the local government ministry, however, did not make it clear whether recommendations of the MPs would be made mandatory for city corporations to conform to. "Like the Upazila councils, MPs will be made adviser to the city corporations so that those MPs having no Upazila councils in their constituencies do not face discriminations," Ali told reporters at his office. His committee at its Sunday's meeting made the MPs ex-officio advisers to the 482 Upazila councils which must accept their recommendations. The committee would meet on the draft bill on city corporations to make the recommendations, he said.
