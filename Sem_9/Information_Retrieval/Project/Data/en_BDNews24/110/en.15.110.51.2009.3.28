 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com)  The last British Airways flight to London took off from Dhaka Saturday morning, ending more than a quarter century of operations. "The last BA flight departed at 5.44am, about 20 minutes behind schedule," director of Zia International Airport, wing commander Syedul Hasan Khan, told bdnews24.com. The 'world's favourite airline' has run commercial passenger flights between the two capitals since the early 1980s. Its non- stop Boeing 777 service between Dhaka and London began in October 2001, with three direct flights a week. BA announced the suspension of a number of flights in November 2008a bad year for the airline industryamong them Dhaka and Kolkata. The last Kolkata-London flight takes off Sunday. There was no formal announcement on the last day of operations in Dhaka, though local BA staff bade an emotional farewell to the final flight carrying around 240 passengers. Some 43 employees of the Dhaka office will lose their jobs, said airline officials. "The decision to suspend flights between Dhaka and London has been a difficult one to make," said Amanda Amos, British Airways' area commercial manager for South Asia, last year. "However, the route is not making a profitable contribution to our business and we are unable to sustain it," Amos said in a statement to bdnews24.com. BA's cargo flights will continue out of Dhaka, using connecting flights via the Middle East, the airline said. Customers booked to travel with British Airways from Dhaka after March 28, 2009, will be contacted by the airline so that alternative arrangements can be made, BA said in a statement. bd
