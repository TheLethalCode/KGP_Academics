 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, March 29 (bdnews24.com)The parliament secretariat cannot say who is in charge of maintaining the keys of the House, officials said after a security meeting on Sunday. The high-level security committee on parliament's security, headed by deputy speaker Shawkat Ali, formed a body to look into ways of keeping the keys secure. "We simply do not know who used to keep the keys of the parliament building," Shawkat told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "We formed a six-member sub-committee to recommend how we can develop a system to maintain the keys," he said. The deputy speaker said an additional secretary to the parliament secretariat (internal parliamentary affairs) was made head of the sub-committee. He said Sunday's meeting also decided to raise the height of fence around the 217-acre Jatiya Sangsad complex by another five feet. The boundary wall will be made eight feet high from the present three. Shawkat also said the number of entrances to the complex would be reduced to two. "Besides, we will keep a point open at the northern side of the building to facilitate the movement of MPs coming from the NAM flats in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar," said the deputy speaker. He said police would barricade all other unauthorised entrances to the parliament premises. The House formed the 11-strong high-powered committeeheaded by the deputy speaker and having representatives from all law enforcing agenciesto review parliament's security system earlier this month in the wake of the Feb. 25-26 BDR mutiny.
