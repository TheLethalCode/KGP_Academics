 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)A list of border guards yet to report back for duty is being prepared for police stations across the country, the BDR chief said on Wednesday. Brig Gen Moinul Islam also told a press conference at BDR's Peelkhana HQ that there were no arrested BDR men being held at the compound. "The government has no plans to turn Peelkhana into a sub jail." "BDR members and families have been asked to remove their possessions as the situation here is still dangerous," said Gen Moinul, adding that arms and ammunition were still being recovered from the premises. Replying to a query, he said that they still had no actual figures of missing arms and ammo. On another jawan's death death, reported in Sylhet Wednesday, he said, "It is assumed that he committed suicide." "This BDR soldier was at Peelkhana on Feb 25. He reported back to Sylhet instead of Peelkhana," said Islam. The BDR chief said the families of all dead BDR soldiers would be provided with facilities according to rules and regulations. "If investigation proves a BDR member died in trying to prevent the mutiny then authorities will be informed to pay them due respect," he added. The BDR chief said the border areas were being manned as usual. Flag meetings were being held regularly with the BSF, said Islam, adding that the Indian border guards had "acted very responsibly" during last month's BDR mutiny and subsequent chaos. BDR operations and trainings director Col Jahangir Kabir Talukder and public relations officer Nurul Huda were also present at the press conference.
