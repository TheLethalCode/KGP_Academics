 Dhaka, March 24 (bdnews24.com)The government is pressing ahead to set up a deep seaport in the Bay, with a feasibility study already in progress, said shipping minister Afsarul Amin on Tuesday. "The government will not back out on plans for a deep seaport, as it was very much on the grand alliance's election manifesto," the minister told reporters at his secretariat office. The feasibility study is progressing, the minister said, adding, "The shipping ministry will sit on April 12 with the primary report." The minister and acting shipping secretary Masud Elahi earlier met with an Indian delegation headed by additional transport secretary Vijay Chhibber. "We discussed the water transit protocol between the two countries which will be signed today (Tuesday) at Hotel Sonargaon," said the minister. "The renewal of the prevailing water transit agreement was discussed. The conditions will remain unchanged. "The agreement has been in force for many years, but it has to be updated and modernised if Bangladesh is to reap further benefits from the arrangement," said the minister. On labour unrest at Chittagong port, Amin said, "Though some workers organisations may launch movements to realise their demands, the port will remain operative." "The government has empathy with the workers and will resolve their problems through discussions," he added. bdnew
