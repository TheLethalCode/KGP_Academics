 BUENOS AIRES, March 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Cup winner Jorge Burruchaga quit as coach first division Banfield on Sunday, the second Argentine coach to resign in less than 48 hours. Burruchaga, who scored the winning goal when Argentina beat West Germany 3-2 in the 1986 World Cup final, followed Miguel Santoro, who left Independiente on Friday night. Both coaches resigned despite wins for their respective sides. Banfield beat Arsenal 2-0 on Friday and Independiente thrashed Newell's Old Boys 4-1 the same evening. Banfield president Carlos Portell said in a radio interview that he had been taken by surprise by Burruchaga's decision, announced at a meeting on Sunday. "We told him he was making a mistake but he said he had already made up his mind," Portell said. Burruchanga, 46, who has previously coached local sides Arsenal and Independiente, had been in charge since June. He becomes the sixth coach to lose his job since the mid-season break ended in February. The others were Gustavo Alfaro at Rosario Central, Juan Manuel Llop at Racing Club, Leonardo Astrada at Estudiantes and Omar Labruna at Gimnasia-Jujuy
