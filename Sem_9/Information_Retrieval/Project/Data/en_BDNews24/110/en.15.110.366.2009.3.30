<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)A number of 'big guns' will be interrogated over the BDR killings, if occasioned for, police superintendent Nesarul Arif of the CID, in charge of the case, said Monday. "A lot many people may be required to be questioned in the interest of the case, a lot of big guns we may need to quiz as the case unfolds," Nesar told reporters after grilling Jama'at-e-Islami leader Abdur Razzak at the CID headquarters Monday. He skirted a direct answer when asked if any political leader would be grilled. On quizzing Razzak, Nesar said, "We have got considerable information from the lawer, which all are being verified and scrutinised now." He, however, refused to elaborate any further on this. "I can tell you nothing more now." The BDR case investigation officer Abdul Qahhar Akhand interrogated Razzak at the headquarters. Akhand, after he was done with the interrogation, told reporters, "I needed to call him and ask things related to the case. He wasn't summoned here as a political figure." Razzak, on the other hand, told reporters that the CID had summoned him only to harass him politically. Qahhar, replying to another query, said, "Yes, we took his cell phone number." Razzak was quizzed as per the court's orders, Qahhar pointed out. "He was called in connection with the case and will be summoned again, if necessary." The case investigation will take more time, he added. bdne
