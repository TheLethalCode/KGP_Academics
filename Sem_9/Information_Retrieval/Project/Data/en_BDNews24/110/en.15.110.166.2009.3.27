<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 27 (bdnews24.com)  A first-half strike from John Goodwin was enough for Mohammedan Sporting Club to see rivals Abahani Limited off and clinch the Citycell Super Cup in the final at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Friday. Nigerian striker Goodwin's 21-minute goal was enough for the Black and Whites to earn the Tk 1 crore prize money along with the inaugural trophy in front of the nearly 45,000-capacity stadium, a scene that reminded fans of the game's heydays in the '80s and '90s. The crowd had started to enter the big bowl at about 2:00pm before the place-deciding match between Brothers Union and Chittagong Mohammedan at 3:00pm and big bowl turned full before the 5:00pm kick-off. The final as expected had an electric start with both sides attacking and the fans inspired their favourite sides beating drums. Abahani felt the absence of suspended midfielders Arif Khan Joy and Prantosh Kumar on the pitch, and were forced to retreat to a five-man defence. That allowed Mohammedan plenty of space to go on the attack and the Motijheel-based outfit took a deserved lead in the 21st minute. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen found no place for playmaker Abul Hossain in the starting line-up, preferring Nigerian attacking midfielder and tournament's top scorer Emeka Christian to play just in front of the backline. Comparatively, Mohammedan's strong midfield comprising Arman Aziz, Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmud, Enamul Haq Sharif and Nasir Hossain controlled the game until they opened their account. However, Abahani had the first shot on target in the sixth minute when Ghanaian striker Awudu Ibrahim darted into the Mohammedan box to drive a low shot to the near post, but the goalkeeper had no problem. It took 15 minutes for Mohammedan to make an attempt when defender Rajani Kanta Barman headed a Hazem corner narrowly wide of the near post with Abahani goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya beaten. Abahani came close to opening the score in the 20th minute, but Mamunul Islam frustrated the Sky Blues, driving an Ibrahim back-header wide of the near post. In the 21st minute, Mohammedan got the second and last chance to execute their opportunity superbly as Hazem sent the ball to Alamu Bukola Olaleken, the Nigerian striker, then cut the ball back to his compatriot Goodwin, who just fired the ball with his first attempt inside the box to silence the Abahani fans. After going down, it was another blow for Abahani, who lost in-form striker Jahid Hasan Emily on the half-hour mark due to a cramp and Abul Hossain was sent to replace him and then they started to get some momentum going. Abul should have levelled in the 39th minute when Ibrahim outfoxed two Mohammedan defenders to send a fine ball from the touchline for a free header, but Abul headed it over from close range. After the interval, Abahani went all-out and Ibrahim, who looked the liveliest player on the pitch and despite having no help from his partner, began to cause some problems. The early pressure almost yielded a chance nine minutes into the second half when Abul pushed a nice ball to Emeka, who darted into the box only to smash wide despite finding the open net. Two minutes later, Abul being set free by Jahed drove a low shot to near post, but it was again tournament's award-winning best goalkeeper Aminul, who dived to his left to make a brilliant save for a corner. Abahani stepped up their attacks with striker Shahazuddin Tipu replacing Emeka. Jahed played a fine one-two with Ibrahim to advance into the box, but saw his flick to the near post blocked by Paul Enamual Dami with goalkeeper Aminul standing at the far post. With 25 minutes to go, Abahani pressed hard tearing Mohammedan defence but could not get the equaliser. Defender Sujan headed a Wali Faisal free kick to be saved by goalkeeper Aminul. Abahani had the last chance in the 79th minute when Ibrahim chipped a cross for Abul, who headed confidently, but Dami made a goalline save to frustrate the B. League champions. b
