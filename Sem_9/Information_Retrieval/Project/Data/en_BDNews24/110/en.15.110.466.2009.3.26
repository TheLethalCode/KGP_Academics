 Faridpur, March 26 (bdnews24.com)A truck carrying over a hundred schoolchildren to an Independence Day rally near the district town, killing at least two and injuring 90 on Thursday. "Over a hundred students of Faridpur Muslim Mission School were being transported in the truck to Faridpur stadium," Kotwali police chief Md Wares Ali Miah told bdnews24.com. The dead children were identified as Sohel Rana, 14, from Hat Govindapur in Faridpur, and Ramzan, 14, from Sreepur in Magura, he said. Asked why the children were being transported in a truck, school official MA Samad told bdnews24.com, "We have always used trucks for carrying students on such holidays and outings." Asked the same question, Dhaka Education Board chairman Shamsul Haque told bdnews24.com, "It is very deplorable. Transporting students by truck speaks of totally reckless attitude of the caretakers." "The Board will take necessary measures after reviewing the reports forwarded by the school and local administration." The truck lost control around Komarpur, hitting a roadside tree and overturning at around 7.30am. Of the injured children, 61 were admitted to Faridpur Medical College Hospital, nine critical cases being transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital in the afternoon. Another 30, including five girls, were admitted to Faridpur General Hospital for treatment. bdnews24.co
