 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com) - The country is reeling under an acute power crisis, which is hampering Boro irrigation, although the authorities say they are diverting power from urban to rural areas to help farmers. Farmers say irrigation is stalling as pumps stop working due to zigzagging voltage, while city dwellers are suffering numerous power cuts throughout the day. On Tuesday, the Power Development Board estimated production at 3680mw against a demand for 4725mw, giving a shortfall of 1045mw. PDB authorities said gas shortages caused a shortfall in power production of up to 665mw. However, gas supply will be increased by 70mcf at gas-fired power plants by the current week, they said. Farmers complain The prime minister's adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury told bdnews24.com farmers were receiving undisrupted power supply for irrigation. "However, there are some disruptions in places due to limitations of sub-stations," he said. bdnews24.com Rangpur correspondent says farmers are not receiving sufficient power although they have been promised uninterrupted supply from 11am to 7pm. There are frequent power cuts in the town as well, up to four to five hours 'load shedding' a day. Rural Electrification Board general manager Tofazzal Hossain said power supply to Rangpur and Bogra districts are controlled from the capital and power cuts occur without any prior notice. bdnews24.com Netrokona correspondent says farmers' irrigation pumps stop working due to irregular voltage. At least 300 water pumps in the area went out of order in the last 15 days due to fluctuating current, said additional director of Department of Agricultural Extension Abdur Rouf. City dwellers swelter Dhaka Electric Supply Company, which supplies power to the capital's Uttara, Gulshan, Baridhara, Banani, Badda, Mirpur and Tongi areas, has a demand of around 450mw. With availability of just 290mw, the agency is forced to manage a 160mw shortfall with severe 'load shedding' measures as city dwellers swelter amid rising temperatures and water shortages. Another supplier to the capital, Dhaka Power Distribution Company, gets only half the 900-950mw it needs a day. Other power distribution agencies in the capital and elsewhere are facing similar crises. The power crunch in turn is causing acute water shortages in Dhaka, adding to the sufferings of its millions of residents. Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority has blamed the power shortages for disruptions in water supply, as electric pumps are unable to draw water from the city's deep tube-wells in sufficient quantities. The government has said it sees no total solution to the crisis this year. bdne
