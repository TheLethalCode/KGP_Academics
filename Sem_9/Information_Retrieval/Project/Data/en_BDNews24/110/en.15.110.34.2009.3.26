The party's national standing committee will make a final decision in the first week of April on the process of reform from the roots, said party leaders who have been sitting in a series of meetings this week. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has been chairing the meetings of the party's top policymaking body to review six divisional reports on party reform measures. The division-level organisational committees submitted the reports to the chairperson based on countrywide interviews with local-level party leaders held from Mar 3 to 24.

The national standing committee began reviewing the reports from Mar 22, starting with Chittagong followed by Dhaka division. b
