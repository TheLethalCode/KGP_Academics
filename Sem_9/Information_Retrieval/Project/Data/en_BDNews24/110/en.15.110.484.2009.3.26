 WASHINGTON,Mar 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama said on Wednesday his review of Afghanistan policy would call for better coordination between NATO members, who have been criticized for having competing goals. Analysts say integration between the 40 NATO allies and other nations with troops in Afghanistan is poor, while the overall command-and-control structure is unwieldy, challenging efforts to develop a coherent counter-insurgency strategy. "We are confident that we can create a process whereby NATO, which is already strong, becomes stronger, where we become more effective in coordinating our efforts in Afghanistan," Obama told reporters. Obama spoke after talks with NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer on next month's NATO summit marking the 60th anniversary of the transatlantic organization. Scheffer said NATO was awaiting the Obama administration's review of US policy in Afghanistan, where NATO-led troops are struggling against a resurgent Taliban insurgency. "In Afghanistan there are still major challenges. Many things are going right, but many things are still not going right," Scheffer said. The United Nations on Wednesday named US diplomat and academic Peter Galbraith as a UN deputy envoy to Afghanistan. Galbraith will handle electoral and other political issues. Obama has called for a new, multi-pronged strategy for Afghanistan to prevent the country from becoming a springboard for al Qaeda attacks on the United States. A US official said on Tuesday that Obama was expected to announce the results of his Afghanistan review on Friday. Other officials have said the president has not yet made a decision. "When the president is ready to make an announcement, obviously that is likely to happen before we go overseas. I would look for that in the next few days," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a news conference. While some details of the proposed strategy, which is to be presented at the NATO summit on April 3-4, have leaked out, Obama has been tight-lipped about what it will say and described it on Tuesday as a work in progress. VIOLENCE AT RECORD LEVEL In his remarks after meeting Scheffer, however, Obama referred several times to the need for better coordination among the allies in NATO's International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, known as ISAF. "We believe we are going to be able to ensure that the NATO members who have made so many sacrifices and have worked so hard already are reinvigorated," Obama said, adding that better coordination was key to the success of the mission. A group of US analysts who visited Afghanistan wrote in the conservative magazine the Weekly Standard this week that NATO'S command and control structure there is "schizophrenic." "At some point the United States will have to decide what price it is willing to pay for keeping all of the ISAF contributors happy, most of whom send contingents so small or so heavily limited by caveats that they contribute little or nothing to the success of the mission," wrote analysts Max Boot, Frederick Kagan and Kimberly Kagan. They noted that some foreign contingents were willing to fight, but others were not, and that while US troops stayed in Afghanistan for at least one year, many other NATO soldiers were on four- to six-month rotations. More than seven years after ..-led troops toppled the Taliban for harboring the al Qaeda leaders behind the September 11, 2001, attacks, Obama has acknowledged the United States is not winning the war in Afghanistan. Violence is at its highest level since the 2001 invasion, and the United Nations warned earlier this month that it was likely to worsen this year. Seeking to arrest the deteriorating security situation, Obama has ordered 17,000 additional US troops to Afghanistan. They will join 38,000 American troops and 30,000 more from NATO allies and other nat
