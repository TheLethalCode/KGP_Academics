 NEW DELHI, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (Items are from own sources unless stated.) India's ruling Congress party has sealed a deal with a key ally in the government coalition, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), over how many seats each will contest in Maharashtra. Relations between the two parties have been prickly as the NCP negotiated with opposition parties to undercut Congress and boost its leader's prime ministerial ambitions. Congress will stand for 26 seats in the state and the NCP for 22. The allies are weighing up their options for a similar deal outside the state. (The Hindu) India's main opposition party said it would field Varun Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's first prime minister, as a candidate, defying an Election Commission directive. India's Election Commission on Sunday found Gandhi guilty of delivering an anti-Muslim speech in a recent election rally, described by the country's media as a "hate speech." The Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was asked to drop Gandhi as their candidate, but the party has refused. Sonia Gandhi, the head of the Congress party, held a major campaign rally in front of 100,000 people in the BJP-run Karnataka state. She projected her party as one of stability and development in contrast to the Hindu-nationalist BJP. The state has seen clashes between Hindus and Christians in the past year. (The Asian Age). Congress has temporarily pulled its election song "Jai Ho" ("Let there be victory"), bought from the Oscar movie hit "Slumdog Millionaire", after the party received negative feedback for three short films based on the song. There are fears "Jai Ho" may leave Congress open to attacks from the BJP, which says the song will remind voters' that huge slums exist in India because of failed policies. Congress is nervous the song could lead to a repeat of the BJP's failed "India Shining" campaign during the last election, which failed to resonate with poor voters left behind by India's economic boom.
