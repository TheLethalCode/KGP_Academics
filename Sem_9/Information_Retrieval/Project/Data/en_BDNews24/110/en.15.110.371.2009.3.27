 Dhaka, Mar 27 (bdnews24.com)  The fate of Faisal Mostafa, who allegedly channelled funds through a British charity to finance terror activities from a Bangladeshi madrasa, remains a mystery two days after his arrest in Dhaka was widely reported by the media. The elite anticrime force, Rapid Action Battalion, has yet to announce any arrest while Faisal's family members in the UK and Bangladesh are unclear about his whereabouts. He was reported to be in the country, however, when RAB unearthed a massive cache of firearms, ammunition and bomb-making equipment at the heavily secured madrasa compound in Bhola. The British-based Faisal has not been named an accused in either of the two cases that have been filed against four Bangladeshi employees of the madrasa, despite the fact that his UK-based charity Green Crescent funds the Bhola madrasa-cum-orphanage. Asked why, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed, told reporters Friday "We'll take necessary steps against all when the occasion warrants it, irrespective of citizenship or guise." RAB additional director general Col Reza Noor Rahman Khan told bdnews24.com Friday, "We are looking for Faisal but have yet to arrest him." "Arrest of a 'militant leader' would amount to a success for us. Why should we cover up the news?" Reza said when pressed about the reports in Bangladesh and the UK. Faisal's father Golam Mostafa, who lives in the UK, told the BBC on Friday he heard from people that his son along with an aide was arrested in Dhaka. "I'm not sure from where he was arrested or who arrested him, but I'm sure he was arrested," said Golam. Faisal's father-in-law, Shahidul Haq Naqib Chowdhury, who lives in Dhaka, told bdnews24.com he had no confirmation on whether Faisal had been taken away by authorities, or of his whereabouts. "One of Faisal's uncles told me that RAB had arrested him as he was going to Gazipur from Dhaka." But Shahidul said another relative told him he had been arrested him from Kalabagan in the city. Media reports gave similar conflicting accounts. One newspaper said Faisal was "understood to have been arrested at Dhaka airport." Almost none gave any official quote. The Times was one exception, quoting a junior RAB officer, Captain Shafiul Alam, as saying Faisal was detained along with a Bangladeshi "agent". The report did not say where. The British newspaper also said The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was still to confirm the arrest. Bhola men being grilled RAB did arrest four local employees, including a teacher, of the heavily secured Green Crescent Madrasa and Orphanage, during the arms haul on Mar 24. The four were remanded into Bhola police custody on Thursday for ten days of interrogation. The RAB raid unearthed firearms, 3000 bomb 'splinters', over a thousand rounds of ammunition and remote-control devices among other equipment. A number of books on Jihad were also recovered. There were 11 children, aged between 5 and 6 years, present during the raid, said officials. Major Mamun Ur Rashid, who led the operations, said suspected militants, including the four arrestees, were preparing for a "major operation". He also said Green Crescent began constructing the madrasa and orphanage on the 12 acre site four years ago. The charity's website, greencrescent.org, shows that it is involved with several other projects in Bangladesh and at least one in Pakistan. The UK's regulatory Charity Commission has said it will investigate the alleged links between Green Crescent and the Bhola arms haul. 'Trustee' twice charged with terrorism Faisal, from Stockport, Greater Manchester, is reportedly a trustee of Green Crescent in the UK. The 45 year-old, with a PhD in chemistry, has twice faced terrorism charges in the UK, according to British media. He was cleared both times of conspiring to cause explosions, in 1996 and 2002, but was sentenced to four years for illegal possession of a firearm in 1996. Father-in-law Shahidul told bdnews24.com he sold Faisal the land in Bhola to set up the madrasa. "I attempted to give the land to my daughter free of cost, but they bought it promising to set up an orphanage," said Shahidul. He said he saw Faisal just once since he came to Bangladesh 10-12 days ago. Shahidul said he had very little communication with his son-in-law. Faisal's wife Sabina Mostofa, along with a daughter and two sons, lives in England. bdnews2
