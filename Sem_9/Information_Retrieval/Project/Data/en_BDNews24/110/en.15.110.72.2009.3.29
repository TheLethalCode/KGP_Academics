 NAIROBI, Sun Mar 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Human rights activists in Kenya have gone into hiding after receiving death threats in the wake of a scathing United Nations report on extrajudicial police executions, a rights group said Saturday. Rights lawyer Ann Njogu told Reuters more than 30 people had gone into hiding. The government-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said earlier this week that some activists had fled the country. "They have had to go undercover for fear of either being rounded up, or being killed," said Njogu, executive director of the Center for Rights, Education and Awareness. "I get calls on my phone telling me to ogopa mungu', which means fear God'." Kenya's coalition government has been criticized for allowing a culture of impunity to grow and diplomats say they are following the welfare of the activists closely. Njogu said the activists had been targeted for cooperating with U.N. investigator Philip Alston, who delivered a damning report in February on arbitrary police killings in the east African nation. Alston backed accusations that security forces have killed 500 suspected members of the outlawed Mungiki crime gang, 400 political demonstrators during a post-election crisis last year, and 200 suspected rebels from the western region of Mount Elgon. President Mwai Kibaki was criticized last week by global watchdog Human Rights Watch for tacitly endorsing extrajudicial violence by keeping silent on the Alston report. CRIME GANG Alston found that police killed people at will, often using the excuse victims were members of the Mungiki sect, notorious for extortion and gruesome murders including beheadings. Police deputy spokesman Charles Owino told Reuters no innocent citizen was being pursued but the Mungiki posed a deadly threat that would not be tolerated. "We are not a tyrant state, we are a democratic country," he said. "We are not going to allow any citizen who is a criminal to intimidate others and hide in the name of human rights." "If you are a criminal and you are killing citizens then we have to pursue you by all means. So if there is anybody who is hiding, then that must be a criminal and not a human rights activist." He said the police wanted to know who was in hiding. The Oscar Foundation, a human rights group, organized a protest against police killings in the wake of Alston's findings. Later that day gunmen shot dead foundation members Oscar Kamau Kingara and Paul Oulu in a Nairobi st
