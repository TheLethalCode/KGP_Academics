 Sydney, Mar 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Remote Pacific island communities turned off the lights on Saturday as they kicked off Earth Hour 2009, a global event to highlight climate change which will see landmarks around the world go dark for an hour. Among the more than 80 countries taking part this year are newcomers like industrial powerhouse China and Asian industrial hub Singapore. In the Vatican, the dome of St Peter's Basilica will go dark, as will Egypt's Great Pyramids, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and New York's Empire State Building. Organisers said the remote Chatham Islands was the first place where supporters turned the lights off for an hour at 8.30 p.m. local time, followed by New Zealand and Fiji. They were soon to be followed by Australia, where the event started two years ago. Lights on Sydney's famous Opera House and Harbour Bridge are to be switched off at 8.30 pm (0930 GMT). Organisers put the number of communities taking part worldwide at 3,931, while 829 landmarks will go dark around the world. "We need massive change -- one hour in terms of change is not that much," Earth Hour executive director Andy Ridley told reporters at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Saturday. "The primary reason we do it is because we want people to think, even if it is for an hour, what they can do to lower their carbon footprint, and ideally take that beyond the hour," he said. Australia first held Earth Hour in 2007 and it went global in 2008, attracting the involvement of 50 million people, organisers say. Environmental group WWF, which started the event, is hoping to get one billion people involved this year. Organisers are calling it a 'global election', with switching off the lights a vote for the Earth and failure to do so a vote for global warming. WWF says it will present the results at a conference on climate change in Copenhagen later this year, where governments will try to seal a successor agreement to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In Australia, the event has attracted support from state and national governments, with large numbers of official buildings expected to go dark. The country's military has also signed up to take part. While it was mostly expected to be good-spirited, in Victoria state, Earth Hour supporters said on Saturday they had occupied a power station as a protest against global warming. Organisers said they did not support such actions and Earth Hour was intended to be purely symbolic.
