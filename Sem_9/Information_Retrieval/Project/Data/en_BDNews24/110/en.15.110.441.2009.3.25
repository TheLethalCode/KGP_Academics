 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com) - A second half strike from Enamul Haq helped Farashganj Sporting Club clinch the Plate title of the Citycell Super Cup after beating Sheikh Russel KC 1-0 in the final on Wednesday. Enamul, who was picked for the national fold Wednesday, struck the all-important goal in the 58th minute at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Both Sheikh Russel and Farashganj toiled hard to control the midfield and it was almost an equal battle in the first half though the winners launched the first attack after 16 minutes. Capitalising on a through pass from Ramzan, Younus drove a low shot wide of the Sheikh Russel near post while Sheikh Russel's Siberian striker Milunovic came close to grabbing the lead twice. Manwar whipped a cross for Milunovic, who volleyed the cross wide in the 20th minute before his tap on an Alfaz cross narrowly missed the target in the 30th minute. Farashganj nearly broke the deadlock when Emeka Lucky Uti headed a Khokon Das corner narrowly wide of the cross bar in the dying minutes of the first half. The Old Dhaka outfit, Farashganj, finally broke the deadlock in the 58th minute when Enamul found the back of Sheikh Russel's net with his third effort after his first two attempts were blocked by goalkeeper Khaled Azam Biplob. Farashganj went close to doubling the margin in the 67th minute, but Idris mis-kicked on a Khokon pass. Sheikh Russel had the last chance to equalise six minutes from time, but Milunovic drove an Alfaz cross wide. bd
