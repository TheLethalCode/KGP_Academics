 Dhaka, Mar 29 (bdnews24.com) - BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said Awami League's rejection of Ziaur Rahman's declaration of independence will not hold water with the people. Criticising the recent comments of AL MP Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Delwar said, "He will have to apologise one day for what he has said." "Awami League's fabrications and falsifications against Ziaur Rahman will not be acceptable," he said. The BNP leader also claimed, "They are trying to make the country dysfunctional." The opposition leader was addressing a rally in front of the BNP's central party office at Naya Paltan, protesting against the ruling party's "derogatory remarks" regarding Zia, the late BNP founder and former president and his contributions to independence. "No benefit will be reaped from distorting history. It is known to all at home and abroad that Major Zia first declared Bangladesh an independent nation." "Don't try to wipe out history after assuming office. Otherwise, a Pandora's box may be opened." "If Zia had not fought for freedom, then why did (independence architect) Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his government gave him a medal?" Delwar asked. The BNP leader also censured the ruling Awami League for their "politicisation of the administration" and "deterioration of law and order since they came to power". bd
