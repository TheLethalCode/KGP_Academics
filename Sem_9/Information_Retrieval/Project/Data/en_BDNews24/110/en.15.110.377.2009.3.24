<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com)MPs demanded Tuesday that they remained advisers to Upazila Parishad, city and municipal corporations. Ruling Awami League and opposition BNP MPs, while examining the Upazila Parishad Bill 2009 at the parliamentary standing committee on local government, said they should be made advisers to the local councils. But the committee, headed by Rahmatl Ali, did not make final recommendations on the proposed bill which had a provision to make MPs the ex-officio advisers to the parishads. "We are yet to decide on [the demands]. The committee will sit on Mar 29 to prepare its recommendations," Ali told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said the committee could not prepare recommendations as local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam was absent from the meeting "This needs to be resolved," Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, a committee member, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "All the MPs, irrespective of their political identities, demanded at the meeting that the MPs should be advisers to the local government bodies," he said. State minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanok, MP Monowar Hossain Chowdhury and the lone BNP member Abul Khayer Bhuiyan also attended the meeting. According to the bill, tabled in parliament on Feb. 25, the MPs will be advisers to the local councils though these were not bound to accept their suggestions. The Upazila Parishad Act 1998 had allowed the MPs to be ex-officio advisers to the councils and made it mandatory for the local bodies to accept their suggestions. But the emergency government led by Fakhruddin Ahmed repealed the 1998 act and made a new law deleting the controversial role of the MPs. The standing committee will also examine the draft city and municipality corporation bills placed in parliament for passage. The drafts laws have no provision for the MPs to be the advisers to the corporations. The standing committees can change any section of any proposed law sent to the watchdog body once they are placed in parliament. But parliament can finally change standing committee recommendations before passage if the government wishes.
