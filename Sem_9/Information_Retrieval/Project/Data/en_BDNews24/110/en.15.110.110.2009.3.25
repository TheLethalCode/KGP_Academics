 WASHINGTON, Mar 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US State Department said on Tuesday it had seen media reports that two journalists detained by North Korea had been charged with spying, but backed away from suggestions that it had independently confirmed this. "The US is aware of South Korean press stories reporting on South Korean sources claiming that the DPRK (North Korea) is investigating the two journalists for 'espionage,'" State Department spokesman Robert Wood said in a statement. North Korea's formal name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "We are in touch with the DPRK through various channels, and the only statement that the DPRK has made to us says only that the DPRK believes that the two journalists crossed the DPRK border illegally," Wood added in his written statement. "This is what I was referring to in my comments during the daily briefing." The United States, which does not have a diplomatic presence in North Korea, is trying to resolve the case of the two journalists, who were arrested by North Korean guards at the border with China last week. The two, identified by South Korean media as Euna Lee and Laura Ling, have been moved to the capital Pyongyang and are being interrogated there, a South Korean newspaper said, quoting intelligence sources. During his briefing earlier, Wood suggested that the US government had independent knowledge that the two had been charged with espionage. "We're certainly aware of the charges," Wood had said when asked to comment on media reports the pair had been charged with spying. "The North has assured us the detainees will be well-treated." ARREST AT FROZEN TUMEN RIVER The journalists' arrest at the Tumen River came at a time of mounting tension on the Korean Peninsula, with North Korea accusing the United States and South Korea of aggressive behavior while Pyongyang continued preparations to launch a long-range missile. "We understand the two female reporters are staying at a guest house in the suburb of Pyongyang overseen by the Security Command (the North's intelligence agency) and are being interrogated," the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo quoted an intelligence source as saying. The two were arrested before dawn on March 17 and driven in separate cars the next day to Pyongyang, JoongAng Ilbo reported. South Korea's National Intelligence Service declined to comment on the report. The women, who media sources said were working for US-based online news company Current TV, probably crossed the river and were on the North Korean side at a point where the current narrowed in a secluded part of the river, the newspaper said. An American cameraman, Mitch Koss, and a Chinese guide who was with the three were detained by Chinese police, media said. "The male American citizen involved in the case has left China," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang told reporters Tuesday. He did not comment on the status of the two reporters in North Korea. A diplomatic source said the two reporters were on the frozen Tumen river, which runs along the eastern portion of the border with China, when they were taken by North Korean security guards. It took three months to secure the release of an American in 1996 after he was detained by North Korean guards when he crossed the Yalu River that also separates the North and China
