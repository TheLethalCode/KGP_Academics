 LONDON, Mar 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world may be turning away from the death penalty, Amnesty International said on Tuesday, despite its latest report revealing a mixed picture. Worldwide executions rose more than 90 percent to 2,390 last year, with China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United States responsible for over 90 percent, said the human rights watchdog in its annual report on the death penalty. China alone carried out 72 percent of all executions in 2008, according to Amnesty's figures which it said were drawn from governments, human rights groups, court records and media reports. "The whole situation (in China) is shrouded in secrecy and the numbers might well be much, much higher," Irene Khan, Amnesty's secretary general, told Reuters, noting that the rise in executions was due in part to a change in the judicial system in China where there was a backlog of cases. The human rights group said the number of people sentenced to death more than doubled last year to 8,864 from 3,347 in 2007. Iran executed at least 346 people, Saudi Arabia 102, and Pakistan 36, Amnesty said. Japan executed 15 people in 2008, the highest since 1975, it said. 'Closer to a death-penalty free world' Nevertheless, Amnesty pointed out, just 59 nations retained the death penalty and, of those, just 25 carried out executions last year. Khan said despite the rise in executions during 2008, there were reasons to be optimistic. "The good news is that executions are only carried out by a small number of countries, which shows that we are moving closer to a death-penalty free world," she said. Amnesty said there was increasing evidence that the United States was turning away from the death penalty -- executing 37, the lowest number since 1994 -- Argentina had abolished the death penalty and there was a "clear move towards abolition" in central Asia. "Central Asia is now virtually death penalty free, following the abolition of the death penalty in Uzbekistan," said the rights group. "Belarus is the last country in Europe and the former Soviet Union that is still carrying out executions," it said. Four people were executed there in 2008. In Africa, Botswana and Sudan were the only two countries known to have carried out executions, Amnesty said, adding that Liberia re-introduced the death pena
