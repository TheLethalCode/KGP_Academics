<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)Learn to accept the results of elections, look to other countries to see how, was the message from the EC as commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain addressed potential candidates in Gazipur Saturday. He also stressed that no unfair bias was being shown to any party in the run-up to elections, in response to recent claims by BNP that the Election Commission was 'not neutral'. "We have no bias for or against any party," he said, at a views exchange meeting with aspiring candidates for the 9th Jatiya Sangsad and third upazila elections. "Learn to accept the results of elections," Sakhawat said, aiming his comment at the crowd of potential runners. Citing the just-concluded US presidential election, he said: "Republican presidential candidate John McCain graciously accepted Barak Obama's victory. The commissioner quoted McCain's statement: "'So far he was my rival. Now he is my president'." He requested those present to abide by the election code of conduct. "In the past, lakhs were spent on publicity on the day of submission of nomination papers." Saying it would not be tolerated this time, he advised: "You save yourself the money. Don't bring more than four people when submitting your papers." "And if anybody participates in a motorcade procession they will be sent to jail," the commissioner warned. He warned candidates too not to trade in votes. "If anybody is found doing so he will not be pardoned. The law proscribes three to seven years imprisonment for such offenders." Sakhawat also pointed out that the August city corporation and municipal elections "proved that the state of emergency was not an obstacle to the election". Referring to the Sripur municipal election, he said: "I visited 13 out of the 19 centres. People voted spontaneously. Some 84 per cent of voters turned out." "The power of democracy lies there," Sakhawat said. Many present at the meeting criticised the re-demarcation of five Jatiya Sangsad seats in Gazipur. In particular, they pointed out, the constituency of Gazipur Sadar had been redrawn to hold more than 10 lakh voters which was too large. Several candidates also demanded that Tongi be made a separate upazila. Gazipur's deputy commissioner Md Borhanuddin Bhuiyan presided over the meeting at the DC's conference room. Leaders of different political parties also spoke. bdnews2
