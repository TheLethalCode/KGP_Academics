 NEW YORK, Thu Nov 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Major retail chains posted disappointing October sales as consumers, stunned by a financial crisis that threatened to derail the US economy, shunned all but the most crucial of purchases. Discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc stood out as one of the few bright spots. It posted a better-than-expected increase of 2.4 percent in October sales at US stores open at least a year. Analysts had expected a 1.6 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters data. Other retailers, from Costco Wholesale Corp to Limited Brands Inc and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc, posted weaker-than-expected October sales on Thursday. According to a preliminary tally of 16 retailers that had reported results on Thursday morning, Thomson Reuters said 60 percent missed expectations, while 33 percent beat. To win more market share during the crucial holiday selling season, Wal-Mart said it will introduce new price cuts every week until Christmas, reducing prices on thousands of items, such as toys and food. Stephen Quinn, Wal-Mart's chief marketing officer, told Reuters that the new initiative "takes the intensity up massively" on price cuts it declared last month on popular toys. The company's shares rose 0.4 percent premarket. The October sales come as retailers head into what could be the weakest holiday season in two decades. While Thanksgiving weekend later this month traditionally marks the launch of the holiday shopping crush, retailers were already introducing discounts and sales to spur early buying. The outlook for October sales worsened as the week progressed. Thomson Reuters initially forecast a decline of 0.1 percent on Monday, but its updated forecast on Wednesday called for a decrease of 0.3 percent. "If the index actually comes in at -0.3 percent this would be the weakest same store sales result ever registered since we started collecting same store sales estimates in 2000," it said in a note. FINANCIAL CRISIS BATTERS CONSUMERS October sales results were expected to be weak after a financial crisis that began in the United States in September swept across the globe, stoking fears of a deep recession. Panicked investors sent stock markets plummeting as credit markets seized up and the U.S. government was forced to take extraordinary steps to shore up the U.S. financial system. With companies slashing jobs and retirement savings evaporating, U.S. consumer confidence plunged in October to a record low. Economists are now forecasting that the United States could be facing its worst recession since the 1970s. Zumiez Inc, which said late on Wednesday its October sales at stores open at least a year fell 13.1 percent, cut its fourth-quarter sales and earnings forecast. "As we look to the future, it is difficult to predict how the consumer will respond this holiday season due to extraordinary recent macroeconomic events and record low consumer confidence," Rick Brooks, Zumiez chief executive officer, said in a statement. The retailer, which sells action-sports clothing, footwear and accessories, expects a tough economy will persist into next year, and it is cutting its inventory, store growth plans and capital expenditures. COSTCO STUMBLES In additional to discount retailers, warehouse club operators like Costco have been prosperous this year as the clubs attract bargain-hunting shoppers looking for discounts on bulk-sized packages of paper towels, food and electronics. But Costco's October same-store sales fell 1 percent, hurt in part by fewer purchases of discretionary items like computers, toys and jewelry. Thomson Reuters said it was the company's weakest monthly same-store sales result since it began collecting estimates for Costco in 1997. Costco also said its sales were hit by the strengthening US dollar. A weaker dollar boosts profits of US multinational companies when their foreign revenue is converted into greenbacks. But in October, the dollar rose almost 8 percent compared with a basket of six foreign currencies, including the euro. Costco operates warehouse clubs in other countries including Canada and Britain
