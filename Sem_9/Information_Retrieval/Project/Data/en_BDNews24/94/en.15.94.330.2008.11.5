 Dhaka, Oct 5 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Navy frigates have been patrolling disputed Bay waters from a safe range, as Myanmar is yet to remove its structures and equipment for gas exploration from the area, foreign ministry officials said Wednesday. "We have very close relations with Myanmar. We want to maintain them," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "However, Bangladesh is also determined to protect her critical interests. That's why, we have dispatched a high-level delegation to Myanmar," the adviser said. Iftekhar made similar statements to press Tuesday. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, leading the three-member delegation, left Dhaka late Tuesday to discuss the "crisis" over Myanmar's oil and gas exploration in the Bay. "I will meet my Myanmar counterpart and other senior officials to convey that Dhaka wants immediate withdrawal of the vessels and infrastructures from the disputed waters," Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com before his departure. The area, believed to hold huge reserves of natural gas, lies some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island, and is claimed by both Bangladesh and Myanmar. According to an agreement reached at maritime boundary talks earlier this year in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Myanmar committed not to carry out oil and gas exploration until the two countries demarcated their sea borders. A technical team from Myanmar, headed by a deputy minister, will arrive in Dhaka to continue the sea boundary talks on Nov 16 and 17. bdn
