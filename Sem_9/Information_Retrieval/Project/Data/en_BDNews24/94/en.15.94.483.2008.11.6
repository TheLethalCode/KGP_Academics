 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com environment correspondent Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka will table its blueprint to set up an international climate change adaptation centre in Bangladesh at the upcoming Poznan conference in Poland. The ministry of environment and forest is working on the details to present at the climate conference slated for Dec 1-12, said the environment secretary Thursday. Environment and forest secretary AHM Rezaul Kabir told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh's idea to host an international adaptation centre was initially presented at the Bali climate change conference earlier this year. "We want to be the host country and are planning for the centre to be set up in Bangladesh. We also voiced the same offer at Accra in Ghana," he said. Dr Ainun Nishat, resident mission chief of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), agrees. "Since Bangladesh is the worst victim of climate change, the centre should be set up here. We have greater experience," he said. "The proposed centre should come under the aegis of the United Nations," Dr Nishat added. He said no international convention was yet in sight though the Kyoto protocol was signed years ago. The Kyoto protocol, which countries signed to halt climate change, will expire in 2012. The participating countries will discuss future action plans at the Poznan conference. A final declaration may emerge at the subsequent Copenhagen conference in Denmark in 2009. "At least there should be a framework in response to Bangladesh's call to set up this climate centre," Dr Nishat said. The environment secretary said experts were working on a detailed blueprint for the proposed centre. "Our core proposal will include raising funds for the centre and for a compensatory grant." Kabir mentioned that work had also begun at government level to face the challenges of climatic change, and related ministries have been asked to form an action cell. "This is to ensure sustainable development has no negative impact," he said. The secretary said his ministry would oversee the programmes. "A separate secretariat will be established," he added. bdnews
