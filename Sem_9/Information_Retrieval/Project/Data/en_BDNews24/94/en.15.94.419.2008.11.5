 BERLIN, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Torsten Frings has followed captain Michael Ballack's lead by apologising to Germany coach Joachim Loew in a move that should end a recent selection row. Frings met Loew in Berlin on Tuesday to discuss his future after the Werder Bremen midfielder was left out of the starting line-up for the last two World Cup qualifiers. According to a German Football Association statement, Loew told Frings he still had a role to play. In turn, the player apologised to his coach for speaking out after his omission and said he would fight for his place. "I told Torsten he can be an important part of the national team but he must accept competition," Loew said in the statement. It was Frings being left out of the team that sparked the row and almost cost Ballack his position as captain. Ballack spoke out in defence of Frings, suggesting senior players were not being treated with enough respect. Loew reacted furiously and demanded a face-to-face meeting with the Chelsea player in Germany. That meeting took place last week in Frankfurt, with Ballack's apology to his coach defusing the situation
