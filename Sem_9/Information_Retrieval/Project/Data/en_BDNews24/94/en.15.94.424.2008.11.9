 MILAN, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A stoppage-time own goal from Cicinho gave third-from-bottom Bologna a 1-1 home draw against AS Roma in Sinisa Mihajlovic's first game in charge on Saturday. The Brazilian defender's diving header cancelled out Francesco Totti's 68th-minute strike when the Roma captain made light of a nagging knee problem to smash in the ball at the near post after cleverly controlling a deflected cross. Roma, runners-up last term, had lost six of their previous nine Serie A games and remain a point above the drop zone despite looking a more confident side following the 3-1 win over Chelsea in the Champions League in midweek. Former firebrand defender Mihajlovic, who won the scudetto with Roma's city rivals Lazio in 2000, was given the Bologna job on Monday after Daniele Arrigoni was sacked following last weekend's 5-1 defeat at Cagliari. The two sides failed to create many clearcut chances. Visiting keeper Doni was carried off with a head injury after bravely denying Marco Di Vaio. Earlier, Torino moved up to 14th after Austrian midfielder Juergen Saeumel volleyed home from the edge of the area a minute from time to snatch a 1-0 home win over Palermo. The visitors struck the bar through Fabrizio Miccoli and had Antonio Nocerino harshly sent off for an elbow but the hosts deserved their victory given that Nicola Amoruso had a goal wrongly ruled out for offside for the second time in a week.
