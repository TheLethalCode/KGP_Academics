<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  There is no particular reason, but rather many reasons, for upholding the state of emergency, an adviser said on Wednesday. "It cannot be said that the state of emergency is being upheld due to any specific reason," communications adviser Ghulam Quader told reporters after a meeting with two other advisers at the Secretariat. "There are many reasons behind the emergency. If the situation compels, there is no alternative to emergency. It cannot be lifted fully," he said. "A number of conditions of the state of emergency have been relaxed. We are observing the situation." "The emergency will be relaxed or lifted as the situation demands," the adviser repeated. Quader, hopeful of a better situation after the national election said: "We have reached the electoral highway leaving all hurdles behind." "The Dec 18 election will be held properly. We have withdrawn army intervention. We hope a free and fair election will be held with the participation of all parties." "The qualitative change might be better than we are expecting this moment," the adviser said. Asked about the uncertainty of the participation of BNP in the election, he said: "We are still working for an understanding. The door for that is always open." Quader said he hoped that BNP would join the elections. The other two advisers present in the meeting were LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff. bdnew
