 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Army chief Moeen U Ahmed pledged all support from the army, alongside the government, to protect the interests of the readymade garment sector, the country's main export earner. "The garment industry belongs not to any group of individuals. It is a national wealth. None has the right to destroy it," Moeen said. He spoke as chief guest at the conclusion of the three-day Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition (BATEXPO) at Sonargaon Hotel on Saturday. "Certain quarters may be conspiring to destroy it, but no harm to this industry will be accepted at all. Alongside the government, the army will also provide all cooperation to this industry." "The industry has to be protected for the interests of the country." Moeen pointed out that 76 percent of the country's export earnings now come from this sector. "Around 22 lakh workers are employed by this industry, 80 percent of whom are women. A total of one crore people are indirectly involved with the industry." "The RMG industry is playing an important role in alleviation of poverty." BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez presided over the concluding session of the BATEXPO. US ambassador James F Moriarty and European Commission ambassador Stefan Frowein were special guests. Frowein said the European Commission would continue to assist in the development of the garment industry in Bangladesh, adding that Bangladesh faced the post-quota situation boldly. Moriarty praised the industry's progress, growing from $400 million sector 20 years ago to over $10 billion. He said improved quality had created a high demand for Bangladesh-made clothing in the West, including the US. But, he pointed out, extremely low wages of garment workers was a main factor in the development of the industry. Moeen said: "The government has always been behind the development of the industry and its workers. A minimum wage for the workers has been fixed through a tripartite agreement among the government, workers and the owners. The workers and owners will have to work hand in hand to take the industry forward." Aiming at garment owners, Moeen said: "You must keep in mind that development of this industry is not possible by depriving the workers." BGMEA president Parvez said: "The crisis in the world economy has brought both risk and potential for us. We want to go ahead availing the potential." Also touching on the global economic crisis, the army chief said: "We will have to take all types of preparation to face the crisis. Different quarters predicted that our garments industry would collapse with the end of quota system but that did not happen." He expressed hope that the garment industry would also withstand the economic crisis. The US ambassador, however, cautioned the global crisis was unpredictable, as was its impact on Bangladesh. The army chief claimed that after 1/11, a business-friendly environment had been created in the country. bdnews
