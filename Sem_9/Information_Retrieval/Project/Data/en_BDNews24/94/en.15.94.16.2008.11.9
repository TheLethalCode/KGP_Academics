 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) Any party taking up the reins of government next must recognise the caretaker government and validate its work, said Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam on Sunday. "The authority of the parliament of the next government itself will be questioned if it fails to validate the present caretaker government," he told reporters at his Nam flat residence in the morning. Ashraful made the remarks after a meeting with Philip Burton, South Asia director of British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and British envoy Stephen Evans. "We had a very interesting meeting," Evans said, introducing Philip Burton to reporters as they were leaving. Burton said: "We all want that a free and fair election be held on December 18th." He also expressed hope that the emergency would be lifted and all political parties would take part in the election. Ashraful said they had explained the position of his party and also threw light on the party's post-election agenda during the meeting. "We discussed the parliamentary polls and the post-election situation. The foreign envoys asked about our election stance and I said clearly that we must take part as the polls seem to be the only rational way out," said the AL spokesperson and joint general secretary. "The diplomats were also assured that Awami League would officially recognise the laws passed and the reform activities undertaken by the caretaker government," he said. "They also wanted to know if we apprehend any conflicts or clashes during the polls," said Ashraful. "I've assured them that nothing of the sort will happen. We also spoke about the state of emergency." He said Awami League wanted all parties to join the parliamentary elections. bdnews24.
