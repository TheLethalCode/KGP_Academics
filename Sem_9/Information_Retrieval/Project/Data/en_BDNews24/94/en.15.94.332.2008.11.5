 Suman Mahmud bdnews24.com chief political correspondent Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia held a closed-door meeting with commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed at her home that ran well past Tuesday midnight, an aide said. The meeting, under wraps, took place hours before a summit of the BNP-led four-party alliance is set to decide on their participation in the general election slated for Dec. 18 and Upazila polls 10 days later. Mojaheed drove to Khaleda's Shaheed Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment at 11:30pm and they were joined by Hossain Zillur 15 minutes later, an official at the house told bdnews24.com by phone. Mojaheed left at 11:50pm, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. But the adviser stayed back until 12:45am to speak to the former prime minister, who returned home at 11pm after presiding over a meeting of the party's highest decision-making body, the standing committee, at her political office in Gulshan. On Oct 10, Hossain Zilur meet secretly with Khaleda, touching off swirls of controversy across the political divide. bdnews
