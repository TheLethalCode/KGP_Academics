 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com) - Public Service Commission chairman Dr Saadat Hossain said on Tuesday that the commission would face the case filed, alleging irregularities in the 27th BCS examinations, in court. "The writ, filed against the government and the PSC will be faced through the legal process," Dr Hossain told bdnews24.com, denying any irregularities in the 27th Bangladesh Civil Service exam results. Following a writ petition filed by examinee Abul Kalam Md Tarit Hossain and 33 other children of freedom fighters, the High Court asked the government and the PSC to explain why the publication of the 27th BCS results without fulfilment of the freedom fighter quota should not be declared illegal. Irregularities due to 'politicisation' were alleged after the initial publication of results, on Jan 21 last year, of the 27th BCS held under the BNP-led alliance government. The caretaker government cancelled the results and rearranged viva voces for those who passed the written examination. But since the announcement of the second-phase results on Sept 23, recommending 3,239 examinees for appointment, angry examineeswho failed the second time roundhave demanded cancellation of the latter results and reinstatement of the earlier ones. The agitators have alleged that the PSC published the second-phase results violating the quota system and other rules. However, a bdnews24.com investigation had found that 331 freedom fighters' offspring and 23 indigenous people were recommended for appointment in the second-phase results under the respective quotas against the first-phase's 230 and 10. PSC officials say the quota system was followed strictly. bdnews
