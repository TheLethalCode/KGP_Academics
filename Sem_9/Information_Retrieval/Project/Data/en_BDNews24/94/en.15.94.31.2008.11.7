 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  The United States has urged political leaders to hold inter-party dialogues in a bid to minimise "political problems". "The US wants a free and fair election in Bangladesh," ambassador James F Moriarty said to reporters on Friday. He said he was worried about when the nation election, if it did not take place on Dec. 18, would be scheduled. Moriarty met with Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and party leaders at her Dhanmondi Sudha Sadan residence. After a half-hour meeting with the Hasina and other party leaders, Hasina and Moriarty had a closed-door discussion for an hour. "[Hasina] congratulated me on a free and fair election in the United States. I hope Bangladesh will also hold a free and fair one and everyone will accept the results," Moriarty said. On the other major political party BNP's participation in the election, he said he hoped the caretaker government would take effective measures to convince it to take part in the election. Acting AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam ,speaking to the media after the meeting, however, said he was optimistic about BNP going to the polls. "We've come to know that they (BNP) are preparing for the election. It is the political parties who have been the most affected since the 1/11. "We ought to stop the blame-game among political parties and extend cooperation so that we can gift the nation an acceptable election." "During the meeting we've informed the US ambassador about the Awami League's electoral preparation and its nomination process," Ashraful said. He asked for lifting of state of emergency before the ballot. Hasina's special assistant Hasan Mahmud, AL women affair secretary Dipu Moni, former lawmaker Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, among others, attended the meeting. bdnews
