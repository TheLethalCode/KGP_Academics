 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Fri Nov 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected US drone missile killed 10 people in a Pakistani region on the Afghan border on Friday, security officials said, the latest in a series of strikes that have infuriated Pakistan. There have been nearly 20 attacks by suspected missile-firing pilotless US drones since the beginning of September, but Friday's is the first since Tuesday's US presidential election. Pakistan objects to the strikes as not only a violation of its sovereignty but counter-productive to its efforts to tackle militants behind surging violence in both Pakistan and Afghanistan. A Pakistani intelligence agency official said the strike was on a house in North Waziristan but a military official said the attack was in South Waziristan. Both regions are al Qaeda and Taliban sanctuaries on the Afghan border. "It happened close to the border. We have reports of 10 dead but it will take time to get more information," said a military officer. US forces have stepped up attacks on militants in Pakistan in response to concern about worsening security in Afghanistan. Scores of people have been killed in missile strikes and a Sept. 3 cross-border commando raid, but no top al Qaeda or Taliban leaders have been reported to have died. Nuclear-armed U.S. ally Pakistan is also battling militants on its side of the border but says cross-border U.S. strikes undermine efforts to isolate the militants and rally public opinion behind the unpopular campaign against them. The United States has shrugged off Pakistani protests. It says the attacks are needed to protect U.S. troops in Afghanistan and kill Taliban and al Qaeda militants who threaten them. Pakistan hopes the new U.S. administration will be more sensitive to its concerns, although President-elect Barack Obama made comments in his campaign suggesting he would take a hawkish approach toward the border area militants. AIR STRIKES The violence and tension with the United States have contributed to investor gloom, exacerbating an economic crisis that looks likely to force the civilian government to go to the International Monetary Fund for help. While the U.S. strikes have been focused on North and South Waziristan, Pakistani forces have for months been battling militants elsewhere in the northwest, in particular Bajaur, to the northeast of Waziristan on the Afghan border. The militants have responded with a series of bomb attacks. On Thursday, a suicide bomber attacked a meeting of about 200 pro-government ethnic Pashtun tribesmen drawing up plans to drive militants out of their area. Up to 40 militants were killed in air strikes launched in response to the bomb attack, a government official said. "These were a quick response to the suicide attack, which lasted for several hours. We hit militant hideouts and killed 30 to 40 terrorists," said Fazl-e-Rabi Khan, a senior government administrator in Bajaur. There was no independent verification of his casualty estimate. The military has said more than 1,500 militants have been killed in Bajaur since fighting flared in August but there has also been no independent verification of that estimate. As part of efforts to tackle the militants entrenched in large parts of the Pashtun northwest, authorities are encouraging tribesmen to raise militias to force militants out. A similar strategy of supporting militias to evict insurgents has been used in Iraq, where Sunni tribesmen have risen up against al Qaeda and driven militants from their neighbourhoods. Khan said the death toll in Thursday's suicide bombing at the meeting of tribesmen in Batmalai village, 20 km north of Khar, the main town in Bajaur, had risen to 25. A suicide car bomber attacked a similar meeting on Oct. 10 in the Orakzai region, south of Bajaur, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 100
