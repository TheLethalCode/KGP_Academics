<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Rifles have been put on alert on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border at Teknaf and Bandarban, after reports that Yangon is strengthening its border security troops in the wake of a recent dispute over Myanmar's oil-gas exploration in the Bay, say officials. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Saturday, meanwhile: "Daewoo has said it would start removing its installations from the disputed waters from late night of Nov 7. The withdrawal will take several days, they said." Myanmar employed South Korea's Daewoo to undertake its oil-gas activities, that came to light just over a week ago. "Our ships will remain there until Myanmar withdraws its vessels," said the foreign adviser. He said Bangladesh was observing the situation "very closely". Meanwhile, BDR numbers have been reinforced at different border outposts and border patrols have been intensified in response to Nasaka activity, BDR and local authorities said Saturday. BDR has imposed an alert along the 105 kilometre border of Naikkhongchhari upazila in Bandarban, said Naikkhongchhari zone BDR commander Lt Col Abu Nayeem. Local Upazila Nirbahi Officer Nabab Aslam Habib told bdnews24.com: "Both BDR and Myanmar border security force Nasaka have deployed additional force and intensified security and patrol at the border." Though locals said an exchange of fire took place on Friday night, officials denied it. bdnews24.com Cox's Bazar correspondent said BDR had imposed an alert along 40 kilometres of border in Teknaf. Locals also said three Myanmar ships were seen inside Bangladesh waters, about 90 kilometres south-west of St Martins on Friday evening. Teknaf 42 Rifle Battalion commander Lt Col Abdul Khaledque confirmed to bdnews24.com Saturday: "Three Myanmar ships are still in the area of St Martins." Several hundred fishing trawlers have halted fishing activities around St Martins. Teknaf police officer in charge Md Jasim Uddin, however, said the border situation remained normal. "More than 200 tourists in two ships, the Keari Sindabad and LCT Kutubdia, went to St Martins from Teknaf Saturday morning. They returned by the same ships in the evening. There was no problem." Cox's Bazar deputy commissioner Monzur Alam Bhuiyan said BDR is in normal positions at border. He said he does not know about any alert. bdnews2
