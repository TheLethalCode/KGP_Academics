 LISBON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil coach Dunga is planning to recall AC Milan playmaker Ronaldinho to his squad next year after leaving him out for the friendly with Portugal. "He will stay at Milan to do more training and play more matches because before the Olympics (in Beijing) he was sidelined for four months," Dunga told a news conference to promote the friendly in Brasilia on Nov. 19. "It's better for him to play for Milan so he can return to the national squad in good condition next year because he is irreplaceable." It will be Portugal's first visit to Brasilia since 1989. Dunga refused to promise the uncapped Amauri a place, which could mean the Juventus forward will opt to play for the world champions instead when his application for Italian citizenship is completed. "He did well with Palermo and now he's doing well with an important team like Juve," Dunga told Italy's Rai television. "We haven't spoken to him but I read the newspapers and I hear of requests for guarantees. "No one has guarantees with me. The only guarantees are results. "There is a hierarchy that should be respected and I can't cast aside players who have done well with me.
