 FLORENCE, Italy, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tim Borowski scored a late goal to earn Bayern Munich a 1-1 draw at Fiorentina on Wednesday and put the Germans on the brink of the Champions League last 16. The unmarked midfielder controlled a deflected Franck Ribery ball from the left and slotted in 12 minutes from time to give the visitors a barely deserved share of the spoils. Romania striker Adrian Mutu had volleyed the home side in front in the 11th minute after Alberto Gilardino glanced on Luciano Zauri's cross from deep. Bayern have eight points from four games and share the lead of Group F with Olympique Lyon, who beat Steaua Bucharest 2-0, while Fiorentina are five points behind in third with slender hope of going though. "It was important to salvage a point at the end of the match," Borowski told Sky television. "Now we're sure of keeping Fiorentina behind us." The Italians, who lost 3-0 in Bavaria two weeks ago, enjoyed a good spell of pressure after going in front and Bayern keeper Michael Rensing produced two diving saves to repel Gilardino headers. The visitors, without injured former Fiorentina striker Luca Toni, had more possession in the latter part of the first half, but failed to do much with it. Bastian Schweinsteiger blasted their best chance wide shortly before the break. The Serie A side made a bright start to the second half, when Italy forward Gilardino overhit an attempted lob and had a powerful strike blocked by Rensing while Mutu headed over the bar from close range. Borowski made them pay for their wastefulness and Miroslav Klose almost snatched it for the German champions shortly after the equaliser. "We played well. We put a great team in trouble," Mutu said. "We were a bit naive. We should have wrapped up the game. We're paying for our inexperience in the Champions League
