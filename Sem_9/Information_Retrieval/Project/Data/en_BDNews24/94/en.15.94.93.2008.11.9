 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission has warned BNP over violations of the election code of conduct. A letter warning the party was sent by the EC said on Sunday, stating BNP leaders and workers violated the code of conduct by carrying out election publicity at the party's 'Solidarity Day' rally in Chittagong on Friday. Election Commission deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com: "A letter has been sent by messenger to the BNP secretary general today warning the party over the violations." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia addressed crowds of party leaders and supporters carrying banners and festoons, welcoming the party chairperson with the party's 'sheaf of paddy' election symbol, and putting up posters of potential candidates. The EC deputy secretary said the code of conduct barred parties and individuals from election campaigning more than three weeks ahead of the election. "The EC has requested the BNP to refrain from such activities for the sake of creating congenial atmosphere for elections," Morshed said. Awami league was similarly warned after party chief Sheikh Hasina was welcomed by similar rallies of supporters on her return to Bangladesh on Nov 6. The Jatiya Sangsad election is slated for Dec 18. bdnews
