 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked the candidates for the general election to limit their polls expenses to Tk 5 per voter or Tk 15 lakh per constituency. EC senior assistant secretary Farhad Ahmed Khan told bdnews24.com on Thursday the revised Representation of the People Order clearly specified that the highest expenses in a constituency must not exceed Tk 15 lakh, irrespective of the number of voters. He said two election monitors will check the possible violation of the election rules. Khan also said the election rules allow only the agent of the candidate to spend money and he or she can spend the amount on buying stationery, postal stamps, and telephone calls, and on other small heads. Dhaka-19 will be the largest constituency with the highest number of 6,02,386 voters and Jhalokathi-1 will be the smallest with 1,37,092 voters.

"The candidates must state the source of the campaign expenses to the Election Commission 30 days after the polls result. Discrepancies if found will cancel the candidature," Khan said. The election rules bar the candidates from using from using posters of multi-colours or of imported paper or of any size bigger than the prescribed. They cannot make canopies of over 400 square feet, gates or use more than three mikes at a time on any occasion except public meetings.
