 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)-The Supreme Judicial Commission has sent the names of 14 lawyers and judges to the President in order to appoint seven to the High Court. The nine-member commission, chaired by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, met at the latter's chamber from 1:30pm to 4:00pm on Wednesday, Supreme Court Bar Association president Barrister Shafique Ahmed told reporters after the meeting. Ten lawyers and four judges of lower court were nominated, but their names were kept confidential, he said.
