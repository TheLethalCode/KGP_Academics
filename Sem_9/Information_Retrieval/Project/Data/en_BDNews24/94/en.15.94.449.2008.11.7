 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - River Plate's miserable run continued on Thursday when the Argentine champions squandered a 2-0 lead against Guadalajara and were knocked out of the Copa Sudamericana. The Mexicans fought back to draw the quarter-final second leg tie 2-2 at home at the Jalisco stadium and qualify 4-3 on aggregate. The match was seen as crucial for the future of River coach Diego Simeone, whose side are bottom of the Argentine championship. Simeone, with his right hand still in a cast after he pounded the team bench in frustration following a game two weeks ago, was sent off for dissent in the 84th minute. River looked set for a change of fortune when Gustavo Cabral and Radamel Falcao Garcia put them 2-0 ahead after only 20 minutes. They could have had a third as Sebastian Abreu headed against the post early in the second half. Guadalajara hit back when Fabian de la Mora and then Alberto Medina scored with breakaway goals in a five-minute spell. Rodrigo Archubi and Garcia both came close to snatching a winner for River. Guadalajara will face Internacional, who pulled off a shock 2-1 win over Boca Juniors at the usually impregnable Bombonera stadium in Buenos Aires that gave them a 4-1 aggregate win. Midfielder Magrao put the Brazilians ahead two minutes after halftime when he side footed in from close range. Juan Roman Riquelme levelled with a penalty 10 minutes later but Internacional quickly regained the lead when Alex Meschini turned in Andres D'Alessandro's incisive pass. The Copa Sudamericana is the region's equivalent of the UEFA Cup
