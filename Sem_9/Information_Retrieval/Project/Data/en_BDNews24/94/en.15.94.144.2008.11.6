 AALBORG, Denmark, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A late free-kick from Anders Due gave AaB Aalborg a 2-2 draw with Villarreal on Wednesday and kept alive the Danish champions' slim hopes of advancing from Champions League Group E. With new manager Allan Kuhn at the helm, Aalborg searched feverishly for their first group victory but Villarreal struck first. Robert Pires released Giuseppe Rossi on the edge of the penalty area in the 41st minute and the Italian international, who had hit the crossbar five minutes before, moved to his left to avoid two Aalborg defenders and finished with a precise low shot. "We started well in the first half but we forgot to cover Pires once and we paid the price on the counterattack," said Kuhn, who took over on an interim basis from Bruce Rioch after Aalborg lost 6-3 at Villarreal two weeks ago. "In the second half, we played one of our best football in a long time against a very good team," Kuhn added. Jeppe Curth levelled the score after a nifty back heel pass from Caca in the 54th minute, only for substitute Guille Franco to put Villarreal ahead again in the 75th minute after the hosts failed to clear a free kick. Franco collected Joseba Llorente's chip over the Danish defence and slipped the ball past goalkeeper Karim Zaza. Villarreal's second lead lasted only six minutes before Due blasted a free kick over the wall and in the top corner from 25 metres, giving Aalborg their second point in the group. "It was a balanced game and they equalised with an amazing free kick," Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini said. Manchester United and Villarreal lead the group with eight points each, while Celtic are on two with two rounds of matches remainin
