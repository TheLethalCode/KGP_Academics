 TOKYO, Thu Nov 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's opposition hopes it can emulate US President-elect Barack Obama's victory with his promise of change, but many Japanese voters longing for something new doubt their own politicians have what it takes. Polls show many Japanese have grown weary of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, in power for most of the past 53 years. But the opposition Democrats, who share a name with Obama's party, face an uphill battle to prove they can do a better job. "Japan doesn't have any charismatic politicians like Obama who are young and calling for reform," said 38-year-old Keishi Matsuoka, who works in advertising. Flagging support for Prime Minister Taro Aso and the LDP have not translated into a big boost for the Democrats, who are led by a former ruling party heavyweight saddled with an image as an old-fashioned back-room dealer. "If we had an election ... I think most Japanese would be in a quandary. There isn't really anyone we want to vote for," Matsuoka said. Aso is Japan's third prime minister in a year, but with his popularity sagging and the economy faltering amid fallout from a global financial crisis, the premier looks unlikely to call an election this year. None need be held until next September. Recent surveys show many voters are prepared to wait, given the economic uncertainty, but others are not so patient. "It would be better to have an election soon, or nothing will change," said financial sector employee Norihiko Nishigaki, 34. "Policies being implemented now are more of the same. The LDP is just spreading money around trying to win votes," he said, referring to a new $51 billion government stimulus package. Nishigaki acknowledged that the opposition also left him a bit cold, but offered a glimmer of cheer for Japan's Democrats' hopes that the Obama landslide would provide a tailwind. Asked for whom he would vote if given the chance, he said: "I think it would be better to have a change.
