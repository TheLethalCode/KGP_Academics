<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) - Bikalpadhara president Badruddoza Chowdhury announced Sunday that his party would leave the Awami League-led 'grand alliance' and form a new alliance with Gano Forum. "Today we are making a call for a new meaningful and alternative political alliance," the former president said at a press conference in the city. The formal announcement of the new alliance also comprising Krishak Sramik Janata League, Bangladesh Kalyan Party and others would be made in a day or two, Chowdhury said. Asked about the break with the grand alliance, he said: "Before the cancelled January 2007 election, the country was heading towards a civil war." "We joined the grand alliance to avert that disaster. We still have good relations with alliance members including the Awami League. But we are no more in the grand alliance." B Chowdhury alleged, many of the established parties were trying to rehabilitate corrupt politicians. "People want a change from such injustice. There is no alternative to change for taking the country forward." "Not only the US, but the whole world is seeing great changes. The people of Bangladesh also want change. We are preparing to contest in all the constituencies." Asked if he had any doubts regarding the election, he said: "We think the election will be held. If none other participate in the election, we will." On allegations of corruption against one of the probable leaders of the new alliance, Bangabir Kader Siddiqui, Chowdhury replied: "He did not commit corruption. He has made that clear." KSJL president Bangabir Kader Siddiqui, Gano Forum acting general secretary Subrata Chowdhury, Kalyan Party chairman Maj Gen Syed Mohammad Ibrahim and Bangladesh Labour Party chairman Sekendar Ali Moni were present at the press briefing at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. bdnews
