 Chittagong, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Local BNP has taken massive preparations for party chief Khaleda Zia's visit to the port city on Friday. She will drive to Chittagong from Dhaka with a motorcade of about three to four hundred cars, party sources said. On her way she will address streetside rallies at different points and a public meeting at Laldighi Maidan in the afternoon to mark the "National Revolution and Solidarity Day". Local BNP leaders are expecting an announcement from her about the election at the public rally. This is Khaleda's first visit to Chittagong since the current military-installed interim government took power and her release on bail from detention. Local administration has shore up security ahead of the visit and the public meeting. The long-running dispute between local BNP's two rival groupings led by Abdullah Abu Noman and Mir Nasir Uddin would also be discussed during her visit, party sources said. bd
