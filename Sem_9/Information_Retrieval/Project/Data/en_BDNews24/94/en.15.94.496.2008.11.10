<TITLE> China says no progress in talks with Tibet envoys </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Any demands by the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for autonomy for Tibet are out of the question, a leading Chinese official said on Monday, blaming his envoys for lack of progress in talks last week. Zhu Weiqun, a Vice Minister of the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work Department, told a news conference that the Dalai Lama's envoys had presented a memorandum urging "genuine autonomy" for all Tibetans. But Zhu said China will "never allow ethnic splitting in the name of 'genuine autonomy' to undermine ethnic solidarity." "The central authorities said that the door for the Dalai Lama's return to a patriotic stance had always been open and would remain open in the future," he said. "However the door for Tibet independence, half independence and covert independence has never been open and nor will it be open in the future," said Zhu, whose department oversees the Party's dealings with religious organizations and other non-Communist groups. Zhu's remarks were Beijing's first detailed comment on the talks with envoys of the Dalai Lama that ended last week. Those talks were the first since the Beijing Olympics in August, where pro-Tibet groups held sporadic protests. "Contacts and talks failed to make progress, and they should assume full responsibility for it," Zhu added, referring to last week's talks. His comments also come during an agenda-setting debate among exiled supporters of the Dalai Lama, many of whom will attend a meeting he has called to discuss the future of their cause. Those talks will give a platform to exiles demanding independence for Tibet rather than their revered leader's idea of autonomy under Chinese sovereignty. Beijing says the Dalai's demands for high-level autonomy for the mountain region amount to independence in all but name. MIDDLE WAY The 73-year-old Buddhist leader suggested this month that his "middle way" for Tibet short of outright independence was failing, and speculation has grown that he wants to step back from day-to-day political leadership after a bout of poor health. He is not attending the Nov 17-22 exiles meeting, perhaps a sign that he wants to leave this debate to a newer generation. The Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959 after an abortive uprising against Chinese rule. He has since lived in India, traveling the world to promote his cause, and still widely revered in his homeland. China accuses the Dalai's supporters of fomenting violent unrest in Tibet in a bid to upset the Beijing Olympics in August. The Dalai has strongly rejected that claim. Critics of China's rule in Tibet say it stifles religious and cultural freedom and promotes development that skews wealth and opportunities away from poor Tibetans while encouraging influxes of Chinese labor from other parts. bd
