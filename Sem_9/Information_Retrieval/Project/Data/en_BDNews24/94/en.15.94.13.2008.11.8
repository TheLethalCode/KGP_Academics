<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad tasted first triumph in the B. League with a 1-0 away win over Rahmatganj MFS at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. Muktijoddha, who ended their five-match losing run to hold Brothers Union to 1-1 draw in the previous match, went ahead in the fourth minute when Walid Khan placed a Sentu pass home at the top of the eight-yard box. After taking an early lead, Muktijoddha apparently took a defensive strategy, allowing Rahmatganj to go for attack, and the Old Dhaka outfit were a bit unlucky in squandering two chances in the first half. Striker Onyeo Koro Felix hammered a powerful shot at the edge of the box with goalkeeper Maksudur Rahman brilliantly thwarting Felix's effort in the 40th minute while, two minutes later ,substitute Aminul Islam Ripon saw his effort come off the sidebar in a scramble. After resumption, Rahmatganj pressed hard, but they could hardly split the Muktijoddha backline marshalled by Biplob, Roni, Bappi and Davis Majemu. With the maiden triumph, the All Red outfit climbed up the second position from the bottom with four points from seven outings. Khulna Abahani Limited are in the bottom place in the 11-team point table with three points also from seven matches. bd
