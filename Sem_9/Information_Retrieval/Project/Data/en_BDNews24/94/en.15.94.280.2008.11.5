 Matthew Bigg ATLANTA, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In churches and bars, on the street and in private homes, African Americans celebrated on Tuesday in anticipation of a longed-for victory by Democrat Barack Obama in the U.S. presidential race. Although they make up only about 13 percent of the U.S. population, more than 90 percent of black Americans are expected to vote for Obama, who would be the first black president in U.S. history. Many looked to early exit poll returns in Eastern states to buoy their hopes for a Democratic win. "This is definitely history in the making," said elementary school teacher Sheneka Mayes, 32, in Atlanta. "This night will be burned into my memory and into the memory of my children." The early returns, particularly a big early win in Pennsylvania, calmed fears that weeks of opinion polls giving Obama a lead against Republican John McCain might have overestimated his support among the country's white majority. Thousands of people watched a giant screen in New York's Times Square. Around 2,000 people also watched a big screen set up on 125th street in Harlem, New York, dubbed the unofficial capital of black America. In Atlanta, thousands more held a candlelight vigil at the tomb of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King, setting the election firmly in the context of the movement in the 1950s and 1960s to end racial segregation and win the right to vote for black Americans in the South. Later they packed into King's old church, Ebenezer Baptist, where thumping gospel music from a choir dressed in black provided accompaniment to two giant TV screens scrolling results on CNN. Deafening cheers greeted any result that appeared to favor Obama. "Martin Luther King gave his life so that a man of color could be president or a woman could be vice president," said civil rights leader Al Sharpton, referring to Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. "The dream was not just to get a high place. It was to use an exalted place to help everyone," Sharpton said, in a reference to King's "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963. A victory for either Obama or McCain would be a positive outcome for democracy, said Sharpton and other speakers. "This is a great night. This is an unbelievable night," said U.S. Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who was brutally beaten by police in Selma, Alabama, during a voting rights march. "Tonight we can celebrate and thank God almighty. Martin Luther King must be looking down from the heavens and saying 'hallelujah,'" Lewis said.
