<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  National footballers on Thursday began to gear up for the ensuing Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Malaysia this month. The 3rd Grand Royal Challenge Cup is scheduled for Nov 11 to 21 with Bangladesh competing with hosts Myanmar and Indonesia in the group stage. Except defender Rajani Kanta Barman, all players had practice in two sessions as coach Shafiqul Islam Manik emphaised the need for players' fitness on the first day and kept the players almost on running in both morning and afternoon sessions. Rajani has been advised to rest for one day following his cuff-muscle pull, said the coach. Manik said that he would go for technical session Friday, the second day of the three-day camp, before leaving here for Myanmar on Nov 9. Alfaz returned to the national fold after the veteran striker was dropped in the Mardeka Cup where Bangladesh lost to Mozambique U/20 and Myanmar and drew against Vietnam U/23. After the Mardeka Cup, the pressure mounted over the coach to include Sheikh Russel KC striker Alfaz, who had struck a hat trick in the ongoing B. League. "I would be very pleased if I could strike in the tournament," said Alfaz after the training session. He, however, said that he felt a bit pressure after being picked up as an experienced striker. "If we can perform as a team, then it is not impossible to score a goal," said Alfaz, who has been representing the national team for 13 years. bd
