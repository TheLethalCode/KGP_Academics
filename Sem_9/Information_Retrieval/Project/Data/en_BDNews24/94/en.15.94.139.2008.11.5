<TEXT>
 London, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina has said Awami League will go to the election "if things are all right even if the BNP decides not to". Asked by reporters in London if her party would participate in the polls amid emergency, Hasina replied in the affirmative. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman echoed Hasina to say the Dec. 18 general election is a must, "whether any particular party participates or not". Zillur made the comment to a group of AL supporters at his Gulshan residence on Wednesday. Both sets of comments came as Hasina's political rival, BNP chief Khaleda Zia, on Wednesday asked all to avoid what she termed was an "unacceptable election" on the cards. Hasina, meanwhile left the UK around 7pm BdST on Wednesday en route for home. She was expected to land in Dhaka Thursday morning. Prior to her departure, she spoke to Bangla reporters at a central London hotel on Tuesday. Hasina rejected outright suggestions of any secret power-sharing deal with the government. "Awami League can never have such a deal with a non-elected government." She asserted that her party "wants to help the interim government's exit, not to make them permanent." The former prime minister said the government's anticorruption drive was "not transparent" although time demanded it. Her party members had been victim to conspiracies and harassment, even though Awami League did not believe in corruption, she alleged. If elected, her party would "further strengthen the Anticorruption Commission and curb the price hike," the AL chief told reporters. Asked if they would keep off elections in case of an adverse situation, she declined to make a "comment that would give a chance to a quarter to foil the election." About nomination of expatriate candidates, Hasina said her party had to make an unanimous decision on the issue. Senior journalist and columnist Abdul Gaffar Chowdhury, UK AL president Shamsuddin Khan, party leader Jalal Uddin, UK Youth League Anwaruzzaman Chowdury also attended the briefing. bdnews
