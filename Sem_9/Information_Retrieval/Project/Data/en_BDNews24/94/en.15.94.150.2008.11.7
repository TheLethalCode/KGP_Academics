<TITLE> ICL hunting Tigers even in S Africa, says manager </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's national cricket players are still being hunted by the breakaway India Cricket League, even on tour thousands of miles away in South Africa, say team managers. Bangladesh thought they had no more worries over their cricketers' security on tour, but it seems the team's management is concerned again. And those concerns are turned toward the ICL rather than the notorious law and order situation in South Africa. The ICL has already seized 14 top former national cricketers including opener Shahriar Nafees, middle order batsmen Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali and wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh. "After arriving here, we were provided security personnel on the day of the first match. Other days, we move without security, but we still need to keep a close watch for suspicious characters approaching the boys," said manager Shafiqul Haq Heera on the way to the practiceground at Potchefstroom on Thursday. Heera said that he was advised by the board to give extra attention to the players as ICL agents were still trying to nab national players. "Razib (Shahadat Hossain) was made an offer by the ICL during the second Test against New Zealand in Dhaka, but he rejected it," said Heera, a former national captain. The ICL also approached Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and opener Tamim Iqbal during the first Test against New Zealand in Chittagong, though both cricketers rejected the offers and made them public through an official press conference. The Bangladesh manager was also non-plussed over the team's accommodation at the Palazzo Montecasino, which includes casinos, a skate park, restaurants, a 135-meter high balloon ride and a bird sanctuary. Heera's concern is that unknown people can approach the players at any time in such a place. "It is not a place where a national cricket team can stay," he alleged. bdnew
