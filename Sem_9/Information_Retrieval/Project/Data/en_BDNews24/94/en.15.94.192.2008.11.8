 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  Less than six months into the launch of its international routes, private airline Best Air has suspended flights to three overseas destinations.. "Poor numbers of passengers on Colombo, Male and Dubai routes have forced the suspension," the airline's marketing and sales director Farhad Hossain told bdnews24.com "We expect to restart the flights soon, however." Best Air started flying the Dhaka-Colombo-Male route on July 28 and Dhaka-Dubai on Sept 8. Flights to Colombo and Male were suspended in the middle of October and to Dubai in the last week of that month, officials said. Farhad Hossain said the company would nevertheless debut its Dhaka-Canton and Dhaka-Kathmandu routes soon. Best Air has also stopped flights to Chittagong, though the company's maiden flight was to the country's port city last January. Best Aviation, the company's predecessor, debuted in the local aviation market with helicopter service. Best Air's entrance to international routes began with its Bangkok flight in May and expanded to Dhaka-Kuala Lumpur and Dhaka-Singapore routes in October. Farhad said an A-321 aircraft would be added to the fleet of two chartered MD-83 and Boeing-737 aircraft soon. bdne
