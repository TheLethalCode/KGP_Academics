 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Myanmar has pulled out vessels from the disputed waters in the Bay of Bengal where it had been drilling for oil and gas and the vessels are patrolling inside their seawaters, the foreign adviser has said. He said the South Korean industrial giant, which was awarded oil and gas exploration by Myanmar, also started dismantling their installations for the offshore exploration. "Myanmar vessels have left the disputed waters and are staying in their waters," adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Sunday at his office. The adviser said Daewoo had responded to Bangladesh's protests and had been suspending their operations. "We have heard from the ground that Daewoo has begun the process of dismantling their installations and removing rigs," the adviser said. "Naturally, we are pleased with this development." The adviser said Dhaka was keen to peacefully resolve the issue with the neighbour. "At the same time, we will protect our sovereign interests," he said. Foreign ministry sources said Myanmar's ruling junta awarded Daewoo the contract secretly in 2005. There was no open bidding for the contract, they said. "Daewoo did not know that the site was in the disputed waters. The company first came to know about it when Bangladesh protested the exploration," an official, asking not to be named as he was not authorised to brief the media, told bdnews24.com. He said according to international practices, international companies do not go for exploration works in the disputed waters. Sending protest letters to the South Korean government was a good move that influenced Daewoo's withdrawal, he said. Tension flared between Bangladesh and its southwest neighbour last week over Yangon's oil and gas exploration activities in the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles south of Saint Martin's Island. The area is claimed both by Bangladesh and the reclusive Myanmar. According to an agreement, both the countries committed not to go for oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters until the disagreement was resolved through negotiation as per the United Nations laws. A Myanmar delegation is due in Dhaka soon to continue the sea boundary delimitation talks that resumed in April this year after a pause of 22 years. bd
