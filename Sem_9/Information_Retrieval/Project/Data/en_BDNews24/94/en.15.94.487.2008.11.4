 NAGPUR, India, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saurav Ganguly's farewell will not be a distraction for India as they try to win the final test against Australia starting on Thursday, off-spinner Harbhajan Singh said. "I don't think it will be a distraction. We will focus on cricket, simple," a fit-again Harbhajan told a news conference on Tuesday. Former India captain Ganguly will be playing in his final test.

India lead the four-match series 1-0 after winning the second test at Mohali by 320 runs. The first test in Bangalore and the third in Delhi last week were drawn. Harbhajan will return after missing the previous test with a toe injury. "I am 100 percent fit to play," he said after practice at the old stadium. Both teams had yet to train at the new stadium where the test will be played. Harbhajan, one short of 300 test wickets, will take over the mantle of senior spinner after leg-spinner Anil Kumble announced his test retirement on the final day of the third test. "It (Kumble's) will be very big shoes to fill," the off-spinner said. "We all know his contribution to Indian cricket and the number of matches he has won," he said of test cricket's third highest wicket-taker. "At the same time there are young bowlers, like Amit Mishra, who now have a chance to claim a permanent place in the team. They are good bowlers and are doing well." Mishra took seven wickets on his debut in Mohali when he replaced an injured Kumble. The Nagpur match will also be middle-order batsman Vangipurappu Laxman's 100th tes
