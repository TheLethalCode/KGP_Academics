 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Seven parties, including BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, received their certificates of registration from the Election Commission on Tuesday. "We are very happy," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters after receiving the party's certificate from EC secretary Humayun Kabir. He refused to comment, however, when asked about the party's decision to join elections. EC officials said registration certificates were ready for another 10 parties, including Awami League. AL is expected to collect its certificate on Wednesday, they said. Jamaat-e-Islami collected its registration certificate from the Election Commission late Tuesday night, a party official said. Party officials went to the EC secretariat to pick up the certificate at 8:45pm, Jamaat law affairs secretary Jasimuddin Sarkar told bdnews24.com. Asked why they collected the registration certificate so late, Sarkar said: "We learnt about it at night, and collected it at night." EC secretary Humayun Kabir confirmed the party had picked up its certificate of registration. Jatiya Party, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, Communist Party of Bangladesh, Workers Party of Bangladesh and Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal also picked up their certificates on Tuesday, bringing the total number of certified parties to eight. Liberal Democratic Party was the first to receive its certificate on Oct 20. The certified parties have also been allocated election symbols: paddy sheaf for BNP, plough for Jatiya Party, winnow for Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, umbrella for LDP, scythe for CPB, hammer for WPB and torch for JSD. Awami League will have the boat symbol. JP secretary general Ruhul Amin Hawlader said: "Registration plays a vital role in holding an acceptable election. We are happy to receive the certificate." EC joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan said as many as 107 parties had applied for registration but not more than 25 parties would be certified. Other parties to have registration certificates ready include: Jatiya Party-JP (bicycle), Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal (wheel), Krishak Sramik Janata League (gamchha), Bangladesh National Awami Party (hut) and Ganotantri Party (pigeon). "The EC will hand out registration certificates to all qualified parties by the end of the week," said Khan, chief of the EC's scrutiny committee. The commission also started hearings on Tuesday of objections against registration of four parties: Islami Oikyo Jote, Khelafat Majlish, Jamiate Olamaye Islam and Nejame Islami Bangladesh. Two of BNP's alliance partners, Jamaat-e-Islami and IOJ, have sparked objections to their registration. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda in his address to the nation on Sunday said no candidates other than those of registered parties and independents could take part in the elections. bdnews24.
