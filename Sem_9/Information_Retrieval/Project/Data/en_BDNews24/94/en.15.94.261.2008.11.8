<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A (all times GMT). Ivan Cordoba could replace Nicolas Burdisso in Inter Milan's lineup for Sunday's home match against Udinese (1400) after the Argentine defender's inept showing in Tuesday's 3-3 draw at Anorthosis Famagusta in the Champions League. Coach Jose Mourinho is seeking to shore up a back-line that has conceded five goals in two games and is likely to be tested by second-placed Udinese, who are level on points with the third-placed champions. Romania centre back Cristian Chivu has a knee injury, while striker Adriano is hoping for a squad place after being left out for three games for indiscipline. Udinese's Italy forward Antonio Di Natale is a doubt because of a bout of flu, but his fellow striker Fabio Quagliarella is in prolific form, scoring a double in Thursday's 2-1 UEFA Cup win at Spartak Moscow for his fourth goal in three games. Brazil playmaker Kaka is likely to return for leaders AC Milan at Lecce (1930) after being rested in Thursday's 1-0 win over Braga in the UEFA Cup. Milan are still without injured midfielder Andrea Pirlo and defender Alessandro Nesta, who has flown to the United States for treatment on a stubborn back problem. Kaka's Brazil team mate Ronaldinho said he is settling in well at Milan after coming off the bench to score a stoppage-time winner on Thursday. "Every day I feel more at home, the affection people give me is incredible," he told reporters. AS Roma are expected to stick with the side that beat Chelsea 3-1 in the Champions League this week when they bid to end a run of four league defeats at second-from-bottom Bologna on Saturday (1930). Bologna will be under new coach Sinisa Mihajlovic for the first time after they sacked Daniele Arrigoni following Sunday's 5-1 loss at Cagliari. Juventus coach Claudio Ranieri may give Alessandro Del Piero a break at struggling Chievo Verona on Sunday (1400) after his captain brought the Bernabeu crowd to their feet with the superb double that downed Real Madrid midweek. Fourth-placed Napoli will be without suspended Italy midfielder Christian Maggio at home to Sampdoria (1400)
