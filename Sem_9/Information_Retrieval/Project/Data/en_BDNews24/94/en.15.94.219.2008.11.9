 Chittagong, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury announced on Sunday on his return from Thailand that he wished to run the parliamentary election from three constituencies. "There is no bar to participating in the parliamentary election as an elected mayor. So I will contest the poll from the constituency party leaders and workers ask me to do," Mohiuddin said at Chittagong Shah Amanat International Airport. The city Awami League chief hinted at contesting the election from three city constituencies and nomination papers have been collected for him from three seats in the city. The government has not allowed Mohiuddin to take back the charge of the mayor's office after his release on bail from jail on Oct.8. Councillor Monzur Alam is now the acting mayor. Mohiuddin and his wife Hasina Mohiuddin were welcomed by the city corporation councillors, officials, employees and party leaders and workers after undergoing treatment for 10 days at Piathai Hospital. Later in the afternoon he presided over an extended meeting of the Chittagong city AL. At the airport, he told reporters peaceful election should be held in time and added that "if people want" he would contest from three seats. He said as the elected mayor he would run the city corporation. Stopping him from his work was illogical, he added. The mayor went to Bangkok for treatment on Oct. 29 to get treatment for spinal cord, heart, diabetes and kidney problems. The city mayor said his health was much better now and that he would take part in party and corporation work in a few days. bdnews24
