 LONDON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief Premier League news ahead of this weekend's matches: Arsenal are already missing Emmanuel Adebayor (ankle), Emmanuel Eboue (knee) and Robin van Persie (suspended), and the London club could also be without Theo Walcott, captain William Gallas and Bacary Sagna for the clash with champions Manchester United (1245GMT) on Saturday. Manager Arsene Wenger admitted that fielding Mikael Silvestre to face his former side may be a "gamble," after the 31-year-old Frenchman broke his nose against Fenerbahce on Wednesday. Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia resumed training on Thursday after an illness forced him out of the Fenerbahce match. Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez anticipates the return of striker Fernando Torres for Saturday's home game (1730) against lowly West Bromwich Albion. "I think Torres will be fit. It will be very good for the team to have him back. We are playing really well but we're not taking our chances," he told the club's website (www.liverpoolfc.tv) on Friday. Newcastle United captain Michael Owen came on briefly as a substitute against Aston Villa on Monday, and looks to have regained full fitness after a two-week absence with a groin injury. They visit Fulham on Sunday (1600). Blackburn Rovers, who host Chelsea on Sunday (1330), are hopeful that Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz will return after he sustained a hamstring injury on Oct 29. Bolton Wanderers captain Kevin Nolan will be suspended for Saturday's trip to Hull City (1500), having accumulated five yellow cards in the league so far this season. Everton could be without forwards Yakubu Aiyegbeni (heel) and Steven Pienaar (knee) for their visit to West Ham United on Saturday (1500). Record signing Marouane Fellaini is suspended after picking up five yellows. West Ham are hoping former Chelsea midfielder Scott Parker is available after a calf problem. Tottenham Hotspur forward Giovani Dos Santos suffered a serious ankle injury in Monday's training session and is set for a lengthy spell out. Spurs manager Harry Redknapp will look for his third league win since taking charge last month against Manchester City on Sunday (1500)
