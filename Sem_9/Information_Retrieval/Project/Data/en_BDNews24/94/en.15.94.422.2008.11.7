 KARACHI, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has told the four host countries of the 2011 World Cup to speed up their preparations for the event. ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat told representatives of the Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh cricket boards during a meeting in New Delhi this week that they needed to fast track preparations that are running 10 months behind schedule. The joint World Cup committee met formally for the first time since it was formed in June 2007. "The ICC had advised us to go into overdrive," Saleem Altaf, the director-general of the Pakistan board, told Reuters on Friday. "The budget for the World Cup would be approved next year in June." Altaf said the ICC would also be contacting the respective governments to discuss a common visa for World Cup visitors. "They want a common visa like the one issued for the last World Cup in West Indies in 2007," he said. India is due to host 22 matches, including the final of the tournament, with 14 matches in Pakistan, nine in Sri Lanka and six matches. Pakistan and Sri Lanka will host the semi-finals while Bangladesh will host the opening ceremony
