 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  A private company is set to operate the country's first aviation academy to coach aspiring pilots, flight engineers and cabin crew from Bangladesh and South Asia, say its directors. Aviation Academy Limited will be run by two retired pilots of Biman Bangladesh Airlines, who are hopeful of starting operations in December. "We have already got approval for the academy to be initially located within buildings of Zia International Airport," managing director SM Nasimul Haque told bdnews24.com on Saturday. Claiming the academy will be a first ever, not only in Bangladesh but in South Asia, Haque said: "We will welcome both domestic and foreign students, providing them training as pilots, flight engineers, cabin crew and for other aviation jobs." "We are aiming to eventually set up as a full-fledged university," he added. Bangladeshi students will eventually be able to find work abroad after being trained by the 'world-class' academy, said Haque, who is a former president of Bangladesh Airlines Pilot Association. Another former BAPA president, Monwar Hossain is chairman of the company, while two other directors are architect Rafique Mazhar Islam and businessman Ehteshamul Haque. Nasimul Haque said foreign trainers would be employed to teach the most up-to-date aviation technology. "We also have plans to buy aircraft to this end." "The new academy will offer to train up staff of foreign airlines as well as national and private domestic airlines," said Haque. At present there is only one aviation school, the Flying Club, in Dhaka. There was another, the private Air Parabat, which closed its doors some years ago. bdnew
