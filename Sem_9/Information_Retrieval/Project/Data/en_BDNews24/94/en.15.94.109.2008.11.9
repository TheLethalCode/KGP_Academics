 NAGPUR, India, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Debutant off-spinner Jason Krejza took two wickets in two balls to claw Australia back into contention in the final test against India on Sunday. Krejza, who claimed a record eight wickets in the first innings, dismissed Vangipurappu Laxman (4) and Saurav Ganguly first ball to revive Australia's hopes of a series-levelling victory as India reached tea on 166 for six. First-innings centurion Sachin Tendulkar was run out for 12 in the last over before the interval after being sent back by Mahendra Singh Dhoni (3 not out). India led by 252 after an aggressive 92 by opener Virender Sehwag had put them in control of the match but they lost six wickets for 50 runs in the session to give Australia hope. Medium-pacer Shane Watson got the ball to reverse swing and sent back debutant opener Murali Vijay for 41 and a struggling Rahul Dravid for three. Fast bowler Brett Lee, placed on a drip on Saturday to counter the effects of dehydration caused by a virus, dismissed Sehwag to peg India back. India are eying their first test series victory over top-ranked Australia in seven years. The hosts won the second test at Mohali by 320 runs to go 1-0 up in the four-match series. The other two matches were drawn. Australia are bidding to avoid their first series defeat since their 2005 Ashes tour of England. Watson broke the first wicket stand when he had Vijay lbw with a delivery that came back in sharply. Lee had Sehwag caught behind down the leg-side with a short pitched delivery to raise Australia's hopes of a fightback. Dravid's poor form continued when Watson forced him to edge behind with a delivery that straightened. India lost their next three wickets in the space of three runs. Krejza bowled Laxman with a big-spinning off-break that hit leg-stump after pitched outside off. He caught and bowled Saurav Ganguly, playing his last test innings, with his next ball after the Australians had applauded the left-hander on his way to the creas
