<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  South Africa sealed the three one-day international series with a match to go after they drubbed Bangladesh by a massive 128 runs at Willowmoore Park in Benoni on Sunday. Bangladesh were all out for 230 in 49.2 overs after South Africa racked up 358 for eight, riding on a maiden century from opener Hashim Amla. Except the 22-ball 41 knock from opener Tamim Iqbal, it was the same old essay for the Tigers, who never looked as competitive as in the tour's first match. Tamim fell to Dale Steyn in the fifth over but not before an entertaining innings, in which the opener sent fierce pacer Steyn over the rope once and struck three successive fours before giving a catch to JP Duminy in the same over. The left-handed batsmen also smacked pacer Johann Louw for four fours in the previous over. The defeat-margin could have been bigger had Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Abdur Razzak not added 53 off 45 balls for the ninth wicket. Mashrafee fired a 22-ball 34, studded with four fours and two sixes, while Razzak remained unbeaten on 20 off 30 balls that included two fours and one six. Off-spinner Johan Botha rattled the top-order removing Imrul Kayes (14 off 39 balls), Mohammad Ashraful (5 off 11 balls) and Junaed Siddique (47 off 82 balls) with an impressive three for 27. Steyn wrecked the middle grabbing three for 48 while Louw and both Morkels chipped in with one wicket apiece. Earlier, opener Amla struck a sparkling 140, and put on two 100-run partnerships with captain Graeme Smith and one-down Jacques Kallis as South Africa racked up their highest total against Bangladesh. South Africa's earlier best against Bangladesh was 301 for eight in the first ever one-day international between the two sides in Potchefstroom in October 2002. Bangladesh paid dearly as Amla, dropped on 15 by Mashrafee off Syed Rasel, smacked four sixes and eight fours off 135 balls. Strike pace duo Mashrafee and Rasel exploited the overcast conditions to get some movements until the fifth over with South African scoreboard reading only 12 runs for no loss. But, then fit-again Graeme Smith and Amla turned the things around on the flat wicket. They effortlessly put 136 for the opening stand as Bangladeshi bowlers failed to keep on the early momentum. However, the things could have been a bit different had Mashrafee not dropped Amla. Ashraful introduced Razzak in the 11th over intending to slow the run down, but the left-arm spinner had virtually no impact on the left-right combination. Off-spinner Naeem Islam brought the breakthrough for the visitors, having Smith caught by Ashraful, but by then the South African openers laid a sold foundation from where others took the match away from Bangladesh. Smith, who sat out five one-day internationals for South Africa due to elbow injury, marked his return with a well-composed 65 off 66 balls studded with six fours and one six. Amla then paired with Kallis to add exactly 100 runs for the second wicket before Kallis fell to Razzak for run-a-ball 49 that included four fours and one six. The bearded opener soon followed Kallis to be caught at deep mid-wicket by Rasel off Mashrafee, leaving the side at 263 for three in 42.4 overs. AB de Villiers quickfired an unbeaten 54 off 27 balls hitting four sixes and two fours while Albie Morkel fired a 13-ball 37 including three sixes and as many fours to take South Africa beyond 350-mark. bdnews24.
