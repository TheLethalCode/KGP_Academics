<TITLE> Democrats to fall short of super Senate majority: aides </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats appear certain to fall short in Tuesday's elections of obtaining a US Senate majority big enough to clear Republican procedural hurdles that can kill legislation, senior party aides said. The aides said Democrats will likely gain at least six or seven seats, but not the nine needed to hit a "filibuster-proof majority" of 60 in the 100-member chamber. Still, aides said they expect a big enough Democratic majority to pressure Republicans to negotiate more and block legislation less often.
