<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's main opposition National Party looked set to topple the ruling Labor government in Saturday's general election, the latest count showed. With 25 percent of the vote counted, the center-right National Party led by former foreign exchange dealer John Key had 48 percent of the vote, which would translate to 62 seats in the 122-seat parliament. The center-left Labor Party, which is seeking a fourth three-year term, had 32 percent of the vote, translating to 41 seats. The Green Party is on 6 percent, and National's committed ally the right-wing ACT Party on 3.5 percent. If National maintains its current share of the vote, it would be able to form the next government with the help of the ACT and United Future parties, who have already pledged support. Under New Zealand's proportional voting system, a party must win 5 percent of the nationwide vote or a local electorate seat to be represented in parliament
