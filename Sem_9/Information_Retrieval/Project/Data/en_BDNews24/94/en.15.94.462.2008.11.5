 Dhaka, Nov 04 (bdnews24.com) A Bangladesh delegation, led by foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, left for Yangon late Tuesday night on a mission to resolve the crisis over Myanmar's oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. "I will meet my Myanmar counterpart and other senior officials to convey that Dhaka wants immediate withdrawal of the vessels and infrastructures from the disputed waters," Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com before his departure. The high-powered delegation, which includes top Navy officials, left Dhaka on a Singapore Airlines flight at 11.55 pm, said Eliza Sharmeen, officer-in-charge of immigration at Zia International Airport. The Hossain-led delegation will try to resolve the dispute sparked when reclusive Myanmar last week began offshore oil and gas exploration in the waters claimed by both countries. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters at his office Tuesday that the delegation would "try and defuse the current situation". The area, believed to hold huge reserves of natural gas, lies some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island, and is claimed by both Bangladesh and Myanmar. According to an agreement reached at maritime boundary talks earlier this year in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Myanmar committed not to carry out oil and gas exploration until the two countries demarcated their sea borders. A technical team from Myanmar, headed by a deputy minister, will arrive in Dhaka to continue the sea boundary talks on Nov 16 and 17. bdn
