 MOSCOW, Wed Nov 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev threatened on Wednesday to station new missiles near Poland's border in response to US plans to deploy an anti-missile system and proposed extending the presidential term to six years. In his first annual address to the nation, he defended Russia's war with Georgia, appealed to nationalism and attacked Washington's "selfish" foreign policy and "economic blunders" which he said caused the global financial crisis. "To neutralise -- if necessary -- the (US) anti-missile system, an Iskander missile system will be deployed in the Kaliningrad region," Medvedev said, referring to a Russian enclave that borders Poland, a member of the European Union. "Naturally, we are also considering using for the same purpose the resources of Russia's navy." Russia would electronically jam the US system, parts of which are due to be deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, and Moscow would scrap plans to stand down three Cold War-era nuclear missile regiments, the president said. Medvedev's 85-minute address also included surprise proposals to extend the presidential term from four to six years, lengthen legislators' terms by a year and make it easier for small parties to win parliamentary representation. These groups, which are among the most critical of the government, were eliminated from the legislature under the eight-year rule of Medvedev's predecessor, Vladimir Putin. The president did not say whether the extended term would apply to himself or to the next president to be elected in 2012. Political analysts have speculated that Putin, who stepped down earlier this year as president after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the constitution, may return in 2012. He is now prime minister and remains powerful. CRITICISM OF UNITED STATES One day after Barack Obama won the U.S. presidential election, Medvedev reserved his harshest criticism for the United States, blaming its "selfish" foreign policy for Russia's brief war in August with Georgia, a U.S. ally. "The conflict in the Caucasus was used as a pretext for sending NATO warships to the Black Sea and then for the forceful foisting on Europe of America's anti-missile systems, which in its turn will entail retaliatory measures by Russia," Medvedev said in his speech, broadcast live on television and radio. The war with Georgia over the rebel region of South Ossetia was "among other things, the result of the arrogant course of the U.S. administration which hates criticism and prefers unilateral decisions," Medvedev said. Speaking in the Kremlin's ornate white-marbled St George's Hall to around 1,000 parliamentarians, top government officials, religious leaders and journalists, Medvedev linked the war in Georgia to the global financial crisis. Both began as localised events but took on broader significance. "We will overcome the consequences of the world economic crisis and will come out of it even stronger than we were," Medvedev, who took office in May, said to applause. But the financial and Caucasus crises also showed the need for fundamental reform of global institutions, he added. "The lessons of the mistakes and crises of 2008 have proved to all responsible nations that the time has come to act, and it is necessary to radically reform the (international) political and economic system," the president said. Russia's war with Georgia handed Moscow a quick military victory but a serious defeat with international investors, who dumped Russian assets in a selling spree that made the stock market one of the world's worst performing this year. Medvedev was defiant over Moscow's intervention in Georgia. "Our people are spiritually and morally rich, we have things we can be proud of, we have things to love and protect and we have things we can aspire to. For these reasons, we will not step back in the Caucasus," he said to applause. GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS Although Russia's heavily-indebted oligarchs have been hit by the financial crisis, the Kremlin has played down the impact on the wider economy and said repeatedly it originated in the United States -- a point the president made again on Wednesday. "Inflating the cash bubble to stimulate their own growth, they not only made no effort to coordinate their actions with the other participants in global markets but also neglected the elementary sense of proportion and did not listen to repeated warnings from their partners," he said. Medvedev, who trained as a lawyer before his career in public life, emphasised in his speech what he said were Russia's key values -- freedom, democracy, fairness and the rule of law. Putin listened to his protege from the front row of the audience, flanked by the leaders of both houses of parliament and the Russian Orthodox Church leader, Patriarch Alexiy II. Yeltsin introduced the address to the nation in 1994, shortly after he had crushed a rebellion by parliament and held elections to the State Duma, in an attempt to restore his authority as a national leader
