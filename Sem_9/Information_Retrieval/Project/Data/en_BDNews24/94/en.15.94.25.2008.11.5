 SAO PAULO, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil's stocks rallied on Tuesday as a surge in commodities boosted Petrobras and Vale, while Brazilian banks charged higher for a second day on speculation of more sector consolidation. Brazil's currency BRBY, the real, strengthened 3.1 percent to 2.102 per dollar on a generally upbeat mood in the country's financial market. Sao Paulo's main stock index, the Bovespa .BVSP, jumped 5.7 percent to 40,427.16 points. Banking stocks soared one day after Itau agreed to take over smaller rival Unibanco. State-run Petrobras jumped 8.5 percent to 25.11 reais and mining giant Vale gained 5.8 percent to 27.8 reais benefiting from rallying commodity prices.

Analysts say the deal could put pressure on Bradesco, long the largest private-sector bank in Brazil, to pursue acquisitions in a bid to hold on to the No. 1 ranking among non-government banks. "Yesterday's deal was unexpected and we expect it to be followed by further moves. We see Bradesco and Banco do Brasil as those likely to move next," brokerage Bulltick Capital Markets said in a note. Banco do Brasil shares rose 9 percent to 15.61 reais. Brazilian pulp producer Aracruz climbed 8.4 percent to nearly 2.97 reais after said it had closed most of its exposure to toxic foreign exchange derivatives with a group of banks at a loss of $2.13 billion.
