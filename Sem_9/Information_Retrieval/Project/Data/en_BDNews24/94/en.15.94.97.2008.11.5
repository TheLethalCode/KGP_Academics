<TITLE> United looking to join Barcelona in knockout stage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Manchester United can join Barcelona in the knockout stage of the Champions League with victory at Celtic on Wednesday, while Bayern Munich and Arsenal also have a chance to qualify for the last 16. Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw at home by Basel on Tuesday but both the Primera Liga leaders and Sporting Lisbon went through after the Portuguese side beat Shakhtar Donetsk. A win for Manchester United would send them through with two games to spare if AaB Alborg fail to beat Villarreal in Denmark and a draw would be enough if the Spaniards win. Bayern, who head Group F on seven points ahead of Lyon on five, travel to third-placed Fiorentina, who have two points. In Group G, injury-plagued leaders Arsenal will go through if they beat last-placed Fenerbahce at the Emirates but will miss striker Emmanuel Adebayor and defenders Emmanuel Eboue and William Gallas, who are all out with injury. Nine-times European champions Real Madrid welcome back striker Ruud van Nistelrooy and defender Pepe from injury to help avenge their 2-1 defeat at Juventus two weeks ago when they play the Italians at the Bernabeu
