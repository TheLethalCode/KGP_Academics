 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile phone networks across the country will be shut on the general election day to make the polls free, fair and beyond "influence", an election commissioner says. "The mobile phone network will be closed from morning to evening to bar anyone with wrong intentions during voting on the day," M Sakhawat Hossain told journalists on Friday. He oversaw a training session for divisional commissioners of the Election Commissioners on electoral rules at the EC Secretariat in the capital. Hossain added they will sit to finalise the issue. He called on the divisional commissioners to take extra care so that no aspirant was deprived of candidacy for tiny mistakes during scrutiny of nomination papers. EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir said teachers from educational institutions under government's monthly pay order (MPO) will be eligible to vie in the parliamentary election slated for Dec. 18, but not for the Upazila election. He said the aspirants having defaulted on payment of utility bill could file nomination by pay last three-months' bill. According to new electoral law, utility bill defaulters will be ineligible for elections if they do not pay the outstanding telephone, gas, electricity, water, or any other bill of any service-providing organisation of the government at least 15 days before submission of nomination. bdnews24.
