<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club returned to the winning ways with a 2-1 home win over title contenders Sheikh Russel KC in the crucial B. League match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. The third win in five matches took Mohammedan to 11 points, four behind archrivals Abahani Limited, who have played a match more than the Black-and-Whites. With the first defeat in seven matches, Sheikh Russel, who had surrendered their lead to Abahani, remained on 14 points, second in the 11-team table. Coach Maruful Haq chose Mohammad Sharif to play as a defensive midfielder by compromising his five-man backline. Mohammedan, held 1-1 by Brothers Union in the previous match, called the shots in the first half with Nigerian striker Bukola Olaleken coming close in the 11th minute. Defender Nasir Hossain cut the ball from the touchline to Olaleken, who got into a nice position but fired wide from the eight yards. Sheikh Russel, who came into the match on the back of a 3-0 thrashing of struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad in their previous game, seemed a bit disorganised in the face of Mohammedan attack. They came close to hitting the target on the 16th minute when winger Tanvir Ahmed played a nice one-two with Moroccan striker Touati Youness down the left. But he sent a Youness chip over the Mohammedan crossbar from the edge of the eight-yard box. Mohammad Robin put the Motijheel-based outfit ahead in the 35th minute but the young striker seemingly surprised after scoring his fifth goal in the league. Nasir drove a low-cross from the left with the Sheikh Russel defenders standing still and Robin just turned the ball into the far net to give Mohammedan an unexpected lead. Three minutes from the breather, Sheikh Russel keeper Khaled Azam Biplob thwarted a towering Saikat header off an Aram Aziz free kick. Olaleken, fed by a back-heel from Robin, fired at the side netting in the stoppage time when a calm tap was needed with goalkeeper Khaled Azam Biplob down. The Nigerian striker, however, did not disappoint his side as he doubled the Mohammedan lead just a minute into the second half. Snatching a ball from Russel defender Jahirul outside the box, Olaleken ran into the danger zone to hammer a powerful shot that was parried by Biplob. But the Mohammedan striker drove the rebound nicely home. Two goals down, Sheikh Russel pressed hard in the latter part and got the dividend in the 77th minute, though Mohammedan's defender Saikat had a hand in Russel's goal. Capitalising on a pass from Touait, veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed advanced into the box to lash a powerful shot that was denied by Mohammedan goalkeeper Aminul Haq, but the ball finally found the back of the net with a deflection from defender Saikat
