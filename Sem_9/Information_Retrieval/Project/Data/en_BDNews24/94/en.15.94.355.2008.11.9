 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)TThere will be no pay hike for civil servants anytime soon. The next elected administration will implement the seventh Pay Commission's recommendations on salaries and allowances of government officials and employees, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said on Sunday. "The National Pay Commission 2008 formed to re-adjust salary structures is working at the moment," he said to reporters after a meeting with Canadian high commissioner Robert McDougal at his planning ministry office on Sunday. "The commission was given a six month time period," he added. The seventh Pay Commission, with three full-time and nine part-time members, was formed on Aug. 31 with former finance secretary Mustafizur Rahman as its chairman. It was tasked with making specific proposals to readjust salaries and allowances for government officials and employees in line with inflation. Dispelling the possibility of a delay in the commission's report, with the chairman currently abroad, Azizul said other members would continue the work. The last pay scale for government officials and employees was made effective in Jan. 2005. Earlier. National Pay Commissions were formed in 1996, 1989, 1984, 1976 and 1972. bdnews24.
