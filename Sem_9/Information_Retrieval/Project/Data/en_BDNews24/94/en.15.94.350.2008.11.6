 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Individuals have until Nov. 12 for filing income tax returns under an extended deadline, the National Board of Revenue says. The NBR has extended for a third time the date for submission of income tax return for the current tax year. The last date for submission of income tax return by the taxpayers of individual category was Thursday In a press release Thursday evening, it said the deadline had been extended on requests by different chambers, organisations and agencies. The press release said the extension will also be applicable to the self-assessment taxpayers of the individual category. "Over four lakh taxpayers submitted returns, from which the government netted Tk 700 crore up until Wednesday," Mohammad Abdul Mazid, the NBR chairman, said. He said on Thursday only two lakh taxpayers submitted their income tax returns. He hoped this year the government would earn more than the previous year's Tk 739 crore. The annual Sept. 30 deadline is normally extended each year; this year the NBR initially stretched it by another month to Oct. 31 and then again to Nov. 6. Last year the government extended the deadline twice up to Nov 30. Mazid said income tax laws allow an individual some days over the official deadline to file returns, by appealing to the officials of the tax zone concerned. He stressed, however, that the tax payer must show "valid cause." bdnew
