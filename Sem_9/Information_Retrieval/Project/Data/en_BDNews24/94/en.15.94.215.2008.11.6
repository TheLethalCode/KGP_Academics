 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission has warned Awami League over violation of the Election Code of Conduct. In a letter to AL, the EC said the party had allowed election-related publicity during the citywide reception, involving tens of thousands of AL supporters, for party president Sheikh Hasina on her return to the country Thursday morning after five months abroad. EC deputy secretary Mirhir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com the EC requested the AL to refrain from such activities to create a congenial atmosphere for the ensuing 9th parliamentary election. The EC sent the letter in the afternoon to the party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue, addressed to AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam. However, Ashraful told bdnews24.com: "I did not receive any such letter." Signed by Sarwar Morshed, the letter said the reception in reality turned into an electoral campaign, before the scheduled period for campaign, which was a violation of the election code. The EC said coloured posters for potential party candidates were on view and processions carried the party's electoral boat symbol. The letter cited Rule No 12 of the code: "No political party registered with the EC, or person nominated by the party or any independent candidate or anybody seeking vote on behalf of him can start election publicity earlier than three weeks before the election." The EC also mentioned traffic jams throughout the city caused by the motorcade for welcoming Sheikh Hasina on her return. bdnews24.com/ m
