<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has urged the garment industries to raise the salary and allowances of the workers in line with the dearness allowance of the civil servants. He made the call while inaugurating the Bangladesh Apparel and Textile Exposition (Batexpo) at Hotel Sonargaon on Thursday. "The workers are the driving force of the production-oriented industries. The factories and the workers are complementary to each other. "The government always tries to protect the interest of the workers. The government has already taken a number of steps including fixing minimum wage through tripartite talks. But in many cases allegations of depriving the workers of their just dues surface. Violent incidents also happen over this." To the owners, he said, "Most of the female workers of garment industry come from extremely poor families in the villages. They come to towns with the hope of getting a little better-off. We should give minimum attention to those who are providing you and us comfort. "In the backdrop of dearness allowance announced for the government officials and employees from July, I think an increase in the wage and allowance of the garment workers is logical." "All have to be sincere about paying wage and allowances to the workers in time and consider ensuring their benefits." He spoke about the crisis in the world economy. "The crisis has both risks and potentials for us. It is our main task to see how to turn risks into potential." "The government and the private sector will have to work together." "Two main markets of the readymade garment are the USA and Europe. We have to identify what loss Bangladesh may face due to ongoing crisis in the world economy. "The government is observing the world situation with much importance. It has already formed a committee," Fakhruddin said. Making a call for expanding export market the chief adviser said, "Alongside the USA and Europe we will have to search for new markets. The government will provide all cooperation in this regard." He said his administration ensured trade and business, and unhindered production in mills and factories. "The much awaited national election is only a few days away. We hope that the next elected government would be able to continue the present trend of trade and commerce. If industries are not set up and trade and commerce expanded, employment will not be created, the target of poverty alleviation would fail." "The current stable condition has to be maintained at any cost. The businessmen and entrepreneurs will have to take effective steps so that mills and factories do not close without reason, production is not stopped and people's earnings are not hampered." "You have an important role in bringing a qualitative change to politics. Now you will have to discharge that responsibility properly." Bangladesh Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) organised the three-day exposition. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez and first vice president MA Salam were, among others, present at the launch. This is the 19th edition of exposition. "The 19th BATEXPO exposition has been organised amid crisis in the world economy. This crisis has brought us both risk and potential. We want to go ahead taking advantage of the potentials," the BGMEA president said. He suggested formulation of 15-year plan for development of garment industry, solving the power crisis, lowering the interest rate and charges on bank loan, expansion of Chittagong Port and setting up of an alternative port, uplift of Dhaka-Chittagong highway to six-lane and implementation of their 10-point charter of demands. German Technical Corporation (GTZ) cooperated in organising this year's expo. Some 70 organisations from India, Hong Kong, Thailand, China, Pakistan and Bangladesh are taking part in the expo. Alongside display of commodities, seminars on impact of the world economic crisis on the garment sector, recent changes in garments business trends, increase of goods production, and quality and design are being held. bdnew
