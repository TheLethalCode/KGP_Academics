<TITLE> Unfair elections will worsen crisis: Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sumon Mahmud Chief Political Correspondent Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)In what appears to be a call for boycott, BNP chief Khaleda Zia has appealed to all to avoid what she termed was an unacceptable election in the offing. "I appeal to all to avoid the path to an unacceptable election," she told reporters at her Gulshan office on Wednesday evening. The former prime minister read out a statement to the media at around 8:30pm prior to a meeting with her four-party allies. "An unacceptable election could worsen the (current political) crisis in the country. The general elections are due on the Dec. 18, for which nominations close in just eight days. "The present crisis has to be overcome through a free and fair election. "The government and the Election Commission and all concerned have to be gracious and open (to negotiations), burying past mistakes." Khaleda's statement appears a snub to the government's recent attempts at reaching accord with BNP. The other major party, Awami League, has said it is all for the parliamentary polls, with party chief Sheikh Hasina saying they will go to the polls even if the BNP does not. Khaleda said there were a bundle of mistakes over the past two years and malice was prevalent which afflicted herself and her family heavily and also the country. She called for shunning the path of malice, something she never believed in. "Things will be dealt with properly and legitimately in future, no matter who did what," she promised. Khaleda asked for pragmatically addressing issues by maintaining peace, stability, solidarity and unity in order to protect the country and the people. "The country's sovereignty and transition to democracy is being threatened," the former prime minister apprehended. "The economy broke down and the people were in a shambles." Khaleda asked the people to ignore the differences and get united. After the briefing she walked into the next room to meet the four-party alliance leaders. bdnews
