 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  An already tense situation on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border appeared to deepen on Sunday evening with Bangladesh deploying additional security forces, according to officials and witnesses. They said the situation flared suddenly, though it had been relatively "normal" earlier in the day despite Bangladesh Rifles being on alert in the Naikkhangchhari border area. "The situation suddenly began to change in the evening," said Taslim Iqbal Chowdhury, Naikkhangchhari correspondent of Dainik Purbokon. A number of witnesses also said they saw the Bangladesh Army take position at the border. However, they could not estimate the number of army personnel. At neighbouring Ramu upazila, in Cox's Bazar, UNO Nabab Asram Habib said he heard of extra security forces deployed in his area. The UNO met with neighbouring upazila chairmen and members at the Naikkhangchhari BDR zone headquarters, causing speculation among locals. But Asram said the agenda of meeting was local matters. Tension flared between Bangladesh and its southwest neighbour last week over Yangon's oil and gas exploration activities in disputed waters of the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles south of Saint Martin's Island. The area is claimed both by Bangladesh and military-ruled Myanmar. bdnews24.com
