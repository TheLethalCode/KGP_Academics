<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has said she has forgiven all but not forgotten anything in an apparent crack at the so-called pro-reform leaders of her party. Zillur Rahman, who had stood in for Hasina while she was in jail and abroad, requested her to forgive mistakes, if any, during her absence. Hasina replied that she has born to a political family and had seen many political ups and downs. She said Awami League was her family and family members could make mistakes. The former prime minister said the party would have to solve all its problems from within and no 'outsider' could be engaged here. Presidium member Abdur Razzak placed his "personal reform proposal" before Hasina on June 30, 2007. Two days later, colleague Tofail Ahmed proposed reforms that said one cannot continue in the president and general secretary's post for more than two consecutive years. The prime minister will have to leave the post of party president, the proposal said. bdnews
