 Dhaka, Nov 06 (bdnews24.com)  The European Commission's core team, which will assess the easing of the emergency and recommend whether to send the polls observation mission to Bangladesh, arrives on Friday, says its ambassador. The head of the EC delegation in Dhaka, ambassador Stefan Frowein, on Thursday said the commission's external relations commissioner, on the basis of the core team's report, would decide about sending a full observation mission by the next two weeks. He made it clear that the EU polls observation mission would not come if " conducive conditions for fair polls" were not guaranteed. "The decision is [a step-by-step process] and the core team comes tomorrow. Sending a full European Union election observation mission will depend upon the assessment of these people," Frowein told reporters at a press conference at Hotel Sonargaon. Eight of the nine members of the core team will reach Dhaka on Friday while its leader would arrive two days later, he said. Frowein said 12 of the 40 long-term observers would also come to Bangladesh in middle of the month. The EC mission head said the government's decision to withdraw army and lift restrictions on the media was very "significant and a positive step" for the restoration of people's rights. "The withdrawal of the army was very positive development that came two days ago. It is a significant step to show that they are not deployed anymore everywhere in the country. "Following the substantial easing of the state of emergency that took place this week, our headquarters are reflecting on whether the conditions are now in place for the full redeployment of observation team," the ambassador said. The EU earlier urged the government to restore the civil and political rights to all its polls observation mission to monitor the Dec. 18 general election. "If the legal and practical circumstances conducive to free, fair and credible elections are not in place on the ground, the EU will refrain from wholesale observation," warned Frowein. The commission cancelled its polls observation mission ahead of the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan. 11 last year. The EU sends short-term, long-term and core observation missions to monitor polls. It has never sent missions to observe polls under emergency. Again, the EU has never suspended polls observation mission excepting Bangladesh. Terming Bangladesh's emergency "different from others", it had told the government to either lift or relax the emergency to restore some civil and political rights to convince the EC commissioner to send polls observation teams. bd
