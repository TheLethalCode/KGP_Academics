<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Wednesday alleged the government was making moves to see a "particular party, group" in power. "We neither can accept nor participate in the staged election," Delwar said addressing a discussion organised by BNP's student front Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal to mark the 'National Revolution and Solidarity Day' on Nov 7. "We must vow to resist the blueprint of setting up a 'rubber-stamp' parliament and a 'toy-government' through the election by uniting the whole nation." Delwar said being a pro-election party BNP wanted to take part in the next general election. So, he asked the government to "leave the conspiracy of keeping BNP out and create a congenial atmosphere [for election]". Delwar reiterated that a free and fair election could not be held under the emergency. "We want an election like '91, '96 and 2001 elections". He accused the government of not living up to any of its pledges it had promised BNP in the dialogue. Today's context is reminiscent of the perspective of Nov 7, 1975, it is even more frightening with people's freedom and democracy at stake, Delwar said. Presided over by JCD president Azizul Bari Helal, the discussion was also addressed by former VC of Dhaka University Prof Emaj Uddin Ahmad and former energy adviser to BNP government Mahmudur Rhaman. bdnew
