 Potchefstroom, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com) - For the Bangladesh team Wednesday's International Pro20 match against South Africa at the Wanderers in Johannesburg was another lost opportunity as they conceded the game by 13 runs after being well placed to chase down 122 in 14 overs. The Tigers were going great at 65 for two in the seventh over before the batsmen gave it away. Bangladesh lost three wickets for 5 runs in six balls and slipped to 70 for five. They then saw another three batsmen getting out within 9 runs when they went for big shots towards the end. The result has somewhat changed the conception of locals that the home side would just roll over the tourists and people spotting the Tigers have been heard saying "you should've won that that game". "Obviously we are disappointed. We had a very good scope to start the tour on a winning note but handed the game to South Africa. We tried to slog when proper cricket shots and scoring at a run a ball would have taken us home easily," said captain Mohammad, according to a report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Ashraful who was nevertheless optimistic about the remainder of the tour with the first of three ODIs starting at Senwes Park tomorrow. "This was probably the fifth game on the trot where we had the opposition on the run. We are getting close and that's a very positive sign. We had created a winning situation in the last ODI in Australia, we beat New Zealand in one game and could have won the next two matches also. We barely lost the first Test against the Black caps," said Ashraful who however lamented the failure of the batsmen to take advantage from some fantastic effort by the bowlers. "Yesterday we did not field to our usual standards but still the bowlers managed to bring us back in the game. We are consistently doing well in bowling and fielding and it is about time the batsmen did their job." Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak was the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers with outstanding figures of four for 16 from three overs, the best effort by a Bangladeshi in T20 cricket. Razzak thought there will be encouragement for the spinners on this tour. "Everyone is talking about the fast bowlers but I liked the wicket at the Wanderers which had a bit of turn. Our spinners had an impact and also did Johan Botha who took a couple of crucial wickets. If you bowl a good line and hit the right length then it is not easy to get the spinners away," said Razzak. Ashraful said that confidence and self belief was very much in evidence in the dressing room. "We are a confident side and we believe that if we play to our potential in all three departments then it is possible to win matches on this tour," said the Bangladesh captain adding that the near misses of late have been down to inexperience. "You have got to remember that ours is a very young side. Probably inexperience is one of the reasons why we are not being able to give the finishing touches but these are talented boys and already we are seeing signs that they are learning," said Ashraful. The Tigers left Johannesburg in the morning for Potchefstroom and following an hour and 45 minute's bus ride reached Senwes Park which is inside the Potchefstroom University campus. The North West Province city is one of the hottest areas of South Africa and is also industrially rich where steel and cement industries abound. Senwes Park is a homely venue with a lush and quick outfield. The pitch has a hard surface which is totally devoid of grass and it all points to a free-scoring day-nighter if the batsmen get going. The Bangladesh team first completed their practice session under the scorching sun before journeying another 45 minutes to reach their hotel at Klerksdorp. For tomorrow's opening game of the series Bangladesh have left out Mehrab Hossain Jr., Nazmul Hossain and Mahbubul Alam from their 12. Paceman Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, who missed the T20 match due to a sore back bowled in the nets to prove his fitness. Meanwhile, South Africa's opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs has been sent home after breaking a team curfew on Tuesday evening. He will take no part in the three-match ODI series. The hosts are also without captain Graeme Smith for tomorrow's match as he is recovering from an injury. The match starts at 2pm local time (6pm Bangladesh Standard Time). Bangladesh (12): Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Imrul Kayes, Mushfiqur Rahim (Wicketkeeper), Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (Vice Captain), Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel and Shahadat Hossain. South Africa: Johan Botha (Captain), Jaques Kallis, AB de Villiers (Wicketkeeper), Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, JP Duminy, Johann Louw, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Justin Ontong and Dale Steyn.
