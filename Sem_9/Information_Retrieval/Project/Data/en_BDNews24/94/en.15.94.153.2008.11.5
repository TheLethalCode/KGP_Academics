<TITLE> Airline stocks down as Continental warns, oil jumps </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of major US airlines fell on Tuesday, the morning after Continental Airlines Inc said it expects domestic revenue per available seat mile to rise only 4 to 6 percent in November, citing softer yields and a weaker economy. JP Morgan airlines analyst Jamie Baker said in a note to clients this was below Continental's recent "low-to-mid teens" guidance for November. Also hurting airline stocks on Tuesday was a rise in oil prices, which climbed above $68 a barrel after industry sources said Saudi Arabia had made substantial cuts in crude supplies. "Frankly, it was only a question of when, not if, the global economy would catch up to the U.S. airline industry -- though we readily admit we thought we had another month or two before the inevitable would manifest," said Baker. Continental shares were trading down about 9.5 percent at $18.51, Delta Air Lines Inc fell about 4 percent to $11.09, American Airlines parent AMR Corp slipped about 2.5 percent to $11.02 and United Airlines parent UAL Corp slumped about 6.5 percent to $15.50
