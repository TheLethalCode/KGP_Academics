 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has ordered former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain to jail after his surrender in the Barapukuria graft case. Judge Amar Kumar Roy of the Special Court-2 rejected his bail prayer on Sunday and ordered the BNP leader to jail. The Anticorruption Commission filed the Barapukuria coalmine case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of causing losses to the state of Tk 158.71 crore through irregularities in management of the mine. ACC deputy director Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges on Oct 5 against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Mosharraf, arrested on Feb 8 last year, also faces charges in the Niko and GATCO graft cases. He was released from jail on Sept 23 this year on bail. The Supreme Court upheld his bail order on Oct 21 in the Niko case. bdnew
