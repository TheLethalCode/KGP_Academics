 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Heavy gridlock brought morning rush-hour traffic to a standstill on Thursday as supporters in their tens of thousands lined the streets to welcome Sheikh Hasina back home. Main roads from the airport, through Kalyanpur, Shyamoli, Dhanmondi and including Bijoy Sarani, Farmgate, Banglamotor, Shahbagh, Gulistan, Paltan, Motijheel and Ittefaq intersections were clogged by chanting Awami League supporters, lined up along the route fixed for Hasina  from Zia International Airport to her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi. Cars, buses, autorickshaws, rickshaws and motorcycles stopped in their tracks on the main route and connecting roads, frustrating thousands of office-goers and others members of the public. The party planned the massive welcome reception for their leader, ensuring AL supporters, by some estimates lakhs, were gathered on the route. Sania Siraj, who works with an NGO, called bdnews24.com to tell of her trial in reaching her Dhanmondi office from Mirpur. She said it took her two and a half hours because of the processions of AL supporters. bdnews24.com correspondent Muhsinul Karim said public transport and private vehicles were either stuck or taken off the streets altogether, compelling commuters to walk many kilometres in some cases to their destinanitons. Other reports from Uttara up to Kakrail intersection said crowds of morning office-goers were seen on foot. CNG-run three-wheelers and rickshaw pullers were reluctant to ferry their fares through jammed roads, adding to the commuters' sufferings all the more. Fahmida Farzana, said the jams were so intense that her bus stalled on the street for almost an hour. Mahbuba Akter was stranded in the congestion for about two hours on her way to her office at Kalabagan from Kuril Biswa Road. Hasina, the former prime minister, reached her Sudha Sadan home Thursday noon, returning to Bangladesh ahead of elections after five months in Europe and America. bdnews24
