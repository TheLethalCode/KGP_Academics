 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Thursday said they, like the people, want elections right away . He said the prime task of the government or the Election Commission is to conduct a fair and credible election. "The people want election right now and so do we.

"There was no corruption during the Jatiya Party government, the succeeding governments were corrupt," he claimed. The JP chairman said his party was ready to field candidates in all 300 candidates but would reconsider the matter if they joined an electoral alliance.
