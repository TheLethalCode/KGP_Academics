 NAGPUR, India, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh restored India's ascendancy on the fourth day of the final test against Australia on Sunday after off-spinner Jason Krejza took two wickets in two balls. At the close Australia, who need to score 382 in their second innings to square the series, were 13 without loss in their second innings. Dhoni scored 55, his second fifty of the match, and Harbhajan reached 52 to guide India out of trouble after debutant Krejza had dismissed Vangipurappu Laxman (4) and Saurav Ganguly first ball. The pair added 108 for the seventh wicket as India reached 295 all out in their second innings after exploiting Australia's decision to use part-time bowlers to lift the over rate. Krejza, who claimed eight wickets in the first innings, took four in the second for a match analysis of 12-358. By using part-time bowlers Mike Hussey and Michael Clarke for 10 overs and giving leg-spinner Cameron White his first bowl of the innings instead of his fast bowlers, Ponting eased the pressure on India after they were 166 for six at tea. The stand between Dhoni and Harbhajan helped India recover after they lost six wickets for 50 runs to give Australia hope after opener Virender Sehwag had scored an aggressive 92. Ponting, who has already been fined twice this year for slow over rate, was faced with a possible one-match for repeated offence slow over rate. "I don't think for one second that Ricky hasn't pressed for the win," coach Tim Nielsen told a news conference. "At the end of the day he's got the responsibility to bowl the overs he has to bowl." Medium-pacer Shane Watson got the ball to reverse swing and sent back debutant opener Murali Vijay for 41 and a struggling Rahul Dravid for three. GANGULY DUCK Fast bowler Brett Lee, placed on a drip on Saturday to counter the effects of dehydration caused by a virus, dismissed Sehwag to peg India back after they had got off to a 116-run start. First-innings centurion Sachin Tendulkar was run out for 12 in the last over before tea interval after being sent back by Dhoni. Watson broke the first wicket stand when he had Vijay lbw with a delivery that came back in sharply. Lee had Sehwag caught behind down the leg-side with a short pitched delivery and Dravid's poor form continued when Watson forced him to edge behind with a delivery that straightened. India lost their next three wickets in the space of three runs. Krejza bowled Laxman, playing in his 100th test, with a big-spinning off-break that hit leg-stump after pitching outside off. He caught and bowled Saurav Ganguly, playing his last test innings, with his next ball after the Australians had applauded the left-hander on his way to the crease. Ganguly became only the second cricketer after England's Billy Griffith to score a century in his first test innings and a duck in his last. Krejza had Dhoni caught at silly point by Hussey and Watson took two wickets in his final spell including Harbhajan to finish with four wicket
