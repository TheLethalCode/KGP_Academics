<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP will observe Friday as the 'National Revolution and Solidarity Day', while some other political parties will observe it from different historical perspectives. Awami League will observe the day as a 'Black Day' to commemorate the killing of the freedom-fighter soldiers and the Jatiyatabadi Samajtantrik Dal will observe it as 'Civil-Military Revolution Day'. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will formally inaugurate the day on behalf of her party by placing wreaths at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman in the morning. She will later address a rally marking the day in Chittagong. The other BNP programmes include hoisting party flag atop party headquarters and a discussion in the afternoon at the Institution of Engineers auditorium in Dhaka. Khaleda and party secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain gave separate messages on the occasion. BNP associate Jatiyatabadi Muktijoddha Dal in a press briefing on Thursday urged the government to reinstate the 'Nov 7' as a public holiday. Its president Sohrabuddin, vice-presidents Syed Harun, Abul Hossain and others spoke at the briefing. On Nov. 28 last year, Fakhruddin Ahmed-led interim government scrapped the Nov. 7 as public holiday that comes into effect from this year. The day had been observed as public holiday since 1976 but the practice was halted by the Awami League government in 1996. Later, the day was re-established as public holiday in 2001 when the BNP-led four-party coalition government came to power. bd
