<TITLE> South Africa's Gibbs to miss series for breaking curfew </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Herschelle Gibbs will miss South Africa's one-day international series against Bangladesh after breaking a team curfew, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Thursday. Gibbs broke the curfew before Wednesday's Pro20 match against Bangladesh in Johannesburg, although he looked in fine touch during the game, hitting four fours in an over and scoring 18 off 10 balls. "Herschelle's behaviour is unacceptable in the context of team discipline," national coach Mickey Arthur was quoted as saying in a CSA statement released on Thursday. Gibbs will miss the three-match series at a time when he was under pressure to keep his place in the national side. The statement said the 34-year-old would also have to undergo an alcohol rehabilitation course. "We are not trying to punish Herschelle but rather to help him," Dr Mohammed Moosajee, the team manager, said. "He has been under a lot of pressure lately, notably from the publicity surrounding his recent divorce. It is clear that he has developed a problem that needs to be addressed." Gibbs has a history of ill discipline, having been banned for six months in 2001 for accepting money to under-perform in the Hansie Cronje match-fixing saga. Later that year he was one of six South African cricketers fined for smoking marijuana on a tour of the West Indies. Last year he was banned for three games for making racist comments to the crowd, and received a fine and three-match ban for staying at a nightclub in Cape Town until after 2am ahead of one-day match against Australia in 2000
