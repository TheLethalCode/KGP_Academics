 NEW DELHI, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf brushed aside concerns over his international future after joining the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL). Yousuf, 34, surprised the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) by abruptly leaving for India after being named on Monday in a squad to play three one-dayers against West Indies in Abu Dhabi. PCB operations director Zakir Khan said on Tuesday Yousuf would be banned from all cricket in Pakistan if he played in the unofficial Twenty20 competition. "I know I can't play for Pakistan," Yousuf told a news conference on Wednesday. "I want to play, but the decision is up to them (PCB). Whatever, my performance shows I can play all forms of cricket. "(For the) last one year, I've not played tests," he added referring to the refusal by other teams to tour Pakistan because of security concerns. ICL organisers had filed a legal case for breach of contract after Yousuf, who signed up last year, tried to switch to the official Indian Premier League. ICL officials said they were now withdrawing the case. "I made a mistake so I have come back," Yousuf said. "I didn't talk to the PCB chairman." Pakistan's premier batsman has played 79 tests, scoring 6,770 runs at a superb average of 55.49, with 23 centuries. Yousuf will play for the Lahore Badshahs team led by his former skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq in the ongoing ICL competition
