<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina does not require to seek bail as she has been cleared of charges in the Noor Ali extortion case, her lawyer Shafik Ahmed says. "There is no need to extend her parole too, she is free now," the lawyer told bdnews24.com after Hasina returned home on Thursday. "She will not face any barrier to leading the party and contest the elections now," the lawer added. The former prime minister was cleared of charges in the extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali after the police submitted a final report on Wednesday. The report found no proof to back up allegations against Hasina. The AL chief has secured bail in all other cases and the High Court ordered the government not to arrest or harass her in Niko and barge-mounted power plant cases. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year and the government paroled her on June 11 after she was excused from personal appearance at court. She flew to the United States the next day to seek medical treatment. bdne
