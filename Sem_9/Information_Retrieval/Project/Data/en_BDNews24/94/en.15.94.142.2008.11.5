<TITLE> Pay more taxes: finance adviser </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam on Wednesday called on the tax payers and the affluent to ease the debt on the next generation by paying more taxes. "Forty to 60 percent of national income of a developed country comes from revenue collection, while in Bangladesh it is barely 11 to 12 percent, compelling the government to borrow from foreign and external sources, stacking debts on to the next generation," the adviser said. He urged those who could afford it especially to pay taxes, so the government could provide all necessary services to the people. Mirza Aziz was addressing a ceremony to honour the district-level highest VAT-paying institutions at Osmani Memorial Auditorium in the city. He said the VAT system, on production and investment, is now popular across the globe as a revenue collection method. "Revenue dependency on duty is decreasing in all countries including Bangladesh, as it is not always easy for the government to identify eligible income tax payers. On the other hand, it is easy to identify the VAT paying institutions and consequently collect." At the ceremony, a total of 67 district-level institutions, clear of paying duty, income tax and VAT and not in debt to the government, were awarded with crests and certificates in production, service and business categories. Among others, the National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid and one of the award recipients Rahim Uddin Bharosa, owner of Aziz Biri Factory in Rangpur, spoke on the occasion. Abdul Majid said the national-level highest VAT payers would be similarly awarded soon. bdnews2
