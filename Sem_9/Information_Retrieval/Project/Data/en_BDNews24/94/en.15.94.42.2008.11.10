 Abuja, Nov 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Sunday it had released a Ukrainian and three Nigerians kidnapped in the Niger Delta two months ago, but was still holding two Britons. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) confirmed late on Sunday that it had freed four of the hostages seized by gunmen from an oil supply vessel on September 9. The captives were among 27 oil workers MEND said it "rescued" from their initial kidnappers in early October. The group has released two South Africans and 19 Nigerians. "The remaining two British nationals will be kept with us until the government of (British Prime Minister) Gordon Brown stops offering training and materials to the Nigerian armed forces," the group said in an e-mailed statement. A Nigerian military spokesman said it was investigating the report but could not confirm the hostages' release. The British government said in July it would send military experts to Africa's most populous country to help train Nigerian soldiers in the delta, the heart of the OPEC member's oil industry. Nigeria's President Umaru Yar'Adua took office 18 months ago promising to bring stability to the delta, but has had little success and has sought help from overseas. Militants, who say they want more development and a better living environment after decades of neglect, launched a campaign of violence against the oil sector in early 2006, cutting Nigeria's oil production by about one-fifth. MEND said the two British hostages were also being used as leverage for the release of its suspected leader Henry Okah, on trial for gun-running and treason in the central city of Jos. "We also intend to tie their freedom to such a time when the insincere Nigerian government allows Henry Okah his freedom to attend to his failing health," the group said. A Nigerian judge last month adjourned Okah's trial to allow checks on whether he was healthy enough to face the charges. His lawyers and family say the 43-year-old needs treatment for a kidney ailment. bd
