 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, on her return to Dhaka after five months, has said only an elected government can rescue the country from crisis, and national elections must go ahead as scheduled on Dec. 18. "The election should be held on the declared date. It cannot be foiled or deferred by any conspiracy," Hasina told a press conference at Zia International Airport's VIP lounge immediately after she landed back home Thursday morning. "We don't want politics that is full of violence. We don't believe in that kind of politics. We want peace. We want to remain united. We want to give people their confidence back," said the former prime minister. "None but an elected government can rescue the country from the present crises." "People are passing their days in hardship. They do not have any work to support themselves. They are frustrated by their sufferings." Hasina asked all to have patience "through the country's hard times". The AL chief was hopeful that her party would win the election. "If Awami League comes to the power prices of all essentials will be cut down to within the purchase power of ordinary people," she said. She termed poverty the great enemy. "We have to alleviate poverty. All of us will have to work jointly to save people from that curse." On the possibility of the two leaders meeting across the table for a 'qualitative change in politics', Hasina said: "We will do all possible to save people from hard times." Asked her reaction on parties threatening to boycott elections, the AL chief said: "If people are able to cast their ballots properly, it will not matter which party participates in the election or not." On the AL's reconstitution of an electoral 'grand alliance', she said: "The grand alliance will be formed. Enemies of the people, country and its independence will not be included in such an alliance." The AL had earlier said that it would ratify all positive reforms of the present caretaker government. Asked about the party's present stance on this, she said: "The issue will have to be settled in parliament. Such ordinances must be transformed into law first. The public representatives will decide on that." The AL chief thanked her party adherents, lawyers, journalists and other professionals for their support. Hasina's long-time rival, BNP chief and ex-PM Khaleda Zia appeared close to calling for a boycott of the election on Wednesday, on the other hand, saying "an unacceptable election could worsen the crisis in the country." "I appeal to all to avoid the path to an unacceptable election," she told reporters at her Gulshan office. While Hasina's Awami League has begun its electoral preparations at full tilt, Khaleda's BNP has yet to decide on joining the general election on Dec. 18 - pressing certain demands along with its allies before they will even consider joining, they say. According to the polls schedule, announced on Nov 2, the last date for submission of nominations is Nov. 13. bdnews
