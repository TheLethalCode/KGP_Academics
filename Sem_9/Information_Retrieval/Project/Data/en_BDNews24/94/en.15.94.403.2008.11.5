 GAZA, Wed Nov 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas fired dozens of rockets at Israel on Wednesday after Israeli forces killed six Palestinian militants in an eruption of violence that disrupted a four-month-old truce along the Gaza frontier. The rocket attacks, which included salvoes that landed in the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon, caused no casualties. Sources in Hamas, an Islamist group that runs the Gaza Strip, said calm could return if Israel did not retaliate. A breakdown of the Egyptian-brokered Gaza truce would pose yet another challenge to US efforts, opposed by Hamas, to achieve a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. Egypt has been working to extend the ceasefire beyond its agreed six-month duration and, in conjunction with other Arab countries, to reconcile Hamas and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction at a summit in Cairo next week. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives in the region on Thursday amid few hopes Israel and Abbas can meet Washington's target date of an agreement this year. US President-elect Barack Obama has said resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be a priority for his administration. On Tuesday, Israeli airstrikes killed five militants and Israeli soldiers shot dead a gunman during an incursion into the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces quit the coastal enclave in 2005 and Hamas seized the territory from Fatah two years later. The Israeli military said the aircraft went into action after militants attacked soldiers who entered the Gaza Strip to destroy a tunnel that Hamas had planned to use to kidnap Israeli soldiers. Militants from Hamas and several other militant groups tunnelled into Israel from the Gaza Strip in 2006 and seized Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who is still being held at a secret location in the territory. Hamas has offered to release him in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians in Israeli prisons, including militants who killed Israelis. Israel has not agreed to the terms
