 LOS ANGELES, Thu Nov 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Geeks save the date: NBC Universal has finalized plans to auction props, costumes and set pieces from Sci Fi Channel's concluding cult-favorite `Battlestar Galactica.' The company has booked a weekend at the Pasadena Convention Center for the auction, coinciding with the return of the show on January 16. The auction is one of the most elaborate events ever planned around the conclusion of a TV series, with fans flying in from around the world to stay in area hotels to bid on "BSG" items. Plans include a preview day, panels with various designers on the series, two auction days, an online auction of 200 items and then weekly auctions of additional items thereafter to coincide with the final batch of "Battlestar" episodes airing on Sci Fi Channel. NBC Universal has embraced fan auctions in the past year as a way to offset rising production costs. A portion of the auction's proceeds will benefit United Way. Items up for bid include space ship props, the desk used by Admiral Adama (Edward James Olmos), and six to 12 costumes from each major character, including a red dress worn by Caprica-Six (Tricia Helfer)
