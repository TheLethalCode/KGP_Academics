<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bikalpadhara president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury said his party discussed seat sharing with Awami League ahead of nominations for parliamentary elections, though the party has yet to decide whether to join the AL-led 'grand alliance'. "It will be decided through discussion and we also have to consider the interests of other parties in the Awami League-led alliance," he said, briefing reporters at his party's central office at Topkhana in the city on Tuesday. B Chowdhury reiterated his stance in favour of partial emergency for peaceful holding of the elections, adding that army should also be deployed during the polls. Speaking of personal security, Badruddoza said he deserved SSF protection as a former president. Asked how many seats he would demand of the AL-led alliance, B Chowdhury said: "Bikalpadhara has local organisations and leaders in more than half of the 300 constituencies." He said his party was not sure if they would join hands with the 'grand alliance', but "we are in regular contact," he added. "Once we decide to join the 'maha jote' , we will ask for the seats where we have prospects for a win," the Bikalpadhara chief said. He rejected any idea of joining the four-party alliance, saying: "It embodies anti-liberation forces and we have ideological conflicts with them." Party secretary general Abdul Mannan told the briefing that distribution of nomination papers among the prospective candidates would start on Wednesday. Short-listed candidates would submit nomination papers on Nov 11-12 through interviews due on Nov 8-9, he said. bdnew
