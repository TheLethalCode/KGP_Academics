 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government submitted reports on toxic melamine in foreign powdered milk brands to the High Court on Sunday, with a court order due on Monday. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam examined the reports and heard all the parties on a writ petition by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights organisation. The Court asked for the reports on the melamine tests in the powdered milk on Nov. 6. Deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil submitted the report to the court, saying: "The government sent samples of powdered milk to Thailand for tests. Melamine was found only in three brands of powdered milk." He submitted reports on melamine tests by Dhaka University, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Thailand, BSTI and Plasma Plus to the court. Advocate Manjil Morshed for the human-rights organisation, Jalil on behalf of the state, barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud for Nestl, barrister Tania Amir for Dano and advocate Mahmudul Islam for Diploma and Red Cow were heard in court. Advocate Manjil Morshed suggested a retest of the powered milk in Europe since the test reports available are not uniform. He further said the government did not acknowledge the Atomic Energy Commission's finding of melamine in seven brands. He said harmful quantities of melamine were found in eight brands by Dhaka University test and three brands in tests by BSTI and labs in Thailand. Melamine was also found in others, but in small quantity, he said, adding that those are not free from the toxic substance that pose health hazard. Barrister Mahmud said no melamine was found in Nestl and the previous court order on the government to stop the sale and display should be revoked. Barrister Amir said there was no melamine in Dano and so, the High Court order on it should be withdrawn." On Oct. 3 the High Court instructed the government to take quick steps to stop sale and display of of Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1 and 2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Enlene. bdne
