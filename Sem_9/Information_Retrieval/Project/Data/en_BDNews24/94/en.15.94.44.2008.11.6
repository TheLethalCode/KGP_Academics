 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has asked for Tk 188 crore to hold the upcoming ninth parliamentary and third upazila elections, and seeks another Tk 150 crore to ensure law and order. The proposed budget includes Tk 91 crore for Jatiya Sangsad elections and Tk 97 crore for Upazila polls, an EC official told bdnews24.com. EC secretary Humayun Kabir sent the separate proposals, for JS and UZ poll expenses, to the ministry of finance on Thursday to release the sum allocated for election expenses in the FY 2008-9 national budget. An amount in the region of Tk 150 crore, for law enforcement agencies, will be finalised and submitted once the timing and extent of security deployment is ascertained. EC officials said owing to a jump in commodity prices and a remarkable increase in number of voters since the last parliamentary polls in 2001, the current budget allocation for conducting elections is Tk 425 crore, including law enforcement. There will be 37,500 polling centres, 188,000 booths and 600,000 election officials in the upcoming polls far outnumbering previous elections. Deputy secretary of the EC Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com the commission was following the norms to get the proposed money released. Deputy secretary Syed Khurshid Anwar informed bdnews24.com that proposed UZ polls budget was higher than the JS polls as the number of polling centres at upazila level would exceed that of the national level. The eighth parliamentary elections, held in 2001, cost Tk 74 crore, with the election expenses totalling Tk 32 crore and law enforcement costing Tk 42 crore. Budget allocation for the ninth JS elections, scheduled for January 2007, that were later cancelled was approximately Tk 250 crore. The upcoming JS and UZ polls are due on Dec 18 and Dec 28 respectively. bdnews
