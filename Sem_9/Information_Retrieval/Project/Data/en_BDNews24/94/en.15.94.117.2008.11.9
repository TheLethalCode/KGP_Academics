 Hong Kong, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com) - England lifted the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes trophy for a record fifth time on Sunday after the most dramatic finish in the tournament's history. They ended the Cup final tied with Australia on 121 runs but won because they lost fewer wickets. Australian batsman Stephen O'Keefe was narrowly run out attempting a second run that would have given his team victory. "We like leaving it late but that was outstanding," said England's Tim Bresnan, who bowled the final over. "I don't think any of us have ever been involved in a final like that, played in front of such a fantastic crowd and with a tie at the end." England looked hot favourites to lift the Cup after blasting 121 for 1 off five eight-ball overs in the final of the showpiece event at the Kowloon Cricket Club. Darren Maddy (32 retired) and captain Dimitri Mascarenhas (31 retired) led the run blitz before Jonathan Trott weighed in with 23 not out. Tournament rules state a player must retire on reaching 31 although he is allowed to return if one of the last pair of batsmen is out. But Australia came out firing in their reply with David Warner (35 not out) and Michael Hill (31 retired) leading the way. At 120 for two, they needed two from the last two deliveries but allrounder John Hastings skied a catch to wicketkeeper Trott. With two still needed from the final ball, the luckless O'Keefe straight drove for a single but was run out as he came back for the second, leaving Australia stranded on 121 for 4 and sparking wild English celebrations. "All credit to the Australian side, they fought hard and our bowlers really kept us in it," said Mascarenhas, who also won the Ben Hollioake Trophy as Player of the Tournament. "It was a great tournament, we had quite a few close games throughout the competition." As well as the Sixes trophy, England also collected the winners' cheque for US$88,000. It was their fifth victory in the tournament after previous successes in 1993-94 and 2003-04. While disappointed to lose, the young Australian team could reflect on a tournament in which they won a lot of friends. "We were confident the whole way through the run chase but Bresnan bowled a fantastic over at the end," said Hill. "Congratulations to England and congratulations to him personally because he bowled really well. "We can take away a lot of positives from this weekend and hopefully we can come back next year and have another crack at it." England and Australia qualified for the final after finished top and second respectively in the four-team Cup Group on the second day of the tournament. Hong Kong, victors over the All-Stars and holders Sri Lanka on Saturday, were unable to repeat those heroics on Sunday. They lost all three of their Cup Group matches against South Africa, England and Australia but could hold their heads high after winding up fourth  their highest ever finish in the tournament. Pakistan won a thrilling Plate final with a three-run victory over the All-Stars. Shivnarine Chanderpaul needed a six off the final delivery to win it for the All-Stars but was unable to come up with the required big hit. The All-Stars proved hugely popular with fans and batsman Justin Langer said the Sixes had been a memorable experience. "It's a fantastic tournament," said the great Australian opener. "There's a lot of excitement, the crowd get into it and the players really enjoy it. It's been a brilliant weekend." The Hong Kong Cricket Sixes is fully sanctioned by the International Cricket Council and is the sport's longest-running, best-established and most high-profile sixes tournament. Players who have taken part over the past 16 years include Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar, Steve and Mark Waugh, Viv Richards, Andrew Flintoff, Adam Gilchrist and Wasim Akram. The tournament is organised and promoted by the Hong Kong Cricket Association's commercial arm, China Cricket International Limited. The HKCA's proceeds from the Sixes will be ploughed directly back into cricket development in Hong Kong
