 OBAMA, Japan, Wed Nov 5,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The sleepy Japanese fishing town of Obama went wild on Wednesday as locals gathered to celebrate namesake Barack Obama's victory in the US presidential election. More than a hundred residents gathered to watch the vote count on television in a public hall in the middle of the day, and chanted "Obama, Obama!" as the result was announced on a news programme. Some were clad in hula costumes in honour of Obama's birthplace in Hawaii. Others showed up wearing "I love Obama" T-shirts. The town has taken advantage of the name -- one of many named Obama, or "small beach" in Japanese -- to launch products from fish burgers and steamed cakes to chopsticks. Buoyed by the victory, locals say they hope Obama, who once mentioned the town in a television interview, will visit. "The next thing we want to do is to go to the White House and dance the hula at Obama's inauguration ceremony," said Tatsuya Sano, 45, who runs a souvenir shop selling locally made Barack Obama souvenirs. Chikako Shimizu, 35, the leader of an "Obama Girls" hula dance group launched this year, said she was calm while watching the vote count on television because she had no doubt Obama would win. "I was convinced that he would win. I couldn't be happier," she said. Obama City residents plan to dance and party more in the evening
