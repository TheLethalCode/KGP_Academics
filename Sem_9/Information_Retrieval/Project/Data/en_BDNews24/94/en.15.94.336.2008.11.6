 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) - The tax return deadline for individuals will come to an end on Thursday, with tax offices open until 9.00pm, the NBR chief has said. "Over four lakh taxpayers submitted returns, from which the government netted Tk 700 crore, upto Wednesday," said the National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid. He hoped this year the government would earn more than the previous year's Tk 739 crore. The annual Sept 30 deadline is normally extended each year; this year the NBR initially stretched it another month to Oct 31 and then again to Nov 6. Last year the government extended the deadline twice up to Nov 30. Abdul Mazid said that income tax laws allow an individual some days over the official deadline to file returns, by appealing to the officials of the tax zone concerned. He stressed, however, that the tax payer must show "valid cause." bdnews24.c
