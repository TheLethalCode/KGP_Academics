 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  There was more corruption in the country during the five-year term of the BNP-led alliance government, says the Truth and Accountability Commission. "We learnt this during our work," the commission's chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan told a weekly briefing on Wednesday. He said 337 people had applied so far to the commission for clemency. "Among them 265 are government officials, just one is a politician, 14 are business people, 31 wives of government staff and 16 others." Of the 337 that sought mercy 19 sought clemency personally, 141 through the Anticorruption Commission, 167 through the National Coordination Committee for prevention of serious crime and the remaining 10 through court proceedings. Hearing on 231 mercy-seekers had concluded, he said. "Some 82 of the applicants have so far received clemency," said Justice Rahman. Some Tk 13.96 crore has been deposited to the government treasury against a total of nearly Tk 26.17 crore expected. "The rest is in the pipeline," he said. Rahman said the commission had also served notice on 17 named government officials asking them for explanations over graft allegations that surfaced the hearings of the 231 applicants.
