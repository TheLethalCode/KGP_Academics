 LAMONGAN, Indonesia, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indonesian official denied on Saturday there were any factors delaying the execution of the Bali bombers, as relatives of two of the Islamic militants left their home village to seek a final prison visit. Indonesia does not announce the specific date or time of executions, but the attorney general's office has said the three militants -- Imam Samudra, Mukhlas and Amrozi -- would be executed in early November for their role in the nightclub bombings six years ago, in which 202 people died. Officials said the men, now in isolated cells in Nusakambangan prison island in central Java, will be executed simultaneously on the same island by firing squads. Some media reports suggested weather conditions may have delayed the execution on Friday night. But Jasman Pandjaitan, a spokesman for the Attorney General's office, denied there was anything holding up the execution. "There are no technical problems delaying the execution," said Pandjaitan, adding officials on the ground would decide the timing. Security has been tight in Indonesia in the past week as some analysts fear a hardline backlash if the executions go ahead. There have been a number of threats made to foreign embassies and against Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and other officials in recent days. Muhammad Chozin, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, told reporters their youngest brother and a Muslim cleric had left their home village in Lamongan district near Surabaya in East Java early on Saturday in a bid to make a last visit. State news agency Antara said the family representatives also included Amrozi's two wives and daughter, Mukhlas's two wives and another brother. Chozin said the family representatives wanted to bathe and shroud the bodies after the execution, because authorities had said the family would only be allowed to bury the men once the bodies were flown to their home villages. "But the police said, according to security procedures, the bodies should not be tampered with by anyone," Chozin said. In an interview with Reuters late last year, the militants said they had no regrets, except for the fact some Muslims died in the blasts. The attacks by the Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI) were intended to scare away foreigners as part of their drive to make Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, part of a larger Islamic caliphate. The two blasts on Bali's Kuta strip on Oct. 12, 2002 dealt a severe blow to the island's tourist industry, although also led to Indonesia cooperating more deeply with the West on tackling the threat from Islamic militants
