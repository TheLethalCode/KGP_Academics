 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com) - Top leaders of the BNP-led four party alliance met on Wednesday night to decide whether to participate in the election, they said. "The meeting is being held to decide whether the alliance will participate in the election, as the government did not live up to any of its pledges to the alliance even after the announcement of the poll schedule," alliance member Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif told bdnews24.com from the meeting. The alliance's second meeting since BNP chief Khaleda Zia's release on Sep 11 began at 8:40pm, BNP office secretary Razvi Ahmed said. Just prior to the meeting, Khaleda gave a statement to the press appealing "to all to avoid the path to unacceptable elections." It appeared to be a snub to the caretaker government's recent attempts to reach an accord with her party. Although rival party Awami League has begun its electoral preparations in full swing, the four-party has said it is yet to decide on joining the general election on Dec 18. BNP's highest policy-making body, its standing committee on Tuesday urged the government to meet its seven-point demand including lifting of emergency to create a favourable environment for elections. The polls schedule was announced on Nov 2, fixing the last date for submission of nominations on Nov 13. Jamaat Islami amir Matiur Rahman Nizami, Islami Oikya Jote chairman Fazlul Haq Amini, Khelafat Majlish amir Mohammad Ishaq and Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Barrister Andalib Rahman were attending the meeting. BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain, Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojahid and other alliance leaders were also present. bdnews24.
