<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League has told the Election Commission it has no problem with the schedule for general election but asked it to stave off the Upazila election for a month. It also asked the EC to allow the defaulting borrowers to adjust their outstanding dues until the last day of the submission of nomination papers for the parliamentary election. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam briefed reporters on the meeting with the top polls officials at the EC Secretariat at 6pm on Wednesday. "We have discussed with the EC the impact of holding the two elections at the same time , which is why we want the Upazila election to be held a month after the general election," Ashraful said. The borrowers, he said, would barely get the chance to repay the outstanding loans since they had too little time since the schedule was announced on Nov 2. "The commission sincerely heard the proposals." Registration to the non-partisan election observers and formulation of a code of conduct for mass media was also discussed in the meeting, he said. The Awami League had also demanded printed voter list, instead of CDs, for the candidates, Ashraful said. "There will be more meetings and the AL stance on the emergency will surface on the future agenda." He added that dialogues with the government and the EC would continue until the elections. "We only listened to them but did not say anything. Let's see what we can do," election commissioner Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com. AL presidium members Tofail Ahmed, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Suranjit Sen Gupta, Motia Chowdhury, Abdur Razzaque, Amir Hossain Amu, and the party's election coordinator Hossain Toufique Imam also attended the meeting bdnews24
