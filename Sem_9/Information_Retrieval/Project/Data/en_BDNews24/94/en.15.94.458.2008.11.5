 BREMEN, Germany, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Panathinaikos revived their hopes of a place in the Champions League knock-out phase when a ruthless second-half display earned them a 3-0 win away to Werder Bremen in Group B on Tuesday. Vangelis Mantzios made it 1-0 with just under an hour gone, Giorgios Karagounis lashed in a perfect half-volley for the second and Alexandros Tziolis made certain when his first-time shot on the rebound wrong-footed goalkeeper Tim Wiese. It was a first win of the campaign for Panathinaikos, who have four points from four matches and move ahead of Werder, who drew their first three games. Inter Milan are top of the group with eight points and Anorthosis Famagusta are second on five. Werder had controlled the first half, enjoying the better chances and looking well capable of improving on the 2-2 draw they managed when the two sides met in Athens last month. They almost took the lead when Diego sent in a swerving free kick and Claudio Pizarro's flick header forced a fine point-blank save from Mario Galinovic. Mesut Ozil caused the visitors problems down the left and Diego ran the game through the middle but the strikers could not find the finishing touch and Panathinaikos punished them when Mantzios turned two defenders before sliding in a low shot. Werder pushed forward in search of an equaliser but they were rocked again when Karagounis beat Wiese with a wonderful strike from the edge of the box. The home side were by now in defensive disarray and the result looked beyond doubt even before Tziolis leapt on a block from Per Mertesacker and made Wiese look foolish with his snap shot
