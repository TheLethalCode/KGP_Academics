 Rangpur, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  A one-day sports carnival titled 'Sports for all', as part of district-wise initiative to revive traditional rural games, concluded in Rangpur on Wednesday. Organised by Rangpur DSA and sponsored by Bangladesh Olympic Association with the International Olympic Committee, the one-day sports festival was held in the district for the underprivileged who do not have the opportunity to participate in sports. But there were hardly such people to be found at the two-hour fiesta at the Rangpur Zila School grounds Wednesday. School going children from the town mostly participated in traditional sports likes bouchi , chasing cocks, sack races, thread and needle races, blindman's bluff, pole climbing, among other, seeming almost like an inter-school competition. However, some older participants were seen in the kabaddi meet "reliving" their childhood memories. Samsul Alam, who represented the district kabaddi team for nine years, was one of the players. Recalling past games, Alam said: "There were so many spectators back when I used to play, but ha-du-du has been losing its popularity due to lack of support." He hoped that the game would be revived again through the 'Sports for all' initiative. Before the competitions, a parade of school children starting at Rangpur Town Hall ground went around the town before ending at the sports venue. The organisers said they had a huge reception in the three upazilas of Mithapukur, Badarganj and Cowniya, where the people of all ages and backgrounds took part in the sporting festivities. The upazila-level festivals on Tuesday hosted events such as ha-du-du, daria bandha , boat races, bullock cart races, horse and carriage races and fishing competitions. With support from BOA, Sylhet will host the next carnival on Nov 16 followed by Comilla in the first week of December. The BOA will host this one-day sports carnival in all 64 districts over the next five years, with respective districts subsequently holding the festival annually. Rajshahi divisional commissioner Hafizur Rahman Bhuiyan inaugurated the meet, with BOA CEO and director Col (retd) Wali Ullah present among others. bd
