 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com) - BNP's highest policy making body was meeting Tuesday evening, in the follow-up to the announced election schedule, with party chairperson Khaleda Zia presiding over the meeting at her Gulshan office. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com the standing committee meeting began at around 8.15pm. It is the fourth meeting of the BNP standing committee since Khaleda Zia was released on Sept 11. Top four-party alliance leaders are scheduled to hold a 'summit meeting' on Nov 5, in the wake of the Election Commission's announcement of the schedule for upcoming elections. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain had expressed frustration at the time over Sunday's High Court verdict in favour of the EC's demarcation of parliamentary seats, which cleared the way for announcement of the polls schedule. BNP and its allies called an emergency secretary general meeting, immediately after the chief election commissioner's televised announcement of the schedule on Sunday. A subsequent meeting between BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and the secretaries general of the four-party alliance ended inconclusively after running late into the night. bdnew
