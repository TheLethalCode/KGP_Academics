Since then, Brown has won praise internationally and at home for a 400-billion-pound ($632.4 billion) package of loans and guarantees to prop up the financial sector. "With Gordon Brown interest rates are at a record low, helping hard-working families ...

The election was held on Thursday as the Bank of England slashed interest rates by 1.5 percentage points to their lowest level in more than half a century and when the International Monetary Fund forecast that Britain would suffer a deeper recession than leading industrial rivals next year.
