<TITLE> Obama to hold first news conference on Friday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Nov 7(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President-elect Barack Obama will hold his first news conference on Friday after a meeting with his team of economic advisers, an aide said on Thursday. The meeting in Chicago will include top advisers who worked with Obama on the campaign and comes as the president elect works on putting together his cabinet following his election on Tuesday. Just two days after winning a decisive victory in Tuesday's elections, Obama is moving ahead with his transition to the White House. With the financial markets falling sharply and more dismal economic news expected for Friday, Obama is likely to want to move forward quickly on naming his economic team. The aides did not say if any major announcements or appointments would be made at the news conference. Obama is expected to issue a statement on Thursday discussing some of his plans for the upcoming week. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will also travel to Washington early next week to meet President George W. Bush at the White House, the aide said. Obama has spoken to Bush, and Michelle Obama spoke on Wednesday to Laura Bush about the role of the first lady and asked her for guidance in preparing, aides said.
