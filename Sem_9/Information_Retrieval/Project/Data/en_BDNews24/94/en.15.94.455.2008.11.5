 Washington, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats expanded their US Senate majority on Tuesday but failed to beat one of their top targets, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Riding a wave of resentment against Republican President George W. Bush, Democrats had a shot to reach a Senate majority of 60, the number needed to clear Republican hurdles for their first filibuster-proof majority in three decades. But with McConnell and at least two other targeted Republicans holding onto their seats, Democrats faced a steep challenge to achieve this lofty goal. By picking up four seats with more than dozen Senate contests yet to be decided, Democrats had increased their majority to 55 of the Senate's 100 seats, and figured that they would get at least a few more. "Sixty is kind of arbitrary to a certain degree. You just want to get it as close as possible," said Andrew Taylor, a political scientist at North Carolina State University. Overall 35 Senate seats were up for election, 23 held by Republicans, the others by Democrats. Many of the races involving seats held by Republicans were seen as competitive. All 435 House seats were up for election. Democrats now control the chamber, 235-199 with one vacancy. MSNBC projected that Democrats would increase their majority to 261-174. Democrats said if they get close to a 60-seat Senate majority, they figure they will be able to win over a couple of moderate Republicans to clear a number of procedural hurdles. While Republicans over the past two years routinely blocked Democrats efforts on matters from expanding health care to ending the Iraq war, Taylor said, "Republicans will have to think strategically about when they'll have to filibuster" in the new Congress that convenes in January. Two former Democratic governors, Mark Warner of Virginia and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire won seats held by Republicans, retiring Sen. John Warner and Sen. John Sununu, respectively. In addition, Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina, wife of 1996 Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole, was unseated by Democratic state senator Kay Hagan. And Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Udall won the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico. Along with McConnell, Sens. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Susan Collins of Maine fended off fierce challenges and won, according to network projections. If Barack Obama also prevails, the new Congress that convenes in January should be able to keep a long list of campaign promises. They include ones to withdraw U.S. troops from the Iraq war, roll back tax cuts for the rich and move to end the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. But regardless of how many seats Democrats pick up, record federal deficits and the poor state of the economy will limit what they can do. Democrats would likely have to limit or postpone any big new spending programs, such as ones to expand health care, upgrade education and advance renewable energy technology. Among the senators who easily won re-election was Democratic Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware. But if Obama wins the presidency, Biden will have to give up his seat since he will become the new vice president. Republicans, who lost control of Congress in 2006, have been hurt this year by the unpopularity of President Bush and presidential nominee John McCain's inability to rally support in states that have traditionally backed Republicans.
