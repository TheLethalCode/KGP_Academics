"We have been building up public opinion in favour of the trial of war criminals. But the present government despite having all scope did not start trial of war criminals. It is very sad. We are frustrated at it," Bangladesh Liberation War Sector Commanders Forum president retired air vice marshall AK Khandker said. He was speaking at a poster and cartoon exhibition organise to demand the trial of the war criminals" at Rabindra Sarobar on Friday. "We urged the chief election commission not to give registration to Jamaat-e-Islami as a political party. But Jamaat has been given registration," Khandker, deputy chief of the liberation forces in the 1971 war, said. "We will ask the public throughout the country not to vote Jamaat candidates. Whereever they contest we will urge the people not to vote them." "As per constitution, trial of the war criminal is possible under the existing laws of the country. The UN secretary general during his visit to Bangladesh also assured his cooperation on the issue. "Even so the government did not take initiative.
