 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Grameenphone on Sunday said it signed agreements with ten institutions to raise Tk 4,250 million in private placements from the capital market. The country's largest cell-phone operator by subscription said in a press release that it would issue 425 bonds, each valued at Tk 10 million, in two tranches  one with a 540-day term and the other with a 720-day term. "Grameenphone will be able to contribute to a meaningful development of the Bangladesh capital market by introducing new debt instruments and creating more awareness in the domestic market," said its CEO Anders Jensen. "A placement of this kind will provide the bond market of the country a much-needed boost and pave the way for other companies to explore this new avenue of financing," he said. "All the bonds will carry an interest rate of 14.5% per annum. The bonds will be unsecured and non-convertible. "The bonds will not be listed in any of the bourses but a free transferability structure will mean the instruments can easily be bought and sold over the counter," the company said. The bonds, alternative sources of funding, are the first of their kind in the country's capital market. GP and the bonds have both been rated as "AAA" by the Credit Rating Agency of Bangladesh (CRAB), which is the highest credit rating given by CRAB. Citibank N.A. Bangladesh is the arranger and placement agent for the transaction. A private placement is the selling of unregistered securities, either stocks or bonds, to qualified institutional investorsinvestment companies, pension funds, and insurance companies. The cost of a private placement is much less than a public offering, because the securities do not have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Grameenphone has moved to look beyond the conventional bank loan structure and into the capital market in the form of issuing a debt instrument to meet its funding needs. Grameenphone says it will invest the proceeds of the bonds in capital expenditure to improve the infrastructure of the company. It will also use the proceeds to prepay a portion of the company's short-term debt. In addition to raising capital, the company believes the move will help reduce the liquidity risk and better match the profile of the company in terms of asset liability maturity. Last month, GP said it missed the deadline for listing on the capital market because of the ongoing global financial meltdown, and the public offering will not be brought to market before March. Companies in the US raised more money through deals involving private placements than initial public offerings 2006, demonstrating how issuers are shying away from the scrutiny and expense of the US public market. Public equity offerings on the three largest US stock exchanges - the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and the American Stock Exchange - raised $154bn in 2006, while offerings involving 144A private placements raised $162bn. bd
