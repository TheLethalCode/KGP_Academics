 BERLIN, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayer Leverkusen raised doubts about their ability to mount a serious title challenge when they let Karlsruhe come from three goals down to claim a memorable 3-3 draw on Saturday. With Hoffenheim not in action until Sunday, Leverkusen had a chance to move back on top of the Bundesliga and they seemed certain to take it when Patrick Helmes scored after a few seconds and they improved that lead to 3-0 by the 24th minute.

Leverkusen looked comfortable enough even after Kiessling deflected in a free kick from Antonio da Silva eight minutes before the break but the second half was a different story. Leverkusen seemed to suffer a crisis of confidence in defence and attack, which became worse after Tim Sebastian converted from a free kick with an hour gone. An equaliser began to look inevitable and it came when Aleksandr Iashvili headed in 14 minutes from tim
