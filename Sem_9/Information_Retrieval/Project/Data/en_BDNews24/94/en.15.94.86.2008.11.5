 LONDON, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Goalkeeper Ben Foster will make his debut in the Champions League for Manchester United against Celtic on Wednesday after the club opted to rest first choice Edwin van der Sar. United said on their website (www.manutd.com) on Tuesday that Dutchman Van der Sar had not made the trip to Scotland with manager Alex Ferguson keeping one eye on Saturday's Premier League visit to Arsenal. The European champions are also without defenders Wes Brown and Gary Neville as well as long-term injury victims Paul Scholes and Owen Hargreaves. Brazilian youngster Rafael da Silva is expected to slot into right back in place of the experienced Neville. Foster's only previous appearance for United came against Derby County in the Premier League in March. Victory for United in the Group E clash would ensure they qualify for the last 16 of the tournament and Celtic are eliminated provided joint group leaders Villarreal do not lose against AaB Aalborg
