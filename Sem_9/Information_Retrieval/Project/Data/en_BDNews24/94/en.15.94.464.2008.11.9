<TITLE> EC's juggling of dates is a hoax: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)BNP general secretary Khandakar Delwar Hossain termed the Election Commission's "juggling of dates" for submission, scrutiny and withdrawal of nomination papers "a hoax" on Sunday. "Rescheduling of the dates should be declared after the withdrawal of emergency and after detained leaders have been given a chance to participate in the elections," he said, mentioning two of the party's seven conditions on which it has said it would go to polls. Election officials announced earlier Sunday that a partial change was being made to the election schedule "at the request of returning officers and candidates" to extend the period for submissions in particular. The deadline for nomination filing, for both Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila elections, was being extended from Nov 13 to Nov 20. Scrutiny of papers for the parliamentary polls would take place on Nov. 23-24, and the last day for withdrawal of candidacy would be Nov. 29. Scrutiny of papers for upazila polls would take place Nov. 25-27, with the last date for pulling out being Dec. 3, officials announced. Reiterating that BNP is a pro-polls party, Delwar said the new deadlines erased the opportunity for loan defaulters to pay arrears in time to qualify for elections. Speaking at the Diploma Engineer's Institute Auditorium, he categorically stated that BNP would only go to polls if the four-party alliance's seven-point demands were met. "A state of emergency was declared on Jan 11, 2007 as part of a carefully laid blueprint, but BNP will not be part of any plan that serves any malicious motive." He also criticised the lack of a level playing field ahead of elections. "It's not acceptable that the leaders of only one party should be kept behind bars to prevent them from taking part in elections." bdnew
