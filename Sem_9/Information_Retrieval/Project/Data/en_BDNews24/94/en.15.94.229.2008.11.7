<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP observed the "National Revolution and Solidarity Day" on Friday through various programmes and asked the government to mark the day officially. The day started with party chief Khaleda Zia along with BNP leaders and workers placing floral wreath at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman overlooking the national parliament building at 7am. Party flag was hoisted at the party's Naya Paltan central office early in the morning. A discussion meeting will follow at 3pm in the Institution of Engineers auditorium. The assassination of president independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Aug. 15, 1975 led to anarchy in the country including coup and countercoup in which former army chief General Ziaur Rahman was put under house arrest. Soldiers led by Colonel Taher later on Nov. 7 freed Zia. Since then the BNP observes the event as the "National revolution and Solidarity Day" every year. Earlier in the morning, supporters streamed to the grave of the founder of BNP and chanted slogans with colourful banners and festoons flung in the air. Khaleda said prayers after placing the wreath at her late husband's graveside. She is scheduled to address a public rally in Chittagong in commemoration of the day. Secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, central leaders M Shamsul Islam, Tariqul Islam, ASM Hannan Shah, Nazrul Islam Khan, Selima Rahman, Rizvi Ahmed, Jatiyatabadi Jubo Dal president Barkatullah Bulu, general secretary Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal, organising secretary Khairul Kabir Khokan accompanied the party chief. Delwar said, "This is a part of the conspiracy that the day has not been observed officially." Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, Jubo Dal, Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, Jatiyatabadi Mohila Dal, Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal, Jatiyatabadi Ulama Dal, Jatiyatabadi Motshyajibi Dal, Doctors' Association of Bangladesh (DAB), Engineers' Association of Bangladesh, Zia Shishu Sangathan, and Jatiyatabadi Samajik Sangskritik Sangstha followed the mainstream to place wreath at Zia's cemetery. Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar and deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiquee also followed the suit in the morning. Security was enhanced in the area on the occasion. bdne
