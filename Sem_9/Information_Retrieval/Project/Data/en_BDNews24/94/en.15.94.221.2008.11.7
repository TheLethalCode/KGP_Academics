 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  An eight-member European Commission delegation arrived in the city on Friday to assess Bangladesh's political situation for Brussels to make a decision on sending observation mission for the Dec.18 election. "The eight-member core team has arrived this afternoon," Chalres Whiteley, first secretary to the European Commission's office in Dhaka, told bdnews24.com in the evening. The core team would stay until January as part of the European Union's polls observation process, he said. According to the report of the core team, the EC's commissioner for external relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner would decide whether the European Union's fully-fledged election observation mission should come to Bangladesh. The core team would report whether the military-installed caretaker government restored some civil and political rights  a condition set by the EC for sending a full-fledged election observation mission. The EU has never observed polls under emergency. But the commission, terming Bangladesh's state of emergency different, has urged Fahkruddin Ahmed's government either to lift the emergency or relax it by allowing back some civil and political rights. Otherwise, the EC said, it would not send a full polls observation mission to Bangladesh. The team will meet with the government and the Election Commission officials, political parties, journalists, civil society members and others to assess the political situation. The EC sends short-term, long-term and core teams for polls observers. bd
