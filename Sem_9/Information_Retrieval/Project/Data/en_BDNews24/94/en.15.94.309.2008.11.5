 WASHINGTON (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When all is said and done with the 2008 presidential election, one of the contenders will be returning to the US Senate, a harsh reality after coming so close to the White House. For the first time in 48 years a senator will capture the White House, either Republican Sen. John McCain or Democratic Sen.

You're damn right I did. Would I have been happier with a win? Of course," he told Reuters at the time. Both McCain and Obama are up for re-election in 2010. This year, a few Democrats returned to the Senate after losing their fights for the presidential nomination, Sens. Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd and Joe Biden, though Biden ended up as the Democratic vice presidential nominee. In late June Clinton was greeted back in the Senate by her colleagues with cheers, a couple of tears and hugs after she lost a tough fight with Obama for the Democratic nomination. Dodd dug into the financial crisis as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Biden as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held court on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "The hardest thing to do is to sort of adjust your pace from speaking to the nation and sometimes even to the world about what you want to get done, and then to come back and settle into the pace of the Senate," Kerry told reporters in June after Clinton returned
