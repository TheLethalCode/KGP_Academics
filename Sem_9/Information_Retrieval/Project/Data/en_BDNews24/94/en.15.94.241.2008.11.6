"Maradona was in the stands? I am happy to have scored in front of him. I hope he comes to watch us more often," Del Piero told reporters after the Italian team secured their place in the last 16. The World Cup-winning striker opened the scoring after 17 minutes by slamming a left-foot shot past Iker Casillas as the defence backed off. Del Piero's second came from a direct free kick in the 67th minute which he whipped past Real's badly-positioned wall into the left-hand corner of the net with Casillas rooted to the spot. His performance drew the applause of an otherwise disappointed home crowd when he was substituted in injury time. "I am proud of the applause I received at the Bernabeu, an incredible stadium and an extremely important one. You live for these kinds of emotions," said Del Piero. "I want to thank the Madrid fans for their applause. We are very happy." Real players were full of admiration for the striker. "A player like Del Piero is always difficult to stop.
