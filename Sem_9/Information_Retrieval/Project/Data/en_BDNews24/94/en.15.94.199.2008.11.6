<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) will prepare a report by the month-end on reasons behind administrative corruption, which will also recommend means to combat it after meeting with four ministries, the chairman said on Thursday. Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said once the report is prepared, he and two of his commissioners will meet with the government high-ups to enforce their recommendations. Chowdhury had a meeting with the heads of Local Government Department and its service providing organisations on progress of the report at the LGD office. The ACC has met with the land ministry and is set to sit with the health and family welfare ministry, and communication ministry. He said they would recommend the LGD and all ministries open cells to receive internal allegations. He said because of a lack of such cell, authorities deny allegations, but "that does not mean that there is no corruption and irregularity". The former army chief said the report would recommend intensified monitoring to eliminate deep-rooted corruption and swift actions for such corruption that could be stopped immediately. The officials attending the meeting proposed a rise in the pay scale for employees to eliminate corruption, but the ACC chief differed with the idea. bdnew
