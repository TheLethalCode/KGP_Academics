 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  BNP-backed doctors and staff at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University have demanded the resignation of the health adviser, alleging that the caretaker government had appointed officials backed by "another party" to the positions of vice-chancellor, pro-VC and treasurer. They observed a 'sit-in' in front of the VC's office from 11am on Wednesday. The demonstrators also held a protest gathering at the BSMMU auditorium earlier. Health ministry officials said Tuesday that authorities had removed vice-chancellor Prof Mohammed Tahir, pro-VC Prof M A Majid and treasurer Prof Mobin Khan. Prof Md Nazrul Islam of the pediatrics department and Prof Md. Kamal Uddin of the pathology department had been appointed as the VC and pro-VC, and Prof Md Ruhul Amin Miah, chairman of microbiology department, had been made treasurer. BSMMU registrar Md Abdul Gofur said that the newly appointed officials took up their duties on Wednesday. Prof Saiful Islam Selim, president of the Doctors' Association of Bangladesh, an organisation supported by BNP, said the government had appointed "partisans" and removed the incumbent officials on a trivial pretext. "The way these people were removed is offending for the doctors' community. The incident has also tainted the neutral image of the government." "We are protesting the new appointments," said Saiful Islam, professor of neurology department. The demonstrators said that they would continue their sit-in programme till 2.30pm. They will also submit a memorandum to the chief adviser, Islam said. Though the demonstrators are BNP adherents, they are holding their protest under the banner 'integrated doctors-nurse-staff council'. Abdul Kuddus, associate professor of BSMMU eye department, said the newly appointed people were adherents of Awami League. "If the recruitment is neutral we will accept it. But if not, we want the resignation of the health adviser," he said. Dr Iqbal Arsalan, secretary general of Swadhinata Chikitshok Parishad backed by AL, said that the three newly appointed officials were not members of SCP as alleged. BSMMU Teachers' Association welcomed the new appointment. "We submitted a memorandum to the health adviser on Aug 2 protesting irregularities in the hospital and demanded the resignation of the VC, pro-VC and treasurer," the association's general secretary Dr Kamrul Hassan said. He alleged that the demonstrators were members of DAB and the people who were removed were also partisans. bdnews
