<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  A late blitz from Johann Louwa and captain Johan Botha powered South Africa to 283 for eight against Bangladesh in the first of the three one-day internationals at Senwes Park in Potchefstroom on Friday. Louwa cracked three sixes and one four in seven balls to a whirlwind 23 while Botha struck five fours in his 15-ball 23-run knock to take the hosts to what appeared as a total Bangladesh may find difficult to chase under lights. It seemed Bangladesh, riding on some excellent works from spinners and fielders, were going to restrict South Africa to a moderate total with scoreboard reading 194 for five in 40 over. But the things changed in the last five overs, the last power play, specially in the last three overs, with Louwa and Albie Morkel blunting spin duo Shakib Al Hasan and Naeem Islam. Shakib conceded 17 runs in his last over, Naeem Islam spilled 16 runs in the last over while pacer Syed Rasel gave away 13 runs in the final over of the innings. Earlier, Shakib and Naeem slowed the Proteas down with controlled bowling after South African openers Hashim Amla and Justin Ontong gave them a solid start putting on 56 off 62 balls. They had no trouble against Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Syed Rasel. Amla (35) was a bit unlucky to be run out after slipping down in the middle of the pitch and got no chance to return with Abdur Razzak breaking the stumps with a fine throw. Left-arm spinner Shakib then had Ontong caught by Razzak for 27, but Jaques Kallis and AB de Villiers (35) steadied the innings. They took the side to 135 for three before Naeem struck first, dismissing the latter. Kallis kept his cool to concentrate on singles and reached his 49th ODI fifty before he also became victim of Naeem in the space of 12 runs. He struck just two fours for 73-ball 50. Mashrafee trapped Mark Boucher in front for eight, but Jean-Paul Duminy and Albie Morkel kept the run-wheel running with 36 and 32 respectively. Naeem was the pick of the attack with three for 60 while Shakib took two wickets for 48. Mashrafee and Rasel chipped in with one wicket apiece. South Africa: Hashim Amla, Justin Ontong, Jaques Kallis, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Mark Boucher, Albie Morkel, Johan Botha, Morne Morkel, Johann Louwa and Dale Steyn. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Imrul Kayes, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak and Syed Rasel. bd
