 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Private airline United Airways begins flights on its Dhaka-Saidpur route on Nov 24, providing a new air service to the much-neglected northern region. United public relations officer Kamrul Islam told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that they would fly the route three days a week with a return flight a day on Saturdays, Mondays and Wednesdays. One-way travel will cost a passenger Tk 4,995 including tax, but the maiden flight will charge only Tk 3,000 per passenger, Kamrul said. Bangladeshi expatriates own 95 per cent stake inUnited Airways, which was formally launched on July 10 last year. It flies from Dhaka to various domestic destinations, including Chittagong, Sylhet, Jessore, Barisal and Cox's Bazar, as well as an international flight to Kolkata. There was no air service linking Dhaka with Saidpur after Biman Bangladesh Airlines halted its scheduled flights from Feb 19 last year until Aug 26 this year, when Royal Bengal Airlines, a private carrier run by expatriate Bangladeshis, began operating on the route. bdnew
