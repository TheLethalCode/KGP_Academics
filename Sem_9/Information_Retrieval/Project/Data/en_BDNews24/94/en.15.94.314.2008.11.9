 Dhaka, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)The government must strengthen the rural economy if Bangladesh is to be self-sufficient in food, speakers at a seminar stressed on Sunday. "To ensure food security, Bangladesh must ensure the rights of producers," Justice Habibur Rahman said at a seminar on 'Reforms of Rural Socio-Economic Situations', organised by Research Initiatives Bangladesh (RIB). Participants stressed land reforms, proper distribution of khas or state-owned lands and water bodies for a stable rural economy. The former chief adviser criticised the country's administrative body as "too inefficient". He also stressed education side by side with land reforms in a bid to support the rural economy. On the role of political parties in this regard, Habibur Rahman said election manifestos of political parties promise many constructive measures for the rural people. "But once the elections are over, the promises in the manifestos are reduced to just words." Awami League presidium memeber Abdur Razzaque emphasised a strong, transparent and accountable local government and the re-introduction of the rural co-operatives programme. "However, land reforms and introducing a rural banking system are also essential to improve the rural economy," he added. Ex-BNP minister Md Shamsul Islam said the "500-year old" prevailing laws, to some extent, encourages land grabbing. "The existing law states that if anyone lives on a property for 12 years, he is entitled to some rights over the property. There is a strong need to revisit these laws," he said. Economist MM Akash in his keynote speech said a 'donor-recipient' relation between farmers and land owners hinders rural people from electing a representative of their own choice. "This relationship needs to be abolished and proper distribution of khas properties ensured among the needy through land reforms for the sake of democracy and fair elections." Renowned economist Professor Rehman Sobhan focused on the need of joint efforts by political parties, farmers' bodies and other social forces to address the issue. The seminar, moderated by Khushi Kabir, executive chairman of the Association of Land Reform and Development, also heard from economist Abul Barakat, Communist Party of Bangladesh chief Manjurul Ahasan Khan and Ayesha Khanam, president of Bangladesh Mohila Parishad among others. bdn
