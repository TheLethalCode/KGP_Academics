<TEXT>
 CLUJ, Romania, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Girondins Bordeaux boosted their qualifying hopes with a 2-1 victory at CFR Cluj in the Champions League on Tuesday. Yoann Gourcuff put the French team in front after six minutes before Dani headed Cluj level three minutes later. Brazilian Wendel grabbed the winner for Bordeaux from a 19-metre free kick in the 38th minute. "We came here for a victory and we got a victory," said coach Laurent Blanc. Bordeaux and AS Roma share second place in Group A with six points from four games, one point behind leaders Chelsea. "Now there are three teams fighting for the first two places and this makes our job more difficult," added Blanc after learning of Chelsea's 3-1 defeat at Roma. Bordeaux and Cluj attacked from the start and created several goal-scoring opportunities. After the three goals, Cluj were unlucky not to claim their second equaliser of the night when Yssouf Kone's effort was deflected to safety by defender Matthieu Chalme. Keeper Matthieu Valverde also rescued Bordeaux when he deflected away a header by Sixto Peralta. "We wasted several chances to score and it cost us at least a draw," said Cluj coach Maurizio Trombetta. "More than that we made some errors in defence and Bordeaux's excellent players profited." Bordeaux had a chance to extend their lead in stoppage time but striker Marouane Chamakh was denied by home goalkeeper Eduard Stancioiu
