 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered BNP leader Saifur Rahman and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed to surrender to the trial court by Nov 10 in the Barapukuria coalmine case. The HC bench of justices Md Mojammel Hossain and Afzal Hossain Ahmed gave the order after hearing their petitions for bail and quashing the case on Wednesday. It set Nov 11 for a follow-up hearing. The ACC filed the Barapukuria case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of causing losses to the state of Tk 158.71 crore through irregularities in management of the coalmine. ACC deputy director Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges on Oct 5 against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. A separate HC bench on Wednesday granted former BNP minister Mirza Abbas and former Barisal mayor Mujibur Rahman Sarwar three months bail in two separate cases. The bench of justices Syed AB Mahmudul Haque and Moinul Islam Chowdhury gave the order on their petitions. It also ordered the government to explain in four weeks why Abbas, facing a murder case, and Sarwar, facing an extortion case, should not be given permanent bail. The murder case was filed against Mirza Abbas with Shahbagh Police Station on Aug 28, 2006. Abbas was shown arrested in this case on March 1 last year. Zakir Hossain filed an extortion case with Tejgaon Police Station against the Barisal mayor on July 18 last year. bdnew
