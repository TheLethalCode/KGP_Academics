 Johannesburg, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh had their moments in the first ODI against South Africa at Potchefstroom on Friday but struggled for consistency and could not sustain pressure. But despite the 61-run defeat the mood in the Tigers camp is one of optimism as they prepared for the second game at Benoni on Sunday. "If you leave aside the last five overs where they (South Africa) made 66, I thought we bowled and fielded pretty well on a flat pitch. We didn't have the best of starts in pursuit of 283 but my 92-run partnership with Shakib (Al Hasan) brought us back in the match. Unfortunately we both got out at an important time," said Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful according to a report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. "The wicket, the fast outfield everything suited the chase. 283 might be a steep target but we went for a win and we'll have the same mentality in the next games also. We will take note of the mistakes we have made in the first ODI and try not to repeat them. Our goal is be competitive throughout this series," added Ashraful who thought there was a good vive going in the team. "We have fought well in almost every match starting from the last ODI against Australia in Darwin. We have created winning situations and have gone close. Remember that we have been playing the world's number one, two and three over the last few months and they haven't found the going easy against us," Ashraful said. "The boys have really come together as a unit and there is great camaraderie. If we stay like this and keep pushing the opponents I'm sure we'll start to get results pretty soon." The Tigers delayed their travel to Johannesburg from Potchefstroom Saturday with more than half the squad opting for practice at Senwes Park in the morning. The scheduled training at the Wanderers was cancelled as Senwes Park was a more convenient option considering the two-hour bus journey to Johannesburg. The Bangladesh captain was also happy with a return to form following his sparkling 73 off 78 balls. "It is always a good feeling to score runs especially against an attack like South Africa's. They are number two in the world and they don't give you an inch. That's why it is very satisfying to make runs in their conditions." Number six Shakib led the Bangladesh fight-back yesterday with Ashraful after the side had collapsed to 77 for four and made a crucial 51. He felt the match would have been much closer if the top order had contributed. "Three batsmen in the top five made just 4 runs between them and that is where we badly suffered. Usually when that happens you are almost out of the game. But I am confident that our batsmen will come good. I think people now realize that we can stand up to the challenges in South Africa and the bowlers and wickets are not unplayable," said Shakib. Opening batsman Tamim Iqbal, who was run out for 24 rued missing out on another start. "The most difficult part is to get into the 20s and you need to concentrate the hardest at that time. I am doing that bit and then getting out when things should be easier. I am training as hard as possible and giving every effort to make big runs. I know it'll come." Tamim said the relatively inexperienced players in the team will come good as the tour progressed. "It is a massive step up for someone like Imrul (Kayes) who has played mostly academy and A team cricket prior to this tour. It needs a bit of adjustment and I'm sure it won't take long for him to adjust. This goes for all new players." Weather is a concern for the match on Sunday which is a day fixture starting 10am local time (2pm BdST). There has been rain and thundershowers in Benoni over the last couple of days and heavy rain is forecast tomorrow also. The Bangladesh side will delay naming the playing XI until they have seen the wicket on Sunday. Benoni's Willowmoore Park has hosted 11 ODIs so far since 1998 and Bangladesh have played here twice. In 2002 they were thrashed by 10 wickets by the hosts. Their last ODI game at this venue was on February 18, 2003 during the World Cup when the West Indies made 244 for 9 batting first. The Tigers had reached 32 for two in 8.1 overs when rain prevented any further play and the match was declared a no-result encounter. In 2007 the Tigers played Kenya at Benoni in a warm-up match of the ICC T20 World Cup and lost. Teams have traditionally preferred batting second at Willowmoore Park with nine out of the 10 completed matches won by the side chasing. South Africa had a day off Saturday and could welcome back a fit-again captain Graeme Smith for Sunday's match. Bangladesh: Mohammad Ashraful, Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Imrul Kayes, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Syed Rasel, Shahadat Hossain, Mehrab Hossain Jr., Nazmul Hossain and Mahbubul Alam. South Africa: Graeme Smith, Johan Botha, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, JP Duminy, Johann Louw, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Justin Ontong, Dale Steyn and Monde Zondeki.
