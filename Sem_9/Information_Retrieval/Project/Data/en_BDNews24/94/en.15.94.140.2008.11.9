 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Sun Nov 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli and Palestinian officials asked the international community on Sunday to support their talks under the US-backed Annapolis process despite the expectation there will be no deal this year. The Quartet of Middle East peace mediators, which held joint talks with both sides on Sunday in Egypt, voiced support for the process and suggested the spring of 2009 could be an "appropriate time" for an international peace meeting in Moscow. The talks launched by President George W Bush nearly a year ago at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland have been hobbled from the start by violence and bitter disputes over Jewish settlement building and the future of Jerusalem. "They asked that the international community support the parties' sustained efforts in the framework of the Annapolis process," the Quartet said in a statement read by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. "The Quartet emphasized the importance of continuity of the peace process," he said. SIDE BY SIDE Sitting side by side at a round table, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas briefed ministers from the Quartet, which groups the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States. The White House this week conceded Bush was unlikely to achieve his goal of securing a peace deal to end the six-decade conflict before he leaves office in January. Bush had hoped an agreement would improve a legacy burdened by the war in Iraq. But U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters after the talks: "What we heard today from the parties, which is the most important element of this, is that they believe in the Annapolis process." Livni, speaking to Israel Radio before leaving for Egypt, reaffirmed Israel's commitment to the Annapolis process. "We are intentionally operating quietly and responsibly," she said, after months of negotiations with the Palestinians that have yielded few signs of progress. "If I thought hope was gone, I would not be attending today." DEAL REMOTE While the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are expected to continue next year, political uncertainty in Israel and Barack Obama's victory in the presidential election leave the Bush administration with limited influence in its waning days. The chances of a deal this year were always remote and appeared to evaporate entirely when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert announced his decision to resign because of a corruption scandal, triggering plans for a February 10 election in Israel. Rice, wrapping up what is likely to be her last visit to the region before stepping down, joined Ban Ki-moon, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and European Union foreign policy Chief Javier Solana at the meeting. Earlier this week Rice suggested Livni and Abbas would not speak in much detail to the Quartet about their peace talks, saying that it was vital to preserve their confidentiality. It is unclear how much emphasis Obama will place on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and Palestinian officials have repeatedly expressed concern that Israel would use any lull in talks to expand Jewish settlements. "Here we face a vacuum created because of the American election and because of the coming Israeli elections and we hope that the Quartet will help us so the Israelis will not use this vacuum to increase the settlements, to increase the incursions, to increases the attacks and the roadblocks on the Palestinian people. This is a very crucial point," Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters on Saturday
