<TITLE> Is Obama an internationalist or trade sceptic? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Fri Nov 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In Barack Obama, America's trade partners face a man who has strong internationalist instincts yet is committed to defending US jobs. At a time when the need for economic stimulus is matched by pressure for tighter regulation, the politician drawing support from the unions and one who wants the United States to benefit from global integration may both find their hands tied. The incoming president has shown he is aware of the jaundiced view many US voters have of trade, even if he does not share it himself. Speaking in April about the frustrations of small-town voters bitter over job losses, Obama described people who "cling to guns or religion ... or anti-trade sentiment". He wants to amend the NAFTA trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico to strengthen labour and environment standards, and favours a tough line with China over its huge and growing bilateral surplus with the United States. However, an 18 percent rise in US exports in the first eight months of this year is one of the few bright spots in an economy already contracting in the third quarter, and no US president can afford to dismiss trade. "When he talks in general terms he's strongly pro-trade, he's strongly pro-globalisation, he's strongly pro an interconnected world," said Fredrik Erixon, director of the European Centre for International Political Economy (ECIPE). "I wouldn't call him a free trader, but I would call him an internationalist." EARLY SIGNALS Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim also rejects the idea that Obama's Democrats are protectionist. "I don't think that holds any more. This has more to do with manufacturing than with the agricultural problems we are facing, and the Democrats are also more multilateralist," he said. The first indication of Obama's approach to trade may come next week, two months before he takes office, at a summit in Washington on Nov. 15 to discuss the financial crisis. Obama has not yet said whether he will attend but the outgoing administration will in any case have to reflect his views. Brazil and Australia want the summit to instruct negotiators to speed up work on the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Doha round to open up global trade, and EU trade chief Catherine Ashton said on Thursday a breakthrough was possible this year, sending a positive signal to the battered world economy. If the summit does not give an impetus to the Doha talks, launched seven years ago, they risk further delay next year partly because of uncertainty generated by elections in India and the formation of a new EU executive commission. Although Obama wants to revise NAFTA, he has not indicated he wants a new approach to Doha, says Pascal Kerneis, managing director of the European Services Forum. "My understanding is that he would be in favour of concluding the deal as it is," Kerneis said. Another signal will be Obama's choice as U.S. trade representative, the top U.S. trade official. An experienced figure with credibility who is able to hit the ground running, rather than someone less well known who has to work their way into the job, would show trade was a priority, said Kerneis. Daniel Tarullo, a law professor and former trade aide to President Bill Clinton, is a top candidate for the job. Supporters of an early Doha deal argue it would bolster defences against protectionism. However, the economic slowdown and financial crisis make it difficult to push for more liberalisation and market access, and instead are encouraging greater regulation and more subsidies, for instance in the U.S. and European car industries. Some experts say a deal that simply locks in current levels of access and liberalisation would be valuable to businesses. Obama must deliver new markets to U.S. businesses if he wants their support for a deal in Congress. "He will have the same problems as the previous administration," said Erixon of ECIPE. "Getting acceptance from the farm sector in the United States for a new agreement must involve access to developing country markets," he said, adding the same applied to manufacturing and services. The United States has several high-profile disputes with the European Union, from hormone-treated beef to subsidies for civilian aircraft. These are working their way through the WTO disputes process, but will eventually require the two sides to sit down and negotiate, especially the case involving Boeing and EADS subsidiary Airbus planes. Obama's politics, and his status as the first black US president, lead developing countries to hope he will be more responsive to their trade demands. On one hot-button issue, subsidies for US cotton growers, he is relatively unbeholden to the politically influential producers in the southern States. "We would want to see some willingness from the new administration to change. The current administration has had a high level of aggression and resistance to fundamental concerns from developing countries, such as around the cotton issue," said South African deputy Trade Minister Rob Davies
