 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka will be the world's second largest megacity by 2015 in terms of population, say urban planners. "Dhaka ranks 206th among 215 cities by life standards," M Rahmatullah, adviser to the Bangladesh Institute of Planners, said on Saturday. Speaking at a roundtable on urban planning, he said Dhaka's present population growth will turn it into the sixth largest megacity by 2010 and the second by 2015, according to the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS). The Institute of Planners organised the round table 'Bangladesh Urban Planning: Perspectives 2020', under the aegis of UNDP, to mark World Town Planning Day. Calling for decentralisation of the country's urbanisation drive, Rahmatullah said plans for developing all district towns should be improved. University Grants Commission chairman and urban planner Professor Nazrul Islam told the round table that forecasts doubled Bangladesh's present population to 280 million in 20 years. "This must be factored in before a single more inch of the country is urbanised." Stressing the need to include urban planning in the curricula at all levels up to university, Nazrul Islam said: "Planners should be employed also at village levels." Attributing flaws in the country's urbanisation schemes to bureaucracy and corrupt politics, chairman of Transparency International Bangladesh Prof Muzaffar Ahmed said, "People must be at the centre in urban plans, which must not be left unimplemented." He also asked the Institute of Planners to formulate policies for the professional urban planner. bdnew
