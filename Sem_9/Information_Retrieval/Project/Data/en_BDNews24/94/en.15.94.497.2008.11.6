<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)The foreign adviser has said Myanmar is pulling out of disputed Bay waters, but Bangladesh remains "ready for any eventuality". "We are hearing that Myanmar has started the process of dismantling installations in the disputed area of the Bay," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Thursday. Iftekhar had "no knowledge", he said, of Myanmar having already withdrawn, as reported by some media Thursday. He stressed: "We want to resolve the dispute through diplomacy - but we are ready for any eventuality." The adviser said that he had spoken with foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, who is heading a Dhaka delegation in Yangon. The secretary was set to meet his Myanmar counterpart Thursday to discuss a resolution to the dispute, said Iftekhar. The two countries have been involved in an escalating dispute over the past week following Myanmar's attempts to explore for gas in a disputed stretch of water. Bangladesh insists that the area, about 60 nautical miles of St Martin's Island, lies well within its exclusive economic zone, and has formally protested over the issue. The foreign ministry has twice summoned Burma's ambassador to protest the reported intrusion, and sent Bangladesh Navy vessels to patrol the area. Myanmar, with also bringing its navy into the areas, has stuck to its counterclaim that the waters fall within their maritime border. The two sides have held talks this year to resolve their long-time dispute over sea boundaries, as well as possible energy cooperation. The Bay of Bengal is believed to have abundant reserves of oil and gas, with both sides looking to foreign companies to exploit the reserves. bdn
