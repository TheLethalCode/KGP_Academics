 MADRID, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Real Madrid central defender Pepe has recovered from a thigh knock and should be available for the Spanish champions' Primera Liga match against Malaga on Saturday, the club said on their website (www.realmadrid.com). However, right back Sergio Ramos is doubtful after hurting a foot in Real's 2-0 Champions League defeat to Juventus on Wednesday. Ramos joins winger Arjen Robben on the injury list, while Ruud van Nistelrooy is still suffering from a knee problem and may not play. Real midfielder Ruben de la Red, who briefly passed out during the 3-2 King's Cup loss at Real Union last month, is in "perfect" shape, one of the doctor's examining him was quoted as saying by Marca newspaper on Friday. "The first set of tests have shown he is perfect and that is positive," cardiologist Enrique Asin Cardiel told the paper. Tests would continue until the exact reason for the player's collapse was known, he added. Barcelona defender Eric Abidal needs another three weeks to shake off a knee injury picked up in training, the club said on its website (www.fcbarcelona.com). The Primera Liga leaders host Real Valladolid on Saturday and will definitely be without midfielder Andres Iniesta, who damaged a thigh muscle in Barca's 1-1 Champions League draw with Basel at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Atletico Madrid defender Tomas Ujfalusi said he has shaken off a thigh injury he picked up in the Madrid derby last month and is ready to play again. "I am feeling fine," the Czech international said on the club's website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). "I started training again with the team this week and I am missing the pace of competitive games." Sevilla defender Fernando Navarro said he was "annoyed" after the 1-0 UEFA Cup defeat at Standard Liege on Thursday, their fourth loss in a row in all competitions, and the team had to give their all in their league match this weekend. The two-time Cup winners are at home to struggling Recreativo Huelva on Sunday and have slipped five points behind leaders Barca in the Primera Liga. "It's all or nothing," Navarro said on the club's website (www.sevillafc.com). Second-from-bottom Athletic Bilbao, with just five points from nine matches, face Real Mallorca on Sunday and coach Joaquin Caparros said the team needs a change of luck. "We hope to go on a decent run because that is what we are lacking," he told Friday's Mundo Deportivo newspaper
