 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League was ready with a huge show of support for its president Sheikh Hasina set to return home Thursday morning, ahead of general elections, after five months abroad. The party has planned a massive gathering of supporters, to line the road from Zia International Airport to her Sudha Sadan home in Dhanmondi, to welcome her. Party meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday finalised eight spots, stretching from Zia International Airport to Hasina's Sudha Sadan home, for supporters to gather amid tight security. Hasina arrived in London on Tuesday morning local time, flying in from the US en route to Bangladesh. The former prime minister brought her return date forward by four days, to Nov 6 instead of Nov 10, following the Election Commission's announcement of parliamentary polls schedule earlier in the week. Hasina, facing five graft cases, flew to the United States on June 12 to seek medical treatment, a day after the government allowed her temporary release from special jail on parole. During her stay in the US, Hasina twice met US assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs Richard Boucher. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year. Her parole, extended on several occasions, comes to an end on Nov 6, the day of her return. She was granted bail in all cases against her and was cleared of extortion charges pressed by businessman Noor Ali on Wednesday. bdnews24.c
