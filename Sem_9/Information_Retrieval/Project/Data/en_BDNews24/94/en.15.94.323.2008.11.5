<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)The Sectors Commanders Forum on Tuesday revealed an "initial" list of 50 war criminals, demanding they be barred from nomination and that they be tried. "The election has opened up a great opportunity for the nation to resist the war criminals by barring their nomination," said SCF chairman air vice martial (retd) AK Khandaker. "They should have been tried, but we could not bring them to justice yet," said Khandaker, at a press conference at the auditorium of the Engineers Institution in the capital. SCF chief coordinator Lt Gen (retd) Harun Ur Rashid told bdnews24.com it was an "initial list", and termed the 50 named "anti-liberation" and "against humanity". "We demand their trial." Khandaker urged: "People must work against nomination of war criminals so that they cannot participate in the polls." The SCF chairman said the present administration had yet to take any steps on trial of war criminals, although the caretaker government had said "they should be brought to justice". "Rather, the Election Commission has decided to register Jamaat-e-Islami with a view to recognising them politically." "It will be a matter of grave injustice for the Bengali nation if Jamaat-e-Islami, being an ineligible party, was given registration," he said. Khandaker called upon all "irrespective of caste and religion, to resist Jamaat". Maj Gen (retd) KM Shafiullah said the sector commanders were prepared to prove Jamaat's ineligibility for registration. He called on the people to defeat war criminals through the ballot if Jamaat was registered. SCF joint coordinator Dr Soroar Ali read out the list. The conference began with a one-minute silence in respect to the memory of liberation war heroes. bdnews24.c
