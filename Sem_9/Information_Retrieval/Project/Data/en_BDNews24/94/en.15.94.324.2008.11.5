 Phonix, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican John McCain congratulated Democrat Barack Obama on winning the presidency on Tuesday, saying "the American people have spoken." McCain addressed his supporters at a Phoenix hotel after telephoning Obama to concede the election to him. The 72-year-old Arizona senator urged Americans to rally behind Obama, saying he planned to help Obama tackle the many challenges facing Americans. "Whatever our differences, we are fellow Americans and please believe me when I say no association has meant more to me than that," McCain said. "It is natural tonight to feel some disappointment but tomorrow we must move beyond it," said McCain, who hailed his vice presidential running mate Sarah Palin as a vital new voice in the Republican Party.
