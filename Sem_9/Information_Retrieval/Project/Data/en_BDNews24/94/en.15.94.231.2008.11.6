 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP-led four-party alliance, after a top-level summit of its leaders, was sticking to its seven-point charter of demands on Wednesday, saying authorities must meet their conditions before staging elections. "The election schedule was announced hastily, which is not conducive to a fair election," said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "Meet our demands, then announce the schedule," he asked election authorities. "Please don't hold an election by excluding the four-party alliance," Delwar warned, while speaking to reporters, after the two-hour meeting that ran late into the night. Top leaders of the BNP-led four-party alliance sat from 8.45 to 11pm to decide their election stance in the wake of the election schedule that was announced on Nov. 2. It was the alliance's second meeting since BNP chief Khaleda Zia was released on bail on Sept. 11. Just prior to the meeting, Khaleda gave a statement to the press urging "all to avoid the path to unacceptable elections." It appeared to be a snub to the caretaker government's recent attempts to reach an accord with her party. Delwar earlier in the day had alleged the government was making moves to see a "particular party, group" in power. "We neither can accept nor participate in the staged election," he had said at a gathering of party supporters. But, he later 'clarified' after the four-party meeting: "The four-party alliance is ready to go to election as soon as fair polls can be guaranteed." Pressed by reporters on whether they were demanding a 'new election schedule', Delwar replied only: "A fair election is not possible under this schedule." Alliance member Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif told bdnews24.com the meeting was held to decide whether the alliance will take part in the election, "as the government did not live up to any of its pledges to the alliance even after the announcement of the poll schedule." Jamaat Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami, Islami Oikya Jote chairman Fazlul Haq Amini, Khelafat Majlish chief Mohammad Ishaq, Bangladesh Jatiya Party chairman Andalib Rahman, Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed and other alliance leaders were also present at the meeting. Although rival party Awami League has begun its electoral preparations in full swing, the four-party has said it has yet to decide on joining the general election on Dec. 18. According to polls schedule, Nov 13 is the last date for submission of nominations. bdnews24.
