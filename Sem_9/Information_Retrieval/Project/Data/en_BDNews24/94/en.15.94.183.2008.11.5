 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Aspiring Awami League candidates have begun picking up nomination forms for the upcoming national elections, with the very first being picked for party president Sheikh Hasina. The area around the party's central office on Bangabandhu Avenue was buzzing with slogans and chants of party adherents flocking there from early Wednesday morning. Tazimul Islam Shamim, nephew of Hasina's husband Dr Wazed Miah, collected the form on behalf of the former PM, for Gopalganj-3 constituency. Sheikh Hasina will launch electoral campaign on her arrival back in the country on Thursday, said AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, who was among those handing out forms at the party office. Forms are being sold, for Tk 7,500, in separate rooms for six divisions. Their sale will continue to Friday. The last date for submission of nomination papers is Nov 13, according to the election schedule. "Awami League will initially endorse candidates for 300 seats. After establishing the electoral alliance, AL candidates will withdraw their nominations from the constituencies where seats will be contested by allied parties," he said. The AL-led 14-party alliance is currently active, but the formation of a much-debated 'grand alliance' is still under discussion with Jatiya Party, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh and the Liberal Democratic Party. AL has begun its national election preparations in full swing, but rival party BNP, leading the four-party alliance, is yet to decide on joining the national polls. Four-party leaders are set to hold a 'summit meet' on Wednesday evening in this regard. Ashraf was positive that the election would take place as per the declared time. "People were in doubt about elections. But we have been saying that the election must be held. I firmly believe that it will be held on Dec 18." Reiterating AL's demand for deferring Upazila polls, however, Ashraf said: "We will sit with the Election Commission on the matter today." The EC has announced that Upazila polls will be held in one go on Dec 28, just 10 days after the national elections. AL, BNP and other parties have been pressing demand to defer the elections. AL's central working committee has said nomination of candidates will be based on the opinions of grassroots level leaders. "Boxes will be kept according to divisions in the central office. The aspiring candidate will collect a form and drop it in the relevant box after filing it out," said Ashraf. "People who will submit forms will be given receipts. They have to submit a copy of the receipt to the presidents or general secretaries of their respective units." An extended meeting will be held by district Awami League members and presidents and general secretaries of wards, unions, upazilas and municipalities of electoral constituencies. The leaders will send the name of five prospective candidates to the CWC secretary by Nov 9. The central parliamentary board will finally nominate a candidate from the list for each constituency. bdnews
