 Chicago, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrats captured a governor's seat from Republicans in Missouri on Tuesday but most of the 11 U.S. gubernatorial contests ended with no change in party control. The outcomes were significant because they affect the way the country's political map will be redrawn after the 2010 census. Nearly every governor's seat will be up before then, and the state leaders play a major role in redrawing population-based legislative maps -- including the geographic areas from which members of the U.S. House of Representatives are elected. In Missouri, Jay Nixon, the state's long-time attorney general, defeated six-term U.S. congressman Kenny Hulshof for the seat held by Republican Gov. Matt Blunt, who did not seek reelection. But Republicans kept control of the governor's offices in Indiana, North Dakota, Vermont, and Utah. Democrats did the same in Delaware, West Virginia, New Hampshire, North Carolina, and Montana. The race for Washington's statehouse was undecided, with a rematch of a 2004 battle in which Democratic incumbent Christine Gregoire bested Republican Dino Rossi by a mere 133 votes. Going into Tuesday's contests, there were 28 Democratic and 22 Republican governors. Of the 11 seats up for a vote, Democrats controlled six and Republicans five before the voters went to the polls.
