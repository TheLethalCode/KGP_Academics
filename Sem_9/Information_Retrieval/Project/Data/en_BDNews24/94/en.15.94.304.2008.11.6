 MINSK, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zenit St Petersburg beat fellow Champions League debutants BATE Borisov 2-0 on Wednesday to keep alive their chances of reaching the knockout stage. Russia striker Pavel Pogrebnyak fired the UEFA Cup holders ahead in the 34th minute and Portugal international Danny added the second in the final minute to seal Zenit's first victory in the competition.
