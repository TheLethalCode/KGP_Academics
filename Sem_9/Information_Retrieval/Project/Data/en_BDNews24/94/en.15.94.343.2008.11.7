<TITLE> How can Obama manage Africa's euphoria? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOGELO, Kenya, Fri Nov 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Within hours of Barack Obama's election victory, Kenya sent workers to bring electricity for the first time to his late father's rural village. Obama may find it hard to bring such fast, tangible benefits to a whole continent that greeted his White House triumph with euphoria and vast expectations. "Africans must not ask extraordinary things from him, must not expect ... that through the miracle of his election America will drain money on Africa to change our continent," cautioned Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade. "I don't think that's going to happen, and it wouldn't be a good thing." The appointment of a "son of Africa" to the most powerful position in the world has sent hopes for change soaring. But given the global economic meltdown, and myriad other foreign policy priorities -- not least Iraq, Afghanistan, Russia and Iran -- the Obama administration's first policy challenge in Africa may just be managing expectations. When he does turn his attention to its needs, there will be no easy answers. From fresh fighting in eastern Congo to the crisis in Darfur and intractable conflict in Somalia, many of Obama's intelligence briefings on Africa will be grim. Priorities include accelerating the continent's integration into the global economy, securing American access to oil and other natural resources in the face of fierce Chinese and Indian competition, and contending with a host of humanitarian crises. "RARE OPPORTUNITY" Analyst J. Peter Pham, Africa advisor to Republican candidate John McCain, said Obama's Kenyan ancestry would help drive policy there -- alongside strategic and political concerns. "The excitement sweeping across Africa now presents (him) with a rare opportunity to translate effusive sentiments of good will into a windfall of diplomatic capital which, if he husbands it prudently, can significantly advance America's values and interests on the continent while helping to achieve Africans' aspirations for peace, stability, and development," he said. Obama's personal story has inspired millions across Africa, reducing many to tears of joy and pride when he won. Some African leaders, however, might privately be feeling a bit nervous. Obama's campaign vowed to strengthen ties with governments and groups committed to democracy and accountability. Kenyan human rights activist Maina Kiai said Obama had showed his stomach for a fight when he visited South Africa in 2006 as the only black U.S. senator -- criticising President Thabo Mbeki for his slow response to AIDS and urging him to take a tougher stand against Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe. He then flew to Kenya, met pro-democracy groups and gave a powerful speech at Nairobi University on human rights. "The next thing you heard was government officials attacking Obama and saying he doesn't understand Kenya," Kiai said. "On Darfur, he has been very strong on it. On Zimbabwe, he has been very clear about the need for change and the need for Mugabe to stop killing and hurting his people ... he has consistently been on the side of the underdog, on the side of the people, the side of right, so hopefully that will continue." The Nairobi Star agreed, saying Africa should not expect a soft ride from Obama: "In fact he will probably be tougher than Bush or Clinton, if we are to judge by his speech on corruption in Nairobi in 2006." DEMOCRATIC EXAMPLE Obama is clearly interested in Africa -- the question is whether he will have the money to do anything here. The issues certainly look likely to get more of a hearing at high levels with Susan Rice, former President Bill Clinton's top Africa aide, tipped as a possible national security adviser. Another legacy of history's most closely watched ballot might just be the dignity shown by McCain in defeat. The elation at Obama's win was felt most strongly by Kenyans, who saw their nation torn apart by post-election tribal violence at the start of this year. Many other African polls have also been marred by bloodshed. "It is particularly instructive to us in this country ... that John McCain gracefully conceded defeat but remained ever the steadfast statesman, as any leader anywhere worth his name should," said Kenya's Party of National Unity, which formed a unity government with the opposition to end the turmoil. Kenya's Daily Nation asked why, if the bloodshed seen in Kenya was unthinkable in the United States despite such a hard-fought, heated and lengthy election campaign, was it so common on the world's poorest continent? "The answer could simply be that we are incapable of harbouring any tolerance for each other's points of view," it said. "True democracy requires tolerance and the ability to give in with grace when we lose a political contest.
