 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com)  The finally qualified batch of the 27th BCS has urged the authorities to recruit them in the respective cadres without further waste of time. The call came at a news briefing at the TSC of Dhaka University on Saturday. Foreign affairs cadre qualifier Md. Al Alemul Imam in a written statement said they would observe symbolical hunger strike at the Aparajeyo Bangla on the DU premises for two hours everyday until their demands were met. "Reports appearing on different news media about the candidates qualified in the 27th BCS are untrue," he complained and protested the "false reports." Imam said, "Those who have qualified earlier are no rivals to us, but since we lost three years for the BCS we urge the authorities to give us appointments." Demonstrations and human chain on the DU campus preceded the briefing. Meanwhile the first batch of the qualified candidates in the 27th BCS continued their "hunger to death" at the central Shaheed Minar for the eighth day on Saturday leaving 19 of them ill. Rehydration dribs is being administered to 15-20 staging the hunger strike there. DU VC professor ASMA Fayez met the demonstrators on Thursday.
