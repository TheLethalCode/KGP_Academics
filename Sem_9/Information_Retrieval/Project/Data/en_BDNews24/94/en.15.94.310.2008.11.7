 Dhaka, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League has demanded that those convicted in the trial court under the emergency powers rules but have appealed their conviction in the High Court be allowed to contest election. The demand was raised from the meeting of the party's central working committee on Friday, with president Sheikh Hasina in the chair. "If those convicted by the trial court under the Emergency Powers Rules appeal to the High Court they will have to be allowed to contest election, as per constitution, until the [appeal] is disposed," acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said to reporters of the meeting decision. "The emergency will have to be withdrawn before the submission of the nomination papers," he said. Besides, he said, the meeting also demanded that loan and utility bill defaulters are given opportunity to pay the dues until the day before the submission of nomination. It also asked authorities to push back the Upazila election. "We demand deferral of the Upazila election including date for submission of nomination papers." "Those who have been arrested under the emergency powers rules have their bank accounts frozen and are not being allowed to open any other account. We demand that they are allowed to open new accounts," Ashraful said. Several hundred workers of Awami League and its associate organisations were waiting at Hasina's political office at Dhanmondi well before she reached there at 5:15pm. They welcomed her with raucous applause and by chanting slogans. Awami League presidium member Zillur Rahman went up to her car to receive her. The working committee meeting continued through to 8:45pm before it was adjourned until 5pm on Saturday. bdnews24
