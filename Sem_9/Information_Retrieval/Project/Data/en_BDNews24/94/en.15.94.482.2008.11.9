<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami's student front Islami Chattra Shibir has threatened the activists of a cultural organisation with "elimination" from campus. The Shibir activists, under the banner of 'Conscientious Students Society', delivered the threat to Udichhi student-members from a rally for "humiliating" prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in a play. The play titled 'Mandar' was staged to mark the Nov 3 anniversary of the Jail Killings in 1975, and to protest the removal of the Baul sculpture in the capital. Shibir students assaulted a 'cultural activist' the previous week after the showing of the play. "If the authorities do not take measures against the Udichhi students within the next 24 hours, actions to eliminate them will begin," said Abu Hanif, convenor of the 'Society' from Sunday's rally in front of the university arts building. Meanwhile, authorities have formed an 11-member committee to investigate the incidents, headed by social science dean Prof Sadekul Islam, RU registrar Muhammad Shafi said. The committee will begin its investigations soon, said officials. bdnews24.com
