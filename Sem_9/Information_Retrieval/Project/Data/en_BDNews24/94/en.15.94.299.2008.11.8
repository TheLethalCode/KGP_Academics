<TITLE> Britain revokes visas of Thai ex-PM and his wife </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain has revoked visas for former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his wife after their convictions in Thailand on corruption charges, newspapers reported on Saturday. The reports cited an advisory by the border agency cancelling the visas held by Thaksin and Potjaman, who skipped bail in August and fled to London claiming they could not get fair trials. A spokesman for the Home Office in London said they would not comment on individual cases. The British embassy in Bangkok also declined to comment. Thaksin, ousted in a bloodless 2006 coup, was believed to be traveling in China this week when the visas were revoked, the Nation newspaper reported. Thaksin was sentenced to two years in jail last month for breaking a conflict of interest law by getting involved in a government agency's sale of a piece of prime land in Bangkok to his wife. Potjaman was cleared of any wrongdoing in the land case, but in July she was sentenced to three years in jail for tax evasion. Thai prosecutors are urging London to extradite Thaksin, who won two landslide election victories, but was ousted in a 2006 coup on accusations of corruption and abuses of power. In interviews with Reuters last month, Thaksin said he was not seeking and would not seek political asylum in Britain as reported by some media, as he was eligible to visit Britain any time. The campaign against Thaksin is largely driven by the People's Alliance for Democracy -- an unelected group comprising royalists, academics and businessmen -- while he continues to enjoy support in the countryside. The PAD has occupied the official compound of the prime minister's offices since August, demanding the current government stocked with Thaksin loyalists step aside. Thailand's political crisis dates back to 2005 when the PAD launched its first street campaign against Thaksin, whom PAD accused of cronyism and abuse of power. It has meandered through a coup to elections and back to protests and shows no signs of resolution, to the dismay of investors worried about a lack of functioning government with a global economic recession looming. bd
