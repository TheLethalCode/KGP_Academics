 MARSEILLE, France, Nov 5(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Marseille secured their first points in this season's Champions League campaign by crushing PSV Eindhoven 3-0 on a soggy pitch on Tuesday. Ivory Coast striker Bakari Kone collected a fine through ball from France forward Hatem Ben Arfa to race into the box and open the scoring half an hour into the clash between the two bottom teams in Group D. Kone was also involved in Marseille's second goal, sending a cross that Senegal striker Mamadou Niang volleyed home from close range just after the hour. Niang was on target again for Marseille's third goal from another Ben Arfa pass on 71 minutes. Former European champions Marseille, who had lost their first three matches, join Eindhoven on three points with the two sides still hoping for at least third place in the group to continue in the UEFA Cup. Liverpool and Atletico Madrid lead the way on eight points after a 1-1 draw at Anfield. The match, a scruffy affair and a tight one until Marseille stepped up a gear in the second half, was a special occasion for Marseille coach Eric Gerets, a former PSV player and coach. "We will not give up and now and again, not too often, miracles happen," said Gerets, still dreaming of an unlikely top-two finish. "As long as we have a chance, we will keep fighting." RIGHTLY CRITICISED Marseille had undermined their chances with a 2-0 at Eindhoven last time out. "We were criticised after the first leg, and rightly so, but living in the past doesn't help," Gerets said. Eindhoven coach Huub Stevens, who once played alongside Gerets at PSV, said his side would focus on third place. "That's clearly our goal now," he said. "This is a bitter disappointment. We were well organised in the first half but we let them surprise us with counter-attacks after the break." Torrential rain in the Mediterranean port threatened to force a postponement but stopped two hours before kickoff and the game went ahead as planned. The visitors came close to equalising shortly before halftime when a header by Ecuador midfielder Edison Mendez bounced off the post. Marseille survived another fright early in the second half when keeper Steve Mandanda had to dive to prevent forward Danny Koevermans scoring from close range before Niang's quick strikes then killed off the match
