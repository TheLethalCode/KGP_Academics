<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Nov 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A son of Osama bin Laden arrived at Cairo airport on Saturday, a security source said, after his request for asylum in Spain was turned down. Omar bin Laden, who was travelling on a Saudi Arabian passport and failed to obtain a visa to enter Britain earlier this year, had been held since Monday at Madrid airport. He had stopped there on a flight from Cairo to Morocco and requested asylum. "Spanish law...has no provisions under which he would be given asylum," Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Spanish television. "As such, his claim for asylum and subsequent plea have been rejected." Spain's interior ministry rejected bin Laden's asylum plea because it does not consider he is in danger in Egypt. "The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees supports the Spanish government's position and consequently he will be sent back to the country he came from," Rubalcaba added. According to Spanish newspaper El Mundo, bin Laden left Madrid Airport at 1300 GMT on an easyJet flight bound for Cairo with his wife, British national Zaina al Sabah-Bin Laden, formerly known as Jane Felix-Browne. No one at Spain's interior ministry was available to confirm the report. Zaina al Sabah said in an interview with Reuters on Friday the couple fear they will be assassinated for condemning the views of Omar's father and the al Qaeda organisation he leads. "Spain is our only chance of surviving, our only chance of living," she said. "He has denounced 100 percent what his father does. The reason for his problems is that he stands up and asks for peace," she added. She said her husband, one of bin Laden's many sons, had stopped living with his father before he masterminded the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States seven years ago and made it clear to him he did not support violence. Omar Bin Laden has lodged another request for a British visa, although this will not be considered until February 2009, his wife said
