<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has called for collective and coordinated efforts by UN members to build an effective multilateral framework for overcoming global financial instability, a statement from Geneva said on Thursday. The president of the Trade and Development Board of UNCTAD in his speech at the second committee of the UN General Assembly in New York also stressed the need for involving developing countries in the process. Bangladesh's permanent representative to the WTO and UN Offices in Geneva, Debapriya Bhattacharya, pointed out that as global economic downturn would impact on trade, currencies and investment prospects of developing countries, their participation was a must in any effort to change the global financial construction. He also underscored the urgency in strengthening financial supervision and regulation to prevent a global recession, which would definitely push back the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). Debapriya mentioned that developing countries, particularly the least developed and African countries, faced mounting challenges in fulfilling the MDGs because of lack of development financing. Energy crisis, food insecurity and the commodity price volatility are the threats to attain the MDGs, he added. He cautioned that the MDGs would remain unfulfilled if assistance to these countries was not scaled up and their export flow lowered, and their productive capacities were not upgraded. He mentioned that a rule-based fair multilateral trading system would improve market access for products and services from developing countries and help them reach the MDGs
