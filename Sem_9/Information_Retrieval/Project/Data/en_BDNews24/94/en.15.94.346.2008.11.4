 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Remittance inflow in the 10 months to October has topped US $ 7.4 billion, up almost $1 billion on the previous year, an adviser says. "As of now US $7.4 billion has been received as against last year's total figure of US $6.6 billion which was a record," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told journalists on Tuesday at his office. The adviser said employment of workers abroad was also rising. "So far this year, 7,65,000 have been cleared for jobs abroad. "The number for the whole of 2007 was 8,32,000, which was a record. This year that record is also expected to be exceeded," he said. He termed Bangladesh's signing of the MoU with Libya on manpower export a success of the interim government. "We are constantly looking for new markets. Libya will now be an important destination," he said. "We are processing two more similar agreements on labour with Jordan and Bahrain," said the foreign adviser. bd
