 Kamran Reza Chowdhury senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has turned to China and South Korea as Myanmar authorities have been exploring oil and gas in the disputed waters in the Bay of Bengal despite Dhaka's protests. "I have had talks with the South Korean ambassador who assured me that Daewoo company is well aware of Bangladesh's position on the issue and taking appropriate steps," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com at his office on Thursday. Myanmar authorities awarded the exploration contract in the disputed waters, some 60 nautical miles off the Saint Martin's Island, to South Korean company Daewoo. He said Bangladesh naval ships would be patrolling the waters. Earlier, in the morning he told bdnews24.com: "We want to resolve the dispute through diplomacy, but we are ready for any eventuality." Bangladesh also briefed Beijing about the situation as China has huge influence over Myanmar, a reclusive country run by the military junta since early 1960s. On Wednesday, the adviser had talks with Chinese ambassador in Dhaka Zheng Qingdian on Bangladesh-Myanmar relations and Yangon's exploration in the disputed waters. "We have also spoken about the current situation between Bangladesh and Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal," Iftekhar told journalists after the meeting at the foreign ministry. "I have explained our peaceful intentions to our Chinese friend, and expressed our hope that Myanmar dismantles the installations on the disputed waters". A high-powered Bangladesh delegation, headed by foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain, on Thursday had talks with his Myanmar counterpart in its capital Yangon. But the foreign ministry officials would not say whether Myanmar authorities agreed to dismantle the installations and withdraw vessels from the disputed waters. "They (Myanmar vessels) are still there. We have no information about suspension of their exploration activities," acting foreign secretary M A K Mahmood told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Dhaka decided to urge governments of all workers engaged in the exploration to withdraw their citizens from the disputed area. The foreign adviser said he spoke to the foreign secretary on telephone to know about the meeting with the authorities there. "I cannot disclose the content of the discussion," the adviser told bdnews24.com. As per an agreement, the two countries pledged not to carry out oil and gas exploration in the disputed waters in the Bay until the disagreement was resolved. bd
