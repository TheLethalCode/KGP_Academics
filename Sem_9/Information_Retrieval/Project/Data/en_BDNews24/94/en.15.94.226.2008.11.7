 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Fri Nov 7, (bdnews24.Reuters) - Suspected US drones fired missiles into a Pakistan border region on Friday killing 13 militants, including five foreigners, officials said, the latest in a series of strikes that has infuriated Pakistan. There have been nearly 20 attacks by suspected missile-firing pilotless US drones since the beginning of September, but Friday's is the first since Tuesday's U.S. presidential election. Pakistan objects to the strikes as not only a violation of its sovereignty but counter-productive to its efforts against militants behind surging violence in Pakistan and Afghanistan. A senior government official in the region, Latif-ur-Rehman, told Reuters the missiles hit a militant compound in the Kamsham area of North Waziristan. "It was an accurate strike and the compound has been destroyed," said Rehman. At least 13 militants were killed, another senior government official and an intelligence agency official said. "It's remote so information is coming slowly but we can confirm that four missiles killed eight Pakistani Taliban and five guests," said the intelligence official, referring to five foreign militants. There was no information about the nationality of any of those killed but North Waziristan is known as a sanctuary for Taliban and al Qaeda militants. U.S. forces have stepped up attacks on militants in Pakistan in response to concern about worsening security in Afghanistan. Scores of people have been killed in missile strikes and a Sept. 3 cross-border commando raid, but no top al Qaeda or Taliban leaders have been reported to have died. Nuclear-armed U.S. ally Pakistan is also battling militants on its side of the border but says cross-border U.S. strikes undermine efforts to isolate the militants and rally public opinion behind the unpopular campaign against them. The United States has shrugged off Pakistani protests. It says the attacks protect U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Pakistan hopes the new U.S. administration will be more sensitive to its concerns, although President-elect Barack Obama made comments in his campaign suggesting he would take a hawkish approach toward the border area militants. AIR STRIKES The violence and tension with the United States have contributed to investor gloom, exacerbating an economic crisis that looks likely to force the civilian government to go to the International Monetary Fund for help. While the U.S. strikes have been focused on North and South Waziristan, Pakistani forces have for months been battling militants elsewhere in the northwest, in particular Bajaur, to the northeast of Waziristan on the Afghan border. The militants have responded with a series of bomb attacks. On Thursday, a suicide bomber attacked a meeting of about 200 pro-government ethnic Pashtun tribesmen drawing up plans to drive militants out of their area, killing 25 of them. Up to 40 militants were killed in air strikes launched in response to the bomb attack, said Fazl-e-Rabi Khan, a senior government administrator in Bajaur. There was no independent verification of his casualty estimate. The military has said more than 1,500 militants have been killed in Bajaur since fighting flared in August but there has also been no independent verification of that estimate. As part of efforts to tackle the militants entrenched in large parts of the Pashtun northwest, authorities are encouraging tribesmen to raise militias to force militants out. A similar strategy of supporting militias to evict insurgents has been used in Iraq, where Sunni tribesmen have risen up against al Qaeda and driven militants from their neighbourhoods
