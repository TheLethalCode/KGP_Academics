 KHAR, Pakistan, Thu Nov 6,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber attacked a meeting of pro-government Pakistani tribal elders in the Bajaur area on the Afghan border on Thursday, killing 10 people and wounding 30, government officials said. In a second suicide attack, a bomber detonated an explosive-laden car near police headquarters in the Swat Valley, also in the northwest, killing at least two people, security officials said. Pakistani soldiers have been fighting Islamist militants in Bajaur and Swat for months and the militants have responded with a series of bomb attacks. The violence has contributed to investor gloom, exacerbating an economic crisis that looks likely to force the civilian government of the nuclear-armed U.S. ally to go to the International Monetary Fund for help. As part of efforts to tackle the militants entrenched in large parts of the ethnic Pashtun northwest, authorities are encouraging tribesmen to raise militias to force out those who have been attacking the tribesmen. The first bomb attack was on a jirga, or traditional council, of about 200 men from the Salarzai Khar, drawing up a plan to drive militants out of their area, the officials said. "The bomber walked up to the jirga and set off explosives strapped to his body. Ten people were killed," a senior government official in Khar, the main town in the region, told Reuters by telephone. About 30 people were wounded. Several elders said the death toll was about 20 in the blast in Batmalai village, 20 km (12 miles) north of Khar. "WON'T DETER US" Tribal elder Kamal Khan said: "We don't know how and when he got there. We just heard a blast and then people started running here and there". Khan said the drive against the militants would go on. "This bombing won't deter us," he said. A suicide car bomber attacked a similar meeting in the Orakzai region, south of Bajaur, on October 10, killing more than 50 people and wounding more than 100. In the Swat Valley, northwest of Islamabad, a spokesman for Pakistani Taliban militants claimed responsibility for the suicide bomb attack outside police headquarters in the main town of Mingora that killed at least two people The military says well over 1,500 militants have been killed in fighting in the northwest since August. There is no independent verification of the estimate. Separately, authorities released a Taliban militant commander and three of his comrades in exchange for 10 soldiers abducted by militants near the northwestern town of Hangu, a government official said. In another incident, militants fired five rockets at the airport in the main northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday night but there were no casualties, police said. Three of the rockets fell on empty land near the airport. The other two landed inside the airport perimeter but caused no damage, they said
