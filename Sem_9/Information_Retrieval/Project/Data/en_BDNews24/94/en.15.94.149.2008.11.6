 KIEV, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Porto's Lucho Gonzalez headed a last-gasp goal to give his team a 2-1 come-from-behind win at Dynamo Kiev in Group G of the Champions League on Wednesday. Porto's victory and a goalless draw between Arsenal and Fenerbahce has left the qualifying places up for grabs with two games left. Arsenal are top with eight points ahead of Porto on six, Dynamo with five and Fenerbahce who have two. "I think this was a good answer to all our critics who had written Porto off," coach Jesualdo Ferreira told reporters. "We are always fighting for the highest places and we will continue to do it. "I think all four teams still have chances to qualify from the group. The experience of the Champions League shows that the second part of the group stage is more unpredictable and can deliver more surprises." The Portuguese went behind when Dynamo midfielder Tiberiu Ghioane's slick pass from the edge of the area found striker Artem Milevskiy, who skilfully slotted home after 21 minutes. Porto responded by increasing the pressure on the home side but could not find an equaliser before halftime. ATTACKING MOVE Dynamo coach Yuri Semin went in search of more goals by replacing Ghioane with striker Ismael Bangoura on the hour but nine minutes later Porto were level through a Rolando header. Both teams attacked in the last 15 minutes but it was Dynamo, whose strike force of Milevskiy, Olexandr Aliyev and Bangoura swarmed around Porto's goal, who almost regained the lead when Ognjen Vukojevic's powerful shot hit the post. However, the home side began to lose concentration in defence and Porto took advantage on the counter-attack when Lucho's late header from a Lisandro Lopez cross gave Porto the win they needed to have a chance of reaching the last 16. Lucho, who had already been booked, was shown a second yellow card for over-celebrating and was sent off. "We didn't make that many mistakeswe were just unlucky today," Dynamo coach Yuri Semin said. "It was a good game and I think our supporters should be pleased with our performance
