<TEXT>
 GLASGOW, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A late Ryan Giggs header capped off a second-half onslaught from Manchester United and earned a 1-1 draw with Celtic in a passionate Champions League Group E encounter on Wednesday. United went behind in the 13th minute when Scott McDonald scored the Glasgow club's first goal in the group with an exquisite lob on 13 minutes but Giggs earned a deserved point when he headed home from close range. The defending European champions should have snatched all three points at the death but Dimitar Berbatov screwed the ball wide from five yards with the goal at his mercy. "In the second half we kept our perseverance up and kept at them and we obviously deserved the point," United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said. "But with minutes to go you obviously think you are going to lose it. That's football and you keep thinking it's never going to be your night." Celtic had made a fine start when Australian striker McDonald latched onto a headed knockdown into the left of the box and from 14 metres lofted the ball over keeper Ben Foster and celebrated as it dropped neatly under the bar. But United surged back and Rio Ferdinand came close with a couple of chances in a fiercely fought first period. He brought down a high ball just four metres from goal on the left as a Ryan Giggs' corner finally squeezed through the Celtic defence, but Ferdinand then hooked his close range shot over the top on 19 minutes. Celtic's Shaun Maloney forced Foster into a good low save from 25 metres on the half hour before United responded again with Nemanja Vidic squandering a good chance from six metres by heading over the bar. United came close to levelling on 57 minutes when a close-range flick from Berbatov saw Maloney smuggle the ball off the line with Polish keeper Artur Boruc beaten. But Boruc did come to the rescue with 10 minutes left as he hurled himself down to his right to brilliantly parry a shot from distance by substitute Wayne Rooney. He then parried a Cristiano Ronaldo rocket shot from 25 metres into the air but was powerless to stop Giggs levelling as he threw himself at the ball six metres out to head the equaliser with six minutes remaining. "I could have taken 11 players off because they were all tired," Celtic manager Gordon Strachan said. We got out of here with our pride and that's what we wanted to win back." United and Villarreal are six points clear on eight points at the top of the group and are the warm favourites to progress with two rounds of matches remainin
