 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed VC of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Md Nazrul Islam, has said he would be do his best to run the hospital well. "We will try to offer better medical service," he said, as he took his office Wednesday amid demonstrations against his appointment. A number of newspapers reported on Tuesday that BNP leader Mosaddek Ali Falu secured bail by showing a false BSMMU medical report, during his treatment at the hospital. The government removed the top three BSMMU officials Tuesday night. Vice-chancellor Prof Mohammed Tahir, pro-VC Prof M A Majid and treasurer Prof Mobin Khan were dismissed. Prof Md Nazrul Islam of virology department had been appointed as the VC and Prof Chowdhury Ali Kawser of Pediatrics and Md Kamal Uddin of Pathology department had been made as the pro-VCs, and Prof Md Ruhul Amin Miah, chairman of microbiology department, were made treasurer. They took up their duties Wednesday. On the demonstrations, Islam said that the protestors were not his enemies. "There might be some misunderstanding. I hope it will disappear soon," he said. On the removal of the officials, health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com Wednesday: "This was the government's decision." Asked about calls for his resignation by BNP-backed doctors at the hospital, he said: "I don't want to say anything now as I am not aware of the matter." BNP-backed doctors and staff at the hospital demanded the resignation of the health adviser earlier in the day, alleging that the caretaker government had appointed officials backed by "another party" to the positions of vice-chancellor, pro-VC and treasurer. They observed a 'sit-in' in front of the VC's office from 11am on Wednesday. The demonstrators also held a protest gathering at the BSMMU auditorium earlier.

"The way these people were removed is offending for the doctors' community. The incident has also tainted the neutral image of the government." "We are protesting the new appointments," said Saiful Islam, professor of neurology department. The demonstrators said that they would continue their sit-in programme till 2.30pm. They will also submit a memorandum to the chief adviser, Islam said. Though the demonstrators are BNP adherents, they are holding their protest under the banner 'integrated doctors-nurse-staff council'. Abdul Kuddus, associate professor of BSMMU eye department, said the newly appointed people were adherents of Awami League. "If the recruitment is neutral we will accept it. But if not, we want the resignation of the health adviser," he said. Dr Iqbal Arsalan, secretary general of Swadhinata Chikitshok Parishad backed by AL, said that the three newly appointed officials were not members of SCP as alleged. BSMMU Teachers' Association welcomed the new appointment. "We submitted a memorandum to the health adviser on Aug 2 protesting irregularities in the hospital and demanded the resignation of the VC, pro-VC and treasurer," the association's general secretary Dr Kamrul Hassan said. He alleged that the demonstrators were members of DAB and the people who were removed were also par
