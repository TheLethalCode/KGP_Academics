<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)- Graeme Smith will miss Wednesday's Twenty20 against Bangladesh in Johannesburg to enable him to concentrate on his rehabilitation programme after his elbow injury. Johan Botha, who led South Africa to a 2-0 victory over Kenya over the weekend, will continue as captain. South Africa will be boosted by the return of pace spearhead Dale Steyn, who missed the Kenya ODIs after suffering from severe headaches since mid-September. The hosts go into the match with five quick bowlers: Steyn, the Morkel brothers and two newcomers, Rory Kleinveldt and Johann Louw. "Graeme is keen to get back on the field in the one-day games but it depends on the medical team," media officer Michael Owen-Smith said. "He will definitely play in the Test series." Gerald Majola, the acting convener of the selection committee, said no replacement had been named for Smith in the squad. "We do not want to disrupt franchises preparing for the next round of SuperSport Series matches starting on Thursday," he said. Besides the Twenty20 match, South Africa take on Bangladesh in three one-dayers and two Tests this month. South Africa team : Johan Botha (capt), Loots Bosman, AB de Villiers (wk), JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Rory Kleinveldt, Johann Louw, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Justin Ontong, Dale Steyn.
