 JOHANNESBURG, Wed Nov 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former South African President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday praised Barack Obama's victory in the US presidential election and urged him to fight poverty and disease throughout the world. "Your victory has demonstrated that no person anywhere in the world should not dare to dream of wanting to change the world for a better place," the anti-apartheid icon wrote to Obama in a letter released by the Nelson Mandela Foundation. "We note and applaud your commitment to supporting the cause of peace and security around the world. We trust that you will also make it the mission of your Presidency to combat the scourge of poverty and disease everywhere."
