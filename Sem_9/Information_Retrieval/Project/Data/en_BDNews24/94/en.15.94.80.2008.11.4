 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The two freed BRAC officials, Md Shahjahan Ali and Akhter Ali, abducted in Afghanistan last month, arrived back home on Tuesday evening. "The two flew back from Kabul, landing at Zia International Airport at 8pm," BRAC director of public relations Anwarul Huq told bdnews24.com. Shahjahan and Akhter, area managers for BRAC Afghanistan, were kidnapped on Oct 23 from the Afghan province of Ghazni, where they both had been working for the past three years. They were set free on Nov 2. One of the world's largest NGOs by staff, BRAC has said it is moving to withdraw all of its 150 Bangladeshi staff from Afghanistan over the next five years in light of the recent abduction. This was the third such incident involving BRAC staff in Afghanistan in just over a year. Abdul Alim, a BRAC official, was killed on Sept 12 last year by unidentified gunmen. Just three days later, another BRAC executive, Nurul Islam, was abducted before being released after 83 days. There were 392 Bangladeshi BRAC staff when the abduction of Nurul Islam took place; the number of Bangladeshi staff was then reduced to 150, BRAC officials said. bdnews
