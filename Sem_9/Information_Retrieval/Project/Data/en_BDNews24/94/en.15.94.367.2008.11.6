<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 6(bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday ordered the government to place four test reports on toxic melamine in powdered milk on Nov. 9. The bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Quamrul Islam Siddiqui passed the order on an appeal by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh, a human-rights organisation. The court also granted petitions of powdered milk brands Dano, Dilpoma and Red Cow, and Nestl to become parties in the case. Advocate Manjil Morshed for the human-rights organisation, deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil on behalf of the state, barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud for Nestl, barrister Tania Amir for Dano, advocate Mahmudul Islam for Diploma and Red Cow argued in the court. Advocate Morshed said Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute (BSTI), the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC), and institutes in Thailand found melamine in the brands. But there was no consistency in the reports. Besides, the technical committee, formed on consensus to probe the melamine incident, has yet to make a decision. He also said Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission (BAEC) had found melamine in seven brands of powdered milk, but the government denied its existence. The toxic substance was also found in eight milk powder brands in tests by Department of Chemistry, University of Dhaka and in three brands in tests by the BSTI and labs in Thailand. Advocate Morshed said there had been no transparency in collecting samples of powdered milk for testing and so, the test reports were not beyond question. Besides, he said, the copies of these reports were not made public. It would be easier to make a decision in the case if these reports were placed before the court, the lawyer said. Deputy attorney general Jalil said melamine was found in three powdered milk brands after the government had sent seven milk powder samples for test in Thailand. Barrister Mahmud said no trace of melamine was found in the powder milk 'Nestle' sent by government for testing in Thailand. Earlier, the High Court had directed the government to put a freeze on sale and display of the brands pending the reports. Since the test reports have been made available, the court should lift that order, he said. Barrister Amir said melamine was found in three Chinese brands of powder milk, but not in Dano. So, she contended, the court should cancel the order that banned sale and display of the brands. Advocate Islam said mothers were not getting powdered milks in the market to feed their children due to the court ban. The court wanted to know which brands had been sent abroad for testing. The HC directed the government to take immediate steps to stop sale and display of those brands. The brands sent abroad for testing are Diploma, Red Cow, Dano, Yashli-1, Yashli-2, Sweet Baby, Nido and Enline. Eight lawyers on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed a contempt of court case against the commerce secretary, home secretary, health secretary and inspector general of police on Oct. 27. bdne
