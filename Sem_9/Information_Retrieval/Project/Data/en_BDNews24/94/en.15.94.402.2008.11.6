 NAGPUR, India, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Sachin Tendulkar has been rested for the first three matches of a seven-match one-day series against England starting at Rajkot on Nov 14. "Considering the hectic schedule ahead and the amount of cricket he has already played this season, Sachin Tendulkar requested that he be rested for the first three ODIs," an Indian board statement said on Wednesday. Indian selectors named a 15-man squad for the matches at Rajkot, Indore (Nov 17) and Kanpur (Nov 20) with Murali Vijay the only new face.

The other four one-dayers will be played at Bangalore, Cuttack, Guwahati and New Delhi. England arrive on Thursday and will also play two tests in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in December. The team: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Yusuf Pathan, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Ishant Sharma, Pragyan Ojha, Rudra Pratap Singh, Virat Kohli, Murali Vija
