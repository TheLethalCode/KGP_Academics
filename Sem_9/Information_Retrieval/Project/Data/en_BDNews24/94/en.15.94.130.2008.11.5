<TEXT>
 ROME, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals by Mirko Vucinic guided AS Roma to a surprise 3-1 win over last season's runners-up Chelsea in the Champions League on Tuesday. Former Chelsea defender Christian Panucci tapped in the first from close range on 34 minutes and Montenegro striker Vucinic struck twice at the start of the second half as Roma ended a run of five consecutive defeats. The Londoners pulled one back through captain John Terry in the 75th before having midfielder Deco sent off for a second yellow card five minutes later. Chelsea stay top of Group A with seven points from four games, one point ahead of Roma and Girondins Bordeaux. "It's a result that gives us a little breather, a little tranquillity," Roma coach Luciano Spalletti told a news conference. "The lads were exceptional. They immediately measured up the opposition. They won an important game and deserved it." Chelsea appeared in complete control until the unmarked Panucci strolled through a sleepy defence to convert a right-wing cross from close range. GOOD SAVES The visitors had enjoyed most of the possession, forcing good saves out of Brazilian keeper Doni from long-range efforts by Deco and Frank Lampard (twice). But the goal lifted the Serie A side's confidence and Vucinic drove the ball in from outside the box three minutes after the break to make it 2-0. He then capped off a long run down the left with a cool finish in the 58th with Chelsea's defence scattered. Terry, who scored the winner in the 1-0 home win over Roma two weeks ago, pulled one back when he converted a left-wing cross from three metres. "We didn't play well. We made mistakes at critical times and Roma killed the game," said Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari. "No one followed Panucci and he scored. After this Roma played with four or five in midfield and controlled the game." Scolari was still upbeat about his side's chances of reaching the knockout stages. "If we win one more game we are there. We'll have 10 points." One Italian was arrested and three English fans and a policeman were injured in minor incidents before the game, the ANSA news agency reported. A Roma supporter was also receiving hospital treatment after falling four metres while celebrating
