<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's outgoing Prime Minister Helen Clark said she would stand down as the leader of the Labor Party following its defeat in Saturday's election. The center-right National Party, led by John Key, won 45 percent of the votes to defeat the ruling center-left Labor Party, which got 34 percent of the vote. National, along with support parties ACT and United Future, will be able to command a majority in the 122 seat parliament and is expected to form the next government. Clark had served as New Zealand's premier for nine years, and her Labor Party was seeking a fourth three-year term. Clark said she expected Labor to elect a new leader by Christmas.
