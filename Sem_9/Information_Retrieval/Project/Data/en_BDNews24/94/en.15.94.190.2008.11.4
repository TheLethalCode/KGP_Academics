 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League will nominate also the leaders who have been convicted under the Emergency Powers Rules and detained in jail, the acting chief says. "We will nominate the party leaders convicted under the Emergency Powers Rules and those detained in jails because constitution is more powerful than the election rules," Zillur Rahman said. Before speaking to reporters he had a meeting with the members of Bangladesh Muktijuddho Projonmo League (liberation war generation) at his Gulshan home on Tuesday. Zillur said, "Awami League will not go to election without the permanent release of (president) Sheikh Hasina." About BNP's participation in the polls, he said, "We hope BNP will come to election." Earlier, Zillur urged the government from the meeting to push back Upazila election, slated for Dec. 28, by a month. He said the grassroots leaders were busy with Upazila election, which was why the party was asking government to defer the local body polls. bdnews24
