 MANCHESTER, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's game at Arsenal on Saturday is 'critical' to their chances of retaining the Premier League title, manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday. The spotlight has fallen on Arsenal following a run of three games without a win and manager Arsene Wenger's complaints about what he perceived as the over-physical approach of Stoke City last weekend, when Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott were added to a lengthy injury list during a shock 2-1 defeat. But with a five-point gap between United and leaders Liverpool and Chelsea, Ferguson is adamant the clash between the two great rivals at the Emirates Stadium is as important to his team as it is to Arsenal's attempts to steady the ship. "I think it's critical for us. We've got to win our games. We've got to be consistent between now and the end of the season," Ferguson told reporters. "We've got points to make up on Liverpool and Chelsea. There's no way I am going to be thinking about what's important for Arsenal. This is important for Manchester United. "We've every right to contest for the Championship, the same as Arsenal or anyone else and we've got to fight for the right to win tomorrow. "If you think that we are going to play at the Emirates Stadium tomorrow thinking it's going to be easy because Arsenal have got one or two players out you are wrong. This will be a tough game, as it always is." United have their own injury concerns with Wes Brown ruled out for a fortnight with an ankle injury and Darren Fletcher rated as 50-50 for Saturday's game because of a knee problem. Paul Scholes has resumed training and is in line for a comeback in the middle of December, but Owen Hargreaves has been sent to see specialist Dr Richard Steadman in the U.S. in a bid to remedy a long-standing tendonitis problem in his knee. "We are trying to get to the root of it," said Ferguson. "We have been frustrated and patient. We really need to speed that up now. "That is why we have sent him to the best available people to try and get a general opinion about where we go from here. It is frustrating for the lad. We want to try and help him." Ferguson welcomed moves from Arsenal to increase security measures around the opposition dug-out at the Emirates Stadium after he was the subject of verbal abuse from some home supporters in the corresponding game last season. "Quite rightly, because it was nasty last year. It was pretty unsavoury. "You build a modern stadium like Arsenal have done, it's a weakness in the planning that you don't provide safety for the visiting substitutes and staff. It's too open for my liking.
