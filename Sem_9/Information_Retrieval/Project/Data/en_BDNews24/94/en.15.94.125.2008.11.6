<TITLE> College campuses revel in pivotal political role </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Los Angeles, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - On American college campuses, where some two out of three students voted from Democrat Barack Obama, it wasn't so much "get out the vote" in this election but rather "text out the vote." The savvy use of text messaging and Facebook networking combined with a political activism not seen at universities in decades roused what may be the biggest youth voter turnout since 1972, according to exit polls. That turnout on Tuesday was a key to Democrat Barack Obama's decisive victory in the U.S. presidential race, with 66 percent of 18-29-year-olds voting for him. "We're the most diverse generation in American history, and this is our candidate," said University of California Berkeley freshman Ian Magruder, 18, who worked on the Obama campaign. In his victory speech on Tuesday night, the 46-year-old African American president-elect thanked "the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy." In past elections, the youth vote fell short of expectations, reinforcing the belief that young people could not make a difference at the polls. This time, they accounted for a larger share of the electorate than the over-65 age group, with 18 percent of the 133 million votes cast. "The youth vote has fulfilled its promise," said John Della Volpe, polling director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. At Berkeley, the political hotbed that inspired youth around the world in the 1960s, students took in Obama's historic victory on Tuesday night on screens in the shadow of the iconic Campanile bell tower. "This (election) season has been the most energized I've ever seen on campus," said Janeen Jackson, event coordinator at the university's Institute for Government. Voting experts are reluctant to give too much credit to Obama -- his youth, charisma and mixed race -- for attracting the vote. But college students across the nation all talked about how the Illinois senator inspired them to get involved. Bryon Eagon, 20, took off a semester from University of Wisconsin at Madison to work for Obama, citing his "unique ability to connect with our generation" on issues like the war, affordable education, health care and green jobs. THE POST 9/11 VOTER But Nicholas Shea, general manager of the Columbia Political Union, a nonpartisan group that encourages student political participation, said it was not about Obama's age. "The mentality of people of my generation is this postmodern view that they reject the idea of good and bad parties," said Shea. "They are adverse to partisanship and they see Obama reflecting that." Although these students might not think about it, the 9/11 attacks in 2001 could have been a major catalyst for getting young people back in politics after years of dormancy. The youth vote has been on the rise since 2004. "We saw massive changes before and after 9/11 because the issues were so important," Della Volpe said. "We went from crime and education policy as important issues to life and death and terrorism and Iraq." Instead of rebelling against the system, like the students of the 1960s and 70s did with sit-ins and street protests against the Vietnam War, this generation decided to go to the heart of it. UC Berkeley sociology professor Martin Sanchez-Jankowski said current Berkeley students aim "to be very active within the system to bring about some kind of change." Working the system meant students for both Obama and Republican contender John McCain ramped up peer-to-peer contacts on campuses. Their tool of choice? Text messaging -- so skillfully employed by today's youth -- was the clear favorite. "The cost to mobilize a voter using text messaging is about $1.50 per vote, which is 15 times as efficient as to do it over the telephone," said Della Volpe. Obama in particular understood the power of texting -- using it to announce his vice president and even to thank his supporters before his victory speech on Tuesday. For some students who took time off to campaign or engage friends, it may be back to the books now. But Sujatha Jahagirdar, program director for Student PIRGs New Voters' Project, believes young people are hooked and will use their political mobilization skills for years to come. "They are not going to disappear," she said. "Once you have felt like you have made an impact, it is hard to go back."
