 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Jatiya Sangsad Secretariat will repossess the two houses, used as special jails for two former prime ministers, within a month, the speaker said on Tuesday. Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar told bdnews24.com that the secretariat would take control of the two buildings in the parliament complex immediately, if necessary. According to an agreement the jail authorities should return the houses to the parliament secretariat after the announcement of the polls schedules. Regretting his decision to hand the houses of the speaker and the deputy speaker to prisons authorities, Sircar said, "I will take the houses back from the [Public Works Department] by next month." The two houses, approximately 200 metres from the parliament building, had been built for housing the speaker and his deputy and now belong to the PWD under the Ministry of Housing and Public Works. The jail authorities handed the buildings back to the PWD after former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia were released. The speaker said he had given the houses to the jail authorities for "technical" reasons. He however admitted that the decision "battered my image to some extent." Politicians harshly criticised Sircar for letting a building turned into jail on parliament premises. The interim administration of Fakhruddin Ahmed arrested Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on July 16 last year and kept her confined in one of the houses until she was released on June 11 this year on parole. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia spent over a year inside the other house from Sept. 3 last year to Sept. 11. bd
