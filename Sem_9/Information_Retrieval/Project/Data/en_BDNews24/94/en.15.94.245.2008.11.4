 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com) Revenue from previously undeclared income nosedived to a paltry Tk 105 crore this year thanks, according to the top taxman, to a lacklustre response from the rich. Last year, a similar government gesture during July-Sept garnered over Tk 803 crore. NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid says a review of the available statistics reveals the rich were reluctant to come forward. "This time round, the middle classes mainly availed the opportunity," Mazid told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "Last year, there were many more returns from the upper classes," he said. Not just the volume, the number of such payers was also down this year. An NBR statement said a total of 14,216 tax payers "legalised" Tk 782 crore they had not declared before. They paid an extra 7 percent in penalty on top of the regular rate. Last year, 42,591 people showed up to declare previously undisclosed earnings. They "whitened" a Tk 8895 crore, giving the government Tk 803.24 crore in fines and taxes. "No one will be spared," said Mazid, when asked if NBR planned any action against those failing to take the chance. "Very soon, NBR teams will be knocking their doors." "We have evidence ... we know who these people are ... whose earnings are not declared." b
