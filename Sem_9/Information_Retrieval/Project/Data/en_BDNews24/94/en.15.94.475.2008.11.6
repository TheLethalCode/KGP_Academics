<TITLE> Frustration for Arsenal as Fenerbahce hang on </TITLE>

 LONDON, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal's hopes of securing an early place in the last 16 of the Champions League ended in frustration on Wednesday as Group G's bottom club Fenerbahce clung on for a 0-0 draw at the Emirates. After a disappointing week in the Premier League left them off the pace in the title race, the Gunners appeared to run out of ideas against a Fenerbahce side they destroyed 5-2 in Istanbul a fortnight ago. They remain top of the group with two matches remaining but Porto's victory in Kiev means things have suddenly got a lot tighter than they might have been. "Fenerbahce were very defensive, they spent their time in their own half," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters. "They were well organised and defended well in the final third.

Arsenal's one moment of alarm came early in the second half when Ugur Boral broke clear but his shot was turned around the post by Fabianski, drafted in when Manuel Almunia was taken ill. The second half petered out as Arsenal's elaborate approach play failed to deliver any end product. To make matters worse defender Mikael Silvestre left the field with a suspected broken nose after being caught by a flailing arm. Wenger said the Frenchman could be doubtful for the game against United. Fenerbahce, quarter-finalists last season, showed little desire to go forward, although the draw keeps their slender chance of reaching the knockout round hanging by a threa
