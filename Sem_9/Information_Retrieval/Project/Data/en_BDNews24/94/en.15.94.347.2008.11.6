<TITLE> US accepts some amendments to troops pact: Iraq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Thu Nov 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States has accepted some Iraqi proposals to change a pact governing the presence of US troops, but had reservations about others, necessitating further talks, Iraq said Thursday. "America has responded and the Iraqi side has received the American response. They had some remarks on some of the amendments, which now requires meetings with the Americans to reach a common understanding," government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told Reuters. "The mood is positive," he added. The pact would replace a UN Security Council mandate which expires at the end of this year and must be approved by the Iraqi parliament, leaving little time for further negotiations. Baghdad has said it would seek an extension of the UN mandate if a final deal cannot be reached. After months of talks, Baghdad and Washington initially agreed a text last month. But before signing off on it, Iraq's cabinet demanded amendments, including tighter language that would commit US forces to withdrawing by the end of 2011 and clarify when US troops could be tried in Iraqi court. Dabbagh would not comment on which amendments had been accepted and which rejected. A US embassy spokeswoman was not immediately able to comment on the issue
