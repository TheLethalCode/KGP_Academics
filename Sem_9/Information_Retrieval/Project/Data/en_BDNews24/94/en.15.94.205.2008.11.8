<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Nov 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark has conceded defeat to the center-right National Party led by John Key after Saturday's election, media reported. Clark had telephoned Key to concede that her Labor Party had lost the election, Television New Zealand said. With almost 99 percent of the vote counted, Key's center-right National Party had 45 percent of the vote, which would translate to 59 seats in the 122-seat parliament with support from its allied parties enough to give it a majority. The center-left Labor Party, which had been seeking a fourth three-year term, had 34 percent of the vote, translating to 43 seats.
