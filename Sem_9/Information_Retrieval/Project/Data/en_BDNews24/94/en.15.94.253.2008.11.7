<TITLE> Meet demands, BNP will run polls: Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Nov 7 (bdnews24.com)  BNP will go to the polls if authorities meet the seven-point charter of demands, Khaleda Zia said at a rally on Friday, without ruling out her party joining the Dec.18 general election. "We want to go to polls but a congenial atmosphere has not yet been created. An environment congenial for a fair election would be created if the seven-point demands are met." "They say they have accepted all demands but there is no sign of implementaiton," she told a huge public rally organised by local BNP at Laldighi ground. The speech sounded to be one of election canvassing as she pledged a raft of measures if elected to office for a third term. She softened her stance on the resignation of the Election Commission hierarchy, saying the present commission was not neutral. "The previous Election Commission faced much criticism. Now some are saying that election must be held on December 18 even if some parties do not take part in it. "If so then why the January 22, 2007 election was not held?" she thundered. She accused the caretaker government of trampling the people's political rights. "I have come here to reclaim the people's rights snatched in last two years. "No matter how much conspiracy is webbed, you know what is true and what is false." She said a level playing field has not been created. "Forty leaders of BNP are still in detention. Does this mean a level playing field has been created?" Khaleda said she had done no injustice. "I was confined to the special jail for one year. I don't know why I was kept detained." "If the country moved ahead in exchange for the injustice done to me I would not have any grievance." Criticising the caretaker government, she said, "They have turned the country into a bigger jail. People are being intimidated and false cases filed against them." In an indirect reference to her main political rival Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, she shad, "I did not flee abroad." "Man makes mistake. We also made mistakes. But our successes outweigh our mistakes," she said. Khaleda arrived at the Laldighi ground at 4pm after driving to the port city at 1:45pm amid thousands of cheering masses greeting her. The rally at Laldighi ground formally started at 3pm. Chittagong city BNP convenor former member of parliament Syed Wahidul Alam presided over the rally. She went directly to the circuit house for rest and refreshments and later exchanged views with the local BNP leaders on a number of issues. The BNP chief is expected to quell the long-running feud between local BNP's two rival groups led by Abdullah Abu Noman and Mir Nasir Uddin, party sources said. The rally over, she went to the houses of four leaders of Chittagong BNP and exchanged greetings with their family members. On her way to Dhaka she drove to the house of Chittagong City BNP convenor Syed Wahidul Alam's Panchlaish house. From there she went to Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's residence at Rahmatganj Goods Hills, Abdullah Al Noman's Katalganj home and Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury's house at Mehedibagh. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's brother Giasuddin Quader Chowdhury was present at the former's home during the visit. This is Khaleda's first visit to Chittagong since the current military-installed interim government took power and her release on bail from detention on a slew of graft charges. The local administration beefed up security ahead of the visit and the public meeting. Earlier, Khaleda led a huge convoy of hundreds of vehicles packed with the party leaders and workers from Dhaka on way to the port city. The Chittagong city BNP made massive preparations ahead of the public meeting. The former prime minister in SSF cordon waved to tens of thousands of her cheering supporters lining both sides of the streets at Farmgate, Naya Paltan, Shapla Chattar, Tikatuly, Saidabad and Jatrabari in the city. The convoy then passed through the cheering crowds holding banners and festoons at Siddhirgonj, Kanchpur bridge intersection, Meghna bridge, Daudkandi, Gouripur, Ilyotgonj, Chandina, Nimsar Bazaar and Moynamoti along the Dhaka-Chittagong highway. In the morning, she placed wreath at the grave of late president Ziaur Rahman and joined a "National Revolution and Solidarity Day" programme in the capital. Khaleda had her last public relations programme on Dhaka-Comilla highway during the campaign for the forestalled Jan. 22, 2007 election. bdnews2
