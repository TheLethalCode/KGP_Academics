 Dhaka, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty on Wednesday said he did not foresee any change in US foreign policy toward Bangladesh. "I don't see any change in the foreign policy as far as Bangladesh is concerned," Moriarty told reporters at a ceremony marking the US presidential election at Hotel Westin. The US policy on Bangladesh is based on 3Ds  democracy, development and denial of space to terrorists. "There will be no change in policy based on the 3Ds," a US embassy official told bdnews24.com. The ambassador said Barack Obama was elected president for his individual capabilities. "The voters of the United States looked at Senator Obama not as black man but as a candidate. And they elected him as candidate not as a black man. And that says it all," the ambassador told bdnews24.com. "There is some racism in the United States as there is in any country. But majority of the people in the country are willing to look at a candidate as an individual person, to look at the strength he brings to the office, that's the matter," Moriarty said. The US embassy arranged ceremony to celebrate the presidential polls. Politicians, intellectuals, diplomats, journalists and other professionals were invited to the hotel to celebrate the historic election. They took part in a mock vote exercised by the Bangladeshis only. Obama bagged 228 votes while John McCain got only 8 votes. "This is a historic day for America and the whole world," Prof Anisuzzaman told journalists. "Obama's win will give the world a new dimension and the desired change," Gano Forum president Kamal Hossain told reporters. bd
