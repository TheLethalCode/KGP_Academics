 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government plans to repair two units of Ghorashal and Khulna power plants by private firms and run them under a joint public-private venture. A meeting at the power, energy and mineral resources ministry on Tuesday discussed the status of the power plants built and maintained by the Power Division and headway with the installation of some other independent power plants. "The policy being prepared for public-private partnership says that the power plants that have increased gas demand, shut down frequently and with low production will be repaired by the private firms and after rehabilitation, run by joint initiative," Power Division secretary M Fauzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com. He said the two power plants would be repaired and run under the policy which would soon be tabled before the interim cabinet for approval. The draft policy says these plants would be run under public-private joint initiative after repair and rehabilitation. The government would ensure purchase of power from these plants and supply them energy. Power Division officials said rehabilitation and modernisation of two units of Ghorashal power plant are underway. Sunday's meeting directed officials to move to cancel contract with the Russian firm implementing the project. The production capacity of a number of power plants has gone down. These power plants shut down frequently and being old, consume more energy than before. As the cost of running these plants have increased the Power Division has taken initiative to get them serviced by private firms, the officials said. bdnew
