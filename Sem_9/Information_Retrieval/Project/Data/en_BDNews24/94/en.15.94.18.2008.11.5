 NAGPUR, India, Nov 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are preparing to give off-spinner Jason Krejza a baptism of fire by handing him his first cap in the fourth and final test against India. The world's top-ranked side have not lost a series home or away since the 2005 Ashes in England but trail the hosts 1-0 in the four-match series going into the final test, which starts on Thursday. "Being 1-0 down in a series with one match to play is a position a lot of us have not been before," Ponting told a news conference on Wednesday. "(But) we pride ourselves on playing well in big games. This is a great opportunity for all of us to stand up and play better cricket than we played in the first three test matches." The last time Australia trailed and lost a series was in Sri Lanka in 1999 under Steve Waugh's captaincy. Skipper Ponting said Krejza, 25, was likely to make his debut at the new test venue on a pitch that he felt would assist spin later in the game. He would replace either leg-spinner Cameron White or one of the fast bowlers. Australia are also keen to capitalise on the absence of India's in-form opener Gautam Gambhir, who's one-test ban was upheld by the International Cricket Council's appeal commissioner on Tuesday. GOOD STARTS India's new captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni told reporters Murali Vijay, who was called up as cover for Gambhir, could make his debut. "Gambhir, along with Virender Sehwag, has been responsible for getting India off to good starts. Without him it gives us more opportunity to put pressure on the Indian middle order," Ponting said. Left-handed Gambhir has tallied 463 runs in the series, including 206 in the third test where he was penalised for elbowing Australian Shane Watson. Vijay earned a test call-up after scoring a double century in a domestic match this week. In the third test Australia scored 577 in reply to India's first innings total of 613 for seven and gave the hosts a scare by reducing them to 93 for four at one stage. The final test will be former captain Saurav Ganguly's last and batsman Vangipurappu Laxman's 100th. Ponting felt this could distract the hosts further after Anil Kumble announced his retirement at the end of the third test. Both teams have yet to get a feel of the new stadium, having practiced at a different facility over the last two days, although the captains have visited the match venue. Dhoni said the conditions at the venue would assist reverse swing as it did in Mohali where the hosts won the second test by 320 runs. "Reverse (swing) will be crucial. The new ball with the shine doesn't really do too much (in India)," Dhoni said. "The only option is to maintain the ball and get it to reverse swing. We have been consistent at that over the last few games.
