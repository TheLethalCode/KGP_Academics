 Dhaka, Nov 8 (bdnews24.com) - National football team captain Motiur Munna looks forward to improving the performance in the 3rd Grand Royal Challenge Cup to be held in Myanmar from Nov 11 to 21. "Our main object in Myanmar is to put up better performance against the opponents than what we showed in Mardeka Cup in Malaysia," said Munna on verge of the team's departure on Saturday. A 18-member team is scheduled to leave here for Myanmar on Saturday midnight. "The result will automatically come if we can perform consistently," said the midfielder. "I think all players are mentally fit to show their best against Myanmar and Indonesia." Bangladesh, under the supervision of Argentine coach Andres Cruciani, became runners-up in the second Grand Royal Challenge Cup. Coach Shafiqul Islam Manik brought a slight change in his squad that played in Malaysia with ace striker Alfaz Ahmed, midfielder Jahed Parvez Chowdhury and stopper Atiqur Rahman Mishu returning to the fold. Manik said he just wants to see how the players could implement his strategy on the field. "You will agree that the three-day training is not enough for an international tournament where other teams are higher status than us, but I will be pleased if the boys can show performance in line with the strategy," said Manik after the final training at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Manik might miss the services from Alfaz and Rajani Kanta Barman who have been nursing muscle injuries. Bangladesh will take on hosts Myanmar in the inaugural Group A match on Nov 11 before playing the final-group match against Indonesia on Nov 13. Group B includes Vietnam, Malaysia and Hyundai FC (Korea). Bangladesh squad: Aminul Haq, Biplob Bhattacharya, Rajani Kanta Barman, Mohammad Sujan, Wali Faisal, Ariful Islam, Nazrul Islam, Enamul Haq Sharif, Mofazzal Hossain Saikat, Mamunul Islam, Jahid Hasan Emily, Mohammad Robin, Motiur Munna, Arman Aziz, Alfaz Ahmed, Atiqur Rahman Miishu and Jahed Parvez Chowdhury. Officials: Badal Roy (manager), Shafiqul Islam Manik (head coach), Golam Rabbani Choton (assistant coach), Dr Mahfuz Ullah Chishti, Ahmed Saeed Al Fattah (media manager) and Mohammad Mohsin (coaching staff). bd
