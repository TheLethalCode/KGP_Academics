 Dhaka, Nov 6 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission has referred the allegations of Trust Bank money laundering against its chairman to the cabinet secretary, an official said on Thursday . "The allegation brought against the chairman after being presented to the two commissioners has been sent to the cabinet secretary as per section 36 of the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004," ACC director general (administration) Col Hanif Iqbal said at a regular media briefing. Iqbal on Monday said it would be looked into whether the ACC had the jurisdiction to investigate the allegations. Section 36 of the ACC Act says, "If any problem arises in the implementation due to the ambiguity in the rules of this Act regarding the power and responsibility of the Commission, the government can seek guidelines about what should the Commission do by issuing gazette notification keeping with the other rules to clarify the rule or explain it." Former energy adviser to the past BNP-led coalition government Mahmudur Rahman on Oct. 27 brought the allegations against Chowdhury and sent those to the ACC office by registered post for investigation. Rahman, a staunch critic of the government's antigraft drive, made an abortive attempt to file a case on Oct. 25. He alleged the former army chief as chairman of Trust Bank showed loss in money transaction and laundered about Tk 22.41 crore of the Bank. Chowdhury at a press conference on Oct. 26 denied the allegation of money laundering. He also said he would fight a legal battle with Rahman. He, however, acknowledged the incident of "financial loss" in Trust Bank. bdne
