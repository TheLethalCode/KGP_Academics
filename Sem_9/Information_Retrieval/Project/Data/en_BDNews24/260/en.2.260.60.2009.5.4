 KATHMANDU, Mon May 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda resigned on Monday after a crisis sparked by his sacking of the country's army chief, plunging the Himalayan republic into a political turmoil. The one-year-old Maoist-led government fired General Rookmangud Katawal on Sunday, accusing him of disobeying instructions not to hire new recruits and refusing to accept the supremacy of the civilian government.

The assembly abolished Nepal's 239-year-old monarchy and declared the impoverished mountain nation a republic. Prachanda led an insurgency against the monarchy in the jungles around the Himalayan foothills.
