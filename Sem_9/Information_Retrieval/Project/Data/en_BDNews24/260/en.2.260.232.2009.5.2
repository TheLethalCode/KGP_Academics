 MADRID, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid's status as the club of choice for Spanish nationalists and Barcelona's role as a cultural and political symbol for Catalunya ensure "El Clasico" is one of the most intensely disputed fixtures in world sport. Spain is expected to grind to a halt when the country's two biggest and richest clubs clash again at Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Saturday (1800 GMT) with Real fans dreaming they can overhaul their bitter rivals. "The country is paralysed. Shops are shuttered, the streets are empty. For 90 minutes the country only thinks about football," said radio journalist Maria Bretones on Friday. Bretones, who has been covering Real Madrid for 16 years, said Real-Barca matches were what the sports media worked towards for the whole year.

Real and Barca fed off their rivalry and neither could exist without the other, she added. "There are always extremists who want to spoil things but it's essentially a clean and honest historical rivalry with a lot of respect between the two clubs. "It's like bullfighting. The one with most respect for the bull is the fighter. But in this case the fight is more equal." Asked by Reuters what the clash meant to him when he was growing up, Ramos said: "The Clasicos are still the ones that get people's attention." Real Madrid's honorary president Alfredo di Stefano, widely considered one of the greatest players of all time and a veteran of many Clasicos in the 1950s and 60s, said last week Real's recent run of victories had been "an heroic act". "Madrid has to win this time but there is a big difference between saying it and doing it," the gruff Argentina-born 82-year-old told sports daily As. "In football, you can dominate and still lose so I prefer not to predict what will happen on Saturd
