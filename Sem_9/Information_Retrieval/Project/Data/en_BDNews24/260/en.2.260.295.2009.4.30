<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) The CNG-run auto-rickshaw traffic is still thin in the city though a section of operators ran the the-wheelers on road through the fourth day of a strike begun Monday. The number of vehicles and their coverage of the city area have increased compared with Wednesday. No unpleasant incident was reported from anywhere. Police have arrested 36 persons after the auto-rickshaw drivers went on a wildcat strike and clashed with la-enforcers and vandalised vehicles. Seven cases have been filed. Auto-rickshaw drivers are demanding repeal of an order by Chittagong Metropolitan Police to run their three-wheelers on meter and cancellation of cases they are facing for not complying with the directive. They said they were still apprehensive about the overall situation. Police also arrested six drivers including the president and the general secretary of Jama'at-e-Islami-backed Chittagong Metropolitan CNG Auto-rickshaw Workers' Welfare Union in Sadarghat area Wednesday afternoon. They said they found that the labour organisation was backing the ongoing agitations. b
