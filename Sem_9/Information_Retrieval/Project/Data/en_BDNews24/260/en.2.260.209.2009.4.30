 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)The government will appeal the High Court verdict on the case regarding the assassination of four national leaders in 1975, the state minister for home said Thursday. The appeal will be filed after the copy of the High Court verdict is in hand, Tanjim Ahmed said at a home ministry press briefing. The 1971Bangladesh government-in-exile's acting president Syed Nazrul Islam, prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, finance minister M Mansur Ali, and home minister AHM Qamaruzzaman were killed inside Dhaka Central Jail on Nov. 3, 1975. The killing took place months after independence hero and president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed with most of his family members on Aug. 15 that year. Tanjim on Wednesday had said the trial process of the four who led the government-in-exile during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 was a 'farce'. On Aug. 28, the High Court acquitted lieutenant colonel (dismissed) Syed Farook Rahman, retired lieutenant colonel Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, retired majors Bazlul Huda and AKM Mohiuddin of the charges, who were given life terms by the trial court. The court upheld the death sentence for Risladar Moslemuddin in the case and acquitted two fugitive death convicts Dafadar Marfat Ali and Abul Hashem Mridha. Tanjim had said the government will sign agreements, if needed, to get countries extradite killers to face trial for the assassination of Sheikh Mujib. Six of the 12 convicts are fugitives abroad, five are at Dhaka Central Jail and the other one died in Zimbabwe. The day after the national leaders were killed, then the deputy inspector general of police Abdul Awal filed a case with Lalbagh Police Station against four persons. After the Awami League took office in 1996, police on Oct 15, 199823 years after the case was filed pressed charges in the court against 23 people including Moslemuddin and Farook. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Md Motiur Rahman on Oct 20, 2004 gave the verdict after the trial had run six years. He handed down death sentence to Moslehuddin, Dafadar Marfat Ali and Dafadar Abul Hashem Mridha. The trial court sentenced 15 accused including Farook, Shahriar Rashid and Bazlul Huda to life. The court cleared retired major Md Khairuzzaman, KM Obaidur Rahman, Shah Moazzem Hossain, Nurul Islam Monjur and Taheruddin Thakur of the charges. The convicts moved the High Court immediately after the verdict. Lancer Mohiuddin was extradited from the United States last year and he appealed against his conviction from jail. The High Court started hearing the appeals against the trial court verdict and death references on July 13 after four years. It upheld life sentence for eight of the 12 convicts in the case in a split verdict. They are retired lieutenant colonels Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Shariful Haque Dalim, SHMB Nur Chowdhury and MM Rashed Chowdhury, major Ahmed Sharful Hossain, captains Abdul Mazed, Md Kismat Hashem and Nazmul Hossain Ansar. bdnews24.c
