 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com) Two uncapped players were included when the Bangladesh Cricket Board unveiled Monday a 15-strong squad to be led by Mohammad Ashraful for the World Twenty20 beginning on June 5 in England. Shamsur Rahman is a 20-year-old batsman who has represented Bangladesh at the Under-19 level. He has one century and 10 fifties from 28 first-class matches and averages nearly 29. Mithun Ali, 19-year-old wicketkeeper, has played only 13 first-class games, averaging 22 with a hundred and two half-centuries. His List A record is more impressive, an average of 35 and a strike-rate of 104. Apart from the rookies, the selection committee led by Rafiqul Alam pinned their hopes on the guys have almost been together for one and a half years. Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who recently was cleared by ICC for his suspected bowling action, has also been drafted in the final squad. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza has retained his vice captaincy. Bangladesh were placed in the Group A along with defending champions India and ICC associate member Ireland and will play their group matches at Trent Bridge on June 6 and 8. They will begin their campaign against India on June 6, two days before facing Ireland. "They (Shamsur and Mithun) have been considered for their brilliant performance in the domestic cricket and they have also the experience of playing international matches for Bangladesh A and U-19s," the chief selector said at a press conference at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Alam said Shamsur was a player with a positive frame of mind, who struck 1485 runs this season, including in the national league, premier league as well as in the international matches for Bangladesh A. The former national spinner said Mithun had good reflexes, who was in top form in the domestic cricket. He had a good record playing for Bangladesh U-19s. But, the inclusion of Shahadat Hossain raised eyebrows as the tall pacer was not considered for eight one-day internationals against South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Alam defended Shahadat's inclusion. "Twenty20 creates a huge pressure on the players.We definitely considered Shahadat's experience as he possesses good bouncer as well as slower deliveries and we think it will help the side in the English condition." The selectors chose four pacers in Mashrafee, Syed Rasel, Shahadat Hossain and Rubel Hossain that left comparatively consistent pacer Mahbubul Alam out of the squad. The inclusion of Nayeem Islam also came under scrutiny as the middle-order batsman is considered too slow, even in the 50-over games. "Nayeem and Mahmudullah Riad have been picked as spinning all-rounders," Alam said. " The other spinner Razzak has been picking up his form as he has been doing well in the practice matches." Before leaving for England, Bangladesh team will play five warm-up T20 matches  two against Bangladesh A and the rest against India's Maharashtra Cricket Association on May 13, 15, 17, 18 and 19. Besides, Bangladesh will also play five warm-up matches in England. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (capt), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Junaid Siddique, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mahmudullah, Rubel Hossain, Shamsur Rahman, Mithun Ali. Standby: Mehrab Hossain Junior, Imrul Kayes, Nazmul Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Mohammad Suhrawardi Shuvo
