The main opposition will hold the meeting on Saturday where party chief Khaleda Zia is expected to address the party supporters, the party's assistant publicity secretary Mohiuddin Khan Mohon told bdnews24.com. BNP sent a letter signed by its office secretary Rizvi Ahmed to the Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner on Friday, Mohon said. He said the party sought security for both the party chief and the meeting premises.
