 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)India has the government Sunday to shore up its surveillance on alleged Indian terrorists hiding in Bangladesh in view of the ongoing general elections in the northeastern states bordering Bangladesh. "The list of the top Indian terrorists hiding in Bangladesh has been handed over to the government here," Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarti told reporters after a half-an-hour meeting with state minister for home affairs Tanjim Ahmed in the morning. "We have also requested the authorities to step up vigil over them specially through the ongoing polls yet to be completed in the eastern states of India." On the issues discussed in the meeting, the envoy said, "Prisons in both countries house a number of illegal intruders. We discussed ways to extradite them." Chakravarti said they did not discuss the issue of separatist ULFA leader Anup Chetia, now serving jail term, and other intruders. After India has its new government, a secretary-level meeting will be held to thrash out the regional terrorism trends and propensities, he added. The forthcoming meeting will also discuss extradition of the illegal intruders hiding in both countries, he said. The state minister said a good number of Bangladeshi terrorists were hiding in India. "We discussed their arrest and extraditions issues." Tanjim declined comments when asked if India had provided any 'terror list' and who were on the lists. b
