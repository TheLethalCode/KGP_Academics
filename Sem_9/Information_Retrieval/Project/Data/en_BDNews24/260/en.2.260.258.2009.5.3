<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division on Sunday stayed a previous order of the High Court overturning conviction of actor and alleged crime kingpin Monwar Hossain Dipjal in two arms cases. In 2007, a trial court had sentenced Dipjal, also a former BNP ward commissioner, to 24 years in jail after finding him guilty of possessing illegal arms. But the High Court overturned the conviction on April 26, prompting the state to move to the Appellate Division. On Sunday, chamber judge Mohammad Abdul Aziz upheld the trial court verdict as he stayed the previous High Court ruling in response to the government's appeal. On July 27, 2007, a special Dhaka court sentenced Dipjal to 24 years17 and 7 yearson two charges for the unlawful possession of illegal arms. Security officials arrested him in the capital's Adabar in Dec 2008. Additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim argued for the state while Khandakar Mahbub Hossain defended Dipjal. bdne
