 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Police cannot deliver better service expected of them unless the force is upgraded and modernised, police chief Noor Mohammad said Saturday. He said the police members were working ceaselessly despite having no place to sit, in some cases. "How can we expect better police service if their dignity is not raised," he asked at a discussion on police-media relations at the Police Telecoms Aauditorium Saturday. He said that it was natural for the police to rush to the scenes of incidents but sometimes they fail to respond promptly with old vehicles and inadequate workforce. He stressed the need for nurturing the relationship between the police and the media which matured over the time as they had common tasks to perform. "Despite being called modern, our police force in fact is not modern in the true sense," he said. "We have informed the policymakers of the necessary steps required for making police modern but to no avail," Mohammad said National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud, The Bangladesh Observer editor Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury and Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq spoke at the view-exchange meeting. Chowdhury said police needed to be tough with the criminals but earn trust of the people. Shawkat Mahmud said police and media men shared the same job although police hide information while journalists divulge it to the people Police use the right to information law to cooperate with journalists, he added. Haq said free flow of information was necessary to ensure the fundamental rights of people. The independence of the judiciary would not be meaningful if police could not perform, he said. The commissioner stressed the need for cooperation to dispel the negative attitude police and media have toward each other. b
