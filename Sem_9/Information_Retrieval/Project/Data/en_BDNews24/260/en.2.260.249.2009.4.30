 DURBAN, South Africa, 30 April (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bangalore Royal Challengers secured a five-wicket win off the penultimate ball against the Kolkata Knight Riders to move off the bottom of the Indian Premier League (IPL) standings on Wednesday. The second match of the Durban double-header between the Mumbai Indians and the Kings XI Punjab also went down to the last over with the bowling side, Punjab, holding on for a three-run win. Chasing Kolkata's total of 139 for six, Bangalore reached 143 for five after beginning the last over of their innings needing 10 runs for victory.
