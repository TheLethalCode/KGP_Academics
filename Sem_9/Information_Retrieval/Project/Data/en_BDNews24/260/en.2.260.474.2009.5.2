 ABU DHABI, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A maiden five-wicket haul by Doug Bollinger and a century from captain Michael Clarke powered Australia to an eight-wicket win over Pakistan on Friday and an unassailable 3-1 lead in the one-day series. Paceman Bollinger, in his second ODI, took five for 35 as Pakistan were bowled out for 197 in 48.4 overs after electing to bat first in the fourth game. Skipper Clarke (100 not out) then hammered his fourth ODI century, sharing an undefeated stand of 197 for the third wicket with opener Shane Watson (85 not out), as Australia cruised home with 34 balls to spare. Clarke, standing in for Ricky Ponting as captain, hit 14 fours. Watson fought his way through a fiery four-over spell from fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who removed Brad Haddin for a duck with the second ball of the innings and trapped debutant Marcus North lbw for one to leave Australia struggling on three for two. Earlier, Bollinger started well on a slow pitch by having opener Salman Butt caught behind for two off his third delivery. His second spell later in the innings yielded four more victims as Pakistan collapsed to lose their last seven wickets for 81 runs. Bollinger dismissed Shahid Afridi (40) and Shoaib Malik (27) when they were well set. Opener Ahmed Shehzad top-scored with 43 and Misbah-ul-Haq chipped in with 34.
