 MANCHESTER, England, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - John O'Shea's early goal put Manchester United in control of their Champions League semi-final against Arsenal with a 1-0 first-leg win at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The holders scored in the 17th minute when Irish defender O'Shea rifled in a half-volley from eight yards after Michael Carrick had turned Anderson's deep corner back across goal.

United went close to doubling their lead when Ryan Giggs sent Ronaldo into space and the Portuguese's thumping shot from more than 25 yards bounced away off the crossbar. The hosts were nearly made to pay for their failure to add a second goal when Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner headed wide from Fabregas's free kick but Arsenal rarely threatened to get a potentially vital away goal. There was concern for United in the closing stages when England defender Rio Ferdinand left the field clutching his ribs but Alex Ferguson's team held firm to stay on course to reach the final in Rome. The winners of the tie will play Barcelona or Chelsea, who drew 0-0 in Spain on Tuesday in the first leg of their semi-final, in the final in R
