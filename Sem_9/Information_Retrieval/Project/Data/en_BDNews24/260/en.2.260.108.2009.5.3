 Dhaka May 3 (bdnews24.com)  The US ambassador in Bangladesh Sunday said the government should give opposition meaningful opportunities to discuss and debate upcoming budget while the opposition should reach out to the government to look for consensus. Ambassador James F Moriarty said Bangladesh would vigorously need to work on dealing with challenges like power crisis and militancy. Speaking to reporters at a Meet the Press organised by the Dhaka Reporters Unity in Dhaka, he said the US would continue to support Bangladesh to strengthen democracy, foster development and handle terrorism. Apparently focusing on the bitter relationship between the government and the opposition, Moriarty said: "Working together, I believe that Bangladesh can respond to the critical needs of all of its citizens, regardless of party affiliation." In addition, he said, the country "has to balance many important, and sometimes competing priorities." "No party has a monopoly on good ideas," he said. Apart from the issue of handling power crisis, Bangladesh needs to focus on major infrastructure projects and also fund agriculture and education, he said. But he said the US has no plan right now to cooperate with Bangladesh on nuclear power plants, when asked if his government had any concern over Bangladesh's desire to set up nuclear power plants. Bangladesh had in recent times held discussions about such plants with Russian and Chinese experts. Such plants are "too expensive", he said. In the field of trade, the ambassador said: "The US will provide due consideration to Bangladesh's desire for increased trade." He said Bangladesh is not an exempt amid global financial crisis that is haunting the world economy, and in this backdrop Bangladesh-US relationship would require a boost. Reverting to his own style of describing Bangladesh-US relations, Moriarty said his three D's democracy, development and denial of space to terrorists  are the main focus of the current cooperation between the two nations. He also touched on issues that involve Bangladesh and the US. FBI's involvement in the "too complicated" investigation into the BDR carnage and funding climate change issues were among the top issues that came up in the press meet. About terrorism, he said recent seizure of weapons in Bhola and continued arrest of suspected JMB militants demonstrate that "terrorism remains a concern" in the country. He said Washington got "disturbing indications" of terrorist threat in Bangladesh. He, however, did not elaborate his statement, but said: "There continues to be threat in Bangladesh and my government does believe that there is a threat." He appreciated Bangladesh's transition to democracy and urged the media to put pressure on the government and the opposition for fair deals that involve the people's welfare. Over the ongoing dispute over the cantonment home of opposition leader Khaleda Zia, he said that boycotting parliament would not bring a "healthy development" but a legal course or dialogue would. Replying to queries on the planned trial of suspected war criminals and the process of ensuring justice for the assassination of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, he said the issues require transparency and all should be done in a fair manner in the "court of law". bd
