 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The new chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday after taking charges the market watchdog will seek a transparent and vibrant capital market in his term. The watchdog will try to make it listing on the bourses easy, Ziaul Haque Khondker, who became the first investment banker in Bangladesh Sunday to head the stocks regulator, told reporters after a meeting with officials. The government on Sunday announced the appointment of the former managing director of the state-run Investment Corporation of Bangladesh for three years. He said SEC would focus on increasing the supply of good scrips to the market. "There are few quality issues...which creates imbalance [in the market] as most investors concentrate on those issues," Khondker, a Dhaka University economics graduate who began his career in the capital market as a research officer with the ICB in 1977. "I think the experience of being a part of the market would help me to take more efficient steps to keep the market balanced," he said.
