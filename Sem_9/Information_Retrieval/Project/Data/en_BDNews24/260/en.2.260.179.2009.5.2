 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami is ready to help prime minister Sheikh Hasina's administration to resolve national problems, a party leader said Saturday. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid, however, accused of the four-month-old government of failure in running the country. Addressing activists at a party conference in Jhenaidah town, Mujahid, a former minister of the BNP-led four-party coalition, said the Jamaat wants to the parliament as the centre of politics. His statement came when the government and campaigners have accused many Jamaat leaders of war crime and other crimes against humanity during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. The government has vowed to try the suspected war criminals in line with its election pledge, which earned a huge popular support before the Dec. 29 elections. In a traditional note of India bashing, Mujahid said: "A section of Indian intellectuals and media are propagating against Bangladesh. They want to make Bangladesh their market where a puppet government will fulfill their desire." On reported construction of a barrage in Tipaimukh in India, he said: "The Sylhet region will not get water if the dam is erected in Tipaimukh. The Meghna basin will dry up." He demanded the February carnage at BDR headquarters be investigated fairly and "without any political influence". bdn
