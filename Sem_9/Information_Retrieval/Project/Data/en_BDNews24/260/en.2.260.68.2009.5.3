 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) Sunday asked president Zillur Rahman to help launch social movement to save the environment. DCCI president Zafar Osman said the president told them during a meeting at the Bangabhaban that he would consider the request. A recent study revealed that around 40 percent investment in development and infrastructure in Bangladesh was being hampered due to changing climate, Osman told reporters. He said only government's initiative to improve the situation is not enough. "Our livelihood and business will seriously suffer if we fail to protect the environment. Now we need to start an irresistible social movement to save our existence," he said. The president urged the businessmen to find out ways to make the most of the global economic downturn. "We will have to be careful so that the economy of Bangladesh is not harmed by global recession," Rahman said in a written statement. He said the government's financial package for recession-hit sectors was 'very encouraging' and added that it need to be kept in mind that the financial strength of a poor country like Bangladesh was very limited. He told DCCI representatives to advice the government on the international market and help control the price of essentials. "I believe you will encourage businessmen to be responsive to their social responsibility besides earning proceeds," he said. DCCI leaders sought assistance of the president, also chancellor of universities, for recognition of DCCI Business Institute by the National University. b
