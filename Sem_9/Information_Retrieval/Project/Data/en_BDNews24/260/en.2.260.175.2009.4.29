 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government will prepare a uniform curriculum for primary school students, the education minister said Wednesday. "We want to bring about total change in the curriculum so that children can read with a single curriculum," Nurul Islam Nahid said after unveiling the book on Chotader Muktijuddher Itihas (history of liberation war for children) of Dr Muhammad Zafar Iqbal at the Bangladesh Liberation War Museum. "At present, there are eleven streams of education at the primary level. We want one-stream education. We will try to prepare the same curriculum for all." The minister said work on revising textbooks for the next year for the students of primary and secondary stages is going on. A committee has been formed with educationists like Dr Iqbal, he said. "We hope that through them the correct history of the independence war will find its place in the textbooks." The government will help to reach the book to the primary school students, the minister said. Nahid also expressed the hope that the government can hold the war crimes trial. He said at present 90 percent children take admission in school but 48 percent of them drop out before they finish the fifth grade. The government is working to bring all children to schools by 2011 and the rate of dropouts will fall by turns. Others who spoke at the function were former caretaker government adviser Sultana Kamal, former Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Farasuddin Ahmed, trustee of Bangladesh Liberation War Museum Sarwar Ali and retired major general Imamuzzaman. Writer Zafar Iqbal did not attend the function because of his mother-in-law's death. b
