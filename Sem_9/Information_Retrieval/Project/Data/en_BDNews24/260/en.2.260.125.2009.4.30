 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)Implementing even a Tk 30,000 crore ADP will not be a problem since the government is likely to see a 10 percent rise in revenue income and increased foreign aid in the next fiscal year, the finance minister said Thursday. Revenue collection may amount to around Tk 65,000 crore this year, AMA Muhith told reporters quoting National Board of Revenue estimates. "We expect it would be rise by at least 10 percent next year and foreign aid would also go up," he said. On Wednesday, planning minister AK Khandaker told the press that the next budget may set aside Tk 29,000 crore in Annual Development Programme allocation. The size of the ADP is likely to be fixed Thursday afternoon at the National Economic Council meeting to be chaired y the prime minister. The ADP portfolio for FY 2008-09 was Tk 25,600 crore and Tk 26,000 crore for FY 2007-08. The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), the government's research arm, however, at a seminar Wednesday recommended the ADP in FY 2009-10 be limited within Tk 26,000 crore. "Alternatively, given the low implementation rate, the target of ADP could be set at a higher level, say at around Tk 30,000 crore," M Asaduzzaman, a BIDS research director, said in the key-note presentation. Earlier, Muhith awarded the winners of the Young Entrepreneur Awards 2008-09 organised by HSBC. He said the next budget would give special attention to employment, agriculture, rural development and "above all, power". Asked whether the decision on a 10 percent government job cut ten percent cancels out the measures to augment employment, the finance minister said the decision was driven by the logic to save resources. "[The job cut] is targeted towards those who work, get paid, but produce nothing." Muhith said it is a must for a country like Bangladesh to save its resources by cutting costs. The government in a circular on Wednesday asked ministries and divisions to prepare to shed at least 10 percent of their workforce for an interim period. The move came as a part of the government's cost-cutting measures in the wake of global economic recession, according to media reports that quoted finance ministry sources. Muhith added that the vacant posts in government offices would not be filled up. "It would be managed by the existing workforce." He, however, made it clear that no lay-offs would happen only appointment in vacant posts would go down by ten percent.
