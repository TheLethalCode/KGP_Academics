 MILAN, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zlatan Ibrahimovic clashed with his own fans after putting Inter Milan on the verge of the Serie A title with a 2-0 home victory over Lazio on Saturday. The champions had gone three matches without a win but with four games left they now hold a 10-point lead over second-placed AC Milan, who visit Catania on Sunday (1300 GMT).

Italian Cup finalists Lazio had several opportunities to take the lead on a slippy pitch but another strong display from Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar kept them at bay. Elsewhere, Reggina defender Andrea Costa briefly swallowed his tongue in a 2-1 win at third-bottom Bologna. Costa recovered quickly but was substituted and taken to hospital after having lost consciousness in a collision in the second half and needing a physio to pull his tongue out of his throat. Reggina, three points behind fourth-bottom Torino, boosted their hopes of an unlikely escape from relegation by making it seven points from three games. Franco Brienza scored with their first attempt on 40 minutes when he beat the offside trap and rifled home before Edgar Barreto doubled the lead just after halftime when he chested down and fired in off the bar from 30 met
