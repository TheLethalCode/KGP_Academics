 ADEN, Yemen, Sun May 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three protesters were killed on Sunday during clashes between security forces and anti-government protesters in southern Yemen, where separatist sentiment is strong, officials and witnesses said. The clashes, which have persisted for several days, prompted a rare call by the United States for an end to the violence it said could undermine the impoverished country's unity. Officials said opposition groups killed two civilians and wounded 20 at an administrative building in Lahej province near Aden in the south. A member of the opposition Socialist Party said locals were defending themselves from government shelling of villages and farmland. Independent daily al-Ayyam said a man was shot dead and four were wounded in clashes in Habilain, where three died last month in clashes after locals objected to new army outposts in the area. Neighboring Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, fears instability in Yemen could allow it to become a launchpad for a revival of a 2003-2006 campaign by al Qaeda militants to topple the US-allied ruling Al Saud family. Yemen is also a player in efforts to stop piracy. Somali pirates have in recent months staged numerous raids on ships passing through the Gulf of Aden, a key shipping lane for oil and cargo, making millions of dollars and causing US and other governments to send patrol ships to the area. Yemen is battling regular attacks by al Qaeda militants and a Zaydi Shi'ite rebellion in the north and struggling to balance its authority with the fierce independence of some tribes. Clashes broke out around a week ago at an opposition rally to mark the 1994 civil war, in which forces commanded by Yemeni President Ali Adbullah Saleh crushed the secessionist south. The separate states of North and South Yemen had united under a fragile political agreement in 1990 but residents in the south, which is home to most of the country's oil facilities, continue to complain that they are marginalized. "The United States embassy in Sanaa views with concern reports of increasing incidences of political violence in southern regions of Yemen. The United States supports a stable, unified, democratic Yemen," a US embassy statement said. "We call on the Yemeni government, the political parties, civil society organizations and all concerned citizens of Yemen to engage in dialogue to identify and address legitimate grievances." Yemen, the ancestral home of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, joined the US war against terrorism after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United St
