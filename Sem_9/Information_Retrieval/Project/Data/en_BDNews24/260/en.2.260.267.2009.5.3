 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The power cuts will be less severe next month when additional 660 megawatts of electricity will be fed to the national grid, power ministry officials told a parliamentary panel Sunday. The parliamentary standing committee on power ministry at a meeting formed a three-member panel to investigate the alleged irregularities in the power sector during the rules of the BNP-led government and the military-installed 2007-2008 caretaker government. "Additional 660.5 megawatts of electricity will go to the national power grid from June 2009," according to the ministry's statement on power situation in the country. "I hope the extra electricity will reduce the degree of load-shedding," Subid Ali Bhuiyan, the committee chairman, quoted state minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku as saying after the meeting. The daily power output would top 4500 MW a day if the additional electricity goes to the grid by June. The power sector master plan puts current daily electricity demand at more than 7000 MW. The working paper says private sector will provide 330 MW and the public sector 330.5 MW. Independent private power plants will add 121 MW. The government will also add 159.5 MW for three years from the private rental power plants while 50 MW will come from the 15-year rental power plants from the private sector. Two Siddhirganj power units with a total capacity of 240 MW will go into operation in June 2009. The paper also says the 90-MW Fenchuganj power plants are waiting commissioning. The committee termed the 15 percent systems loss "too much" and recommended reducing it further. "We have asked the ministry to send inspection teams to the field level to stop pilferage of electricity," said Bhuiyan. The committee chairman said Awami League MP Mohammad Enamul Haque would lead the parliamentary sub-committee which would investigate the alleged irregularities in the power sector from 2001 to 2008. Fazle Noor Taposh and Mujibur Rahman Fakir were the other members of the committee, the chairman said. "We have not given them any timeframe for submitting findings," Bhuiyan. He said the investigation was launched in the wake of widespread allegations of "misappropriation" by the BNP-led government from 2001 to 2006. Bhuiyan said charges of irregularities in the power sector during the tenure of the caretaker government also surfaced.
