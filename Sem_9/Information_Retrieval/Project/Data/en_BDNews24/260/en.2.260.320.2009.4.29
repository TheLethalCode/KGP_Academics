Hafizur Rahman, Doulatpur police chief, said a dozen cases have so far been filed against Lal Chand with Doulatpur Police Station, of which six were murder charges. Tipped off by an informer, a RAB intelligence team went to Hossainabad Wednesday at 5am, where Lal Chand and his cohorts were present in Laldaha ground. Sensing the RAB presence, the alleged terrorists opened fire at them and RAB retaliated. Lal Chand was eventually found dead while others fled the scene.
