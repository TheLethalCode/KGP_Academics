 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)Like everywhere else in the world, the labour organisations across the country observed the historic May Day, also celebrated as the International Workers' Day, Friday. After two years under the emergency rule, this year the day was observed in a democratic environment. The labour organisations took out processions and held rallies across the capital Dhaka and divisional and district headquarters since early morning, holding red flags up and chanting slogans demanding just wages. Other programmes organised to observe the day included discussions, cultural assemblies and painting exhibitions. At Muktangan in the capital, the May Day Observance Committee organised a workers' solidarity rally and cultural show. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina addressed a huge rally organised by Jatiya Sramik League at Paltan Maidan in the afternoon. She pledged to revise the minimum wage for the workers in line with the market price and said contentious labour issues would be resolved. All mills and factories that had been closed down will be reopened, she said. Earlier, she attended a discussion meeting at 10am at Osmani Memorial Hall organised by the labour and employment ministry. She inaugurated the three-day May Day fair at its premises. The main opposition BNP's associate Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal held a discussion meeting at 10am at Bhasani Auditorium at BNP's central office at Naya Paltan. It will observe the day with a rally at Paltan ground Saturday. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia is scheduled to address the meeting. The day was observed as a holiday across the country. All factories and workshops were kept closed in remembrance of those who had shed blood while pressing legitimate demands of workers centuries back. On May 1, 1886, workers of the US city Chicago had staged demonstrations near Hay Market demanding eight hours' workday instead of the 12-hour workday prevalent at that time. Police had opened fire in a bid to quell the agitation, when ten workers killed. But that sacrifice ultimately led to the authorities yielding to the workers' demand and the eight-hour workday came to be introduced universally. On July 14, 1889 in Paris, an international workers rally declared May 1 as the International Workers Solidarity Day in recognition of the Chicago workers' sacrifice and achievement. Since 1890, May 1 has been observed globally as the International Workers Solidarity Day. President Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia issued separate messages on the occasion wishing all workers solidarity, prosperity and happiness. Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain, Bikalpadhara Bangladesh president AQM Badruddozza Chowdhury and secretary general Abdul Mannan and former BNP secretary-general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan greeted the workers across the country and wished them joy and solidarity. Bangladesher Communist Party president Manjurul Ahsan Khan and general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim, JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu and general secretary Syed Jafar Sajjad and other leaders of Samajtantrik Sramik Front and Ganotantrik Bam Morcha wished everyone joy and happiness and expressed solidarity with the workers everywhere. bdne
