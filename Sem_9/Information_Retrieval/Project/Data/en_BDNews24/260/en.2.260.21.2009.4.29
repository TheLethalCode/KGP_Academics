 ANKARA , Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman pretending to be a student detonated a bomb at an Ankara university during a visit by a former justice minister on Wednesday but no one was wounded, state news agency Anatolian said. The woman, who was carrying explosives, approached former minister Hikmet Sami Turk as he visited the university, Anatolian said. The woman was detained and two separate explosives with fuses were found on her. Turk told NTV broadcaster the blast occurred about a meter from him. Turk was hated by left-wing organizations for his policies when he was in office. Turk also said he had received death threats. "There has been a bomb attack, but it's over now, we don't know the details of the attack .... We think it's a suicide bomber," a Bilkent University source, who declined to be named, told Reuters. Police have recently warned of an escalation in attacks by the outlawed, separatist Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey. Separately, nine soldiers died in a bomb blast blamed on the PKK in southeast Turkey
