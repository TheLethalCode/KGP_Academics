 Gopalganj, May 3 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday said her government will put more emphasis for development in areas where the ruling alliance did not win seat in the last general elections. "No development work will be stopped anywhere in the country. Whether one votes or not is one's discretion and constitutional right also. But the government is for all," she said at a meeting of Gopalganj district development and coordination committee at the Bangabandhu Bhaban in Tungipara, her hometown. " We want balanced development everywhere. We will give more stress on development in areas where we did not have any MP. We will not shut down any development activity [in those area]. We did not do anything like that after coming to power." Hasina, also Awami League chief, said her previous 1996-2001 administration set up the Sheikh Russel Distressed Child Rehabilitation Centre as a pilot project to help neglected children stand on their feet through training. It had also set up the Bangabandhu Poverty Alleviation Training Centre at Kotalipara. But the government that came to power after 2001 tried to stop these development projects, Hasina alleged " To us there is no difference between a man in Feni and a man in Bogra. All are equal," the prime minister said, referring to the two districts that are to be opposition BNP strongholds. "That is why we want to implement these development projects in every district in phases." She said the government was putting in efforts to develop the fish industry. " The principle of ' water body belongs to him who owns net' will stand. New projects will be taken up for development of fishery'. She said a pilot shrimp exhibition project will be undertaken for modernisation of shrimp cultivation. The government would also take steps to boost the number of snails as shrimp feed. bdnew
