 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent, back from China Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Chinese equipment maker Huawei is hoping to cash in on what it calls 'Green Communication Technology' by offering a new generation BTS that reduces CO 2 emission and energy consumption. "Our new BTS being deployed globally is high on power efficiency but low on fuel consumption," said Huawei's vice president for wireless marketing Shao Yang, speaking to a group of Bangladeshi journalists at the company's headquarters in Shenzhen last Monday. And low energy consumption, explained Shao, meant low emission. "This is why we are calling it green technology." Usually, a normal BTS consumes 2000 kwh but Huawei's new BTS needs only 700 kwh, he said. Protecting the environment and combating climate change are two of the most pressing challenges facing humankind, he said. Jessie Pan, a senior corporate communication official, said the company was now installing the environment-friendly BTS around the world. More than 100,000 green sites were deployed in 2007, equivalent to a 170,000 ton reduction in CO 2 emission, she said. "Our core network equipment is able to reduce electricity costs by 10 percent," Jessie added. With the new design  "low heat, heat sink and heat resistant", Huawei's 1M nodes of green mobile broadband save 200 million kwh in power consumption every year, she said. In recent years, the telecoms industry in China, also the biggest market in the world, has grown 10 to 20 percent annually. So has the energy cost of telecom equipment. According to the 2006 industry energy usage statistics gathered by China's Information Industry Ministry (MII), the yearly electricity consumption of the telecom industry exceeded 20 billion kilowatt-hours, 10 billion of which was used for the air conditioning of GSM base station. The total energy consumption of the base stations in China in 2006 would have used more than 3 millions tons of co
