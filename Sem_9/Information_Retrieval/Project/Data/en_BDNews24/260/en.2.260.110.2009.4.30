<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has told the knitwear manufacturers and exporters that the government will consider economic assistance to help them hold off recession impact. Md. Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told reporters after a meeting with the prime minister Thursday that she also assured them of resolving the nagging power crisis. The meeting started at around 10:30am at the Prime Minister's Office and continued through to the midday. "The government in its recently declared stimulus package did not include knitwear industry. But the industry is on the verge of disaster. That's why we sought assistance," Hoque said. On the type of economic assistance he said: "We have sought 10 percent performance incentive against each export. "The prime minister responded positively to our proposal. "She told us as the stimulus package has the arrangement of reallocation, we can get it if necessary." The BKMEA president said the government was taking measures to resolve power and gas crises. They asked the government to cut bank interest rate against loan for knitwear industries, allocate the RAJUK plots at Chasharah in Narayanganj to BKMEA at a fair price and end complications regarding knitwear business at Benapole port. The other demands included conversion of BIWTA jetty in Narayanganj into a modern terminal and building hospital for the knitwear workers. Hoque said Wednesday that they could propose to the government for even importing power to ensure smooth production in their factories. The businesses often say that their production is being terribly hampered and the cost of production is skyrocketing because of the electricity crisis. They hugely depend on generator backup, but on-and-off power supplies put the production on the edge amid tight deadline for shipment. The government says it is also trying to divert power to the industrial zones from other areas. It has stopped supplying gas to a fertiliser factory in Chittagong to ensure enough gas flow to a vital power plant in the region to meet its full production potential. But the situation is still beyond control because of the rising demand of electricity, and an immediate solution is not in sight, according to the power ministry. The garment sector, the main force behind the country's export earning, has been demanding cash incentive for their industries to cope with the falling prices of the products that are mainly shipped to Europe and the United States, the origin of the economic crisis. The sector's leaders say they are facing tremendous pressure from competitors such as India, China and Vietnam because of the falling prices in global market, high bank interest rate inside the country and rising production cost. The country annually earns around $12 billion from readymade garment, which prominently includes knitwear products. bd
