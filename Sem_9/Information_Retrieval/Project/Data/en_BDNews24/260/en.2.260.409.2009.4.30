 KHOR AL-AMAYA, Iraq, April 30 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - US and British forces handed over to the Iraqi navy Thursday responsibility for protecting one of the country's crucial floating oil export terminals. In a ceremony on the rusting Khor al-Amaya platform, which handles 10 percent of oil exports from the southern oil hub of Basra, the commander of Task Force Iraqi Maritime, Admiral Tom Cropper, lauded a "breakthrough" in Iraqi military independence. The Khor al-Amaya floating oil terminal is by far the smaller of the two platforms serving Basra, and Cropper acknowledged that the decision to hand its security over first meant Thursday's ceremony marked a small, initial step. "In some ways it's a test case but it's also a significant milestone," Cropper told Reuters. "They've come a good way. These oil terminals produce about 70 percent of gross domestic product. The Iraqi sailors here understand that and how important it is to protect them." To date, al-Basra terminal, which handles 90 percent of Basra's oil exports, and Khor al-Amaya have been protected by U.S. and British forces while they and personnel from Australia and Singapore worked to get Iraqi naval recruits up to speed. Like the rest of the Iraqi security forces, the navy had to be rebuilt from scratch after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein because of a decision by U.S. administrators to disband it. Iraq's navy has ordered four Italian-made patrol boats, the first of which will be handed over in the Italian port of La Spezia on May 15 and sailed over to Umm Qasr port in southern Iraq. Fifteen more patrol boats will be bought. There are now about 2,000 Iraqi navy personnel, including 1,400 marines. The plan is to recruit a total of 6,500 by the end of 2011, when all U.S. troops are due to withdraw from Iraq. "We're building a navy absolutely from scratch and that requires equipment, ships, which you have to buy, training, all of which takes time," said British Army Brigadier Mark Lacey. U.S. Navy Captain Karl van Deusen, head of operations for the task force, said building the navy was a long-term goal. "We're doing a phased approach. We don't want to just cut the cord and walk away. We're still here," he said. At the handover ceremony, an Iraqi military band played on a platform trimmed with tinsel while U.S. vessels and Iraqi speedboats circled the terminal. The terminal, which lies around 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from Iraq's border with Iran in the Shatt al-Arab waterway, is a rusted outer shell. Every square foot has rust patches. The decks are creaky, unstable and full of holes. Pieces of broken pipe and scrap metal lie around. Iraqi navy operations commander, Commodore Ahmed Jassim Marij, said the navy knew it shouldered a big responsibility for protecting Iraq's main source of income, its crude exports. "We are ready to protect this terminal. Later we will take over the other. Protecting our oil terminals from the threat of terrorism is vital," he said. The sea around is dotted with the shapes of giant tankers. The platform is guarded by Iraqi marines on machine guns. Speed boat captain Saimir Jabir said he couldn't wait. "I love being out on the waves. I'm hoping we will have full freedom to patrol our waters and protect against terrorists soon," he said as his craft crashed through choppy seas.
