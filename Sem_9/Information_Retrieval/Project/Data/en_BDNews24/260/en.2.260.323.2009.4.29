 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)Health minister AFM Ruhul Haque has advised all to be aware of the dangers of a new type of swine flu but not to panic about it. "There is no reason we should be panicking about the diseaseswine flu. You should be better aware of how it spreads and affects people," he told reporters after attending an inter-ministerial meeting at the health ministry Wednesday. He urged the news media not to publish or present any scary news about the disease. "Though Bangladesh is not directly threatened by the disease, we are taking all preparatory steps necessary to face and handle the menace." All the three international airports and other ports have been instructed to screen any arrival from any country known to be affected by the flu, he said. Haque added that the government had started training health officials for screening passengers at Zia International Airport. "Officials and employees of other airports will also be trained in a day or two." The symptoms of the disease include sneezing, coughing and fever, he said. The airlines passengers coming from abroad and arriving at the airport with such symptoms will have to take necessary screening tests. The minister called upon everybody to avoid sneezing, coughing or spitting just 'anywhere' and cover their mouth while coughing or sneezing and then wash their hands properly. As the swine flu virus has been spreading globally at an alarming pace, World Health Organisation has raised its pandemic warning level 3 to 4. Once declared a pandemic, this will be the first pandemic in the past 40 years. The death toll in Mexico from an outbreak of the flu has risen to as many as 159 people. bdne
