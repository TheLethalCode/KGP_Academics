 CANBERRA, May 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji's military government ruled out any election this year and said on Friday it would extend emergency laws, defying an international deadline for the country's suspension from the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum. "We made it quite clear that it is not going to happen. There will be no election until September 2014," Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama told Sky News Australia in an interview. "That's the deadline... "I think there will be a need to continue that (emergency regulation). We want this calm to continue for a while," said Bainimarama, who also commands the country's military. Fiji was plunged into fresh political crisis this month after the president reappointed Bainimarama as interim prime minister, less than two days after a court ruled his 2006 coup and subsequent government was illegal. Bainimarama, who has ruled out elections until 2014 after earlier promising a poll this year, immediately imposed emergency restrictions, including sending troops and police into media and government offices to gag opposition to his reform plans. But the country has been under pressure to back down and announce democratic elections as a May 1 deadline passed for the country's suspension from the 16-nation Pacific Islands Forum. Bainimarama said he wanted urgent talks with the leaders of regional heavyweights Australian and New Zealand to resolve the standoff over democratic reforms and avert a threat of tougher international sanctions. "They need to understand, there are a hell of a lot of changes we need to come up with before we have an election, and it's not an overnight thing, unfortunately for them," he said. AUSTRALIA DEMANDS ELECTIONS But Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ruled out any meeting with Bainimarama, saying Fiji's actions had set the country up to be suspended from the Pacific Islands Forum, which is the key regional body. "This is the bloke who just abolished freedom of the press in Fiji, this is the bloke who just sent independent judges, including those from Australia, packing. This is a bloke who just suspended the Constitution of Fiji. These are decisions taken by the military government of Fiji," Rudd told Australia radio. "What they need to do in Fiji is announce a timetable for elections, which is reasonable, which is within the immediately foreseeable future, not off in the total never-never, in order for us to begin to contemplate any form of normality in our relations with the Fijian military government." Credit agency Standard & Poor's this month cut Fiji's long-term rating credit rating to B-minus from B, and its short-term rating to C from B, due to Fiji's deteriorating political environment. The central bank devalued the local dollar by 20 percent to boost tourism badly damaged by successive coups. Fiji, a former British colony, has had four coups and a military mutiny since 1987, fueled by tensions between indigenous Fijians and economically powerful ethnic Ind
