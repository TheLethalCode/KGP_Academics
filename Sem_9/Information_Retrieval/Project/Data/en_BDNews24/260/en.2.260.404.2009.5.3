<TITLE> Flu pandemic still likely but Mexico toll drops </TITLE>

 MEXICO CITY, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexico's swine flu outbreak appeared to be stabilizing on Saturday, but officials warned the unpredictable virus still threatened to become a global pandemic. Mexican officials said hospitals were seeing fewer new cases of people with symptoms from the new swine flu virus and cut the estimated death toll from the outbreak to up to 101 from as many as 176 as more test samples came back negative. "It would still be imprudent to say that we're past the worst of it but I do think ... we are in a stage of stabilization," Mexican Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova told reporters. Costa Rica, Italy and Ireland confirmed cases of the virus, which has now been found in 18 countries. In Geneva, the World Health Organization said H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America, as required before the pandemic alert level is raised to its highest level. But it said that would probably happen soon. "I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent because we are seeing the disease spread," Michael Ryan, WHO director of Global Alert and Response, told a briefing. Few are ready to take chances with the new virus, widely dubbed swine flu. In Hong Kong, police quarantined a hotel after a Mexican guest fell ill with the virus. Mexico, the country hardest hit by the virus, called the action "unjustified" and advised its citizens to avoid travel to China. China's Foreign Ministry had no immediate response to the criticism. Mexican authorities said fewer patients with severe flu symptoms were checking into hospitals, suggesting a falling infection rate, and no new deaths were reported in the capital, Mexico City, in the past two days. REMAIN VIGILANT The WHO said 15 countries had reported 615 infections, not including the reports of confirmed cases in Ireland, Italy and Costa Rica. The United States, the second hardest-hit nation, said it had confirmed 160 cases in 21 states. But public hospitals in Mexico have noted a steady drop in patients turning up with fevers, suggesting the infection rate may be declining as people don face masks and use hand gel. US officials said they were encouraged by the developments in Mexico but added it was too early to relax. "We are remaining vigilant," said Dr. Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We have seen times where things appear to be getting better and then get worse again. ... I think in Mexico we may be holding our breath for some time." Almost all infections outside Mexico have been mild. The only death in another country has been a Mexican toddler who was taken to the United States before he fell sick. President Barack Obama said the United States was responding aggressively to the new flu strain and was closing some schools temporarily and distributing antiviral drug supplies as needed. The White House said Obama spoke to Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Saturday about cooperating to stop the virus. Canadian health officials announced a swine herd in the province of Alberta had been infected with the virus, but they added the outbreak did not pose a risk to the food supply and Canadian pork remained safe to eat. The WHO and other international organizations warned on Saturday against imposing any trade restrictions on pigs or pig products as a result of the emergence of the new flu. Scientists are still trying to assess how the new virus behaves and compares to regular seasonal flu strains, which kill between 250,000 and 500,000 globally every year. The outbreak remains tiny compared with other epidemics, such as malaria, hepatitis and meningitis. But the WHO hiked its pandemic alert level to 5 from 3 this week -- the last step before a pandemic -- due to its rapid spread and the possibility it could hit hard poor and disease-prone communities, including among people with HIV. Ryan said the WHO would send more than 2 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs to poor countries to help them prepare for the virus, which is already causing havoc with a travel industry that flies hundreds of thousands of people to and from Mexico each week. In Mexico City, big parks, museums and zoos were shut and many in the sprawling metropolis of 20 million people were heeding a government call to stay home for a prolonged five day-holiday to try to stem new infections. First-division soccer matches were played before empty stands after authorities decided to bar spectators to prevent the further spread of the virus in public. "We're sick of this situation. A few days off school wouldn't be so bad, but now there's nothing to do," Jose Francisco Suarez, 15, said during a break while playing basketball with friends
