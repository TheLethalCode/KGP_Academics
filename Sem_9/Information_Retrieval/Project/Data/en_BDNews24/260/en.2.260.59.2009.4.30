<TITLE> Obama's 100 days in office </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, April 30 (bdndews24.com)  President Obama has completed his one hundredth day in office Tuesday. Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new president are watched closely by analysts and commentators, which provide a snapshot of how the president is doing in the eyes of the common people. Almost all major news outlets and polling organizations have done a survey on his performance and so far the news is good for Obama. According to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, an overwhelming number of Americans seem to have high hopes for the president. It is not unusual for new presidents to enjoy substantial public support at this point in their tenure. But Obama's 68 percent job approval rating is higher than that of any recent president at the 100-day mark. Bush had the approval of 56 percent of the public at this juncture. Of the total number of Americans polled during the survey, a staggering 72 percent said they were optimistic about the next four years. But the optimism is somewhat tempered by a feeling of uncertainty about the economy and the American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Most Americans, however, say Obama has begun to make progress on both fronts, but many do not expect either the recession or the war to be over by the end of his term. By and large, Americans expect him to make significant progress in health care, energy and immigration policy, issues central to his ambitious domestic agenda. Another significant aspect of the poll found that two-thirds of the Americans now believe that race relations are generally good, and the percentage of blacks who say so has doubled since last July Despite that, half of blacks still say whites have a better chance of getting ahead in American society. Not surprisingly, Black Americans remain among the president's staunchest supporters; 70 percent of black respondents now say the country is headed in the right direction, compared with 34 percent of whites. But while Americans clearly have faith in Obama, the poll revealed something of a disconnect between what the public thinks the president has already accomplished and what it expects him to achieve. Fewer than half of those surveyed, 48 percent, said Obama had begun to make progress on one of his major campaign promises, changing the way business is conducted in Washington. And just 39 percent said he had begun to make progress on another major promise, cutting taxes for middle-class Americans, even though the stimulus bill he signed into law does include a middle class tax cut. Asked to judge his actions, more than two-thirds of Americans say he is not a typical politician, though most say he is set apart more by his style and his personal qualities than his policies. The poll also found that the public appears divided over whether the Obama administration has broken with the Bush administration in its overall foreign policy. Forty-three percent of respondents said there had been some change in foreign policy since Obama took office, while 44 percent said there had been no change. Overall, the respondents appear to give Obama credit for improving the image of the United States with the rest of the world. And it found support for Obama's overtures to Iran and Cuba; a majority, 53 percent, said they favored establishing diplomatic relations with Iran, while two-thirds favored Obama's plans to improve relations with Cuba
