<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)Half the deaths caused from accident at workshop or other work places occur solely due to violation of safety and health related laws, a research report says. Five NGOs jointly presented the research report titled, 'Investigation into work place deaths in Bangladesh: Compensation, Accountability and Legal reform', before the media Thursday at the National Press Club. The report, based on 100 accidents in 40 districts in 2007 and 2008, said some 116 workers died from 100 accidents. The report observes that health and safety laws of Bangladesh failed to save the workers and 80 percent families of the victims did not get compensation they deserved. BRAC Human Rights & Legal Aid Services, BLAST, Ain O Salish Kendra, Centre for Corporate Accountability, and Health & Environment Foundation jointly prepared the research report. The executive director of BLAST, Mohsin Ali Khan, said only 17 workshop inspectors are employed to oversee workers' health and safety. Labour court exists at four places which are hardly enough to ensure the safety of the workers, he alleged. The director of BRAC Human Rights & Legal Aid Services, Dr. Fostina Perera, said police and workshop inspectors should investigate the accident whenever it occurs. "The employers and developers are to blame for the failures," Fostina added. Human-rights worker Dr. Hamida Hossain said compensation for the victims must be ensured at any cost. Law commission chairman Abdur Rashid said the state is not to blame if a citizen dies for negligence of others. The report has recommended some steps including application of criminal law, training of the police on investigation procedure and rise in compensation package. bdnew
