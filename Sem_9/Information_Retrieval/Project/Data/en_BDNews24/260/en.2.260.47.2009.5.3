 ASUNCION, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Libertadores Cup ties involving Mexican teams Guadalajara and San Luis have been postponed because of the swine flu outbreak and Colombia's refusal to act as an alternative venue. The South American Football Confederation (CSF) had announced the two Mexican teams would stage their home ties in Bogota but Colombian authorities rejected the plan. On Saturday, the Chilean government also ruled out Santiago as a venue. San Luis are due to host Uruguayans Nacional on May 6 in their second round first leg and Guadalajara were scheduled to play Brazilian champions Sao Paulo the same day. "The confederation wants to analyse, mull over the situation and find a way out," CSF spokesman Nestor Benitez told Reuters. "I wouldn't want to speculate over the outcome. "The other second round matches will take place as established in the official programme." The Chilean soccer federation said it had offered to let San Luis and Guadalajara play in Santiago but the government ruled out the proposal. "Our position today  is to not accept such a request," health ministry official Julio Montt told reporters. ESTIMATES DOWN Mexico said on Friday that up to 101 people had died from the disease, down from earlier estimates which had put the total at up to 176. Domestic football in Mexico has continued and the weekend's matches will all be played behind closed doors. Mexican teams are not members of the CSF but three take part in the Libertadores every year under a special agreement. The Libertadores has a tight schedule with the second round, second leg ties due to be played next week, followed by the quarter-final first and second legs in successive weeks. One solution that has been mooted is for Guadalajara and San Luis to meet each other in the second round while Sao Paulo would face Nacional. The Libertadores Cup is the region's equivalent of the European Champions Lea
