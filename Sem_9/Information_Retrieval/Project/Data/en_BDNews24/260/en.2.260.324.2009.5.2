 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)The 16-strong committee tasked with devising a national education policy meet Sunday, 25 days into its formation on Apr. 7, a member of the panel said Saturday. Headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury, the committee will convene at 10am at the National Academy of Educational Management, member Kazi Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid announced the committee on Apr 8 and had said the committee will act fast to introduce a new education policy modelled on Kudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission and updated in line with Dr Shamsul Alam Education Policy. The Awami league government in its 1996-2001 stint had tailored the policy. Nahid had said, "We have asked for a report within three months so that we can start putting the policy into practice by this year." "The committee will have 90 days from its first sitting [to formulate the policy]." The committee members include Bangladesh Economic Association president Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman, and Shahjalal University of Science and Technology teacher Dr Muhammed Zafar Iqbal, among others. Nine education committees have formed to introduce an education policy since independence, but none of them were fully implemented. A number of educationists told earlier bdnews24.com the government should form a permanent commission and put in place a policy so that the permanent commission can revise it regularly
