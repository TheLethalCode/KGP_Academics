 SUVA, May 02 (bdnews24.com/reuters) - The Pacific Islands Forum on Saturday suspended Fiji from the 16-nation grouping with immediate effect, after its military leader failed to meet a deadline to announce fresh elections, the forum's chairman said. Fiji was plunged into fresh crisis last month after the president reappointed Commodore Frank Bainimarama as interim prime minister, less than two days after a court ruled the military leader's 2006 coup and subsequent government was illegal. Bainimarama was given a deadline of Friday to outline plans to return the country to democracy. But he said there would be no election until 2014 and extended emergency laws. "It is with considerable sorrow and disappointment that I confirm the suspension of the current military regime in the Republic of the Fiji Islands, from full participation in the Pacific Islands Forum, with immediate effect from 2 May, 2009," chairman Toke Talagi said in a statement. "A regime which displays such a total disregard for basic human rights, democracy and freedom has no place in the Pacific Islands Forum." Talagi, premier of the island nation of Niue, said Fiji remained a member of the forum and expulsion had not been considered so far. The decision follows a meeting in January in Port Moresby, where the grouping discussed Fiji, which has suffered four coups and a bloody military mutiny since 1987. On Friday, Bainimarama said he planned to continue emergency regulations under which troops and police have been sent into media and government offices to gag opposition to his reform plans.
