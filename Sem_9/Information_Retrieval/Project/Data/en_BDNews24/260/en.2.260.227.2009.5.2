 LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. sports tycoon Stan Kroenke has increased his stake in English Premier League club Arsenal to 28.3 percent and become the club's biggest shareholder. Arsenal issued a statement on Friday saying Kroenke, who joined the club's board last year, had bought 4,839 shares from members of director Richard Carr's family. He paid more than 41 million pounds ($61.04 million) for the shares having purchased them for between 8,500 and 10,500 pounds each, the club said on its website (www.arsenal.com).

The American's increased investment was welcomed on Friday by the Arsenal Supporters' Trust (AST), whose members hold about three percent of the club's equity. "The AST were the first shareholders at Arsenal to welcome Kroenke's initial investment. We have since established a good dialogue with him and this will continue," it said in a statement on its website (www.arsenaltrust.org). "Our position is that stability and plurality in ownership is to the benefit of Arsenal. "We hope he will build relationships with all shareholders so that club has stability off the pitch which is a vital ingredient for success on it".
