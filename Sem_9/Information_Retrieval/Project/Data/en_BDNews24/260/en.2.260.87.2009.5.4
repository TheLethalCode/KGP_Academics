<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The US has once again pursued Bangladesh to recognise Muslim-majority Kosovo, a breakaway Serbian republic that declared independence defying Russia and its allies. US ambassador James F Moriarty on Monday saw foreign minister Dipu Moni and lobbied for Kosovo's recognition from Bangladesh, the world's third largest Muslim country. Moriarty said he would try to make an appointment with prime minister Sheikh Hasina for her to meet with president Barack Obama. "We went over a variety of bilateral issues," he told reporters of the meeting with the foreign minister. "The one big international issue I referred once again to is the question of recognition of Kosovo," Moriarty said. "I urged the government of Bangladesh to quickly review the issue and move forward with recognition, if possible," he said. The envoy said 58 countries have recoginsed the tiny country in the Balkan region. "Earlier, the (Bangladesh's) response had been that they wanted to see the OIC countries recognise [Kosovo]. "In this meeting, I pointed out that you have Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Malaysia and Turkey--they all recognised. "So, this is a good time to move forward," said Moriarty who received an awarded from the US government for his role in framing the US policy toward Balkan states. Last year, the US envoy saw former foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at least twice to press for Kosovo's recognition since the tiny country declared independence on Feb 17 last year. The envoy also saw Dipu Moni after she took office in Jan and lobbied for the acknowledgment. Foreign minister Dipu Moni did not talk to the media on the issue. "I have no knowledge about Kosovo's recognition," an foreign ministry official quoted foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain as saying after the meeting. On Dec 18 last year, the foreign ministry issued a statement saying Bangladesh was closely monitoring the developments in Kosovo. On July 1, 2008, Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh would consider national interests in recognising Kosovo. "On such matters (recognition of any country), we take into consideration how we will benefit from it. There are some political problems," the adviser had said. Kosovo, a tiny Muslim majority state in the former Yugoslavia, declared independence with supports from the United States and the European Union. Serbia and its close ally Russia rejected the independence, saying such a move by Kosovo was a violation of a UN resolution (No. 1244). Russia also threatened to use its veto power in the voting for Kosovo's membership to the UN. On the prime minister's probable meeting with Obama, the ambassador said he was "in discussion" with Bangladesh government for the meeting. "If she does decide to go, we will hope sorting out meeting to the extent we can," the ambassador said. He, however, said, "I don't have any word back from Washington (in this regard)". Hasina, who is scheduled to leave Dhaka for Canada to see her daughter, has expressed her eagerness to meet Obama if the Sstate Department allowed.
