 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Two people suffered critical burns Monday after an oil tanker caught fire at a CNG filling station at Mohakhali in the capital, police said. 'Lokman', a van driver, and Mohammad Sharif, an automobile mechanic, have been admitted to the Burns Unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Mohammad Omar Faruque, officer in charge of Tejgaon police, said. Police immediately closed Shaheed Tajuddin Ahmed Sarani from Mohakhali to the Sat Rasta crossing, forcing traffic movement on the route to come to a halt for two hours. Black plumes of smoke could be seen billowing up after the fire suddenly broke out at around 4.45pm. The lorry of supplier Padma Oil was being emptied into the reserved tank of the Amam Enterprise and CNG Filling Station when it went up in flames, Mir Akbar Hossain, owner of nearby Akbar Automobile, told bdnews24.com. Fire later spread to a neighbouring garage and damaged four cars and a microbus, he said. Firefighters doused the fire at around 6:30pm, Faruq, the OC, said. Kwari Mohammad Anwar Hossain, owner of the CNG station, said the fire was an accident and he had no idea how it happened. "We are suspecting that somebody carelessly threw a burning cigarette as the reason," Abdur Rashid, deputy director of Fire Service, Dhaka Division, told bdnews24.com. bdne
