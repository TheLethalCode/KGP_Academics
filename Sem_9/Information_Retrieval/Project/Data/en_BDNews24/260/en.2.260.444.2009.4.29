 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lankan K Perera struck an unbeaten century against the Bangladesh Under-19 team in the three-day drawn match on the final day Wednesday at the Birshreshtha Shaheed Matiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. Sri Lankan U-19s, who had started their second innings with a 28-run lead after bowling the hosts out for 257, were 260-6 at the close of the final day with Perera remaining unbeaten on 114 off 177 balls that featured 12 boundaries. The visitors lost opener D Dhandimal off the fourth delivery of paceman Kamrul Islam, who ran through the top order to reduce them to 41-3 inside 13 overs. Then, spin duo Mahmudul Hasan and S Romman removed A Perera and V Perera respectively to leave the visitors struggling at 95-5 before K Perera along with I Udayanga repaired the damage with a brilliant 165-run stand for the sixth wicket. Hasan finally broke the stand having Udayanga caught by Romman for 78, but K Perera remained unbeaten with Peris, who, however, did not face any delivery before the close. Bangladesh had earlier added only 28 runs for three wickets to their overnight 229-7. Noor Hossain converted his overnight 49 to exact 50 before being caught by B Rajapaksa off L Jayarathne while his overnight partner Taibur Rahman took score 54 to 79. bd
