<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation is more or less satisfied with the performance of the national football team in the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers but wants to review the performance of all three matches especially against Myanmar. Bangladesh finished second behind champions Myanmar and qualified for the eight-team finals as the best runners-up among four qualifying groups. Bangladesh beat Cambodia and Macau 1-0 and 3-0 respectively but went 2-1 down to Myanmar despite taking the lead. "We are more or less happy after Bangladesh qualified for the final round but we are keen on reviewing the reasons behind the Myanmar defeat," BFF vice-president and chairman of the National Team Management Committee Badal Roy told reporters on Saturday. The NTMC will also review the performance of those persons who were involved with the team during the tournament and would ask them to submit their reports within a short period. The NTMC also was also thinking of making a training bridge between the clubs and the national team so that the players can cope with the national team's training after being called up for the international games, said Roy. "We think we have something to do in the club-level coaching and we will provide guidelines through holding a workshop," said Roy. The former national footballer thinks that there is no alternative to conducting a long-term training for the national team as well as maintain the age-group teams. "No doubt, the final round of the AFC Challenge Cup will be a high-level competition and we need to improve a lot in some sectors," said Roy. Roy also believes the national team would be stronger as much as club-level football has improved. The NTMC chairman hinted that they might consider the experienced footballers in future as it seemed that the lack of experienced footballers in the side affected the outcome against Myanmar. Meanwhile, the NTMC will cut the match fee ($50) and winning bonus ($200) of right-back Nasir Hossain, who picked up a second yellow card unnecessarily to be sent off against Myanmar Besides, each player of the squad will receive $550 ($150 for fees of three matches and $400 for winning bonus of two matches). bd
