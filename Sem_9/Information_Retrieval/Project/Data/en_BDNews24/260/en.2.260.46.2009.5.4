<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Monday granted BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and three other lawyers permission to appeal in four weeks to overturn the landmark High Court judgement declaring illegal the fifth amendment to the constitution. The amendment had given constitutional legitimacy to military governments after the 1975 assassination of independence hero president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a military coup. Monday's ruling by the seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin stays the High Court verdict through the next four weeks, a lawyer said. The court heard two separate petitions submitted by the BNP secretary general and Supreme Court lawyers Munshi Ahsan Kabir, Tajul Islam and Kamruzzaman Bhuiyan. It observed that because the matter was of public importance and related to the constitution of Bangladesh the appellants were permitted to file 'leave to appeal' within four weeks. "So, the decision on the government appeal for scrapping the appeal filed against the HC verdict declaring the fifth amendment illegal will also be given after four weeks," TH Khan, the counsel for Delwar, told reporters. The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) late Monday rushed a meeting to protest the Supreme Court agreeing to consider admitting the petition against the High Court verdict. The government Sunday petitioned the court to withdraw the appeal that contested the Aug 29, 2005 High Court verdict. The High Court bench of judges ABM Khairul Haque and ATM Fazle Kabir declared all the regimes from Aug 15, 1975 to 1979 headed by Khandaker Mushtaque Ahmed, Abu Sa'dat Mohammad Sayem and Ziaur Rahman illegal. The judgement came upon a writ petition challenging Martial Law Regulation VII, 1977, over the validity of then the military government The judgment had said the martial law promulgation was entirely illegal and unconstitutional, and hence all deliberations, laws and regulations made during the period stood automatically cancelled. b
