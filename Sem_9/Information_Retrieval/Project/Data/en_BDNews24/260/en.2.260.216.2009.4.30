<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) A parliamentary watchdog said the state-controlled Bangladesh Television (BTV) had not got changed kowtowing to the ruling party of the day though the Awami League came to power promising change. "But we don't see any change in the activities of the BTV during the last four months. The BTV is continuing to function stereotypically," Obaidul Quader, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on information ministry, told reporters after a committee meeting Thursday. "We talk about digital Bangladesh. But only words will not bring any change. We must change our mindset." He said some BTV staff, who had been there for decades, have always been sycophantic to please governments. "They praise one government. The same people change overnight and highly admire the next," said Quader, a former state minister of the Awami League government. "Those people need to be removed," he said. The chairman said parties would have some influence on political governments, but the influence must not assume to the level of wholesale politicisation. He said the BTV's terrestrial facilities would be useless unless it was popular with the people. Information minister Abul Kalam Azad and other committee members attended the meeting.
