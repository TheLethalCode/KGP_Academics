Rabiul and his wife Fatema, 18, have been detained by the police as suspects in the twin murder case. The couple in a bid to hush up the crime had initially buried the boys on the canal bank. As the boys' family members started looking for them, the execution came to be known widely. Police dug out the bodies after Rabiul confessed to murdering his brothers. The bodies were sent to Barisal for autopsy.
