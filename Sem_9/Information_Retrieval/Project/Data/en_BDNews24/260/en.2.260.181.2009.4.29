 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)The budget for 2009-10 fiscal year may allocate Tk 29,000 crore for the annual development programme, the planning minister said Wednesday. "I can't recall the exact figure but, it would be around Tk 29,000 crore," AK Khandaker told reporters after emerging from a seminar in the capital. The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) organised the seminar titled, 'Meeting the challenges of Global Recession and its Impact on the Economy: Recommendations for the National budget for FY 2009-10'. The ADP allocations are likely to be finalised Thursday at the National Economic Council meeting to be chaired by the prime minister. The ADP portfolio for FY 2008-09 was Tk 25,600 crore and Tk 26,000 crore for FY 2007-08. BIDS, the government's research arm, however, recommended the ADP in FY 2009-10 be limited within Tk 26,000 crore. "Alternatively, given the low implementation rate, the target of ADP could be set at a higher level, say at around Tk 30,000 crore," M Asaduzzaman, a BIDS research director, said in the key-note presentation. There is a need to develop new funding and institutional mechanism for projects for better sanitation and drinking water including relevant environmental rules enforcement, he added. Bangladesh's economy has shown reasonable stability until now despite external threats in the backdrop of global financial turmoil, said Asaduzzaman. "The economy is likely to grow at around 6 percent if the present economic trends continue," he said. The economy, however, has shown some signs of slowdown, especially in terms of export earnings and remittance inflows, the BIDS official added. "Overall export growth led by RMG (readymade garments) sector is still satisfactory but sectors like leather, shrimp, jute and jute goods have been hit hard." He, however, emphasised the need for a constant monitoring of export sectors especially apparel to take appropriate steps, if needed. The upcoming budget should provide support to overcome adverse impact on economic and social life from the global recession, according to BIDS. Asaduzzaman said the government initiative to tackle the fallout of global economic recession was on the right track so far but efficient implementation remains as the major challenge. BIDS suggested a crisis coping fund for three years to meet demands like loans to export entities with working capital difficulties due to a cut in recent export orders, low cost employment loans for retrenched workers and funding to start small business by recent returnee migrants. On investment priorities for the budget, the government's research arm said agriculture and infrastructure should be focused, with special attention to energy. It suggested a more direct procurement system rather than through millers along with higher allocation for cutting-edge technology and a single farm subsidy in the case of subsidies for both diesel and fertiliser. Touching social protection, BIDS suggested rationalising social safety net programmes by combining similar objectives blended with health service supports like health insurance for industry workers and micro health insurance for rural people. The planning minister told the seminar that the budget would focus on improving quality of public expenditure, supporting agriculture and rural economy, and addressing quality and equity issues in education and health. He said the government has attached high priority to the power sector. "The sector will also receive adequate allocations in the budget while measures would be also taken to attract more foreign and private investment," said Khandaker. The session chaired by BIDS director general Mustafa K Mujeri also heard from ex-finance minister M Saiduzzaman, PKSF's managing director Kazi Mesbahuddin, BRAC executive director Mahbub Hossain and BIDS research director Rushidan Islam Rahman.
