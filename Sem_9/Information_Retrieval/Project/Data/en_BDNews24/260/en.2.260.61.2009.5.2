<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has urged engineers to help the government to build better, cheaper and hygienic homes down to Union Parishad, the lowest tier of local government. "Come forward to invent new building technology to construct cheaper houses," she said at the 61st anniversary of the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh, the apex body of engineers. She said nearly 85 percent of development allocations are spent through the engineers and asked them to maintain quality in construction. The building technology should be environmentally friendly and durable. "Installations are raised at random and the environment is ignored," she pointed out. The prime minister suggested that dredgers be manufactured locally to dig the rivers to increase their capacity to retain water and help stop people lose their homes to river erosion. She said embankments can no more be built on crop land. "Forty-one hundred megawatt of electricity was produced on Friday, and so there was no load-shedding," she said while talking about steps to resolve power crisis. However, she said since distribution and supply systems were not reformed it would not be possible to provide electricity despite increased production. Thousands of crores of taka have been siphoned out of the country but people did not get power, she added. Curbing price hike of essesntial goods and forming taskforce to counter global recession have so far been the successes of her government, the prime minister said. "Work without fear. We get sued, we go to jail," she told engineers. "Politicisation went on for five years. Then everyone was in panic for two years. Now there is an elected government." she said added. She sought their help in introducing in e-governance and asked them not to indulge in indolence, corruption and procrastination. IEB president AM Nazrul Islam and general secretary Mesbahur Rahman Tutul also spoke at the programme. Hasina unveiled a memorial plaque on the institute premises in remembrance of engineers who lost their lives in the independence war. bdnew
