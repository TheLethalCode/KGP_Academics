 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government and United Nations Development Programme will sign a deal Thursday to reduce the climate change vulnerabilities of coastal people communities, a UNDP press release said Wednesday. The agreement will be signed for the implementation of a Tk 37 crore project styled, "Community-Based Adaptation to Climate Change Through Coastal Afforestation in Bangladesh". The project aims to help to enhance the resilience of both coastal communities, and protective ecosystems through community-led adaptation interventions that focus on coastal afforestation and livelihood diversification, UNDP said. Jointly funded by the Global Environment Facility/Least Developing Countries Climate Change Facility (GEF/LDCF), UNDP and the government, the project aims to help review and revise management practices and policies that increase community resilience to climate change impacts in these areas. It is designed to develop a functional system for the collection and dissemination of climate-related knowledge, the organisation added. It also aims to enhance the national, sub-national and local capacities of government authorities and sectoral planners to understand climate risk dynamics in coastal areas and implement appropriate risk reduction measures. The five coastal districts in which the project would be operated are Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Noakhali and Chittagong.
