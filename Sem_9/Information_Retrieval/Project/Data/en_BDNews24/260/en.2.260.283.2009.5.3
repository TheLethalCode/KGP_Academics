<TITLE> UK minister says Brown's party guilty of "failure" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sun May 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A senior minister in British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labor party warned on Sunday his government was at risk of electoral disaster, saying it was guilty of a "lamentable failure" to connect with voters. Brown's woes have been growing this year, with Britain recording a record budget deficit, ministers facing embarrassment over parliamentary expenses and growing reports of unease in his party as electoral support ebbs away. Brown is currently up to 18 points behind the opposition Conservatives, indicating Labor is facing losing power for the first time since its 1997 landslide win in the wake of Britain's worst economic decline since World War Two. Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears, a usually loyal Cabinet member, echoed views of dissenting Labor politicians that the government needed a dramatic change of direction or it could be routed at the next election due by June 2010. "Labor's standing has taken a titanic battering in recent weeks," Blears wrote in Sunday's Observer newspaper. "Labor ministers have a collective responsibility for the government's lamentable failure to get our message across." The prime minister's personal authority has taken a battering in the last week after he had to back down on plans to overhaul politicians' allowances, a scheme he announced on the YouTube website. That came days after he suffered a rare parliamentary defeat over proposals to change rules governing Nepalese Gurkha soldiers' rights to settle in Britain, leading well-known opponents within his party to snipe at his leadership. But in what was also seen as a criticism of Brown, Blears used her article to mock the use of new media and called on ministers to engage directly with an electorate angry at rising unemployment, falling house prices and low returns on savings. "YouTube if you want to. But it's no substitute for knocking on doors or setting up a stall in the town center," Blears said. On the Gurkha issue, she commented: "We put ourselves on the wrong side of the British sense of fair play, and no political party can stay there for long without dire consequences." While Blears said she actively backed Brown as leader, other Labor figures gave a damning assessment of his position, leading to speculation that there could be moves to oust him. Former interior minister Charles Clarke said in the Mail on Sunday paper that Brown had been surrounded by a "poisonous team," a reference to one of his close aides who had to resign after he was caught trying to smear political rivals. Papers suggested there could be a plot to replace Brown with Health Secretary Alan Johnson, and former Labor London mayor Ken Livingstone told BBC TV he believed the party would do better in a parliamentary poll with Johnson in charge. But Johnson was quick to pour cold water on the suggestion and said Brown, who only took over from Tony Blair in 2007, had his full backing. "How many more times do you want me to say this? I have no aspiration for the leadership. I am not driven by this ambition," he told BBC television. "I admire Gordon Brown tremendously, I think he is a man for these times. He can do it a lot better than I could do it or anyone e
