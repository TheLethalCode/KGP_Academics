 KARACHI, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ethnic violence broke out in Pakistan's biggest city of Karachi on Wednesday, killing at least 18 people and wounding dozens, officials said. Karachi, Pakistan's commercial hub and the capital of southern Sindh province, has a long history of ethnic, religious and sectarian violence but the sprawling city has been relatively peaceful in recent years. The city is dominated by Mohajirs, Urdu-speaking people who migrated from India after Pakistan was created in 1947, but there is a sizeable population of ethnic Pashtuns. Violence erupted in different parts of the city after an unidentified man opened fire on a mohajir neighbourhood in the centre of the city. "It was the result of a dispute between two groups," city police chief Waseem Ahmed said, referring to the two ethic communities. Provincial health minister Sagheer Ahmed put the death toll at 18. Hospital officials said dozens of wounded people wounded brought for treatment to hospitals. More than two dozens cars and several shops were torched in violence across the city, police said
