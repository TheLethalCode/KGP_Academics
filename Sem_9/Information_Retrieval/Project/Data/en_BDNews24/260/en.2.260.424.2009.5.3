 Biswadip Das, with report from Amit Talukdar, bdnews24.com Legal Affairs Correspondent Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)After moments of high drama, a third High Court bench admitted Sunday the writ petition of BNP chief Khaleda Zia against a government order that asked her to vacate Dhaka Cantonment house. After two other benches declined to hear the appeal, including one that had originally admitted the petition, the bench of justices Zinnat Ara and Abdul Hakim agreed to hear it next Sunday. The bench adjourned the hearing on the attorney general's assurance that the government would not move in a week to evict the former prime minister. Earlier, the bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam Siddiqui felt embarrassed to hear the petition that sought a stay on the government order. Another bench, made of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque that had permitted the lawyers for the opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal felt embarrassed in hearing the appeal. The attorney general sought one week's time from the court to prepare argument. Khaleda's lawyers pleaded with the court to hear the appeal right away and stay the government notice, otherwise the government may evict her after Tuesday, the deadline to leave the house. Now, Khaleda is not obligated to do so pending appeal. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda the notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house within 15 days. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and she violated lease terms. 'Embarrassed' Attorney general Mahbubey Alam told reporters at his office Justice Quamrul Islam Siddiqui and Justice M Azizul Haque felt embarrassed to hear the petition. He quoted Justice Siddiqui as saying that he was embarrassed because he had served at the law ministry when Khaleda was alloted the house in 1981. He did some paperworks on the allotment and gave opinions on the matter, as well. He believed he should not hear the petition for the sake of fair justice, according to the attorney general. Alam added Justice M Azizul Haque assigned no reason as to what had caused him to feel embarrass. Appeal filed Khaleda's lawyers had filed the writ appeal at 1:30pm with the first bench to overturn the April 20 notice served by the military lands and cantonments directorate. Her counsel Mahabub Uddin Khokon told bdnews24.com at noon, "We have got permission to file the writ petition." "I'm taking the affidavit to my client now for her signature. We hope to deposit the writ appeal today." He said court order for affidavit deposition is an integral part of the writ filing procedure. Khaleda responds Khaleda responded to the government's notice with a legal notice of her own on April 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981 during a military uprising, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision of cancelling Khaleda house lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. b
