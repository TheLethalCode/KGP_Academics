<TITLE> Media regains freedom in Bangladesh, says watchdog </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Media regained some of its former freedoms that declined in 2007 because of lifting of the emergency rule and enactment of right to information law, a global media watchdog has said in a new report. The US-based Freedom House said in the study, styled "Freedom of the Press 2009", that Bangladesh saw a five-point improvement in media freedom due to improved legal conditions. The report that was released in Washington on Friday to focus on the global media freedom said there were fewer cases of harassment and violence against journalists, who were consequently better able to cover sensitive political events like the December national elections. As Bangladesh's position got a boost, the Freedom House painted a grim picture for the Asia-Pacific region. It said the position of Cambodia dropped to "not free" status because of increased violence against journalists while Hong Kong slipped to "partly free" as Beijing exerted growing influence over media. It said China's media environment remained bleak, and media in Taiwan faced assault and growing government pressure. In South Asia, the Maldives and Pakistan saw improvements, while Sri Lanka and Afghanistan suffered setbacks. The watchdog said the worldwide trend of media freedom continues to nosedive. "Journalists faced an increasingly grim working environment in 2008, with global press freedom declining for a seventh straight year and deterioration occurring for the first time in every region," the study said. It said the rollback was not confined to traditionally authoritarian states; with Israel, Italy and Hong Kong slipping from the study's "Free" category to "Partly Free" status. Authoritarian states are increasingly consolidating control of the media. In the last five years, space for independent media shrunk significantly in countries like Russia, Ethiopia and The Gambia. "The journalism profession today is up against the ropes and fighting to stay alive, as pressures from governments, other powerful actors and the global economic crisis take an enormous toll," said Jennifer Windsor, Freedom House executive director. "The press is democracy's first defense and its vulnerability has enormous implications for democracy if journalists are not able to carry out their traditional watchdog role.
