 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The case over the assassination of four national leaders in 1975 will be re-investigated, the state minister for home said Wednesday. Tanjim Ahmed said the trial process of the four who led the government-in-exile during the war of independence from Pakistan in 1971 is a 'farce'. Syed Nazrul Islam, acting president of the Bangladesh government in exile in 1971, Tajuddin Ahmed, prime minister, M Mansur Ali, finance minister, and AHM Qamaruzzaman, minister for home affairs, relief and rehabilitation, were killed in ide the Dhaka Central Jail on Nov. 3, 1975, days after independence hero and president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed with much of his family. He said the government will sign agreements, if needed, to get countries extradite killers to face trial for the assassination of 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujib. He , however, declined comments when asked by reporters whether the two convicted killers now living in the United States are under observation. Six of the 12 convicts are fugitives abroad, five are at Dhaka Central Jail and the other one died in Zimbabwe. He also said this is the right time to hold war crimes trial but some time will be needed for a proper trial. Almost 43 percent of Annual Development Programme has been implemented, he said after a three-hour meeting at his ministry. Steps are on way to make sure the allocated funds are not pulled out, he said. Representatives from nine departments including Police, RAB, BDR, and passport and immigration, and officials from different ministries were present at the meeting. bd
