 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Senior Political Correspondent Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has said the government is plotting to bring in foreign troops under the cover of its anti-militancy fight. She told a rally at Paltan ground in the capital Saturday that the her bitter rival prime minister Sheikh Hasina's administration has done nothing in the four months since it took office, instead it created problem in every step. It has failed to supply with gas, power and running water, provide people with job and peaceful life, she said at the gathering marking the May Day. The public meeting organised by Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, the labour wing of main opposition BNP, began shortly after 3pm Saturday. RAB and police personnel have been posted at Paltan ground and surrounding areas including Bangabandhu National Stadium, Maolana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani Hockey Stadium and on the roofs of Shilpa Bhaban and RAJUK Bhaban. SWAT is encircling the dais while RAB is manning the outer peremetre. Sramik Dal's president and BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan is presiding over the meeting. Top BNP leaders are on-stage. BNP asked the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Friday to ensure "enough security" for the planned public meeting, party officials said. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina addressed a huge rally organised by ruling Awami League's labour front Jatiya Sramik League at the same venue Friday. However, there was no bullet-proof glass shield on the stage for Khaleda though the prime minister had the protection at Friday's meeting. Leaders and workers of BNP and its associate organisations started coming to the Paltan ground in small processions from 1pm. They were checked by the security personnel before being allowed in the venue. This will be the first meeting of the BNP at Paltan since its massive defeat in the Dec 29, 2008 parliamentary elections. Khaleda last delivered speech at Paltan on Dec 27, the last day of election campaigns. Metropolitan BNP's former president Sadeque Hossain Khoka said supporters of BNP's all fronts will attend the meeting. "Since it is our first rally in the capital after the election, we have taken massive preparation," Khoka, also Dhaka mayor, added. b
