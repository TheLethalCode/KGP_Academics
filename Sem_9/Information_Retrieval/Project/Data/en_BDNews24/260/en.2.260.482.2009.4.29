<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP will file a writ petition with the High Court Sunday over the government notice that asked Khaleda Zia to vacate her Dhaka Cantonment house, a senior leader said. "We have decided to challenge the government notice through a writ petition with the High Court on Sunday," the party's policymaking National Standing Committee member Moudud Ahmed told reporters Wednesday on the sideline of a discussion at the National Press Club. Moudud said the government's notice on the cancellation on the lease of the 6 Shaheed Moinul Road house stands against "the country's law, the constitution and various verdicts given by the Supreme Court". "Preparations are on to file the petition on Sunday," he added. Earlier in the day, state minister for public works Abdul Mannan Khan said that the government was ready to face the challenge by the BNP to take the issue to the higher court. "The government will obviously face the issue legally. We hope they will accept the court ruling." BNP threatened to move to the court protesting against the government's refusal to reply to legal notice served by Khaleda. On the notice, Mannan said: "It is the government's prerogative to reply or not to reply to the notice." He asked Khaleda to vacate the mansion. "The family has enjoyed the most government facilities. I hope Khaleda who was twice elected prime minister will vacate the house being respectful of law." The military lands and cantonment directorate on April 20 in a notice asked Khaleda to leave the house in 15 days. Three days later Khaleda responded with a legal notice of her own on the government, asking it to withdraw the notice by Tuesday. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters Monday that the government would not reply to the legal notice. The legal notice sent by Khaleda's lawyers said that then the president had allotted Khaleda the house on a yearly rent basis after the assassination of army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981. The house was registered on July 13, 1981 and Khaleda along with her family members had been residing at this house for over 27 years, said the notice. Therefore, it was illegal in the eye of law to be asked to vacate the house by serving a notice, it said. The notice also said that Khaleda would take further legal steps unless the government notice was withdrawn. The cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on Khaleda's cantonment house saying it was not legal to allocate one person the lease of two houses simultaneously. Khaleda was given another house in Gulshan. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina earlier requested the opposition chief in parliament to leave the house for building flats for the army officers slain in the Feb. BDR mutiny. bdnews24.co
