 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  Enamul Haq Bijoy cracked 80 to steer the Bangladesh U-19s to a five-wicket win over their Sri Lankan counterparts in the second one-dayer at the Shamsul Huda Stadium in Jessore on Monday. The win means the five-match series is now level at 1-1. Bangladesh raced to 206-5 in 42.1 overs after Sri Lanka U-19s were 204 all out in 46.5 overs with spinner Sabbir Rahman Rummon grabbing four for 45 in his eight-over spell. Opener U Jayasuhoara top-scored with 49 followed by B Raja Paksa with 37, Anjelo Perera added 36 and Chatkura Perera made 34 before Mahmudul Hasan broke the middle order to return three for 26. Bangladesh, in reply, were reduced to 12-2 inside seven overs but opener Amit Majumdar and Bijoy eased the pressure to take the side to 93-3 before Amit was out for a patient 27 off 50 balls. However, Bijoy kept on blunting the opponent bowlers with a cracking 80 before retiring hurt. His 74-ball innings was studded with six fours and three fours. Later, Sabbir Rahman Rummon and Noor Hossain remained unbeaten on 36 and 23 to steer the hosts home. bd
