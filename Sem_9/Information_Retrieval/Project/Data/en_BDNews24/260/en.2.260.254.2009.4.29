 Dhaka Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)The government announced Wednesday the appointment of development researcher Atiur Rahman to head of the central bank. An establishment ministry order said he has been appointed on contract for next four years to replace the outgoing governor Salehuddin Ahmed who ends his four-year tenure on as the ninth governor Thursday. His appointment will come into effect from May 1, the order said. A finance ministry official who declined to be named told bdnews24.com on Apr 26 that the former research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies who now runs an NGO and teaches development studies at Dhaka University, was picked to helm the Bangladesh Bank. Atiur later told bdnews24.com on Apr 26: "I have received the news ... by phone. But I have not yet received any official notice or letter." "I'm on the road, returning from Nepal. I just came out of the airport and am on my way home," he added. When asked to confirm, the finance minister, A M A Muhith, had not given a direct reply. "Wait until tomorrow," a smiling Muhith told bdnews24.com at his secretariat office Sunday. An aide to the finance minister, speaking anonymously, told bdnews24.com that Muhith had "already congratulated Atiur Rahman on his appointment". The announcement came a day before the incumbent governor, Salehuddin Ahmed, ends his four-year tenure. A professor at the recently-opened deprtament of development studies at the Dhaka University, Atiur will now have to deal with monetary economics as central bank supremo. During the 1996-2001 Awami League tenure, he served as a director of Bangladesh's largest Sonali Bank and then chairman of the state-owned Janata Bank. Atiur's research focussed more on poverty, and the most acclaimed included work on char (shoal) dwellers and poverty alleviation.
