<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The central land allocation committee did not allocate any land for three projects because those violated the government policy for protecting farmland and production, the land minister said Sunday. Rezaul Karim Hira told reporters the decision was made to ensure no loss of crop land and production by erection of structures. The relevant authorities were ordered to build high-rise structures on minimum space, he added. The three projects include 400 KV Power Transmission Line in Amin Bazar in Dhaka, Police Line for Barisal Metropolitan Police and a residential plan by Sight and Services for low-income people in Narsingdi. The committee declined to approve the projects and sent those back for further scrutiny before it reconsidered them in the next meeting. However, the committee gave a nod to a proposal to allocate 277.78 acres of land to expand Chittagong cantonment and around 29 decimal of land to facilitate BCS Welfare Multipurpose Cooperative Society's housing. The committee also discussed proposals to allocate lands for 13 projects but endorsed three. The approval goes to the projects on communications, health facilities, postal development and Armed Forces Division. On the expansion of Chittagong Cantonment, he said a mere 13 out of 277.78 acres of land is agricultural and the rest is hilly. On whether cut hills will clash with the law, the minister said there will be no need to get clearance from environment and forest affairs ministry. The government allotted the land for cantonment, he explained. On allegations of irregularities in paying the price of requisitioned land, he said it was the deputy commissioners who will play and the ministry will provide money. But, he said he was ready to act if his ministry received such allegations. b
