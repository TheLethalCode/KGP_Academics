<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 30 (bdnews24.com)Knitwear manufacturers and exporters sat in a meeting with prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday to draw her attention to nagging power crisis and the impact of global recession on the sector. The meeting started at around 11am at the Prime Minister's Office. Md. Fazlul Hoque, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), said Wednesday that they could propose to the government for even importing power to ensure smooth production in their factories. The businesses often say that their production is being terribly hampered and the cost of production is skyrocketing because of the electricity crisis. They hugely depend on generator backup, but on-and-off power supplies put the production on the edge amid tight deadline for shipment. The government says it is also trying to divert power to the industrial zones from other areas. It has stopped supplying gas to a fertiliser factory in Chittagong to ensure enough gas flow to a vital power plant in the region to meet its full production potential. But the situation is still beyond control because of the rising demand of electricity, and an immediate solution is not in sight, according to the power ministry. Hoque said they would prominently raise the issue of power crisis before the prime minister at the meeting. The chief of the apex body also said they would urge her to bring the businesses under the stimulus package already announced by the government in the backdrop of the worldwide economic crisis. The garment sector, the main force behind the country's export earning, has been demanding cash incentive for their industries to cope with the falling prices of the products that are mainly shipped to Europe and the United States, the origin of the economic crisis. The sector's leaders say they are facing tremendous pressure from competitors such as India, China and Vietnam because of the falling prices in global market, high bank interest rate inside the country and rising production cost. The country annually earns around $12 billion from readymade garment, which prominently includes knitwear products. bdnews24.co
