 KABUL, April 01 (bdnews24.com/ Reuters) - Five Western soldiers including three Americans were killed in an attack by insurgents in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, U.S. forces there said. U.S. military spokeswoman Captain Elizabeth Mathias said insurgents attacked an outpost in the eastern sector with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades and struck an ammunition store, causing an explosion. Mathias said three of the dead were American soldiers and two were from another country in the NATO-led force. The NATO-led force declined to name the nationalities of the other two. International and Afghan forces returned fire and called for support from the air. Mathias gave no further details of the location of the incident. The eastern sector includes 14 provinces, some of which have seen major fighting.
