 PARIS, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A stoppage-time goal from Yoann Gourcuff gave 10-man Girondins Bordeaux a 3-2 win at Stade Rennes on Wednesday to move just two points behind Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Marseille. With five games to go, Marseille have 67 points and Bordeaux, who won the League Cup on Saturday, 65. Olympique Lyon, who have won the last seven Ligue 1 championships, are third with 61 points and Paris St Germain fourth on 60. "The team who most wanted victory prevailed," Bordeaux coach Laurent Blanc told Canal Plus television. "The fact we managed to snatch victory despite being reduced to 10 is a strong message that we won't give up the fight until the end. We are still in the race." Rennes, who opened the scoring through Romain Danze after less than 20 seconds, thought they had secured a point when Moussa Sow equalised from close range in the 89th minute. Bordeaux, a man short for more than an hour after Marc Planus was sent off in the 26th minute for a bad tackle on Sow, had gone ahead in the last half hour with a superb volley from Yoan Gouffran and a Gourcuff free kick. France midfielder Gourcuff then gave the visitors victory with a powerful shot from just outside the area three minutes into stoppage time. Rennes are seventh with 51 points after their first home defeat in Ligue 1 this sea
