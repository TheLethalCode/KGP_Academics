 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)  Capital Dhaka turned into a city of procession Friday, as Jatiya Sramik League, the labour wing of ruling Awami League, organised a public rally to mark the May Day Friday.

The activists carried banners with slogans greeting independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Hasina and calling on all to uphold the ideals of the May Day.
