 MUMBAI, Mon May 4, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares jumped 6.4 percent on Monday, their biggest one-day gain in six months, as data showed factory output grew in April for the first time in five months and boosted hopes for an economic recovery. The rally took the benchmark BSE index past 12,000 points since Oct. 7, and boosted gains to more than 50 percent from a 2009 low in early March. Outsourcer Infosys Technologies, energy giant Reliance Industries and private-sector lender ICICI Bank spearheaded the rise as growing confidence about the global economy bolstered investor appetite across Asia. "Foreign funds are more confident about India because it has managed to outperform international markets in the recent rally," said Gajendra Nagpal, chief executive of Unicon Financial Intermediaries in New Delhi. Analysts had expected the market to consolidate ahead of the election results due on May 16 amid concerns of a possible fractured mandate. The market shrugged off those fears on rising interest from once risk-wary foreign funds, which poured more than $1.4 billion into Indian shares in April, their biggest one-month purchase since October 2007. "There is a great amount of money coming into India as they believe one of the two main parties will succeed in heading a relatively stable coalition," Nagpal said. The 30-share BSE index rose 731.50 points to 12,134.75, its best close in almost seven months, with all its components advancing. It has soared 51 percent since hitting a 2009 low of 8,047.17 on March 6, and is up 26 percent this year after slumping 52 percent in 2008. The benchmark had jumped 17.45 percent in April, its best monthly rise in 10 years, and made it the top performing major Asian index last month. Manufacturing activity in the Euro zone declined at its slowest pace in six months and actually grew in China and India in April, raising hopes that the sharpest slump in six decades may have bottomed out. A survey showed activity in Indian factories expanded for the first time in five months in April as a swelling orders pipeline pointed to a tentative recovery. While many analysts had said the rise since early March was a bear market rally, some now believe this could be the start of a new bull run. Search trends on Google suggest that globally, more people have been seeking information on a "bull run" since early April, while the number of those looking for a "bear market" has been on the decline. The website showed searches for "bear market" peaked in early March, when most world markets hit their 2009 lows.

Reliance Industries, India's largest-listed firm with the most weight in the main index, rose 4.6 percent to 1,885.35 rupees. The stock had jumped more than 18 percent in April on hopes the company's growth in coming quarters will be boosted by sales of gas it started pumping last month from its deep-sea field off India's east coast. Private-sector lender ICICI Bank gained 10.7 percent to 529.05 rupees, while rival HDFC Bank climbed 8.5 percent to 1,194.70 rupees. Government-run State Bank of India advanced 6.9 percent to 1,366.20 rupees, after it cut deposit rates by 25 basis points on Saturday. Shares in Indian banks were hit by the global downturn but are now attracting investors on signs of an economic recovery, with bad debts not as large as their US or European peers, analysts said. In the broader section, advancers led losers in the ratio of more than 2:1 on moderate volume of 430.5 million shares. The 50-share NSE index rose 5.2 percent to 3,654. Asian shares firmed after US data on Friday showed consumer confidence had recovered to its best level since September, sparking a rally on Wall Street.
