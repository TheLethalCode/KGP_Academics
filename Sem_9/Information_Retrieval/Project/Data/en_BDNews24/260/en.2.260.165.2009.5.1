 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com) The rally of Jatiya Sramik League, the labour wing of ruling Awami League, marking the May Day started at Paltan ground at 3:30pm Friday which prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to address. Hasina drove to the venue at 5:10pm as tight security measures have been taken in the surrounding areas. This is going to be maiden public meeting of Haisna, also ruling Awami League president, since her assumption of office as prime minister on Jan 6. She, however, had addressed a Bangladesh Chhatra League reunion assembly at Paltan ground soon after the AL formed the government early this year, which was not a public meeting in any case. Hasina had last spoke at a electoral rally at the venue on Dec 26, 2008. bdnews
