 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The government wants to introduce a uniform curriculum up to the class five in schools, the chief of the 16-strong committee tasked with devising a national education policy said Sunday after the first meeting 25 days into its formation on Apr. 7. "We would like the same curriculum to be introduced and followed countrywide so that our primary education should be one and similar experience for all students attending school up to class five," said 'national professor' Kabir Chowdhury, the education policy formulation committee chairman. He spoke to reporters after the meeting at the National Academy for Education Management in the capital. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, who announced the committee on Apr 8, also told reporters there are disparities in the primary education. " We want to remove them." Prof Chowdhury said, "Eleven types of primary education systems are followed in the country. It is creating divides" "We have to review everything and reformulate the primary curriculum and mainstream only one system across the country." The national professor reiterated that through the primary years, the learners must have similar educational experience. "This will promote and augment unity, solidarity and camaraderie countrywide, across the social tiers, reducing differences," he said. Chowdhury expressed hope that the committee might very well be able to formulate a new policy within three months. On introducing uniform curriculum to be followed by all educational institutions up to class five, the education minister said, "We'd like to free our primary education of all the disparities and differences; hence the proposed introduction of one curriculum for allat least up to class five for now." "We know it's a great challenge in this country to introduce one method of education for all children here. "But to execute what we profess to doDr Q Kholiquzzaman Ahmed has joined the committee as its co-chairto assist Kabir Chowdhury. "Two more membersOpen University vice chancellor Dr RIM Aminur Rashid and Jahangirnagar University English professor Dr Shaheen Kabirhave been co-opted into the committee." Dr Kabir is the daughter of professor Kabir Chowdhury. The minister was optimistic that the committee would be able to complete their tasks and submit completion reports within three months. Other members present at the committee meeting included Dr Muhammad Zafar Iqbal, Dr Quazi Shahidullah, principal Kazi Faruque Ahmed, Dr Shaheen Kabir and education secretary Syed Ataur Rahman. Nahid had said the committee will act fast to introduce a new education policy modelled on Kudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission and updated in line with Dr Shamsul Alam Education Policy. The Awami league government in its 1996-2001 stint had tailored the policy. Nahid had said, "We have asked for a report within three months so that we can start putting the policy into practice by this year." The committee also includes Shahjalal University of Science and Technology teacher Dr Muhammed Zafar Iqbal. Nine education committees have formed to introduce an education policy since independence, but none of them were fully implemented. A number of educationists told earlier bdnews24.com the government should form a permanent commission and put in place a policy so that the permanent commission can revise it regularly. bdne
