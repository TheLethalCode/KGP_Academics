 Dhaka, May 03 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafiq Ahmed said on Sunday those Bangladeshis who had committed crime against humanity during the 1971 independence war will be tried under International Crimes Tribunals Act 1973. He said to reporters at the secretariat: "Misunderstanding has been created regarding the law under which war criminals would be tried. Our local people, who were engaged in killing, rape, arson, looting and other activities breaching human rights, will be tried under the International Crimes Tribunals Act 1973." Investigation agency and lawyers will be appointed based on the International Crimes Tribunals 1973, the law minister said. After that tribunal will be formed, he added. Asked what the misunderstanding was, he replied, "Some media reported that Bangladeshi war criminals will be tried under the International War Crimes Act, which is not true." Shaifq said there was no outside pressure from any state to not hold war crime trials. bd
