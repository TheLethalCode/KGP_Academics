 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)  The MPs will regain the presidency of the managing committees of the private schools and colleges, the head of a parliamentary watchdog said Thursday. The education ministry will make the announcement in a gazette by May 7, Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of parliamentary standing committee on the ministry said after a meeting. Currently, the deputy commissioners and their representatives head the managing committees in a rule introduced by the past caretaker government. "We have already decided to make the MPs presidents of the managing committees of the private schools, colleges and madrasas and technical institutes," Menon said. He added that the MPs can head committees of a maximum four institutes in their constituencies, he said. The chiefs of the institutions in consultation with the MPs will make appointment of presidents of other institutions through the education boards, Menon said. The meeting also formed a committee with three MPs headed by Shah Alam to scrutinise the irregularities in private schools, colleges, madrasas and technical institutes. The caretaker government made an ordinance that stipulated that a deputy commissioner can be president of three institutes. The ordinance has become ineffective, as the current government did not pass it in the parliament. MPs previously used to head managing committees of around 30,000 private schools, colleges, madrasas and technical institutes across the country. Menon said they would discuss a 'creative question method' curriculum in the next meeting. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid, the education secretary and joint secretary, standing committee members, University Grants Commission chairman, and education board chairmen were attended the meeting. b
