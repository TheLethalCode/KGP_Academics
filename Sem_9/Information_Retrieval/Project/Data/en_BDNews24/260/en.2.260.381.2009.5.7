 Dhaka, May 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation has asked Chittagong Mohammedan SC to explain why its three Ghanaian footballers complained that they were yet to be paid their contract money. "We want to know the facts from Chittagong Mohammedan after their three foreign players made allegations of non-payment of their contract," BFF general secretary Al Musabbir Sadi told reporters on Thursday. Raphael Sagno, Musa Camara and Camara Saifullah wrote allegedly stating that they could not leave for their country because Chittagong Mohammedan hadn't paid them in full yet. The trio helped the club finish fifth in the second edition of the B. League and took them to the semi-finals of the Federation Cup as well as Super Cup this season. Chittagong Mohammedan manager M Yousuf also agreed that they had not paid their dues to the trio on disciplinary ground. "One of them was absent for one month after seeking only 10 days leave and they allegedly played outside on hire during the B. League and violated the code of contract," said Yousuf adding that they, however, offered the players to discuss the matter. bd
