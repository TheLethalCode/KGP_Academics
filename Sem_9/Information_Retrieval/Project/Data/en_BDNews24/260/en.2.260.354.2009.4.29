 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)The government will change the immigration law to make provision of compensation for the cheated workers, the expatriates welfare minister has said. At a discussion meeting on migration and global economic meltdown at Hotel Sonargaon on Wednesday, Khondker Mosharraf Hossain said the government had done very little for expatriates. The minister said he would ask civil aviation authorities to tell the airport officials to behave well with the expatriate Bangladeshis. "There are some problems in the immigration ordinance. "We will make all immigration-related laws up-to-date," Hossain told the discussion co-organised by International Organisation for Migration and The Daily Star. The law will be reformed to make sure cheated workers get their money back if any recruiting agency swindles them. Under the current law, cheated workers have little scope to get their money back. Organisations working on migration issues have long been demanding the revise of the ordinance. Anisul Islam Mahmud, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, said the recruiting agencies, barring some incidents of swindling, should get credit for the emergence of manpower as an exportfocused sector. The minister said Bangladesh was yet to have negative impacts of the current global economic meltdown in the labour-receiving countries. He said the flow of remittances was still stable. "Although it may be too early to feel and understand the full impact, we must prepare ourselves proactively to the possible effects of the economic crisis and find realistic and feasible solutions," Rabab Fatima, IOM's regional representative, said. State minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud also spoke.
