 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia and her two sons petitioned the government Thursday to quash 20 political cases against them. A group of lawyers led by Mahbub Uddin Khokan applied to the Dhaka district magistrate Zillar Rahman at around 1pm to withdraw these 20 and a further 10 cases against BNP leaders. Khaleda faces four corruption cases, elder son Tarique Rahman 11, younger son Arafat Rahman Coco five, BNP MP Moudud Ahmed six, Khaleda's younger brother Shamim Iskander and his wife two and Coco's brother-in-law Mostakim Reza faces two. Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman and her mother Syeda Iqbal Mand Banu, Coco's brothers-in-law Mostakim Reza and Mostakin Reza also filed applications. Khokan, an MP and lawyer for Khaleda, said the government would have to withdraw the cases against Khaleda and her family the way it withdrew the cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina on the grounds that the cases meant to politically harass her. Earlier, Hasina filed application for withdrawal of 10 cases against her. Office assistant Nazmul Alam at District magistrate prosecution department told bdnews24.com as many as 1,039 'harassment' cases have been filed so far besides the 30 cases. Of them 57 cases were sent to the law ministry and 400 to Dhaka metropolitan public prosecutor, he said.
