<TITLE> Two men ordered to stay away from Britney Spears </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A judge on Tuesday ordered Britney Spears' former self-styled manager Sam Lutfi to stay away from the pop star for three years, after the singer's father accused Lutfi of trying to undermine the conservatorship Spears lives under. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Aviva Bobb also issued the same order to attorney Jon Eardley, who has presented himself as Spears' lawyer. Lutfi and Eardley, whose attorneys argued that the order was unwarranted, were told to stay at least 100 yards (meters) away from Spears, her family and her homes. The three-year order extends an existing mandate against Lutfi and Eardley that Bobb issued earlier this year. A court placed Spears under a conservatorship last year, after she was hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation. Her father, Jamie Spears, says his control over her affairs enabled Spears to launch her ongoing "Circus" tour. An attorney for Jamie Spears had argued that Lutfi and Eardley continually bothered the 27-year-old singer, and that Eardley filed legal motions on her behalf even though he did not officially represent her.
