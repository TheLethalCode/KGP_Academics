<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)A third bench of the High Court on Sunday has ordered the VIP convicts to surrender before trial court in two weeks. The High Court third bench justice Md Iman Ali's verdict followed an Appellate Division verdict in a similar case that ordered Shahjahan Omar, a former state minister for law, to surrender before trial court within two weeks, additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim said. Asked if there will be any appeal against the verdict, one of the lawyers for VIP convicts, Moudud Ahmed, said they will not appeal as the Appellate Division has the same direction. On Feb. 23, a two-member High Court bench had delivered a split judgement on the appeals for bail and withdrawal of cases against convicted fugitive VIPs. Justice Syed AB Mahmudul Haq, the senior judge of a two-member bench, had ruled that the VIPs, on surrender to trial court within eight weeks, would not have to go to jail. Disagreeing, Justice Mainul Islam Chowdhury, the other judge, ordered the VIPs to surrender to trial court first and then appeal against the trial court verdict from jail. At one stage, justice Chowdhury had left courtroom after repeated interruptions during the delivery of the split judgement by Rafiqul Ul Huq, who was defending one VIP convict, former minister Anwar Hossain Manju. The bench later had sent those files on VIPs to the chief justice, who dispatched the issue to third bench judge Iman Ali. The convicted fugitive VIPs, who appealed for bail and cancellation of their cases, are Awami League leaders Mofazzal Hossain Chowdhury Maya, Mockbul Hossain, Haji Selim and Md Mohiuddin, BNP leaders Nadim Mostafa, Babul Chowdhury, Abul Bashar, Abu Hanif Patwary, Sabrina Sultana, Masudur Rahman and Mijanur Rahman. bd
