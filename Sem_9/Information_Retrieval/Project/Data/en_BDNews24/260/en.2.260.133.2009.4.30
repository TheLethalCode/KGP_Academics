 BAKU, April 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirteen people were shot dead at a university in oil-producing Azerbaijan on Thursday when at least one gunman open fire shortly after the bell rang for morning classes. A statement from the Azeri Health Ministry said 13 people had died in the shooting at the State Oil Academy in Baku, capital of the mainly Muslim Caspian Sea state. Police said the "terrorists" had been neutralized, but it was unclear how many gunmen were involved. Police closed access roads and special forces surrounded the building, a Reuters reporter said. Photographs showed pools of blood on the steps to the university and paramedics carrying out bodies in bags. Baku ambulance service chief Mursal Gamidov said there was one gunman, a citizen of neighboring Georgia, who appeared to be a student of the academy. ANS said there appeared to be two gunmen. A student who asked not to be named told Reuters he also believed there were two attackers. "As far as I know there were two terrorists," he said. "One of them committed suicide and another was arrested by police." He said the shooting started shortly after the bell rang for morning classes at 9 a.m. (0500 GMT). He said one gunman climbed the stairs firing on each of the six floors. Azerbaijan is a mainly Muslim former Soviet republic on the shores of the Caspian Sea, where it holds vast reserves of oil and gas. BP is heavily involved in Azeri oil export to Europe.
