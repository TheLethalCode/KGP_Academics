 PESHAWAR, Pakistan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani security forces killed 16 Taliban militants after coming under attack in a volatile tribal region on the Afghan border on Saturday, the military said. The clash in the Mohmand tribal region, bordering Afghanistan's eastern province of Kunar, came as security forces battled into the fifth consecutive day to take control of a strategic valley in the neighbouring Malakand division. Over 60 militants stormed a post of paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) in a predawn attack in the Spin Tangi area of Mohmand and killed two soldiers. "Our soldiers successfully repulsed the attack and killed 16 militants," a military spokesman Major Fazal Khan told Reuters. Militants have unleashed a campaign of suicide and bomb attacks across Pakistan for several years but their creeping advances to establish their writ in parts of the North West Frontier Province has sent jitters across Pakistan and caused alarm in the United States about the stability of its nuclear-armed ally. Pakistan is vital for the U.S. efforts to defeat al Qaeda and Taliban and stabilise Afghanistan. Pakistan's army this week sought to evict militants from Malakand's Buner valley, just 100 km northwest of the capital Islamabad. The government forces have taken control of Buner's main town, Daggar, though militants still control parts of the valley. Military officials said the security forces were steadily advancing towards Sawary, the main bazaar of the valley. Authorities agreed in February to enforce Islamic sharia law in Malakand if militants shunned violence in their stronghold of Swat valley. Swat is also part of Malakand. However, the military moved into action after militants refused to lay diwn arms and withdraw from Buner. The United States has welcomed the Pakistani offensive and wants Pakistan to do more to fight home-grown militants that pose a threat to Afghanistan.
