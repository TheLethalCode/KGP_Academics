 MUMBAI, April 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian players tied to the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) have been asked to ditch the rebel organisation if they want to be considered for international cricket. In the latest twist to the struggle between the two organisations, the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) working committee set May 31 as the deadline for the players and other officials associated with the ICL to rejoin them. "The BCCI has taken a decision to grant amnesty to players who have been associated with ICL," BCCI president Shashank Manohar told a media conference. "They have been given them time till 31st of May during which if they want they can severe all ties with ICL and come back to the BCCI." The ICL, bankrolled by one of India's largest media firms, launched the league following India's triumph in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in 2007. Apart from several fringe Indian players, it signed overseas players, particularly from Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. However the BCCI, concerned the league would undermine its position, refused to recognise it and persuaded other national boards to ban players who signed up. BCCI's latest decision is expected to open up similar possibilities for foreign players with their national boards. "This decision was taken as many cricketers and people associated with support staff met us and informed us that there was a mistake commited by them in joining ICL and wanted to come back to the board," Manohar said. "That is the reason that prompted (the) taking of this decision." Although the players who rejoin will immediately be considered for domestic cricket, they will need to serve a "cooling off" period of one year from the date of their informing the BCCI, Manohar announced. The International Cricket Council had this month rejected an application from the ICL seeking approval for their Twenty20 competition.
