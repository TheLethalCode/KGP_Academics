<TITLE> Militancy still a threat: Moriarty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty Sunday contradicted opposition leader Khaleda Zia and said terrorism remained very much a threat to Bangladesh. "In Bangladesh, the recent seizure of weapons in Bhola and continued arrests of JMB members throughout the country demonstrate terrorism remains a concern," said Moriarty told reporters at a "Meet the Press" in the capital. He said Washington got "disturbing indications" of terrorist threat in Bangladesh. The ambassador's comment came a day after Khaleda at a public meeting alleged that the Awami League government was talking about militancy to "invite" foreign forces in Bangladesh. She said her government crushed Islamic militants by executing all of them. "Attacks in India, Pakistan and other countries around the globe, however, demonstrate the world has a long way to go before we are rid of the scourge of terrorism, " the US envoy added. He, however, did not elaborate his statement, but said: "There continues to be threat in Bangladesh and my government does believe that there is a threat." He said reduction in violence in Iraq proved some progress in eliminating terrorism in the world. Talking to the press meet, organized by the Dhaka Reporters Unity, he said the US would continue to support Bangladesh to strengthen democracy, foster development and handle terrorism. bd
