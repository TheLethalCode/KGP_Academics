 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)The government's plan not to replace retiring redundant workers in public offices with new recruits is just a coordinated approach to prevent waste, says labour and employment minister Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain. "There are many people without work in government offices while most of the revenue is spent on the salaries of government officers and staff," he said at a Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) programme at Osmani auditorium to mark May Day. His comment came two days after the finance minister said the government would stop recruiting for positions with no real task, effectively shedding redundant jobs. "So, this is not retrenchment," explained the labour minister. The minister promised the labour laws, last updated in 2006, would be reviewed. "We will sit with both the entrepreneurs and the workers." Mosharraf said government planned to set up facility in 6 divisions to train women entrepreneurs through long-term and short-term courses. "We are considering building dormitories for women workers coming from the villages," he said. BKMEA president Md Fazlul Hoque claimed the industry was leading the way in ensuring workers' rights. "We trained workers of 300 factories to make them aware of their rights. This is the first such initiative from the owners' side," he said. "For the first time in Bangladesh, BKMEA has taken the initiative to provide life insurance," he said. The minister assured support for the development of knitwear, the largest exporter of Bangladesh. "We are the third largest knitwear exporting country in the world," said the BKMEA president. "In the next four years we will be able to reach the second position beating Turkey and in 10 years we will be able to reach the top position beating China." Hoque said all the BKMEA factories will be made labour law compliant by 2009. Top 10 labour-friendly factories in 2009, chosen by BKMEA, received awards. Garment workers' monthly magazine Sromobarta was also launched. The awarded factories areDird Composite Textiles, Four Fashions, Fakruddin Textile Mills, Fakir Apparels, Grameen Knitwear, KC Apparels, Metro Knittin and Dyeing Mills, Midland Knitwear, Square Fashions and SM Knitwear. Life insurance cheques of Tk 1 lakh each were handed over to 18 workers at the programme
