 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Bank is ready to offer policy support to the government to help keep the prices of essentials stable and achieve a "pro-poor GDP growth", the new governor said after taking charges Sunday. "The country's poor people have suffered much from spiralling prices of essentials during the last several years," Atiur Rahman told reporters after a meeting with top officials of the central bank. "So the central bank will adopt necessary policy in helping the government to keep prices stable all the time." Atiur said the central bank will also adopt a pro-poor GDP growth policy so that the poor benefited. "The sectors involving the farmers will be given top priority to boost agro-production and along with this measures will be taken to pace up industrialisation," Atiur, a former development researcher and a Dhaka University teacher, said. The government appointed Atiur on Apr. 29 as the successor to the ninth central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, who had been appointed by the caretaker government. The central bank will adopt such policies designed to create massive scopes for more jobs without retrenching any , he added. The new BB chief expressed his hope that a close relation between agriculture and industry will be established. Atiur said under the current circumstances there was no alternative to boosting farm production. "To reduce dependence on import, the farmers will get all support including an increase in the amount of credit for agriculture." The private entrepreneurs will also get policy support for the industries to thrive, he announced. On his first task, Atiur prioritised combating the fallout of the recession. "And for that the initiatives taken by my predecessor must be continued with." Atiur was optimistic about combating the "deep recession smoothly" with the central bank providing policy support to the government and private sectors. Citing the banking sector as the heart of the country's economy he said, "We're lucky that the country's banking sector has got no negative impact of the global recession." "Different governments are announcing bailout packages to save their banks. On the other hand, our banks have extended support to the affected sectors." Atiur was sanguine about seeing the banks reach international standards during his stint. "With the best use of information technology, we'll make our banks to be world-class so that they can set example for others." "The central bank top officials have promised me to work hard to [make this happen]." Asked about his approach towards the World Bank and IMF suggestions, the new governor said he believed in the development of the country. "We'll formulate policies considering the interest of the country. If the donor agencies are inclined to be involved with our task, we'll welcome them. We'll not want any controversy." On question about whether he would continue with the reform initiatives at the central bank launched by the caretaker government, Atiur said reform was a process that will not come to a halt." bdn
