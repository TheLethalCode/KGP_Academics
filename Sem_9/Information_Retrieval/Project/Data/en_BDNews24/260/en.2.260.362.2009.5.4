 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The government has started a pre-feasibility study in a bid to reopen the state-run Khulna Newsprint Mill , the industries minister said on Monday. "The government will move to reopen the mill provided the outcome of pre-feasibility study is positive," Dilip Barua told representatives of the Bangladesh Book Publishers and Sellers Association. The publication industry will benefit hugely if the mill reopens, the minister observed. The BNP-led coalition government shut down the mill, one of the main public-sector paper producers established in 1959, in Nov 30, 2002 over poor management. Bangladesh now imports huge quantity of papers every year. The mill initially was capable of producing 50,000 tons a year but the production capacity came down significantly due to lack of overhauling before the closure. The mill also used to produce coloured paper, wrapping paper, blue match paper, carbon paper and tissue paper. The Awami-led government has moved to reopen the state-run industries that were closed down. The draft of a new industry policy proposes that state-run industries will no more be privatised. On Apr 24, Chittagong Chemical Complex started operation after seven years. The laid-off workers will get back their jobs and there will be employment opportunities for another 250 people
