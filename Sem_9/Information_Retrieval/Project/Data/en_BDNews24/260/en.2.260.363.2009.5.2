 GAZA, May 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli warplanes bombed tunnels beneath the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt on Saturday after militants fired several mortars at the Jewish state from the coastal territory, the Israeli military and witnesses said. There were no reports of casualties from the air attacks. An Israeli military spokesman said the strikes targeted three tunnels used to smuggle weapons into the Gaza Strip near the town of Rafah, along the Egyptian border. Israel had resumed attacks on Friday on tunnels it says are used for smuggling into the Gaza Strip, after a nearly two-month hiatus in fighting. There were no casualties in Friday's air strikes, launched after a rocket struck Israel. Israel said three mortars were fired at Israel from the northern Gaza Strip on Saturday, causing no casualties. The Palestinian Resistance Committees, a militant group in Gaza, claimed it had fired the mortars on Saturday. Militant rocket fire had dropped significantly since Egypt began efforts to consolidate the January 18 truce that ended Israel's 22-day offensive against Gaza's Islamic militants. Israel launched its war on the territory controlled by the Islamist Hamas movement in late December, with the aim of halting cross-border rocket and mortar attacks on the Jewish state by armed militant groups. A Palestinian human rights organization says 1,417 people were killed, of whom 926 were civilians. The Israeli military says the death toll was 1,166 of whom 295 were civilians.
