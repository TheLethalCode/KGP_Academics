<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)At the initiative of some CNG-run auto-rickshaw owners, over a hundred three-wheelers started plying the Chittagong streets Wednesday noon. "More than a hundred auto-rickshaw drivers started operating around noontime in Dampara Jamiatul Falah area of the city," said Manjurul Haque Chowdhury, vice president of a faction of the owners' association linked with the ruling Awami League. The auto-rickshaw drivers, however, have continued with their strike through the third day Wednesday demanding repeal of an order by Chittagong Metropolitan Police to run their three-wheelers on meter and cancellation of cases they are facing for not complying with the directive. The auto-rickshaw service did not return to normal until 12:45pm. No unpleasant occurrence was reported, either. Police arrested three more auto-rickshaw drivers Tuesday night on charges of vandalising and rioting on Monday, the first day of the wildcat strike. Moinul Islam, deputy commissioner (traffic) of CMP, told bdnews24.com that police picked up the three strikers Tuesday night from different areas in the city. The total number of arrests made so far stands at 30. Police said they have found that a labour organisation controlled by opposition Jama't-e-Islami is backing the ongoing agitations. "Leaders of Islami Sramik Kallyan Federation backed by Jama't-e-Islami might have been instigating the agitations and anti-law activities. We're investigating the matter," said Islam. Chittagong Metropolitan CNG-run Auto-rickshaw Workers' Welfare Association president Kamaluddin told bdnews24.com that they would continue with their 'legitimate movement' until their demands are met. They have given the administration 96 hours to meet their demands, Kamaluddin said. bdnews24
