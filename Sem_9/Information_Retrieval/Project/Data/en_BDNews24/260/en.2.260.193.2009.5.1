<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has pledged to revise the minimum wage for the workers in line with the market price. "Measures will be taken to form a wage board to determine the minimum wage for the workers," she said. She told a May Day rally in the capital Friday that contentious labour issues would be resolved amid a tripartite committee with the representatives from the workers, the owners and the government to boost production. "The [ruling Awami League-led alliance] does not believe in shutting down mills and industries. This government will take measures to reopen the shut mills and industries with the help of workers." "We've already taken measures to reopen the Chittagong Chemical Complex," she said, speaking behind a bullet-proof glass shield. "We will not let it happen in Bangladesh that one will have plenty and another none. Rights of the workers and the labourers will be established here." She sought support to strengthen democracy in the wake of 'conspiracies'. "There are many conspiracies in the country. I seek your cooperation to thwart all those and strengthen the democracy," she told the rally organised by Jatiya Sramik League at Paltan ground. The government will extend cooperation to the elected representatives and Upazila chairmen for the development of the country, she said. This was the maiden public meeting of Haisna, also ruling Awami League president, since her assumption of office as prime minister on Jan 6. Hasina said a good number of incidents have taken place in the last four months since her government took office and those were handled prudently. At the beginning of her 20-minute speech, she said her government ended the Feb 25-26 mutiny at the BDR headquarters with minimum casualties. "But our opposition would have been happy if the incident escalated into a civil war and there were more bodies," Hasina said referring to the BNP-led opposition. "We've saved the country from a civil war." "We had to save families of the army personnel in the headquarters, but even after that we could not save 57 army officers Tight security measures were taken in and around the Paltan ground with deployment of huge contingent of army, RAB, and armed police members. She came down hard on the past BNP-Jamaat-led coalition government, saying their widespread corruption and misrule created numerous problems for the country. "The current power crisis is an outcome of their corruption; they had shut down many mills and industries. They will have to return the siphoned off money from the sector. "Awami League government will ease the power crisis, but its not possible overnight," Hasina said seeking time from the people. Citing the Aug. 21, 2004 grenade attack on her rally and 10 truck load of arms haul in Chittagong during the rule of the BNP-Jamaat coalition government, she said murders and conspiracies were their only task. They did not set up any new water purifier because they did not see no scope to loot public money there, she said. bdnews2
