 PARIS, May 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two deflected efforts by Mamadou Niang helped Olympique Marseille draw 2-2 with Toulouse to extend their Ligue 1 lead to three points on Saturday. The league's top scorer Andre-Pierre Gignac took his tally this season to 21 goals by twice putting visitors Toulouse ahead after the interval. ADVERTISEMENT Marseille have 68 points with four games left, three ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux who host struggling Sochaux on Sunday. Olympique Lyon's hopes of an eighth successive crown all but vanished when a double strike by Johan Audel led Valenciennes to a 2-0 home win over the champions. "It is over for the title," Lyon defender Cris told Foot Plus channel. "We were rubbish today. "Lyon are not a great team any more," added the Brazilian. Third-placed Lyon have 61 points while Toulouse are fifth on 58.

"We will see tomorrow if we have let two points slip from our fingers tonight," Belgian Gerets told Orange Sport channel. "But when you draw after being led twice by a good team you can be happy." At Valenciennes, Audel scored twice from close range midway through the first half. The unmarked Audel then wasted a hat-trick chance five minutes into the second period when his header from a few metres out flew over the bar. Valenciennes moved further away from the drop zone on 40 points, seven ahead of 18th-placed Nantes who host bottom team Le Havre on Sunday. Caen climbed to 16th with a 3-1 home victory over Le Mans while St Etienne slipped to second from bottom after a 0-0 draw with Na
