 Comilla, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)-Authorities Wednesday suspended all classes and exams at Comilla University until May 5 after a clash between two pro-Awami League factions left at least 12, including two teachers, injured. The administrative building will, however, remain open, Mujibur Rahman, registrar of the university, said. The clash ensued as Babu, a worker of Masum-led Bangladesh Chhatra League faction, tried to drag Russell, a worker of Chisti-led group, down from a bus after they had argued in the class, witnesses said. Assistant professors Amzad Hossain Sarkar and Bishwajit Chandra Dev rushed to the scene on information and sustained injuries as they tried to stop the clash. BCL workers Masum, Chisti, Shaon, Hasan, Masum and Rakib were also injured in the clash. Of them, Chisti, Masum, Rakib and Hasan were admitted to Comilla Combined Military Hospital and Prime Hospital. Vice-chancellor professor AHM Zehadul Karim told reporters assistant registrar Shafiqul Islam was to blame for volatile campus. Mujibur Rahman, the registrar, also filed a case against Islam, who was to return to his original workplace Rajshahi University on May 6, with Sadar Dakhkhin Police Station in the evening. bdn
