 LONDON COLNEY, England, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish-born goalkeeper Manuel Almunia is the best goalkeeper for England's World Cup campaign, his Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday Speaking at his weekly news briefing before Arsenal's Premier League match at Portsmouth, Wenger said that if England select their 2010 squad according to qualifying residency rules, then the Spaniard would not only qualify but would also be the best available to England manager Fabio Capello.

But Manuel Almunia is really Spanish and he also has to consider if he is going to have a chance to play in the Spanish national team or not."

"If it came to a choice between England winning the World Cup with a Spanish goalkeeper or not winning it, I would rather not win it," he wrote.
