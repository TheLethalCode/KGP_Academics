 KABUL, Wed Apr 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan and US forces killed 32 militants in two separate operations in southern Afghanistan on Wednesday, and an estimated 10 others in a third incident near Kabul, the US military said in a statement. Violence in Afghanistan is expected to spike sharply this summer as additional US troops are deployed in southern and eastern provinces bordering Pakistan, where the fight against the Taliban insurgency is fiercest. In one operation, Afghan police and US forces killed 23 militants, after they came under attack during a routine patrol in Tirin Kot district in the southern province of Uruzgan, the US military said. "After positively identifying the enemies' positions, the Afghan-led force responded to the enemy attack with small-arms and heavy weapons fire. The militants repositioned and continued their attack on the convoy," it said. In a second operation on Wednesday, Afghan and US forces killed nine armed militants in Lashkar Gah district in Helmand, which neighbors Uruzgan, and found bomb-making material after they searched the area surrounding the militants. In a separate incident, the US military said Afghan and US forces killed an estimated 10 militants in Logar province, some 80 km (50 miles) southwest of Kabul. Elsewhere, Afghan troops backed by NATO-led forces killed two militants and wounded one other in a district of Kabul province, some 70 km (46 miles) southwest of the capital city and four German soldiers were wounded when their vehicle was hit by a bomb in northern Kunduz prov
