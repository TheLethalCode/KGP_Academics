 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com) The government and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) signed an agreement Thursday in a first-ever field-level project that directly targets vulnerable people living in communities in coastal areas. The new project is styled "Community-based Adaptation to Climate Change through Coastal Afforestation in Bangladesh". The UND says in a press statement the project intends to enhance the resilience of both coastal communities, and protective ecosystems through community-led adaptation interventions. "Adaptation to climate change has become the new development challenge for Bangladesh. As such, this is the right project to take significant measures towards demonstrating adaptation strategies for vulnerable coastal communities," said UNDP country director Stefan Priesner. The project also aims to enhance the national, sub-national and local capacities of government authorities and sectoral planners to understand climate risk dynamics in coastal areas and implement appropriate risk reduction measures. The five coastal districts in which the project will be operated are Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Noakhali and Chittagong. The project aims to be a show-case for other least developed countries also working on climate change adaptation projects. The results of the project will be presented before the upcoming Climate Conference in Copenhagen in December.
