<TITLE> The man who dug up the world's first planned city </TITLE>

 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Professor Ahmad Hasan Dani, one of the world's leading archaeologists, revealed fascinating details about the ruins at Moenjodaro, the 4500-year-old city settlement north of Karachi, Pakistan, proclaiming it "the first planned city in the world". Prof. Dani, a former history professor at Dhaka University, demonstrated that its Indus Valley civilisation was one of humanity's great foundational cultures, alongside Egypt, Mesopotamia and China, according to Gerry Carman of Sydney Morning Herald with Guardian News & Media. He described a sophisticated people who understood irrigation, traded with Arabia and ruled from Afghanistan to Rajasthan. He showed how they practised yoga and created statuettes of bangled dancing girls and stern-faced priest-kings. Dani, who was fluent in 15 languages, wrote 30 books. His last publication, a History of Pakistan (2007), which culminates in the republic's creation in 1947, encapsulates 50 years of research. Whether addressing international conferences or guiding schoolchildren around museums and excavation sites of some of the world's oldest known civilisations, he conveyed an infectious enthusiasm for learning. Dani, died in Islamabad at 88 in early April, was born in Basna, a village in central India. His parents were Kashmiri by origin and he was the first in his family to be educated. He studied Sanskrit at Banaras Hindu University, graduating as its first Muslim student in 1944. In 1945 he excavated with the great British archaeologist Sir Mortimer Wheeler at Moenjodaro and Gandhara, and worked at the Department of Archaeology of British India at the Taj Mahal, Agra, before leaving for East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, in 1947. There, from 1950 to 1962, he was superintendent of archaeology, a history professor at Dhaka University and the curator at Dhaka Museum. He compiled definitive works on Bengali Muslim architecture while completing his PhD thesis on the prehistory of eastern India at London University in 1955 and working as a research fellow at the School of African and Oriental Studies (1958-59). Then Dani created the department of archaeology at Peshawar University, becoming its first professor. In 1971 he established the social sciences faculty at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, serving as dean until his retirement in 1980. In 1993, he established the Islamabad Museum. From the 1960s, Dani shone light on Graeco-Indian remains in northern Pakistan. At the ancient city of Taxila, founded in the seventh or sixth century BCE, descendants of Alexander the Great's troops had mixed with locals, adopted Buddhism and crafted statues and temples that bore unmistakable traces of an Aegean provenance. In 1997, Dani became founding director of the Taxila Institute of Asian Civilisations. He also supervised exploration of the Marium Shrine at Murree, a hill station near Islamabad. Some believe it houses the remains of Mary, mother of Jesus, whom Muslims know as Hazrat Maryam, the mother of Isa. The site has been maintained and honoured for centuries. At Rehman Dheri in the North West Frontier Province and in Baluchistan, Dani helped unearth traces of a proto-urban civilisation that might predate Mesopotamia by millennia. From 1978, he and German colleagues discovered rock art from the Karakoram mountains dating back 40,000 years. In 2007, he found a human footprint, possibly a million years old, imprinted in sandstone north of Islamabad. Dani often swam against the tide. He suggested that Sufi meditation derived from earlier Buddhist customs, proved a casket bearing an alleged ancient Persian princess was a fake, and disputed the theory that southern Indians descend from Indus Valley refugees driven out by Aryans. He led path-breaking UNESCO expeditions along the old Silk Road to China in 1990 and the Soviet Union in 1991. Imploring Pakistanis to celebrate their pre-Islamic ancestors, Dani criticised nationalists and religious zealots who destroyed traces of preceding cultures. He insisted that his countrymen radically reappraise their outlook on history. The greatest influence on Pakistan, he argued, was neither the Hindu south nor the Arab west but central Asia, in its Buddhist, Persian and later Sufi guises. As chairman of the Pakistan-Central Asia Friendship Association, he wanted to revive "a genuine relationship - cultural, historical, commercial as well as religious", and advocated reopening routes to the north that Soviet rule had shut down in 1920. Dani's many international awards included the Legion d'honneur in 1998. His wife of 60 years, Safiya Sultana, survives him, with three sons, a daughter, five grandchildren and two great-grandchild
