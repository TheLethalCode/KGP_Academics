 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com) Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government is ready to assist industry owners and workers to thrash out contentious issues through discussion and urged them to avert incidents that may taint the image of the country abroad. The government will announce a new industry policy soon, she said Friday at a May Day discussion organised by the labour and employment ministry at Osmani Memorial Hall. "We'll not go by any foreign prescription, we'll put in our best effortsboth public and privateto rehabilitate the abandoned or shut down industrial plants," she asserted. She referred to the government interventions to refurbish the inoperative industrial units and said her government has taken steps to put Chittagong Chemical Complex back to production, which was shut down during BNP's rule. She criticised the wholesale denationalisation of industries after the 1975 changover. Under the guise of industrialists, she said, defaulters then took government loans and spent freely on luxury palaces for personal use or just transferred the national assets abroad. "There're ways of denationalising plants. We had in the past handed over nine textile mills for management by the workers, seven of which are running to date." Addressing the garment factory owners and workers, she said, "You all must be patient and act sensibly. You must be able to resolve all differences through discussions and never adopt any other means which should spoil your reputation and prosperity." "The government will always remain beside you in all your positive deliberations." She said to industrialists, "The government will monitor regularly and ensure that you take due care of your workers." The prime minister said food rationing will be introduced in phases for all workers. "If the business owners organise food rations for their workers, the government will provide them with rice at low costs." "On behalf of the government, I urge you to carry out your responsibilities honestly, sincerely and cordially," the head of the government said addressing the workers and industrialists. "Because we have to survive and advance in this extremely competitive world when it is reeling under an unprecedented long spell of economic depression." The government has taken a number of measures to safeguard the workers' interests, she pointed out. A committee has already been formed to make the Bangladesh Labour Law 2006 more conducive to the workers and industries. Haisna said the government is making efforts to change the moribund Bangladesh Railway into a profitable communication system. "Recruitment is ongoing and soon Bangladesh Railway will be having its required number of workers." She also said new engines are being imported and the railway tracks repaired urgently before commuter rail links installation. She urged the expatriate welfare and overseas employment ministry to ensure that workers abroad enjoy their work rightfully and live like humans. Jatiya Sramik League president Abdul Matin Master demanded formation of a 'wages commission' to determine the minimum wages keeping in view the market prices of commodities. Hasina enjoyed a cultural programme and inaugurated the three-day fair there. bd
