 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Hockey Federation on Monday announced an 18-member squad for the Asia Cup Hockey Tournament that included three uncapped players Rafiqul Islam, Pushkor Khisa and Taposh Barman. The eighth edition of the meet will begin May 9 in Kuantan, Malaysia and Bangladesh will begin their campaign taking on Japan in one of three matches on the opening day. Bangladesh have been drawn with Malaysia, Korea and Japan in Pool A while Pool B includes India, Pakistan and China. Bangladesh will face Malaysia on May 11 before taking on Korea the next day. Tanvir Adel Khan, manager of the Malaysia-bound team, announced the squad but surprising no coach or selector was present at the press briefing to explain the selection process. BHF general secretary Khandokar Jamiluddin informed that German coaches Gerhard Peter Rach, assistant coach Oliver Kurtz and video analyst Achin Martin left Dhaka for Malaysia to collect video footage of the opponents and the Bangladesh national hockey team are scheduled to leave for Malaysia on Wednesday by a GMG flight. "Those who were dropped from the squad were shown reasons behind their exclusion through video footage and they accepted it," said Jamiluddin. Nearly 30 players were picked for the preliminary squad two months ago and later it was cut to 22 members. "Actually we are concentrating on the 2010 South Asian Games in Bangladesh and the Asia Cup is considered as a preparatory tournament. But we would love to see the boys perform what they learned from the new coaching staff," said Jamiluddin adding that the coach told him that they wanted to win against Japan in group-phase matches. Jamiluddin also said that a video analyst was appointed for the national side for the first time and it would help the players a lot. Striker Rasel Mahmud Jimmy will lead the side for the first time while defender Mamun-ur-Rahman Chayan will be his deputy. "The players are in a positive mood what we lacked earlier before taking part in any tournament but this time the players believe that they would be able to earn some good results against giants," said Jimmy, who arrived one and a half hours after the briefing had ended. Despite the absence of experienced Isa Mia, Musha Mia, Ehsan Rana, Habul, Jimmy thought that the absence of veteran players would not affect the team, which was packed with young and experienced players. Jimmy said the German coach emphasised on the need for fitness. He also claimed that they have now a clear game plan what had earlier lacked. Vice-captain Chayan said that the coach also wanted properly taken penalty corners, which made the difference in Asian hockey. "If we can play in accordance, something can be achieved," said Chayan. Squad: Rafiqul Islam, ASM Mahbub Ullah Chowdhury, Sheikh Mohammad Nannu, M Ashiquzzaman, Mamun-ur-Rahman Chayan, Musharraf Hossain Kuti, Rasel Mahmud Jimmy, Zahidul Islam Rajon, Pushkor Khisa, Zahid Bin Talib Shuvo, Krishno Kumar, Mosiur Rahman Biplob, AKM Shamsuddin Tuhin, AHM Kararuzzaman, Asaduzzaman Chandan, Rimon Kumar Ghosh, Iqbal Nader Prince and Taposh Barmon. bd
