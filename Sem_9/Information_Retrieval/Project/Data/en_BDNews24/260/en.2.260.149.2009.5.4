 COLOMBO, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have called up uncapped all rounder Isuru Udana to their 15-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in England next month. The squad, announced in Colombo on Monday, also included 35-year-old middle order batsman Indika de Saram, who last played for Sri Lanka in 2001. Left-armer Udana grabbed his place after an outstanding performance in a recent provincial Twenty20 tournament while de Saram is a consistent performer in the format, averaging 37.30 in his domestic career. The World Cup will be the first major tournament for Sri Lanka since the team were attacked in Lahore in March ahead of a test match against Pakistan. Kumar Sangakkara will captain the side for the first time following the resignation of Mahela Jayawardene, while Muttiah Muralitharan will act as vice captain. Fast bowler Lasith Malinga returns for his first major international tournament since the World Cup in 2007 following his recovery from a long-term knee injury, but there was no room in the squad for left-armer Chaminda Vaas or regular quick bowler Dilhara Fernando. The other notable absentee is batsman Chamara Kapugedera, who lost his place in the team and a national team contract after a low-scoring year. Promising all rounder Angelo Mathews, currently playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League, was also selected. The Sri Lanka team is due to leave for England on May 28. Kumar Sangakkara (captain), Muttiah Muralitharan, Sanath Jayasuriya, T.M. Dilshan, Mahela Jayawardene, Chamara Silva, Angelo Mathews, Ajantha Mendis, Nuwan Kulasekara , Thilan Thushara, Lasith Malinga, Isuru Udana, Farveez Maharoof, Jehan Mubarak, Indika de Sa
