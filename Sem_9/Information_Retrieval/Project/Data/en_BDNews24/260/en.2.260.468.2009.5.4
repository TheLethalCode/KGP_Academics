<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)A tribunal for trying war crimes will be formed by internationally acceptable individuals, the state minister for law said on Monday. "Besides, investigation agencies and lawyers, coordinated by skilled, experienced and honest individuals, will be appointed," Kamrul Islam told reporters after an emergency meeting at his law ministry. The meeting in the ministry was convened to discuss contentious issues that include legal procedures involving former prime minister Khaleda Zia's cantonment home. On whether International Crimes Tribunal Act-1973 will be amended to put absconding war criminals in the dock, he said, "If needed, it will be done after discussing [the issue] with all." He said the government will start the trial after taking care of all legal aspects. On the cancellation of the lease on the house allotted to Khaleda, he said the government was unwavering in its stand on the issue. "I don't think she will reap any benefit by going to court. The cantonment estate officer on behalf of the president illegally allotted the house." He decined comments on the Supreme Court ordering the BNP on Monday to file an appeal against the High Court's verdict declaring illegal the constitution's fifth amendment. "It will be settled only in the court." Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, additional attorney general Enayetur Rahim, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal, former attorney general Mahmudul Islam, advocate Ajmalul Hossain, QC, and advocate Abdul Baset Majumdar attended the meeting. bdne
