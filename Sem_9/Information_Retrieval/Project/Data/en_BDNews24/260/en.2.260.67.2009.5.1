 Dhaka, May 1 (bdnews24.com) Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to address a public meeting organised by Jatiya Sramik League in observance of the May Day at Paltan ground in the Friday afternoon. This is going to be maiden public meeting of Haisna, also ruling Awami League president, since her assumption of office as prime minister on Jan 6. She, however, had addressed a Bangladesh Chhatra League reunion assembly at Paltan ground soon after the AL formed the government early this year, which was not a public meeting in any case. Hasina had last spoke at a electoral rally at the venue on Dec 26, 2008. bdnews
