 Dhaka. May 3 (bdnews24.com)The government will act to fast-track cases pending with the High Court to realise over Tk 6,500 crore in VAT, tax and income tax arrears, the law minister said Sunday. The office of the attorney general has been tasked with the job for speedy disposal of the cases, Shafiq Ahmed said. The decision came at a meeting at the law ministry about speedy disposal of cases as many writ petitions and appeals on VAT, tax and income tax remained pending. The law minister chaired meeting while representatives from the finance ministry, NBR, customs and attorney general's office were present. The minister said 16,172 cases in the High Court was blocking Tk 6,551 crore. The cases were not disposed of as a panel of lawyers who conducted these cases did not attend hearings most of the time, he said. But now, he said, the office of the attorney general would carry out the responsibility for speedy disposal of the cases. Two representatives from the finance ministry and the NBR would remain engaged there. They would liaise with the office of the attorney general. Any law officer of the attorney general's office would be able to arrange hearings of the cases, the minister added. The minister said, "The chief justice has created six benches of the Supreme Court to settle cases in respect of tax, VAT and income tax. "If the lawyers are now active, the cases can be settled. The finance ministry and NBR officials said these cases have been pending since 2000. But this should not have been the case.". The meeting was told that Tk 1739 crore in tax got stuck up in 12,569 cases, Tk 3,112 crore in VAT in 2023 cases and Tk 1,780 crore on income tax in 1580 cases. bdne
