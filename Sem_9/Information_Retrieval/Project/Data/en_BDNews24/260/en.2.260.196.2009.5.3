 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)  Inclement weather hampered the progress of two matches of the Port City Twenty20 League on the second day at the MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong on Sunday. A 27-ball 43 knock from Waseem Nayeem helped Dhaka Sports Club to beat Dada Warriors by seven wickets while Chittagong Abahani and Brothers Union shared points after the game was declared a tie in line with D/L method. After the Dhaka Sports Club-Dada Warriors match was reduced to a 10-over-a-side affair as the outfield was too wet, Dada Warriors made 65-5 after being sent in to bat. Opener Sayeed Anwar Jr struck 45 off 35 balls studded with four fours and one six while one-down Imran Ahmed was the second batsman who reached double digits with his run-a-ball 11. In reply, Waseem Nayeem propelled Dhaka Sports Club to 66-3 with 16 balls to spare as Nayeem remained unbeaten 43 off 27 balls. It featured nine fours. Anisur Rahman chipped in with 11 not out. In the second match, Brothers Union posted a fighting total of 150-7 in 20 overs thanks to some good knocks from Sri Lankan Kapugedara, Mehrab Hossain Jr and Tushar Imran. Mehrab was a bit slow with his 33-run knock that consumed 38 balls but one-down Jehan Mubarak blazed a nine-ball 20 with the help of three fours and one six. Later, Tushar Imran and Kapugedara continued from where Jehan left off as the latter struck an unbeaten 40 off 22 balls smashing two fours and three fours while Tushar played a run-a-ball 33. In reply, opener Tamim Iqbal, tournament's highest-paid player, put the opponent bowlers to the sword smashing an unbeaten 41 off 36 that included four fours and one six. Abahani's progress was stopped by rain after 11 overs when they were 77-2. Tamim put on 64 runs for the second wicket with Hannan Sarkar, who made a 24-ball 23 with the help of three boundaries. bd
