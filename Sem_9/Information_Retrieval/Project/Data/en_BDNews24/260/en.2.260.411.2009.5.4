 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)A cyclone may brew in the Bay this month, says a Met office long-term forecast Monday. The northeast region may experience flash floods towards the month-end, it further said. Meteorologist Abdur Rahman told bdnews24.com that a depression or two may form in the Bay of Bengal in late this month, one of which may mature into a cyclonic storm. There may be one or two moderate to severe heat waves baking the north and middle zones, the forecast said. Usual rainfalls are expected to visit throughout the month across the country. The north-eastern zone, however, might see flash floods in the second fortnight.
