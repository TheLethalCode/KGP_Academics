 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Shiekh Hasina has provisionally approved a draft memorandum of understanding with Russia on installation of a nuclear power plant, officials with knowledge of the matter said on Monday. Nazmul Huda Khan, science and technology secretary, told bdnews24.com they expect an agreement to be signed later this month when a Russian minister is expected to visit Dhaka. Bangladesh and Russia finalised the draft to sign an agreement after the three-day negotiations in April in Dhaka on installation of a nuclear power plant. Ministry officials said the capacity of the power plant would be finalised in the final deal but the government decided to set up two plant each with 1000 megawatt capacity. Russia did specify the financial terms which would be settled after the final agreement, sources said. Sources said Russia was interested to provide loan, probably on easy terms, rather than grant. The Economic Relation Division will settle the terms and conditions. Russia has supplied as many as 65 plants to Iran, India, China, Armenia, Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Finland, Bulgaria and Germany, including 10 in last year. It is constructing 11 power plants. The first initiative to install nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in Rooppur in Pabna was taken in 1961. Currently, 439 power plants are producing 16 percent of total electricity around the world.
