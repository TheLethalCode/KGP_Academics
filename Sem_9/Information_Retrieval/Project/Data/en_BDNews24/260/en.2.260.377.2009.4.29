 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)The head of a parliamentary sub-committee investigating alleged corruption by former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar said they would be 'liberal' in probing 'minor irregularities'. Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, who first proposed parliament form a committee to probe Sircar's "corruption", said his committee members did not have enough time to pore over thousands of documents to dig out corrupt practices from October 28, 2001 to Jan 25, 2009. Khan heads a three-member sub-committee tasked with finding out corrupt practices in the parliament's purchase and development works during Sircar's tenure from October 28, 2001 to Jan 25, 2009. "We do not have enough time to scan every document over the last seven years. "We will be liberal and overlook minor irregularities (of Sircar) reported in newspapers," Khan told bdnews24.com after his sub-committee's meeting at parliament building on Wednesday. "The committee will investigate big cases of corruption," he said. For instance, he said Sircar did not return unspent Tk 2.5 crore to the public exchequer and made some unnecessary purchase in 2005-06 fiscal year. "We will disclose everything to you after the May 5 meeting," Khan said. He said his committee had proof that the Public Works Department spent Tk 25,000 for planting a single tree on parliament premise. "Sircar is involved in the process as the PWD cannot implement any project in parliament area without speaker's consent," said Khan. He had said in parliament that Sircar misappropriates crores of taka in the name of implementing development projects. Speaker Abdul Hamid in the face of demands by the MPs on March 19 formed an 11-member probe body, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, to find out corrupt practices of Sircar, now an MP elected from Bogra-6 constituency. The Mian committee formed three sub-committees to make the investigation comprehensive. S K Abu Baker heads a sub-committee for probing Sircar's alleged misuse of medical fund. Khan's sub-committee has been assigned to unearth corrupt practices in purchase and development projects approved by the former speaker. Mujibul Haq Chunnu, a Jatiya Party MP, is investigating the recruitment of employees in parliament secretariat during Sircar's time. Abu Baker's sub-committee also had a meeting on Wednesday. The sub-committees will submit their reports to the main committee which will discuss the same and finalise the findings. The main committee was supposed to prepare its report in a month, but the deadline was extended further.
