 Abu Dhabi, May 4 (bdnews24.com/BBC) - Pakistan sealed a seven-wicket victory over Australia in the fifth and final one-day international in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. Australia, who won the series 3-2, batted first after captain Michael Clarke won the toss, and Shane Watson anchored their innings with a fine ton. The all-rounder hit an unbeaten 116 as Australia made 250 in their 50 overs. Pakistan reached their target with three overs to spare, with wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal matching Watson with his own knock of 116 not out. The 27-year-old added a Pakistan record of 198 for the fourth wicket with Misbah-ul-Haq after they had slumped to 56-3. Salman Butt was run out without facing a ball, while off-spinner Nathan Hauritz trapped Ahmed Shahzad leg before for 19 and had Younus Khan caught for 27. But Akmal took full advantage on a pitch that offered little help to the bowlers. He drove and cut beautifully and hit Clarke for his 13th boundary to bring up his fifth one-day century. Misbah also rattled along at a run-a-ball and his 10th boundary took him to 76 and Pakistan to victory. Captain Younus said: "I just asked them to rotate the strike and it was nice that our batsmen showed commitment this time. "It's nice to end the series on a high note although we wanted to win it." Clarke felt that Australia's bowlers had not backed up the decent performance his batsmen had put up in scoring the highest total in the series. "We did not bowl well," he said. "Going by totals in the previous matches we thought we had put a good total but Pakistan batted very well." Watson anchored the Australian innings and contributed to stands of 58 for the first wicket with Brad Haddin (36) and 57 with Clarke (26) for the third. But wickets fell steadily until Watson and Calum Ferguson (41 not out) added 84 for the fifth wicket. Meanwhile, Clarke has returned to Australia and will not play in next Thursday's Twenty20 game against Pakistan in Dubai. Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said: "This will allow him a few additional days at home before the squads depart for the ICC World Twenty20 and Ashes series during Australia's tour of England." Haddin will captain the side in the Twenty20 g
