 Dhaka, Apr 30 (bdnews24.com)Like every other year, the government has slashed Tk 25,600 crore ADP to Tk 23,000 crore, a 10 percent cut, on poor implementation, the planning minister has said. A meeting of the National Economic Council chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina approved the revised ADP for FY 2008-09 Thursday. The revised ADP saw allocation from local resources cut 9 percent or by Tk 1000 crore to bring it to Tk 10,010 crore. Allocation from foreign resources was trimmed 11 percent or Tk 1600 crore to make it Tk 12,990 crore. Rural development and rural organisations will get 16 percent or Tk 3583 crore of the ADP, education and religion 14 percent or Tk 3212 crore, power sector 12 percent or Tk 2812 crore, health, nutrition, population and family welfare 11 percent or Tk 2642 crore and transport sector 11 percent or Tk 2578 crore. "We'll try to implement fully the revised ADP by the end of the fiscal year. We're hopeful about implementing up to 85 to 90 percent of it, If not full," AK Khandker told reporters. However, 128 projects have been included in the revised ADP, taking the total number to 1032. A meeting of National Economic Council chaired by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina approved the revised annual development programme on Thursday, the planning minister said after the meeting. "The number of the projects under the revised ADP has increased, as the new government has taken up a number of very important projects," Khandker explained. Asked if the prime minister had given any directions about the implementation of the revised ADP, Khandker said she asked all the ministries and departments to implement projects in time and maintain quality. She also asked all to make sure the projects are goal-oriented, the minister said. The development expenditure is cut and projects are added every year. In the 2007-08 fiscal year, Tk 26,500 crore ADP was cut to Tk 22,500 crore while the projects were raised from 931 to 1058. A report placed before the NEC meeting said the ADP has been cut considering the condition of domestic resources, foreign finance and availability of resources and in line with allocation in different sectors. According to the report, the amount of domestic resources in the revised ADP is Tk 12800 crore, which is 56 percent of the original allocation and project assistance amount is Tk 10200 crore or 44 percent. In the first three quarters of the current financial year, 41 percent of the main ADP has been implemented while it was 36 percent during the corresponding period of the last year, the report said. The revised ADP has prioritised five sectors including agriculture, rural development and rural institutions.
