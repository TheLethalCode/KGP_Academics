 LONDON, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Robin van Persie has recovered from a groin strain and returns to Arsenal's squad for the Champions League semi-final second leg against holders Manchester United on Tuesday, manager Arsene Wenger said. The Dutch international, Arsenal's leading scorer this season, has been out since April 18 and is likely to rejoin Togo target man Emmanuel Adebayor up front as the Londoners bid to overturn a 1-0 deficit at their Emirates stadium.
