 KARACHI, May 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan named uncapped left-arm pace bowler Mohammad Aamir and hard-hitting opener Shahzaib Hasan in their squad on Monday for next month's Twenty20 World Cup. The selectors omitted Indian Cricket League rebel players Abdul Razzaq, Imran Nazir and Rana Naved who had been named in the 30-man preliminary squad last month. The Pakistan Cricket Board last week announced that the ICL players had until end of May to resign from the rebel league after which they would be considered for national selection. Off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was included in the squad despite being reported for a suspected illegal action following the second one-day international against Australia last month. Ajmal has to undergo an examination of his bowling action within 21 days of being reported by the match officials and can only play if the ICC bowling action review committee clears his action. Squad: Younis Khan (captain), Salman Butt, Ahmed Shehzad, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Fawad Alam, Sohail Tanvir, Shoaib Akhtar, Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Shahzaib Hasan, Mohammad Aa
