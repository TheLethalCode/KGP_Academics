 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Rains in capital Dhaka and some parts of Bangladesh over past few days will not damage Boro rice crop, but rain-fed flash floods may spoil harvesting downstream in the northeast, agriculturists and weather experts say. The deputy director, monitoring, at the government's Agriculture Extension Department, Anil Chandra Sarker, told bdnews24.com Bodo paddy, a major cash crop, has been grown on 49 lakh hectares of land and more than 40 percent has been harvested. Light to moderate rains will not ruin harvesting, but incessant downpour will harm the irrigated crop. He said had it rained a bit earlier, it would have been better for the crop. Nor'westers and hailstorms now may ruin new crops. "But this rain will help upcoming Aus-Aman and jute cultivation," Sarker added. The Meteorology Department fears flash floods in the middle of the month but does not foresee Nor'westers and hailstorms. Meteorologist Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com that hailstorm was not likely to occur through May but nor'wester may strike at some places with possibility of flash flood in northeastern region in the country Former chief scientific official of Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI) Jalal Uddin told bdnews24.com that rain at this time will not do any good to crops except vegetables farms. Rain in the neighbouring country may lead to flash flood which may ultimately damage the crops downstream, he added If the country does not experience rain at a stretch for 15 days or nor'westers packing speed of more than 80 km per hour, the prevailing weather condition will not be harmful to the crops, Jalal also said. Rain drenched Dhaka again Saturday morning after an overnight drizzle, while Sylhet, Rangpur and some other parts had showers, causing the mercury to fall after intensely hot days worsened by power cuts crippled life. The Met office said rains and storms will continue throughout the month to bring temperatures down. Rains, accompanied by gusty winds, began at 11:16pm Friday and continued for some 15 minutes, prompting many to get drenched by rainwater in joy. Weatherman Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com late Saturday morning easterly wind and low in the west Bay are causing the rains across the country for the last few days. He added capital Dhaka had 6mm rain on Friday and 5mm the day before. Saturday's data was yet to be prepared, Mannan said.
