 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP will hold a rally at Paltan Maidan marking the International Labour Day on May 2, a day after the ruling Awami League stages a similar rally on the same ground. "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia will address the rally," Dhaka mayor and BNP leader Sadeque Hossain Khoka said after a meeting of the party's Dhaka city unit, which will organise the rally. The rally will prove that the BNP is a well-orgamnised party, Khoka said.
