<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its long-time ally Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami on Monday stepped up the accusations that the government was doing nothing but only talking about militancy. BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said the government was doing so to pave the way for "foreign intruders" in the name of handling militancy. "The government can very well curb whatever militant elements are still active, instead it only says militants are everywhere but does nothing," he told reporters after paying tribute to the grave of former president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman. He joined the commemoration of the second founding anniversary of an alliance of the student leaders in the 80s. More than 50 former student leaders laid flowers at Zia's grave to mark the occasion. The statement came as local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Sunday denounced opposition leader Khaleda Zia's statement that there was no militants in the country. Ashraful warned that Bangladesh may face the fate of Pakistan if it suppressed facts and did not act accordingly. US ambassador in Dhaka James F Moriarty also said on Sunday that Washington got "disturbing indications" of militant threat in Bangladesh, and recent arms haul in Bhola reinforced the fears. Like his party chief, Delwar also thinks this is an overstated issue that will bring no good to the country. "They are calling upon foreigners to assist in local investigations which might prove disastrous for the country's security and sovereignty," he said. Replying to a reporter's query, Delwar said the Awami League-led government had failed totally in past few months as it did not deliver on campaign pledges. "If the situation doesn't improve, people may not wait till the end of the government's tenure," he said, suggesting an anti-government uprising. Jamaat chief Matiur Rahman Nizami said on Monday a quarter was branding the country as a communal state to smear it. "The so-called militancy in the name of Islam has been fabricated to present Islam in a distorted manner," Nizami told reporters at a views-exchange meeting in the city. He advised the government to resolve problems that are crippling the nation rather than fabricating things. bdnews2
