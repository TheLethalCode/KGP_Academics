 Sylhet, May 2 (bdnews24.com) Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid urged expatriate Bangladeshis Saturday to help enhance the literacy rate in greater Sylhet region. The expatriates and different local organisations will have to work alongside the government to develop education, he said at a programme organised by Bhadeshwar Unnayan Samity-UK on Bhadeshwar College premises in Gopalganj. The education sector was plagued by massive irregularities and corruption during the BNP-led coalition government's rule, Nahid alleged. It would not have been in such deplorable situation if funds were properly spent, he observed. The minister said the incumbent government was taking a special initiative to develop Sylhet which was still lagging behind in education. bdne
