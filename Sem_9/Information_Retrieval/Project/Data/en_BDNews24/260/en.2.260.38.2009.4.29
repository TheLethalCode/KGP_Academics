 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said her government will fully implement the peace agreement on Chittagong Hill Tracts Treaty her previous administration had signed to end decades-old bush war. She also said her government would repeal laws and rules that discriminate against religious minorities and indigenous people. The prime minister told visiting Vice Admiral of France Navy and Commander of Joint Forces in Indian Ocean Region Gerard Valin Wednesday that the 1996-2001 Awami League government resolved the long-standing conflict politically and opened up a new horizon of peace and development in the hills region. Admiral Valin met meeting Hasina at her office to greet her for her party's landslide victory in the election and her assumption of office. The prime minister said her government is on the alert for protecting the interest of the ethnic and religious minorities as it believes in secularism, freedom and peace. Hasina added her administration will remove legal complications that impede efforts to ensure equal rights of the minority communities. Democracy needs to be continued to achieve development goals in Bangladseh, the prime minister emphasized. Valin lauded Hasina for her prudence and visionary leadership in peacefully and quickly ending the mutiny at the BDR headquarters in Feb. He also praised her initiative to form a joint taskforce to curb terrorism in South Asia. Secretary to the Prime Minister's Office Mollah Wahiduzzaman and her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad were among those present.
