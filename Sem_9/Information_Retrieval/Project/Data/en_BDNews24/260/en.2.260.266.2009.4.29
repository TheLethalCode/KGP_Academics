<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  After BCCI's declaration of an amnesty for the players in the unofficial Indian Cricket League on Wednesday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board also hinted that they were going to follow suit for their players who joined the ICL last year. The Board of Control for Cricket in India announced an "amnesty" for all Indian players associated with the ICL, who can return to official cricket provided they cut all ties with the unofficial league by May 31. BCB senior vice-president Mahbub Anam said that they would decide the matter in their next board meeting on May 9 as the International Cricket Council its last board meeting took the same decision of what BCCI has taken. According to the ICC decision, the cricketers playing in unapproved leagues will be ineligible to play international cricket, but they could return to the international level only after scrapping their contract with that unapproved league. Anam said that in that case a player, however, would have to play in domestic cricket for one year and then he would be considered for international matches. Meanwhile, the ICC had this month rejected an application from the ICL seeking approval for their Twenty20 competition. Some 14 Bangladeshi cricketers, including Habibul Bashar, Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees, Aftab Ahmed joined the rebel ICL in September, 2008 scrapping their contracts with the BCB, who then banned all of them from domestic as well as international cricket. Former Bangladesh captain Bashar thinks the BCB would also follow in footsteps of the BCCI. "After joining ICL, we never officially contacted the BCB, but I think the BCCI decision will prompt us to contact the board," Bashar told bdnews24.com. Shahriar Nafees sees the decision taken by the BCCI a positive move as the BCCI had a hand in banning the ICL. bd
