 Buner, Pakistan, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani troops took the main town in a key northwestern valley after being dropped by helicopters behind Taliban lines, a military spokesman said on the second day of an offensive on Wednesday. The spokesman said troops had secured Daggar town in Buner valley and linked up with police and officers from the Frontier Constabulary militia. The Taliban's entry into a region just 100 km (60 miles) northwest of Islamabad earlier this month had sent shivers through Pakistan and sparked alarm in the United States.
