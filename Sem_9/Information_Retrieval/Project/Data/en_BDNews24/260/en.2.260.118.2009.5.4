 Rangpur, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Police rescued a child being trafficked Sunday from Taraganj of Rangpur. Mithapukur police chief Wahedul Haque told bdnews24.com Monday morning a group of alleged traffickers were carrying eight abducted children in a black van. "At dead of night, as the vehicle stopped for refuelling at a pump near Mithapukur, one of the children, Abdur Rahman, 10, somehow got out and escaped." He alerted the locals who failed to stop the van. Being informed by the locals, police rescued Rahman, who could only say that his father was Abdul Ghani and that they hailed from Taraganj. Haque said police in the 16 northern districts down to the Jamuna bridge have been alerted to find the runaway van with seven abducted children. All vehicles on the regional highways were being searched, he added. bdnews2
