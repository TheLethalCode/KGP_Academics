<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)  The government will build flats in Upazila and districts to resolve housing crisis and stop encroaching on shrinking farmlands, the state minister for housing and public works said Wednesday. It will ensure planned housing in much less land, Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters at his ministry. The government has started the search for land at 10 expatriate-majority areas and such projects will be implemented at government land countrywide, he added. The junior minister said the government is actively considering implementing more than one satellite housing projects at northern and southern parts of capital Dhaka and in Keraniganj. The projects will take off soon to develop plots and flat on over 500 acres of land, he said. If there are any water bodies, those will be kept intact to give the projects a good look, Khan said. The projects will also get their own water and power so as not to put pressure on scarce power and running water resources, he added. The state minister said the deadline to apply for plots allocation in Uttara and Purbachal projects will end Thursday. He also said his ministry received no proposal to extend the time and it would not be stretched further, either. Khan further said the plot allocation will start soon and the government will do everything to make the process transparent. b
