 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com Senior Political Correspondent Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader Khaleda Zia has asked the government of her bitter rival Sheikh Hasina to step down if it fails to provide gas, power, running water, jobs which were the prime minister's campaign pledges. "Quit so that the people are not forced to bring your government down," she said to Hasina at a rally at Paltan ground in the capital Saturday. The government is plotting to bring in foreign troops under the cover of its anti-militancy fight, the BNP chairperson alleged at the gathering organised by Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, the party's labour wing, to mark the May Day. "In fact, there are no militants in the country." The former prime minister in her 45-minute speech said the Hasina administration had done nothing in the four months in office, instead it created problem in every step. She painted a bleak picture of 'anarchy on campuses' over the last four months. "Universities and medical colleges have been closed one after another, teachers assaulted, is this the digital Bangladesh you dreamt of? Is this the charter of change?" she asked Over 100 BNP leaders and workers have been killed in the last four month, she alleged. Khaleda dismissed the prime minister's claim that not a single watt of power was added to the national grid and Tk 20,000 crore allotted to the power sector were siphoned out of the country during BNP-led coalition government's rule. "How is it possible to launder 20 thousand crore taka out when there was 13 thousand crore taka allocated in the five years of the [BNP-led government]? The former prime minister said in fact, as much as 1280 MW power was fed into the national grid during second her five-year stint. Besides, she said, power plants were installed in Siddhirganj, Bakhrabad and Barapukuria. She retorted that no plants were set up in the Awami League's 1996-2001 tenure. "You set up power plants in private sector at that time. Now power has to be bought from at high prices." "For this, PDB still counts Tk 500 crore in losses." Khaleda demanded that the government lodged a formal protest with India over occupation of South Talpatti Island and erection of barrage at Tipaimukh. "India is plotting to create another Farakka erecting a dam at Tipaimukh. Talpatti is ours, we must not leave that." The BNP chief criticised the government for what she said was its procrastination on revealing probe reports in the Feb 25 carnage at BDR headquarters in Dhaka. "The investigation reports are not being disclosed to hide real killers. Our border is defenseless today." "The Pilkhana incident was perpetrated to weaken the country's armed forces," she alleged. The former prime minister said her government had set minimum wages of workers at Tk 950-1662, formed welfare foundation for transports workers. She also mentioned that her government had launched a tripartite system of owners, workers and government and offered loans to create skilled manpower. The BNP chief claimed her government had generated 'massive employments' were in the private sector. She refuted ruling Awami League's allegation that her administration had closed Adamjee Jute Mill down. "Instead, EPZ has been established there after paying all workers their dues so that more employments are created there." On the government notice asking her to vacate Dhaka cantonment house, she said the emergency government, which came to power because of the ruling coalition's movement, wanted to exile her. "Today, this government not only wants to evict me from my house, but also from politics." She told the people, "We were, are and will remain beside you." She vowed to continue movement over public issues in the street and in parliament. RAB and police personnel were posted at the ground and surrounding areas including Bangabandhu National Stadium, Maolana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani Hockey Stadium and on the roofs of Shilpa Bhaban and RAJUK Bhaban after BNP sought sufficient security Friday . Sramik Dal's president and BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan presided over the rally, addressed also by top BNP leaders. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina addressed a huge rally organised by ruling Awami League's labour front Jatiya Sramik League at the same venue Friday. However, there was no bullet-proof glass shield on the stage for Khaleda though the prime minister had the protection at Friday's meeting. Leaders and workers of BNP and its associate organisations started coming to the Paltan ground in small processions from 1pm. They were frisked by the security personnel before being allowed in. b
