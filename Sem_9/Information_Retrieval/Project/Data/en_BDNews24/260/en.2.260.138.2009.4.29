<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 29 (bdnews24.com)  Smarting from a shock 2-1 defeat to Myanmar, Bangladesh will look to finish Group A runners-up beating lowly Macau in the group final match of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers on Thursday at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Despite taking a first-half lead, Bangladesh went down to neighbouring Myanmar and squandered a good opportunity to confirm a place in the Challenge Cup finals before facing Macau. Still the hosts have a chance to qualify for the final round, if Bangladesh can finish Group A runners-up after beating Macau, who lost both their matches to Myanmar 4-0 and Cambodia 2-1, then they will enter the finals as the best runners-up side among four groups. Group B champions Turkmenistan, Group C champions Kyrgyzstan and Group D champions Sri Lanka have already joined automatic qualifiers India, Tajikistan and North Korea in the eight-team finals to be held in February or May next year. All equations, however, may change if Myanmar go down against Cambodia and Bangladesh win against Macau on Thursday, then three teams will have equal six points and the group champions and runners-up will be decided by goal difference as the head-to-head record will be the same. If Myanmar lose to Cambodia in Thursday's first match, Bangladesh, knowing the margin of that match, will then get an advantage to go ahead of Cambodia or Myanmar on goal difference. After having played two matches, Myanmar conceded just one goal, but struck six goals, while both Bangladesh and Cambodia scored two goals and conceded as many goals. Bangladesh's Brazilian coach Edson Silva Dido is confident ahead Thursday's match and wants to rely on all players, who looked shaky against Myanmar, especially in the second half. "I have full faith in all my players not only youngsters, who just need some time to raise their performance," said Dido adding that he didn't think the international debuts of the youngsters were too early. The Brazilian coach promised that he would be totally attacking against Macau and that newcomer Rashed would replace stopper Nasir, who was sent off against Myanmar. Dido was also critical of the Bangladesh Football Federation for allowing a tight schedule amid scoring heat in the country. He also alleged that the BFF was not helping him as they promised. bd
