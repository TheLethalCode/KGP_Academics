 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)A High Court bench Sunday felt embarrassed to hear a writ petition filed by BNP chief Khaleda Zia against the government notice that ordered her to vacate the Dhaka Cantonment house. The bench of justices Tariqul Hakim and M Azizul Haque, that had permitted the lawyers for opposition leader to submit an affidavit prior to filing the writ appeal, asked them to go to another bench. The lawyers then had filed the writ appeal at 1:30pm with the bench to rule out the April 20 notice served by the military lands and cantonments directorate. Khaleda's counsel Mahabub Uddin Khokon told bdnews24.com at noon, "We have got permission to file the writ petition." "I'm taking the affidavit to my client now for her signature. We hope to deposit the writ appeal today." He said court order for affidavit deposition is an integral part of the writ filing procedure. Military lands and cantonments directorate served Khaleda a notice on April 20 asking her to vacate her cantonment house within 15 days, after the cabinet on April 8 cancelled the lease on the house on grounds that the leasing process had been faulty and she violated lease terms. Khaleda responded to the government's notice with a legal notice of her own on April 23. After murder of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman on May 30, 1981 during a military uprising, his widow, Khaleda, was given another house in Gulshan in addition to the house in the cantonment the family had been living since the 1970s. The 2.72-acre mansion was originally the official home of the army chief, a position held by then Lt Gen Zia who then converted himself into a civilian head of state through martial law proclamations and controversial votes. Before the cabinet took the decision of cancelling Khaleda house lease, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said in parliament that she would ask the slain general's wife to vacate the house and that blocks of apartments would be built in the prime land for families of army officers killed in the Feb mutiny. bdne
