<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 3 (bdnews24.com)The government moved the Supreme Court Sunday to cancel the petition against the High Court judgement declaring illegal the constitution's fifth amendment that gave legal cover to a military government. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and additional attorney general M Enayetur Rahim Sunday filed the writ petition with the seven-strong full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin. The High Court bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and ATM Fazle Kabir gave the landmark ruling on Aug 29, 2005 upon a writ appeal challenging Martial Law Regulation-Seven, 1977 over the validity of then the military government. Lawyer Azmalul Hossain, QC, argued for the cancellation of the petition against High Court ruling while advocate TH Khan and barrister Moudud Ahmed opposed any move to that end during Sunday's hearing. The court will hold further hearing Monday. Moudud and Khan also urged the court to include the petition filed by BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain with the High Court shortly after the judgement as a third party in the latest appeal since, they said, the matter involves the constitution of Bangladesh.. After the hearing, the attorney general told reporters that the government believed that the High Court verdict was right. If it was upheld, none would dare to usurp power unusually, he explained. Moudud said the verdict should not be upheld if the constitutional, state and governmental activities were to be continued with. A constitutional void would be created if the verdict was upheld, he argued. Alam and Rahim earlier said there was a directive not to pursue the appeal lodged against the High Court verdict in this case. Since the government was not pursuing the two appeals, they should be quashed. Khan, who is the counsel for Delwar, said the High Court judgement entailed many constitutional matters and so it should be settled. The attorney general said there was no scope of saying so after the government said it would not pursue the appeal. Azmalul Hossain QC in defence of the government cited the Appellate Division and the Indian High Court's rulings to make it clear in which vases appeals can be withdrawn. In the judgement, the High Court said that takeover of the powers of the government from Aug 15, 1975 by Khandkar Mostaque Ahmed placing Bangladesh under Martial Law Administration (MLA) and his assumption of the office of the president by the proclamation of August 20, 1975 were a clear violation of the constitution, illegal, and consequently all his subsequent actions were illegitimate and void. "The taking over of the office of president of Bangladesh, in favour of Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem, on November 6, 1975 being beyond the ambit of the constitution was void and illegal," the court observed. It observed that takeover of the office of the president of Bangladesh by Justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem and his assumption of the powers of Chief Martial Law Administration (CMLA) and appointment of the Deputy CMLA and the proclamation on November 8, 1975, were all in violation of the constitution, illegal and without jurisdiction and subsequently all functions and actions were illegal. "The handing over of the office of MLA to Major General Ziaur Rahman by Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem by third proclamation on November 29, 1976 and consequently all their subsequent functions and actions were illegal and illegitimate," the court further said. The court also observed that nomination of Major General Ziaur Rahman by Justice Sayem to become the president and the handover of the office of the president to him was illegal and without jurisdiction. "The assumption of the president of Bangladesh by Major General Ziaur Rahman on April 21, 1977 and nomination being beyond ambit of the constitution was illegal, and consequently all his subsequent functions and actions of such president are illegal and without jurisdiction," it said. It observed the Referendum Order-1977 (Martial Law) published on May 1, 1977, unknown to the constitution being made only to ascertain the confidence of people of Bangladesh by president Ziaur Rahman was illegal and void. The High Court said the violation of the constitution is a grave legal wrong and remain so far all time to come. It cannot be legitimate, however, all the necessitating of the state only such a legal wrong can be condoned in certain circumstances, and invoking Doctrine Sales Populist Supremacy Lex. "Martial Law Regulation 7 of 1977 is also illegal and violation of the legal one and legitimate of the necessitating such legal action can be done invoking Sales and Supremacy," the court said. The government, in 1972, declared the land of then Moon Cinema Hall at Wizeghat in Dhaka as an abandoned property and gave it to the Muktijoddah Kallyan Trust. Maksud Alam, the owner of the land, had filed a writ petition seeking the ownership of the land back in the High Court. The High Court, in 1977, had ordered the government to give back the property to the petitioner. But the government did not do so, stating that as per the Martial Law Regulation of 1977 the judgment was annulled. In 1994, he filed another writ petition in the High Court but it was rejected. Maksud, later managing director of Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Limited, in 2000 filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging the validity of the Martial Law Regulation. b
