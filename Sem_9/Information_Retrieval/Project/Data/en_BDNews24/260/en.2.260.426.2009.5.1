 UNITED NATIONS, Fri May 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The members of the UN Security Council agree there is no point in punishing Sri Lanka by withholding a $1.9 billion International Monetary Fund loan or other steps, the council's president said on Thursday. "I have not heard anyone suggesting that," Mexican Ambassador Claude Heller, president of the 15-nation council, told reporters after an informal session on Sri Lanka. Asked if all members of the council agreed that penalties such as withholding the loan were unnecessary, Heller said, "Absolutely." US officials said on Wednesday Washington was trying to delay the loan to pressure the government to do more to help tens of thousands of civilians caught in the fighting between the government and Tamil Tiger rebels.

Sri Lankan Ambassador HMGS Palihakkara said his government had assured him it was not using heavy artillery against the tiny strip of land where the civilians are. But US Ambassador Susan Rice made clear Washington had doubts about the government's denials. "Despite the government of Sri Lanka's promise to suspend combat operations, most accounts indicate that shelling into the conflict zone continues," she said in remarks prepared for delivery at the closed-door meeting. "Very credible reports also indicate that the Tamil Tigers are using civilians as human shields, and have, in some cases, shot at civilians trying to leave the conflict area." Rice urged both sides to "prevent further loss of civilian l
