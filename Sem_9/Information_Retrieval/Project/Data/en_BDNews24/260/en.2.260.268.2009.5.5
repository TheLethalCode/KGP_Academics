 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)The Chittagong port channel was cleared Monday night of a sunken ship, a rescue officer said. The rescue team dragged away the ship a quarter kilometre north of the port channel. The six-and-a-half-hour rescue operation started at 4pm was carried out by ship-retrieving agencies PSM Marine Services, Al Madad Salvage & Company, and Genuine Enterprise. Shipping will get normal now, said Captain Hafizur Rahman, owner of PSM Marine Services, told bdnews24.com. Hafizur said the sunken ship was tied to six barges stiffly to drag it away from there. It will be fully retrieved later or scrapped considering the situation after the ship was taken to the shore, he further said. One man died while 10 others survived after the ship sank on Apr 21 amid high waves and strong winds. bdnews2
