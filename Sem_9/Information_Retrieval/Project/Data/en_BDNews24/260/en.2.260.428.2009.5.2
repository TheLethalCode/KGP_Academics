<TITLE> Edible oil import cost can be halved: minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Import cost of edible oil can be cut by half if soyabean and mustered oil can be produced nationally, food minister Abdur Razzak said Saturday. "Bangladesh spends Tk 5,000 crore each year on edible oil import. The spending can be slashed down to Tk 2,500 crore if soyabean and mustered oil can be produced nationally," he said at a seminar at Bangladesh Agriculture Research Committee (BARC). The Bangladesh Agro-economist Association organised the seminar styled, "What kind of budget is needed for food security". Razzak said agriculture should be commercialised for autarky, and agro-economists should sensitise farmers. "Bangladesh has had a good harvest this year but the farmers are not getting the price. They will lose interest in producing food grains in the future," he said. "Around six crore people, 40 percent of the population, are living under the poverty line. The government is prioritising agriculture to provide food to these people," said the minister. He said developing agro-based products like jute will move agriculture forward. "Jute and jute-based products of our country have a good demand in many countries of the world including Thailand. Still none of us are taking a close look at it or saying anything," he said. Production of new seeds is being hampered because of scant allocation for agro-based research, said Dr Uttam Deb, a researcher at the private think-tank Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), in his keynote paper. "No country produces for more than three years from same seeds. But we are producing for more than 10 years from the same seed. Therefore, at least one percent of the agriculture budget should be allocated for agro-based research," he said. He said skills of farmers and agriculture-related institutes should be increased if the farming sector was to develop. He suggested the government collect more food grains from domestic markets to encourage farmers and pass 'employment assurance law' in Bangladesh like other countries. The seminar was presided over by Dr MA Sattar Mandal, president of the association. Shawkat Momen Shahjahan, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture ministry; AHM Monirul Nagvi, secretary general of the association; Mizanur Rahman, managing director of Shilpa Bank; Dr Abul Kashem and Fazlul Haque also spoke. bdne
