<TITLE> Bangladesh risks fate of Pakistan if militancy not curbed: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka May 3 (bdnews24.com)--Local government minister Syed Asharful Islam said Sunday Bangladesh would face the fate of Pakistan if the country was not prepared to tackle the growing spate of terrorism. Talking to reporters in the capital he said Bangladesh needed to work seriously to tackle the issue since terrorism is a global phenomenon. He denounced the statement of opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia that there was no militant in the country. Asharful told reporters at Secretariat that suppressing the facts is not a solution and the nation should prepare to confront the reality. Ashraful's comment came a day after Khaleda at a public meeting in commemoration of May Day Saturday accused the four-month-old government of the Awami League of plotting to bring foreign troops in the country in the name of combating militancy. Khaleda claimed there was no militancy since 'her administration crushed the militancy by arresting and executing all the militants'. Ashraful's remarks echoed US ambassador James F Moriarty's comment that Bangladesh still faced threat of militancy. About terrorism, Moriarty said at a Meet the Press at Dhaka Reporters Unity that recent seizure of weapons in Bhola and continued arrest of suspected JMB militants demonstrate that "terrorism remains a concern" in the country. He said Washington got "disturbing indications" of terrorist threat in Bangladesh. Ashraful also said the government determined the responsibility of Upazila chairman and a gazette notification will be published a week
