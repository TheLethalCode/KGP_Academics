 Chittagong, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  A blazing 91 from Nazmus Sadat and five scalps from Elias Sunny helped Noakhali's Top Sports Club to a 33-run win over Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club on the opening day of the Port City League at the MA Aziz Stadium on Saturday. Top Sports restricted Mohammedan to 125 in 18.3 overs after posting a challenging 158-4 in the stipulated 20 overs. Mohammedan got off to a horrid start when Top Sports Sri Lankan pacer K Weeraratna removed both openers M Mithun (15) and Hafizur Rahman (8) inside five overs. Pakistani batsman Qaiser Abbas, however, kept the team in the match before being dismissed. Abbas, batting at number four, struck a 34-ball 53 studded with six fours and two sixes before being caught by Rakibul off Sanwar Hossain. The dismissal of Abbas triggered a collapse with left-arm spinner Sunny wrapping up the tail to bag 5-17. Earlier, Top Sports, who opted to bat, got off to a blistering start with opener Sadat hammering an unbeaten 91 off just 57 balls that included nine fours and four sixes. Sadat along with Sanwar Hossain racked up 42 runs off 17 balls for the opening stand before the latter was the first batsman out for a 16-ball 19. Then, Sanzamul Islam of Mohammedan picked up two more wickets to reduce Top Sports to 62-3 in 7.3 overs but Sadat along with Mahmudullah eased the pressure contributing 70 runs for the fourth wicket. Mahmudullah, a national player, hit a run-a-ball 30 with the help of two boundaries. bd
