 Dhaka, Apr 29 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary standing committee on telecommunications ministry Wednesday suggested the government remove duty on mobile-phone SIM cards, and legalise VoIP in three to four months to increase revenue. The committee, headed by Hasanul Haq Inu, said the Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL) should provide internet facilities even to remote areas with a monthly charge of Tk 300. "The committee has recommended that the BTCL and other bodies should present detailed guidelines on making the illegal VoIP businesses legal," Inu told reporters after the meeting. "We have asked them to complete the process in three to four months," he said. Inu said Bangladesh earned up to Tk 1600 crore a year from the international calls and the income could be much higher if the illegal VoIP businesses were legalised. "The international call charge should come down to three cents from present four cents per minute." The committee chairman said the import duty on SIM card should come down to 50 cents from the present US $1.25. "The committee members have recommended that the existing Tk 800 tax on each SIM card should go," said Inu. He said the government should withdraw tax as high as up to Tk 3000 on mobile phones for a greater number of users. The users pay higher charges for internet facilities. To implement the commitment of the prime minister to make Bangladesh a 'digital country', internet facilities must reach the remote areas, he added. "Therefore, the committee has recommended ensuring internet facilities to users with a monthly fee of Tk 300," he said. He said the 15 percent VAT on internet subscription between Tk 700 and Tk 1000. should also go. The parliamentary standing committees recommend measures to ensure transparency and accountability of the ministries, which are not mandatory for the ministries to implement. The committees have powers to investigate corruptions in the ministries and forward recommendations to the parliament.
