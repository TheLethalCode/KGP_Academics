<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina Monday said her government was committed to strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission but she was against anyone being harassed in the antigraft drive, her press secretary said. "The capacity and the efficiency of the Anti-Corruption Commission will be further enhanced as we want a corruption-free country," Hasina was quoted by Abul Kalam Azad as saying at a routine cabinet meeting. "The society should be purged of corruption, but no-one must be harassed unfairly in the process." Azad said the cabinet approved in principle amendments to the Anti-Corruption Commission Act-2004. It had returned the ACC law on Jan 26 after it was presented for incorporating necessary amendments. Asked why it was produced so late, Azad said its weaknesses had been apparent only after it was applied in real life situation. The changes were incorporated in consultation with appropriate with the ACC's panel of lawyers, which took time. The amendments that the cabinet approved provisionally include repeal of the Act's section 408. The ACC must be considered as a party in the legal battle if an accused goes to court at any stage of a case filed by the commission. If the commission seeks assistance of any government organ or any expert from government during investigation or fact-finding, then they will have to help it, the provisionally approved amendments say. bdnews
