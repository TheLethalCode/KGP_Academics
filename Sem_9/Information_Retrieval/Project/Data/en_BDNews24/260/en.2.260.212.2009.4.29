 AMSTERDAM/BEIRUT, Wed Apr 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Special Tribunal for Lebanon Wednesday ordered the release of four pro-Syrian security generals held in Lebanon since 2005 over the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri. The tribunal, which said the order should take immediate effect, handed down its ruling after the prosecutor, Daniel Bellemare, had requested the generals' release. In Beirut, heavy celebratory gunfire erupted when the international judge announced the decision. Supporters of the generals also fired rifles into the air in their home towns. Well-wishers flocked to their homes in Beirut. Lebanese authorities have held the four men, who commanded Lebanon's pro-Syrian security establishment at the time of Hariri's death in 2005, without charge for nearly four years.

In handing down the ruling, the presiding judge noted that the prosecutor had therefore indicated he was unable to indict the four generals within the legal timeframe. "Some witnesses modified their statements and ... a key witness expressly retracted his original statement which incriminated the persons detained," the presiding judge said, referring to the prosecution's reasoning. It was not immediately clear whether the prosecutor intended to try and indict the generals at a later stage. Hariri and 22 other people were killed by a suicide truck bomb in Beirut on February 14, 2005. Some Lebanese politicians, including his the slain politician's son Saad al-Hariri, have blamed the attack on neighboring Syria. Syria denied this, but the killing caused a worldwide outcry that forced an end to its 29-year military presence in Lebanon. The Hague-based tribunal, which was set up by the United Nati
