 Dhaka, May 2 (bdnews24.com)  Fifties from D Chandimal, B Rajapaksa and K Perera powered the Sri Lanka U-19 cricket team to a 38-run win over their Bangladesh counterparts in the first of five one-dayers at the Birshrestha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna on Saturday. Bangladesh were restricted to 236 all out in 46.1 overs after Sri Lanka rattled up a competitive total of 274 all out in 49.3 overs. Despite the loss of opener M Rubel in the first over, Amit Majumdar and one-down Saikat Ali kept the opponents bowlers at bay picking up 86 runs for the second wicket but dismissal of Amit prompted a top-order collapse and Bangladesh were reduced to 143-5 inside 30 overs. Amit was seven runs shot of his fifty but Saikat competed the half-century off a run-a-ball 76 that was studded with 10 fours. Amit's 47 runs off 56 featured four fours and a six. Lower-order Irfan Shukkur (32), Taibur Rahman (36) and Noor Hossain (28) came down hard on the opponent bowlers but their efforts were not enough to take the hosts home as C Perera, L Jayratne, S Weersingne, I Udayanga took two wickets each. Earlier, D Chandimal, K Perera and B Rajapaksa struck 95, 61 and 52 respectively to help Sri Lanka U-19s to post a competitive total on the board. bd
