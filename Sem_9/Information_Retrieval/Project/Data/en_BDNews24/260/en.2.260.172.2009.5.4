 CHENNAI, India, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm paceman Rudra Pratap Singh has returned to India's Twenty20 squad for next month's World Cup following his vibrant performances in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) in South Africa. India cut their 30-man preliminary squad to 15 players on Monday for the tournament in England, pencilling in nine players from the side that won the inaugural edition two years ago. Mahendra Singh Dhoni led a young Indian team to surprise success in South Africa in 2007 to ensure the game's newest format gained instant popularity in cricket's commercial hub. RP Singh, who last played in India's Twenty20 side in October 2007, will be part of a five-man seam attack led by the wily Zaheer Khan and pacy Ishant Sharma, aimed at exploiting the seam-friendly conditions in England. In-form batsman Suresh Raina was an automatic choice while promising left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha forced his way into the mix with a strong showing in the IPL. Explosive batsman Virender Sehwag and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh are the most senior players in the team. Indian team: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Yuvraj Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan, Ishant Sharma, Praveen Kumar, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Pragyan Ojha and Irfan Pat
