 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, May 4 (bdnews24.com)Bangladeshi expatriates have remitted money worth $ 789.09 crore in 10 months of the ongoing fiscal year, almost the total they had sent the previous year, belying the prediction of the World Bank, IMF and ADB in the wake of a deepening global recession. The remittance inflow has pushed the foreign currency reserve to a new high at $ 652 crore or $6.52 billion, according to the Bangladesh Bank figure. Remittance earning in the FY 2007-08 was $ 791.47 crore. Immigrants sent $ 85.70 crore up to the end of April, while it was $ 78.17 crore in the same month of FY 2007-08. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman, who took his office on May 3, was sanguine about the transfer of funds continuing in the final two months of the ongoing fiscal. "We've got nothing to worry about remittance. The central bank will continue efforts to deal with the fallout of the global recession on remittance," he told bdnews24.com on Monday. The central bank chief said they will take up multi-faceted measures so that more money was sent into the country through banks. "This is a very positive trend for our economy that due to the increased remittance inflow the foreign bank reserve has crossed the 6.5 billion dollars." The World Bank, IMF, the Asian Development Bank and a number of local experts had warned that the remittance inflow, one of the main economic indices, will see a slump in the current fiscal year due to the global financial meltdown. The foreign reserves touched $ 6.23 billion, bettering the previous record of $ 6.21 billion in July last year. A country's reserves are seen as healthy if they can meet three months' import costs at any time. Former central bank chief Salehuddin Ahmed had mainly credited greater remittances by expatriates and a cut in imports of luxury products for the record reserve. "But a slight decline in capital machinery imports is also a reason," he had added. Bangladesh's foreign reserves crossed the $ 6 billion mark for the first time on Apr. 5 last year. Reserves will stay above $6 billion until Bangladesh pays off a major portion of its import bills for Mar-Apr through the Asian Clearing Union in the first week of May. The eight member countries of Tehran-headquartered ACU pay their intra-regional import bills every two months through their central banks. bdn
