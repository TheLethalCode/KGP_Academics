 JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Johan Botha, reported last month for a suspect bowling action, was included as vice-captain when South Africa named their squad on Monday for the Twenty20 World Cup in England in June. The off-spinner was reported by the umpires after the fourth one-day international victory over Australia in Port Elizabeth. Botha's action is now undergoing an independent analysis by the International Cricket Council's panel of human movement specialists. "We expect the results in two weeks. Until then we assume he is available (for selection)," Cricket South Africa media officer Michael Owen-Smith told Reuters. The 27-year-old Botha, who has played 45 one-dayers, two tests and nine Twenty20s for his country, was also reported for a suspect action in January 2006 and suspended from bowling. KALLIS BACK All-rounder Jacques Kallis, who missed the home Twenty20 matches against Australia in March, is also back in the squad. "I am delighted with the squad the selectors have given me," coach Mickey Arthur said in a news release. "It has plenty of options, great depth to the batting and plenty of bowling options. It is also an outstanding fielding unit." Selection convenor Mike Procter said: "Our cricket is entering an exciting period. "We are top of the one-day international rankings but have never won a major trophy and this presents the opportunity to do so in a limited-overs format." Squad: Graeme Smith (captain), Johan Botha, Yusuf Abdulla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Kallis, Albie Morkel, Morne Morkel, Justin Ontong, Wayne Parnell, Robbie Peterson, Dale Steyn, Roelof van der Me
