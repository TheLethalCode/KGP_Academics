<TITLE> Collingwood named as England Twenty20 captain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paul Collingwood, who stepped down as England one-day captain last year, was named on Friday to lead the Twenty20 side in next month's World Cup. Collingwood resigned the captaincy at the same time as test skipper Michael Vaughan because he felt it was affecting his test form. He was also at the centre of an acrimonious confrontation with the New Zealand team when he appealed for a run-out at The Oval in a one-day international after batsman Grant Elliott had collided in mid-pitch with England bowler Ryan Sidebottom. Collingwood was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for the Indian Premier League this year but did not play a single match before returning from South Africa for the first test against West Indies starting at Lord's next Wednesday. The selectors have opted for James Foster as wicketkeeper in the 15-man squad ahead of test keeper Matt Prior while all-rounder Andrew Flintoff is selected, subject to a full recovery from the knee surgery which will keep him out of the two-test series against West Indies. National selector Geoff Miller told Sky Sports that Foster had been recalled to the national side for the first time in seven years because of his skill at standing up to the stumps. "He's been excellent over the last couple of years in Twenty20 putting pressure while standing up to the stumps," Miller said. "That was the reason why, plus the fact his batting down the order has improved dramatically." Graham Napier, who smashed 152 not out from 58 deliveries for Essex against Sussex last year, has also been named in the squad along with Middlesex and former Ireland batsman Eoin Morgan. Miller said the selectors had thought hard about the captaincy before deciding on Collingwood. "Captaincy is always a difficult decision but we felt that was the right one," he said. "It's a short three-week period, it won't affect his game. He's quite relaxed about the situation." The tournament starts on June 5 and ends with the final at Lord's on July
