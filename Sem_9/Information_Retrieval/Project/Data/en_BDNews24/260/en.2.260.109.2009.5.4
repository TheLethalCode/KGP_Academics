 JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Punjab Kings XI and the Bangalore Royal Challengers joined two other teams at the top of the Indian Premier League standings after winning their respective games on Sunday. Jacques Kallis and Robin Uthappa scored unbeaten half-centuries as Bangalore cruised to a nine-wicket victory with 11 balls to spare over the Mumbai Indians at the Wanderers in Johannesburg. Kallis cast aside his inhibitions to score 69 not out off 59 balls, while Uthappa was relentless in hammering 66 not out off just 42 deliveries as their unbeaten partnership of 126 carried Bangalore to 150 for one. South African seamer Dillon du Preez (three for 32) had earlier made an impressive IPL debut with a his top-class new-ball spell in which he claimed three wickets without conceding a run in his first eight balls. His haul included the wickets of Sachin Tendulkar for 11 and JP Duminy for a single as Bangalore made a dream start by reducing Mumbai to 23 for three after they had elected to bat first. Mumbai staged a fine comeback, however, as half-centuries by Sanath Jayasuriya (52) and Dwayne Bravo (50 not out) lifted them to 149 for four. The Punjab Kings XI clinched a six-wicket victory at the close against the Kolkata Knight Riders, whose hopes of making the semi-finals are rapidly receding after their sixth defeat in eight matches, at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth. The Knight Riders dropped a number of catches to make the Kings XI task easier after they were set 154 to win in 20 overs. Former Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardena scored 52 not out off 41 to balls to steer Punjab home. The second-wicket pairing of Sunny Sohal (25) and Australian Simon Katich (34) added 43 runs in four overs to allow Punjab to recover from the early loss of Kumar Sangakkarra. Ishant Sharma claimed two wickets to bring Kolkata back into the game. Australian Brad Hodge had earlier top-scored with the bat for the Knight Riders with 70 not out, which came off just 43 balls. The powerful right-hander had support from Saurav Ganguly (22) and South African Morne van Wyk (18 not out) as Kolkata nearly tripled their score in the last 10 overs. The Deccan Chargers and the Delhi Daredevils are the other teams on eight points with matches in hand over Punjab and Bangalore. The Chargers must beat the Chennai Super Kings in East London on Monday to prevent last year's losing finalists from going to the top of the standings. Punjab will be back in action against the defending champion Rajasthan Royals in Durban on Tues
