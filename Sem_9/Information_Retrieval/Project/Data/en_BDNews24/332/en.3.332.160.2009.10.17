 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)--Awami League general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam has slammed BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia for not attending the launch of the anti-poverty campaign on Saturday . "She is trying to divide the nation by doing this," he said at a party meeting at the Dhanmondi office. "But we do not want division. We want to unite the nation," he added. Khaleda made a U-turn on Friday, barely 24 hours before the event that would have seen her and prime minister Sheikh Hasina together launching the anti-poverty campaign in Bangladesh on the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. "Her speeches are assortments of true and false," said Ashraful, also local government minister. "In fact, she does not want the rule of law and the implementation of the verdict on the Bangabandhu murder case. "Her husband [Gen Ziaur Rahman] issued indemnity ordinance so that the trial of Bangabandhu murder case does not take place," he said. "This government will not allow corruption and terrorism in any way. Strict measures will be taken against those involved in terrorist acts," he added. Divisions were distributed among the organisational secretaries of AL at the meeting that went on from 11am to 1:30pm. Dhaka division was allotted to Jahangir Kabir Nanak, Rangpur division to Khalid Mahmud Chowdhury, Khulna division to DM Mozammel Haque, Chittagong division to Ahmed Hossain, Barisal division to AFM Bahauddin Nasim, Rajshahi to Abu Sayeed Al Mahmud Swapan and Sylhet to Mezbah Uddin Siraj. The member collection campaign of AL will start in the second week of November and the extended meeting will be held in the third week of the month. Important final decisions will be taken in the extended meeting, said Ashraful. bdnew
