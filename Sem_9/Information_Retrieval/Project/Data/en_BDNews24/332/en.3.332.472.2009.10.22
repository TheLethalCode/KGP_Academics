<TITLE> Better ADP execution can draw investment: WB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)The World Bank has suggested Bangladesh bolster the implementation rate of its annual development programme to attract investments. The WB economist Sanjay Kathuria has said the governments should better strengthen their ADP implementation, which should constitute the best incentive for drawing investments. The poor will also be benefited most in this way, he said Thursday at a views-exchange meeting with reporters at the Bank's Dhaka office at Agargaon. "If Bangladesh government can achieve desired success in its ADPs implementation, then it should not require any more to raise the incentive package it declared as a measure to cope with the global economic recession," Kathuria said. WB senior economist Jahid Hossain said, "We are not nullifying incentives. The World Bank would like the governments to stress proper implementation of the ADPs, attaching the highest priority to it." The inertia in the investment sector suffered during the interim government's regime still straddles Bangladesh and it is yet to win back the investors' trust, he observed. Under the circumstances, he clarified, the only way to augment investment is to enhance government expenditures (ADP). Bangladesh's economy seems quite stable despite global economic crunch, he said. It now has to quicken its ADP implementation along with infrastructure development. "Gas and power crunches have to be sorted out too," said Hossain. Kathuria said global recession will not allow at least 2.4 million of the world's poor to banish poverty. Quoting statistics from a WB study, he said, "Poverty alleviation will be hampered in Bangladesh due to the global crunch. Bangladesh may achieve only nine percent poverty reduction during 2005-2010 against an envisaged 11 percent (as per regular projection)." About 40 percent of the country's population live below the poverty line, of whom 20 percent happen to be hardcore poor. As per the latest planning ministry data, only four percent of the Tk 30, 500 crore ADP has been implemented in the first two months to August of the FY 2009-10. The government declared a Tk 3,500 crore incentive package in April in a bid to combat global recession. The current fiscal budget has an allocation of Tk 5,000 crore for the purpose. WB acting resident representative Robert L Floyd also spoke on the occasion. bd
