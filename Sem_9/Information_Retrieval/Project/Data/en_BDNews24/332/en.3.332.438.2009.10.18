 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Office goers in the capital attempted going to their workplaces on Sunday in line with the changed timetable announced by the government to control chaos on the streets, but to little avail.

Munirul Islam, an employee of a private office told bdnews24.com it took him one hour to reach Asad Gate from Shyamoli by bus, on his way to his workplace on Dhanmondi road 27. "After having enough of the interminable sojourn, I got down from the bus at Gana Bhaban point, footed it up to Asad Gate and then took a rickshaw from there to reach my destination," said Islam. Mahbuba Akhter, who works in a private organisation said coming from Wireless Gate to Asad Gate took her more than one hour.
