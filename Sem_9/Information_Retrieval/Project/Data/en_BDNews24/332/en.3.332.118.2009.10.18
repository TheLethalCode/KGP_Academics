 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court granted ruling Awami League MP Abdul Jalil three months' anticipatory bail on Sunday in a tax dodge case. A two-member HC bench of justices Syed Md Dastagir Hossain and Md Roisuddin gave the order after on a bail petition submitted by Jalil's lawyers in the afternoon. The bench also issued a rule nisi to the government and the National Board of Revenue asking them to explain why he should not be granted permanent bail. Barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud defended the AL veteran. Rokan told reporters after the ruling: "The accused had spoken against a special organisation both in and outside the parliament. That's why the tax dodge case has been filed to harass him." "Jalil paid income taxes in line with the income tax law. The first evaluation had determined the due taxes in a slightly lower scale. "After the second evaluation, he paid his income tax dues in full. So he did not commit any crime," the lawyer said. Deputy attorney general KM Zahid Sarwar Kajal represented the state. The Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court on Thursday ordered Jalil's arrest after the National Board of Revenue filed the case against the AL veteran on charges of evading Tk 4.07 lakh in income tax after hiding income worth Tk 54.60 lakh. Jalil has been embroiled in controversies after he passed comments about his own party, touching off a political storm in recent times. There was information of abnormal transaction in the bank accounts of Jalil and his wife at different times, which is not relevant with his income tax return statement. There were savings accounts and FDR in the name of their children, which were not mentioned in the income tax return statement, the case alleged. Jalil inferred in media interviews in London that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. He also said that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to retain his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. he has also spoken out against special intelligence agencies, accusing them of torturing him when he was jailed by the past caretaker government on graft charges. bdne
