 NEW DELHI, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A speeding passenger train rammed into another waiting near a northern Indian station early Wednesday, killing at least 21 people and injuring several others, officials said. The impact of the collision left a couple of compartments of the trains mangled, and rescue workers used cutting machines to reach passengers trapped inside. The accident occurred when a speeding Goa Sampark Kranti Express rammed into the Mewar Express waiting near the Mathura city station. Both trains were headed to New Delhi. A local government official said 21 bodies had been recovered. "Over 20 people who were critically injured have been admitted in different hospitals," D.C. Shukla told Reuters. It was not immediately clear how the two trains came to be on the same tracks.
