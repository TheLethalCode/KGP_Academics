<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury secured bail at the High Court on Wednesday after a Thakurgaon court had issued an arrest warrant against him earlier in the week in a defamation case. The bench of justices FFM Abdur Rahman and Md Imdadul Haque Azad granted six months' anticipatory bail, Chowdhury's lawyer Manjurul Haque told bdnews24.com. Chowdhury in a discussion at the National Press Club on Aug 13 this year had said that the Aug 15, 1975 assassination of independence architect Sheikh Mujib and his family members, was "inevitable". Thakurgaon's chief judicial magistrate Ashiqur Rahman issued an arrest warrant against the BNP leader on Oct 18 after a case was filed against him in the district accusing him of defaming Mujib. The Thakurgaon case is one of a number of similar cases filed by individuals in different parts of the country after Chowdhury. The BNP leader previously secured anticipatory bail from the High Court on Sept 17 in a separate defamation suit regarding the same comment. A Tangail court on Sept 10 had issued a previous arrest warrant against the senior Chowdhury on the same charges. He also faces similar charges in Magura, Khulna and Narail courts. bdne
