 KARACHI, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The cricket boards of Pakistan and England have resolved the financial dispute that arose after the forfeited Oval Test on Pakistan's tour to England in 2006. Umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove ruled Pakistan had forfeited the fourth Test at the Oval, as the visitors had refused to come out after tea on the fourth day in protest at being docked five runs for alleged ball tampering. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) then claimed for the loss of revenue due to the early finish to the match. According to official documents seen by Reuters, the boards have signed an agreement under which Pakistan will forfeit revenue from a Twenty20 international on their tour of England next year as a full and final settlement of the dispute. Pakistan is scheduled to play four Tests, five one-day internationals and two Twenty20 matches against England between next July and September for which the ECB have agreed to pay them a participation fee of $3.6 million (2.2 million pounds). "The participation fee does not include the fee for one Twenty20 match on this tour which the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has agreed to waive as full and final settlement of the Oval test match dispute," a clause in the agreement stated. Under the agreement, the PCB also received 68,000 pounds to settle all outstanding amounts from the 2006 tour. Pakistan will also be playing a 'home' series against Australia in England next year for which the ECB has guaranteed a minimum payment of $1.9 million against ticket sales, corporate hospitality and ground advertising rights for the two Tests and two Twenty20 matches.
