 ISLAMABAD, Oct 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen shot and killed a Pakistani army brigadier and his driver in the capital, Islamabad, on Thursday as the military continued an offensive against Taliban targets, police said.

Most were closed on Thursday. The closure of schools rattled stock market investors and the main index ended 3.36 percent lower at 9,247.78 on Wednesday. The index was up 0.38 percent up at 9,282.68 at 0415 GMT on Thursday.
