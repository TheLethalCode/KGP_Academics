 Dhaka, Oct 19(bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Monday denied bail to Imrul Sadat Abir, arrested last month on charges of killing his wife, Dhaka University journalism student, Mafruda Haque Sutapa. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge ANM Bashirullah of Metropolitan rejected Abir's bail petition. Advocates Haidar Ali, ABM Touhidul Alam stood for the accused husband, a bank employee. Mirpur police arrested Abir, within hours of her death at her in-law's home at around 9:30pm on Sept 19. Her in-laws said she had hanged herself. But Sutapa's family alleged the husband had beaten Sutapa to death. They told bdnews24.com, after a personal physician had examined Sutapa's body, that torture marks were visible. The family filed a case with Mirpur Police Station the same night against Abir. Abir told police that he and his wife had "pushed and shoved" each other during a quarrel earlier on the night of her death. He said Sutapa later committed suicide by hanging herself from a grille.
