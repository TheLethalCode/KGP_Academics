 LONDON, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Monday urged world leaders to intervene personally to break deadlocked talks to agree a global climate change deal in December. Brown is one of the few major economy leaders who has announced plans to attend the UN-led Dec 7-18 conference in Copenhagen. The meeting is intended for environment ministers, and meant to sign a new deal to extend or replace the existing Kyoto Protocol after 2012. "I believe that leaders must engage directly to break the impasse," Brown told energy and environment ministers and representatives of 17 of the world's main polluting nations, gathered in London.

The Oct. 18-19 London meeting is the latest in a US-instigated series of major economies forums (MEF) meant to build support for the UN process.

Stern could not confirm that the United States would bring either a concrete emissions reduction target or a dollar offer to Copenhagen. As instigators of the MEF series, the United States is co-chair of the London meeting alongside the host country Britain. Scientists have issued increasingly stark warnings of the possible climate threats facing the planet, for example from melting Arctic ice sheets which could stoke further warming. "Success at Copenhagen is still within reach. But if we falter, the earth itself will be at risk," Brown sa
