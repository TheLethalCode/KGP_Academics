 Chittagong, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)There will be no local elections in the Chittagong-Cox's Bazar region, including city corporation polls, until the Election Commission ensures correct voter rolls, an official said Tuesday, as questions arise over illegal Rohingya immigrants being enrolled in recent voter list updates in the southeast. Election Commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told a workshop in the port city's LGED auditorium that the rise in numbers of new voters during the recent routine updating process in some wards under Chittagong City Corporation and frontier upazilas of Cox's Bazar was "abnormal". According to the commission's estimate the rise should normally be around five percent during such updates, which add new voters who have reached polling age. "But voters increased by 10 percent in some frontier upazilas of Cox's Bazar, of which many are suspected of being illegal Rohingya immigrants coming from Myanmar," said Sakhawat. Earlier in the week, Sakhawat had said up to 30 percent of the newly enrolled voters in Cox's Bazar district may be Rohingya immigrants. "It's essential to re-identify the new voters listed in four upazilas of the district," he had said on Sunday in Cox's Bazar, where thousands of Myanmar's Muslim minority Rohingyas, fleeing religious and ethnic persecution in their country, are living illegally outside official refugee camps. Voters have also increased by an abnormal 22 to 25 percent in two or three wards of Chittagong during the update, he said in the port city on Tuesday. Replying to a query, he said: "There is an obligation of to hold Chittagong City Corporation polls by June next year." The incumbent CCC will come to the end of its tenure this year. It is mandatory to hold polls within 180 days after its term ends. "A final correct voter list will be made by this time on scrutiny of updated list," said Sakhawat. The commissioner said Rohingya immigrants could have enrolled themselves as voters due to negligence of field level officers engaged in updating the lists. Sakhawat asked the officials to be extra careful. He also said there had been a positive qualitative change in the Election Commission and its work in recent years, adding that the commission had successfully overcome previous mismanagement and inefficiencies in many areas. Chittagong divisional commissioner MN Siddique chaired the workshop on 'Development of Election System'. b
