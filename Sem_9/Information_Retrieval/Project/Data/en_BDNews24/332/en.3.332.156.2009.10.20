 Benapole, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  Benapole land port Tuesday saw a six-hour stoppage in imports and exports over trouble with signatures on documents on the Indian side of the checkpoint. Officials at Petrapole Land Port Authority in India refused to sign Import General Manifests, MA Hamid, superintendent of Benapole Customs Cargo Branch told bdnews24.com. According to Bangladesh Land Port Authority, Benapole, situated in the southern district of Jessore, receives around 90 percent of all imports from India through Petrapole. Port activities closed on Tuesday from 10am to 2pm and then, after an hour of trade, closed again from 3pm to 5pm, said Hamid. Kartik Chakrabarty, general secretary of Petrapole Clearing & Forwarding Workers Association also said the Indian authorities "suddenly refused" to sign Import General Manifests in the absence of C&F Agents. "But the manifests had always previously been signed in the presence of cargo truck-drivers without any problems, Chakrabarty told bdnews24.com. Clearing & Forwarding Agents in Benapole stopped all exports and imports through their port in protest at Petrapole's move, said Habibur Rahman, president of Benapole C & F Agents Association. Rahman said activities resumed briefly at 2pm, following talks between the Indian customs authorities and other relevant agencies at Petrapole. "Exports and imports stopped again after about an hour as the same complications arose again," he said. A meeting was then held between Benapole and Petrapole land port authorities as the exports and imports stopped again at 3pm, Emdadul Haque, general secretary of Benapole C&F Agents Association told bdnews24.com. Activities once again resumed after the meeting decided to go back to the previous practice regarding India's singing of the Import General Manifests, Haque said. "Work was back on in full swing after 5pm," he said. There was a tailback of trucks stuck at the port until then, said Haque, but he was optimistic the situation would be back to normal within a few hours. bdnews24
