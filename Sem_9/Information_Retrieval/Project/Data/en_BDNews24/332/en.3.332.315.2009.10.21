<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The BDR mutiny trial will start at the end of this month or at the beginning of the next after the constitution of separate courts in the six divisions by the border guards' chief, the law minister said on Wednesday. "The trial of the major crimes including killing and arson will be held after the Criminal Investigation Department submits its investigation report," Shafique Ahmed told reporters at the Secretariat. He said: "The BDR has sought lawyers to fight legal battle. We have already sent some names. "But we will not say anything right now about the number of lawyers." Ahmed said the mutiny trial would be concluded within 135 days. "The trial will be held in line with BDR Act. Nobody should have any query about the trial process. "The trial will be fair and transparent." "Those who have investigated the incident will again hold trial." On whether the trial would be neutral, the minister said: "The trial will be held in line with law. There is no scope for bias." Asked about abnormal deaths of over 50 BDR members since the bloody rebellion in Peelkhana, the minister evaded a direct answer. "Since I don't have the authority about the issue I cannot say anything about that," he only said. Replying to a query, Ahmed said: "Those accused of mutiny will be allowed to appoint lawyers, but the lawyers will not be able to participate in arguments. "They will be allowed only to provide suggestions to the defendants." On whether reporters would be allowed in the courts, the minister said: "It is something that has yet to be decided. The reporters will be informed about the court proceedings by the BDR." Asked whether it would be a camera trial, he said: "Everything will be held in line with law." The government on Sept 15 decided to try the mutineers under the BDR Act and those charged with killings and looting under the penal code by speedy trial tribunal. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles' Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process, specifically whether the trial of the BDR mutineers could be held under the Army Act 1952. The court appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise on the reference. The court began hearing their opinions on the reference on Aug 25 and ended on Sept 3. The majority of the amici curiae opined that trial of BDR personnel could not be held under the Army Act, 1952 even by notification. bdne
