<TEXT>
 Thakurgaon, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  A Thakurgaon court has issued an arrest warrant against BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury for "derogatory comments" about Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Chief judicial magistrate Ashiqur Rahman issued the order on Sunday. Sheikh Farid, president of a group calling itself the Thakurgaon Citizens Committee, filed the case on Sept 8. The complainant said in his statement that SQ Chowdhury, "an anti-liberation element, had offended the people at large by making derogatory comments about Bangabandhu and his family". Chowdhury in a discussion at National Press Club on Aug 13 this year had said that the Aug 15, 1975 assassination of independence architect Sheikh Mujib and his family members, was "inevitable". He secured anticipatory bail from the High Court on Sept 17 in a separate defamation suit regarding the same comment. A Tangail court on Sept 10 had issued a previous arrest warrant against the senior BNP leader on the same charges. Tangail Jubo League vice president Abdur Rahim had filed that defamation suit on Aug 19. Chowdhury also faces similar charges in Magura, Khulna and Narail courts. State minister for law Quamrul Islam has also said Chowdhury would be tried on charges of war crimes although the BNP leader has refuted long-standing allegations against him regarding war crimes during the nation's war of independence in 1971. bdnews
