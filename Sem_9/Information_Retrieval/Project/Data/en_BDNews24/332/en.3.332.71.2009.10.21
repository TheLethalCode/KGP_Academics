<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)Firefighters on Wednesday renewed efforts to gain control of the fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board's Tejgaon warehouse, three days and three nights after it broke amid the thousands of tonnes of books and printing paper stored at the depot. The fire service officials had been hopeful of completely quenching the heart of the slow-burning fire by Tuesday, as it smouldered on through the huge stacks of books and papers at the depot. Kazi Sufia, radio officer of the fire service control room, told bdnews24.com around 60 firefighters were on the scene on Wednesday. She said it was uncertain when they would be able to completely extinguish the fire. The probe committee - formed late on Sunday, the day the fire broke out - headed by Razia Begum, additional secretary of the education ministry, is due to submit a preliminary report on Wednesday. "We're not overlooking any possibility  but nothing can be specified at this preliminary stage of the investigation," Razia had told reporters on Monday. Stacks of wet-packed paper and books were removed throughout Tuesday through the front of the building but the firefighters could not reach the smoldering flames in the north-eastern corner of the building. Fire service chief Brigadier Abu Nayyim Mohammad Shahidullah told bdnews24.com on Tuesday, "It's been really tough to remove the tonnes of papers crammed in the 1,15,000 sft warehouse." On the very first day on Sunday, he had said fire fighting efforts were not going smoothly as the warehouse, built long back in Pakistan times, was not constructed in line with building codes and some two thousand tonnes of books and papers were piled there in an unplanned way. He said the fire would only be completely extinguished once all the burning papers at the source and the surrounding stacks were completely removed from the building. Sheikh Mohammad Shahjalal, director (operations) of the fire service, said on Tuesday, "It's almost impossible to remove tonnes of packed stacks of books and papers stuck to the floor and roof due to sprayed water." He said the fire might have been caused by someone having carelessly thrown cigarettes or matches. "Electricity short-circuits can't be ignored nor can be arson." "The fire may even have been caused spontaneously by high temperatures building up inside the tightly stacked piles of books," he added. However, the state minister for education Motahar Hossain hinted on Monday that the fire might be "an act of sabotage". Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and his deputy Hossain, however, have sought to assure the public that the government's distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students would be completed on time. bdne
