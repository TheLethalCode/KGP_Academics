<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court resumed hearing arguments for appeals in the Bangabandhu assassination case for the sixth day on Thursday, taking the appeals proceedings into the 14th day. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, began the hearing at 9:45am with advocate Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for death convict Syed Farukur Rahman, delivering his arguments. On Wednesday night the car of Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a lawyer in the Bangabandhu murder case, was hit by a blast in the capital's Motijheel area. He was not injured in the attack. Taposh, an MP of the ruling Awami League, is the son of Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, nephew of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Moni and his wife Arzoo were also killed on Aug 15, 1975. The apex court on Wednesday rejected a defence petition submitted by Rahman on Sept 29 seeking to have the top state counsels removed for their failure to meet a deadline for submitting the 'concise statement', or summary, of their arguments against the appeals. After the court rejected the petition, Rahman began delivering his arguments on behalf of Faruk. A newly formed Supreme Court bench began hearing the long-stalled appeals by death convicts on Oct 5 to conclude the Mujib assassination case more than three decades after the bloody carnage. After reading out of the case paperbook, arguments hearing on the appeals started on Oct 15. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators of the military coup and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. President Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam finally filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Farukur Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. b
