 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)A military coup was orchestrated on Aug 15, 1975, defence counsel for one of the death convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case said on Thursday during the appeals hearings. Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for death convict Syed Faruk Rahman, said the trial of the mutiny should be held under court martial and the trial and verdicts in the case held under civil law should be nullified. He said, "The killing was part of a mutiny and cannot be viewed from any other perspective." The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam had resumed hearings on arguments for a sixth day Thursday morning, ending for the day at 1:30pm. On the 14th day of the appeals proceedings, advocate Khan Saifur Rahman said Gen Ziaur Rahman's killing was a part of military coup and its trial was held under court martial. "The trial of August 15 cannot be held under ordinary law and the trial verdict given under existing law must be nullified," Rahman said in his argument. Citing an example, Saifur said if killing takes place during a robbery, the offence of robbery and killing are held simultaneously. "Aug 15 was a part of a coup and the killing and coup must be tried simultaneously by court martial," he argued Opposing him, state counsel Toufiq Newaj said the trial of Gen Zia's killing was held under a state of emergency. "All the fundamental rights were frozen during the period," Newaj said. b
