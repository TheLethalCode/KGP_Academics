<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The five-day 'Zor' Biswa Iztema, second biggest congregation of the Muslims after the Hajj that was scheduled to begin on Friday, has been deferred to Nov 20. 'Zor' iztema is held annually prior to the regular Iztema in January every year offering an assembly for those who had taken oath in the name of Allah in the last year's Iztema to spread the message of Islam throughout through the following nine months. Abdul Quddus, a local elder of the Iztema, said the deferment of the Zor iztema dates was decided in a meeting held at Kakrail mosque on Oct 16 as advised by the Delhi high command. He said it was due to weather conditions that the authorities shifted the dates of the Zor Iztema which reviews, as per the prophet's practice, the spreading of Islamic messages across. In the last Iztema, discussions were held around the successes and failures of the message preaching work performed by the 'chilla' (oath) bound devotees through the designated nine-month period. 'Kalguzaree' (stock-taking of the day-to-day preaching work) is also carried out and those who have failed to perform as expected are chastised and given their course-correction lessons. Another Iztema elder Ghiasuddin said the three-day Biswa Iztema will start in Tongi Iztema ground on Jan 22. The day was determined at a 'maswara' (discussion) meeting of the Iztema elders held immediately following the last Iztema, he added. The dates will remain unchanged if everything goes well, he reiterated.
