 Chittagong, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  The nation voted in the general elections for a government to serve the people, they did not vote for tender grabbers, the state minister for housing and public works said Tuesday. State minister Abdul Mannan Khan made the comment as he called on Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jubo League workers in Chittagong not to be involved with tender manipulation. "BNP won 29 seats in the last parliamentary elections. People will not give us even nine seats if we fail to run the state," he said. Saying that Awami League does not want to be defeated in the next elections, he warned, "No concession will be given to Chhatra League, Juba League or anyone else involved with tender manipulation." "People voted us to power to serve them, not to grab tenders." The minister was speaking at the inauguration of the Kazir Deuri Kitchen Market and Apartment Complex project of the Chittagong Development Authority. Farming land has been decreasing day by day due to unplanned urbanization, Mannan Khan said. "That's why the government is now moving more towards public housing projects that involve apartments rather than allocating individual plots of land." The Kazir Deuri Kitchen Market and Apartment Complex is projected to be built at a cost of Tk 65 crore at the crossing of Kazir Deuri, he said. Abdus Salam, chairman of Chittagong Development Authority, presided over the event. Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries senior vice president MA Salam, among others, spoke. bdnews2
