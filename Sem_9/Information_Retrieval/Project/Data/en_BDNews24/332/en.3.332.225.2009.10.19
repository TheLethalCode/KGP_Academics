 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--The fire at National Curriculum and Textbook Board warehouse in Tejgaon may be an act of sabotage, the state minister for education has hinted. The smouldering fire at the warehouse has been burning for more than 30 hours after it broke out on Sunday morning. "There are three challenges ahead. Terminal exams are in November, book distribution in December and bringing all children to school," Motahar Hossain said. Someone may have done this job to deter these challenges, he said when asked if he believed the fire was an act of sabotage. He, however, sought to assure people that distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students will be distributed in time. All the papers for printing the necessary books have gone to the press, Hossain said. Twelve hundred metric tons of papers, earmarked for printing books for primary schools in the next year, have been left unscathed, the junior minister said. The fire has burnt down most of the teachers' guides and additional 800 metric tonnes of papers for secondary and Madrasa books, he further said. Some papers have been recovered, he added. bdnews
