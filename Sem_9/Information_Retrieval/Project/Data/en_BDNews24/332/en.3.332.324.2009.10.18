<TITLE> Climate the major hurdle in fighting poverty: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Global climate change is a major deterrent in mitigating poverty in Bangladesh, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Sunday, inaugurating the second day of a conference on tackling extreme poverty. He also said micro credit is not necessarily the prime tool for poverty alleviation. Muhith said 40 percent of Bangladeshis today live in poverty, of whom a further 20 percent are below the hardcore poverty line. "The nation's efforts at mitigating poverty over the years 1960-1990 has of late stumbled seriously due to recurring natural disasters such as cyclones, floods, tidal surges occasioned by the changing climate across the globe," said the minister. "Global climate change poses the greatest challenge today in our poverty mitigation efforts." Regarding micro credit, Muhith said marginalised farmers were not able to access micro credit and therefore it could be said to be an effective measure for all. "It can, however, very well be an aid to mitigating poverty in Bangladesh," he said. "Mass employment through industrialisation should be the mainstay of our poverty eradication efforts," the minister said, adding that self-employment, micro credit and small and medium enterprises have also positively impacted the national economy considerably. "Of the seven and a half crore of our working age population, three crore are unemployed," said Muhith. "Generating jobs for them would certainly cut down poverty." "To do that, massive investments are required, which again is being curbed at the moment due to the global recession. Things will brighten up in 2010, we hope," said the minister. Mentioning that the government is taking multiple steps to augment investment, he said economic development, ie GDP growth, plays a special role in poverty alleviation. He said GDP growth did not fare well under prolonged undemocratic rules, registering less than four percent during the autocratic regimes that straddled the country between 1975-1990. With a democratic government assuming power in 1991, Muhith said, the GDP rose to five and then six percent. "The incumbent government envisages it may go reach seven to eight percent." DFID Bangladesh chief Jim McAlpine also addressed the event, presided over by Saber Hossain Chowdhury MP. bdn
