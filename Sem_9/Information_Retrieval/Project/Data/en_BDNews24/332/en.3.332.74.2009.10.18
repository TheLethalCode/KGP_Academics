<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has said the fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board's main warehouse would not hamper the government's distribution of free textbooks for the next year, though the fire had been burning all day and reportedly caused huge damage. The fire broke at the NCTB's main warehouse in the capital's Tejgaon area early Sunday morning. The NCTB prints textbooks for schools for government's distribution. The minister rushed to the spot at 8am after hearing the news and was there all day. He expressed fears that huge financial losses might occur as the main NCTB stores contained expensive printing paper and printed books. "It's clear that the damage is huge, though we cannot confirm the total losses yet," said Nahid. "But," Nahid said, "it won't put a halt to the government's distribution of textbooks. We will do it on time." "It's our challenge." The government is expected to distribute 19 crore (190 million) textbooks among the primary and secondary students free of cost, he said. The main Tejgaon warehouse stores paper for government's textbooks and other books. Textbooks for the Dhaka district were also kept there. Another NCTB warehouse is situated at Tongi. Fire services deputy director Bharat Chandra Biswas said the NCTB store, crammed with books, was still emitting clouds of smoke after 10 hours despite being hosed down heavily with water. Gouranga Sarkar, research officer and member of the stores supervision committee, told bdnews24.com, "The fire spread in the part of the stores containing stacks of book cover printing paper of heavier thickness. The stores also contain printing paper for the inner pages worth about Tk 19 crore in total." Fire fighters said the water being hosed to extinguish the fire would destroy books and all kinds of paper materials stored there. bdnews
