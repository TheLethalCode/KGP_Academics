 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)--Khaleda Zia's refusal to share podium with Sheikh Hasina has proved that the BNP does not believe in poverty reduction, chief whip Abdus Shahid has alleged. At a hurriedly called media briefing at parliament's media centre, Shahid said the opposition BNP chief exposed her "political poverty" by withdrawing from the inaugural ceremony of an all-party programme marking the 'International Day for the Eradication of Poverty' . The chief whip, speaking on behalf of the speaker Abdul Hamid, told reporters at the briefing, that the opposition chief's U-turn was "unfortunate". But, he said, the programme would go on as planned. "The leader of the opposition at a press briefing this afternoon told journalists that she would not attend the opening function though she repeatedly assured us of her presence. "This is unfortunate." At a news conference at her political office in Gulshan on Friday, Khaleda said: "It will not be possible for us to join tomorrow's programme in the current circumstances." "We cannot unilaterally cooperate with the government by condoning its crime, repression and violation of human rights." Shahid said the poverty elimination function was organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) as per Bangladesh's international commitment to halve the number of poor people by 2015. "This is not a function of a political party. Khaleda Zia could have delivered the same speech at the function instead of making it at the press conference." "It (the refusal) proves that she does not want to eradicate poverty," said Shahid. Flanked by chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque, Speaker Abdul Hamid, chief patron of the APPG, at a media briefing on Thursday told both prime minister Hasina and Khaleda would attend the opening function to launch the anti-poverty call. Shahid said Khaleda had made some "untrue" allegations against the government as an excuse to boycott the function. Whip A S M Feroze and APPG's secretary general Shishir Shil also attended the briefing at 8pm.
