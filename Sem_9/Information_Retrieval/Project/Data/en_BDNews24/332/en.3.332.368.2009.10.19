Ahmadinejad called on Pakistan not to waste time in cooperating with Iran in apprehending the perpetrators, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported. Iran has in the past accused Pakistan of hosting members of the Sunni insurgent group Jundollah, Iranian state television said. Iranian media say Jundollah claimed responsibility for Sunday's bombing, which killed more than 30 people.
