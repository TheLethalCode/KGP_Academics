 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)Officials said the fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board's main warehouse in Tejgaon was almost out on Wednesday, three days and three nights after it broke amid the thousands of tonnes of books and printing paper stored at the depot. Smoke was absent at the depot for the first time since Sunday. Kazi Sufia, radio officer of the fire service control room, told bdnews24.com 60 firefighters were on the scene since morning. The weary firefighters had renewed efforts on the fourth day to gain control of the slow-burning but devastating fire that had consumed half the contents of the warehouse since Sunday morning. They said they were finally successful in quenching the heart of the smouldering blaze around mid-afternoon. "The fire is almost extinguished. No smoke is seen now," Sheikh Mohammad Shahjalal, director (operations) of the fire service, told bdnews24.com. "It will take some time to confirm whether it is doused fully," said Shahjalal. The probe committee, formed late on Sunday, headed by Razia Begum, additional secretary of the education ministry, is due supposed to submit a preliminary report on Wednesday. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and his deputy Motahar Hossain, have said the public that the government's distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students would be completed on time despite almost 1,000 tonnes of books and paper being destroyed. bdnews24
