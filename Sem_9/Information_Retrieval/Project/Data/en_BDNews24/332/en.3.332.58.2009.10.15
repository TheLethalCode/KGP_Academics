<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)The drive to evict illegal occupants along the banks of four rivers, including Buriganga, skirting Dhaka will restart within 'seven to ten days', the shipping minister said on Thursday. The decision came from a meeting of a taskforce to protect the rivers across the country, including Buriganga, Shitalakhha, Balu and Turag. Minister Shahjahan Khan chaired the meeting held at his ministry. The taskforce, headed by Khan, recommends ways to restore navigability and the normal course of the rivers Buriganga, Shitalakkha, Balu, Turag and other main rivers. The meeting also ordered Dhaka WASA and Dhaka City Corporation not to dump any refuse into the rivers and tackle any resistance to the eviction drive, Khan said. "Walkways will be built along the banks of the rivers (Buriganga, Shitalakkha, Balu, Tongi) so those river banks are no longer encroached upon in the future," he said. Dredgers are being collected as part of the government's initiative to increase the rivers' navigability, he also said. In addition, the government will use dredgers bought under private initiatives so that dredging can be completed within the shortest possible time, he added. The government has also taken some initiatives to sensitise the public about not dumping refuse into the rivers, he further said. Dustbins will also be set up so that wastage are not thrown from launches, steamers and ferries, the minister said. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen stressed coordinating all ministries to dredge the rivers. State minister for public works Abdul Mannan Khan said many people, claiming themselves to be adherents of the ruling Awami League, are encroaching on the rivers. Law minister Shafique Ahmed, state minister for land Mostafizur Rahman Fizar, state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader, Save the Environment Movement's Abu Naser Khan and environmentalist Ainun Nishat, among others, were present at the taskforce's meeting. b
