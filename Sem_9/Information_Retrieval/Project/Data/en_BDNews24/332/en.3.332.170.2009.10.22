 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)Ruling party MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh escaped injury, though 13 others were wounded, in Wednesday night's bomb attack in Motijheel as the assailants appear to have thrown the explosive device from a distance, police said Thursday. Primary evidence collected by crime scene investigators also showed the explosive was a hand-made device, not a grenade. Police are assuming the Awami League MP was the main target of Wednesday night's bomb attack. Among the thirteen injured in the blast were bystanders, a messenger of Taposh's office, a security guard of a nearby bank and Awami League supporters. "But Taposh was the only prominent person at the scene," Motijheel zone additional deputy police commissioner Moinul Haque told bdnews24.com. The blast came as Taposh was leaving in his car in front of his Motijheel office. "It can be assumed that he was the target of the attackers," said the police official. "The target was missed as the explosive was thrown from a distance," said Haque. "On the evidence of the splinters recovered after the explosion and the wounds of the injured people we are sure that the explosive was not a grenade, but a hand-made bomb," the official said. The injured were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Wednesday night. Two of them have been transferred to the Combined Medical Hospital. Intelligence forces as well as police are investigating the reason behind the attack. Some eight to ten people have already been questioned up to Thursday afternoon, Haque said. No case was filed with Motijheel Police Station up to that time. Of the people who were quizzed so far were eye witnesses and security guards of companies around the spot. Police have so far grilled five security guards of two nearby banks. b
