 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni said recent media reports of escalating tensions on the Myanmar border could "exert influence" on both sides of the border. She also said vested quarters were trying to blight relations with Myanmar and called on them to stop such instigation. "There may be provocation by some quarters to strain relations between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Their motive is to capitalise on the sour relations," Dipu Moni told reporters at the foreign ministry Wednesday. Local newspapers as well as foreign news agencies have reported escalating tensions, even a "warlike" standoff, in recent days, with Myanmar deploying troops on their side of the border and Bangladesh replying with similar action. The reports also suggested that Myanmar was trying to push thousands of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh as they did in 1991-92. "Some sections of the media are publishing stories about tensions on the Bangladesh-Myanmar border," said Dipu Moni. "This type of report may exert influence on both sides of the border," cautioned the foreign minister, who recently met her Myanmar counterpart in Colombo. She said the Bangladesh ambassador in Yangon, his defence attach, and the Myanmar envoy in Dhaka had all rejected the reports of Myanmar troops mobilising along the border. "They assured that there was regular movements of troops going on the border," said the minister. "The Myanmar foreign minister also told me the same," she said. Dipu Moni last week told reporters that the government had "no information" on unusual troops movement at the border. The Myanmar military junta has, however, recently moved to erect more fencing along the border. Dipu Moni has said that Myanmar was erecting the barbed-wire fencing on their side, after consulting Dhaka, in order to curb border crimes. On TIFA The foreign minister said there is no pressure from the US government to sign a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA). "We have some concerns for some sections of the TIFA. They understand our concerns," said Dipu Moni. She said the two countries were trying to bridge the gap. The minister said, "We are also looking into whether we can expand trade and investment through other agreements other than TIFA". PM's China visit Dipu Moni said prime minister Sheikh Hasina was keen to visit China which Bangladesh considers a good friend "There is an invitation from the Chinese government. Our Prime Minister is sure to visit China at a mutually convenient time," she said.
