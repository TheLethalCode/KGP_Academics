<TITLE> US advises Dhaka to go for cuts, GSP; pushes TIFA </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh should negotiate bilaterally for duty cuts and preferences for access of its products to the US market instead of calling for quota and duty-free facilities, the assistant US trade representative for South Asia suggests. "We always hear pleas to provide Bangladesh with duty-free access ... I wish as much energy was spent seeking ways to better utilise Bangladesh's GSP benefits in the US market," Michael J Delaney told a discussion organised by the Policy Research Institute in the capital on Tuesday. Advocating for the Trade and Investment Framework-Agreement (TIFA), he said it would serve as a forum for government and business representatives to discuss economic issues of mutual interest. "Its objectives include improving cooperation and enhancing opportunities for trade and investment." He added that the TIFA was not a legally bound concept. The visiting US government official also said the GSP facility, allowing duty-free access of 4,800 products, would help Bangladesh to diversify its export basket. "Under GSP, Bangladesh can export china (porcelain) to the United States duty free." Touching on his country's trade policy, he said the US believes that adequate protection of status, conditions and compensations for workers is a key component of a healthy global trading system. Delaney appreciated Bangladesh's progress in addressing the issue of workers' rights. "The office of the US Trade Representative is currently reviewing Bangladesh's progress on labor issues following the submission of a petition by the AFL-CIO to suspend Bangladesh's benefit under the GSP," he added. On the skepticism over TIFA in Bangladesh, Delaney said that its up to the people to decide to sign the agreement. He lauded the debates saying in a proper democratic environment issues like these should be discussed publicly. Discussants, however, suggested that the TIFA draft be public to better understanding of the issue. "We haven't actually seen it...it has not been made public," economist M A Taslim told the gathering. He said that it was only in this discussion that he knew that TIFA was not something legally binding. Taslim, CEO of Bangladesh Foreign Trade Institute, agreed with the call for diversifying export but added that it was a hard task for a least developed country (LDC) like Bangladesh. Echoing Taslim on making the draft public, Mustafizur Rahman of private research firm CPD stressed intense discussion on such issues before a decision is reached. "It needs to be discussed...why is this rush?" he told the US government official. Speakers alleged that the US concentrates more on bilateral platforms rather than multilateral ones. Delaney, however, came up with a rather weak answer; that matters cannot be discussed intensively at multilateral platforms like WTO. Former finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam emphasised a provision in the draft that would not cause Bangladesh to backtrack from its commitments made on platforms like the WTO. He also said that more benefits and compensation to workers would limit the possibilities of expansion for entrepreneurs, hampering potential employments. On the 4,800 products under GSP, Mirza Aziz asked what the US government could do to promote more FDI into the country to produce those products. "It can be joint venture or Bangladesh is very much open to 100 percent foreign-owned entities." Delaney seized the opportunity with both hands. "We really want to do that, but its hard to do that without a dialogue," he said, referring to the TIFA mechanism. Annisul Huq, the president of FBCCI, said Bangladesh was not totally against TIFA but urged for US supports in the upcoming WTO ministerial. "We saw in the previous ministerial that it becomes a priority where the US gives a push." He said that Bangladesh has been totally marginalised as an LDC. "Even Sri Lanka and Pakistan not being LDC got duty-free access for seven products, some of which are our major exports." Huq also pressed for US support for LDCs under a single platform rather than arrangements like AGOA (African Growth and Opportunity Act).
