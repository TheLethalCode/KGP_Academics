<TITLE> Population chief hurdle to food autarky: Matia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Rising population is the chief barrier to achieving self-sufficiency in food, agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said on Friday, urging measures to control it. The other hurdle to boosting food production, according to her, is the growing salinity in cultivable land. Matia hoped to attain food autarky by breaking the barriers. Food minister Abdur Razzaque also expressed the same hope and stressed reducing dependence on food import. They spoke at a seminar at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC) marking the World Food Day. Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas and UN, Food and Agriculture Organisation's Bangladesh representative, Ad Spijkers, attended the seminar. This year's theme of the day is 'Achieving Food Security in Times of Crisis'. "We want to build the country as a self-sufficient one by producing rice, maze, wheat, vegetables and edible oil, but we have two obstacles," Matia said. She asked the donor agencies to help control the population growth, saying that people are aware of it but they lack means. Bangladesh currently has a growth rate of 1.41 percent, while the density of population is also one of the highest at 953 persons per square kilometre. The minister suggested that the development partners help the government with birth control materials instead of only arranging meetings and seminars. "A big family poor on resources suffers food insecurity, which often helps to generate religious militancy," she added. Matia was also critical of the role of donors on food production and storage. "Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation (BADC) was shut following the World Bank recommendations. Shallow tube wells are set up as BADC stopped irrigation projects, which damaged farming. "But we have moved to revive BADC," the minister said. The government has allotted Tk 400 crore for some projects including canal restructuring to reserve sweet water and to increase its supply for better production of Boro and other crops by reducing salinity in the southern coastal zone in dry season, she said. "Once huge crops were produced in the southern region, but now this is barren. We want to make the southern region productive again." She stressed public-private partnership to achieve this goal. While criticising the donors, she said, "I felt pressure from them in my previous term. They said more than 7 lakh metric tonnes of foods cannot be stored in granaries. "But we could fight the crisis as we stored more foods without listening to them." Matia said, "These days more and more investment is being made in our farming sector. In the past, many would spend their money on building houses, now they are investing in agriculture. She also said demand of agro-products is increasing worldwide. Food minister Razzaque stressed attaining self-reliance in food rather than focusing on import. "The policy of this government is against import. We want to meet our demands through domestic production. About the import of edible oil worth Tk 11,000 crore every year, the minister said Bangladesh would be economically benefit if it did not have to import. He emphasised a comprehensive strategy for both the southern and northern regions of the country to achieve self-sufficiency. "Average growth of foodgrains in Bangladesh is 1.8 percent every year on average. In 2008 the growth rose to record 8 percent. But there was no such development in food production during the tenure of BNP-Jamaat alliance government. "The country would not have incurred so much damages if the production did not shrink at that time," Razzaque added. The seminar was presided over by the agriculture secretary C Q K Mostaque Ahmed while Dr Jainal Abedin, representative from the International Rice Research Institute presented the keynote paper. Earlier, the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation brought out a rally in the city to mark the World Food Day. Matia inaugurated the day's events through the rally followed by a procession that started from Khamar Bari, participated among others by agriculturists, scientists, officials and members of the public. Hundreds of school children joined the rally with colourful banners and festoons. The programme was supported by Telefood, a FAO project for eradicating hunger, bdnews24.com and Channel i. A children's painting competition was arrenaged at 3pm at Bangladesh Shishu Academy. A three-day fair on 'Agriculture and Food' was inaugurated at the Krishibid Institution premise at 12pm. A similar fair was being held at Depasai village in Somobhat union under Dhamrai upazila. Channel i is telecasting the programme live. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will release postage stamps and envelops commemorating the day. Moreover, the district and upazila administrations around the country are observing the day through holding discussion meetings and rallies. President Zillur Rahman, on the eve of World Food Day on Friday, said proper measures must be taken to ensure food security in a changing climate. In his message on Thursday, Rahman said, "I believe sufficient research and adequate technological innovation and usage can play an important role to produce more food." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, "Agriculture is the most affected and vulnerable sector due to climate change. It is absolutely needed to ensure food security by fighting the situation." "Bangladesh achieved self-dependency during the previous Awami League government in 1996-2001. But the succeeding government could not carry the success." The incumbent government is pledged to guarantee food security for all being self-dependent again, the prime minister added. In his message the UN chief Ban Ki-moon said, "Food and nutritional security are the foundations of a decent life, a sound education and, indeed, the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals." "Over the past two years, volatile food prices, the economic crisis, climate change and conflict have led to a dramatic and unacceptable rise in the number of people who cannot rely on getting the food they need to live, work and thrive. "For the first time in history, more than one billion people are hungry," he added. He said, "At this time of crisis, I encourage all nations to pursue coordinated and comprehensive strategies for agricultural development and effective social protection so that vulnerable people  women and children in particular  can get the food they need for nutritional security and well-being." FAO representative in Bangladesh AD Spijkers said, "The achievement of the MDG 1 to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  faces the risk of serious setbacks." "It has occurred because of the economic crisis and panicky price hikes that have reduced incomes and access to food of the poor, more severely those in the poorest parts of the globe," he added. Spijkers said, "The government has taken a strong resolve to return to self sufficiency in food by 2012 and to sustain it. The farmers of Bangladesh may rightfully aspire to attain that target. We believe they can, and they will." bdnew
