<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)The stage is all set at the capital's Bangabandhu Centre for the much-hyped "all-party" event to launch anti-poverty campaign in Bangladesh, but without the opposition leader Khaleda Zia who backed out at the last moment. Speaker Abdul Hamid, who will be in the chair, reached the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) as per Bangladesh's international commitment to halve the number of poor people by 2015 the conference is set to start at around 3:30pm. Khaleda and her arch political rival, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, were scheduled to launch a call to combat poverty but she announced on Friday that she would not share the stage with her. Flanked by chief whip Abdus Shahid and opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque and , Speaker Abdul Hamid, chief patron of the APPG, at a media briefing on Thursday told both Hasina and Khaleda would attend the opening function to launch the anti-poverty call. She hit out at the Awami League-led government for not cooperating with the opposition and said, "Unilaterally cooperating with the government amounts to condone its crime, anarchy, repression and violation of human rights." At an emergency news conference at her political office in Gulshan on Friday, the opposition chief said: "Observing the events over the last few days, we regret to announce that it will not be possible for us to join tomorrow's programme in the current circumstances." Replying to questions from the media, Khaleda said: "We wanted to attend the programme. But I am ethically pressed to make this statement here today following the events over the past few days." She said the government has been more tyrannical in its nine months than the military-installed immediate past caretaker government was in the two-year term. She asked the government to meet her party's four-point charter of demands, pointing out that creating a 'congenial atmosphere' is the pre-requisite for national unity. "The process for creating national consensus on various issues can begin only after the government creates an congenial environment. "Otherwise, the call for unity to alleviate poverty will ring hollow." Khaleda thanked speaker Abdul Hamid for his efforts regarding the programme and said a letter of regrets will be sent to him on Friday. At Friday's news conference, Khaleda called on the ruling Awami League-led government to behave like the country's government, not the party. b
