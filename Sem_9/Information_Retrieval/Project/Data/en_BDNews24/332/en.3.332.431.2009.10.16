 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)--Academics have termed the proposed education policy as erroneous and inconsistent and urged the government to fast implement it after making necessary amendments. They were speaking at a roundtable titled 'National Education Policy-2009' hosted by Communist Party of Bangladesh at Moitri Bhaban in the capital' Paltan area on Thursday. Jahid Hasan Chowdhury, assistant professor of political science department at Dhaka University, presented the keynote paper at the roundtable chaired by professor Safiuddin Ahmed. The educationists sounded a pessimistic tone over implementation of the education policy. They alleged that though the education policy speaks of secularism in line with the constitution, it reeks of compromise with a particular section. Religion education retains its previous position without much qualitative change in it and English medium education has been completely spared, they alleged. Former Bangla Academy director general Syed Anwar Hossain said, "Though it was said that the education policy would reflect the spirit of liberation war, it will widen the existing disparity leading to utter chaos in the education sector." Terming it as a partial draft, he said, "The erroneous and inaccurate policy is not worth implementing." Bangladesh College and University Teachers' Association president Akteruzzaman said, "The government has turned a deaf ear to the demand of progressive teachers for a modern, scientific education policy of world standard." Necessary changes to the policy can be brought after launching the policy, he said. "The reactionary forces will try to shoot down the policy unless steps are initiated to put it in place right now." Professor Rangalal Sen of Dhaka University was highly critical of the proposed education policy. "It is full of inconsistencies as it does not reflect the economic and political commitment of the government." "The draft is marked by self-contradiction and it is not possible to dream of universal society keeping discrimination alive." Professor of Bangladesh Agriculture University Nur Mohammad said, "It is not clear whether it is a programme or an education policy." He urged the government to start launching the policy focusing on the positive aspects of recommendations and to address the incongruities gradually. In the keynote paper, professor Jahid called on the government to resolve inconsistencies and self-contradiction by conducting a thorough analysis. He demanded the proposal on introducing religious education at pre-primary level be cancelled. BAU professor Asrfuzzaman, Sikhkha Barta editor professor AN Rasheda, among others, spoke at the roundtable Storming to power in early January, Awami League formed the National Education Policy Formulation Committee-2009 headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury. The committee handed over its report to the prime minister on Sep 4 through the education ministry. The policy document is furnished with separate chapters on primary, secondary and higher education, technical education as well as madrasa education.
