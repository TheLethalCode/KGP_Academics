<TITLE> Strong regulator to replace RRC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The Regulatory Reforms Commission will make way for a larger and more powerful body to oversee operations of government organisations and agencies, the finance minister has said. AMA Muhith said on Monday the new organisation will be helpful in rendering the Board of Investment, Privatisation Commission more effective and also in implementing the recommendations forwarded by the RRC. The finance minister spoke to reporters after his meeting with the newly arrived Japanese ambassador Tamotsu Shinotsuka at his Secretariat office. Asked if RRC should continue to exist after the exit of chairman Akbar Ali Khan, Muhith said, "The RRC was a requirement for ship-shaping and streamlining time-worn and hackneyed laws and regulations." " Regulatory Reforms Commission was just one of the various reform measures adopted by the unelected government and it had its role to play then. We're looking at the issue from a different angle now. The last caretaker government formed the 17-member RRC on Oct 30, 2007 with an aim to reform old, ineffective and complicated laws to fast track development through boosting investment and trade. "In the light of the recommendations forwarded by the RRC and to further enable the BoI, the Privatization Board etc. we're seriously contemplating raising a big and capable organisation instead." The BoI and the PB have become ineffective of late, he added, which have to be invigorated. On the other hand, Muhith said, the brilliant clusters of recommendations forwarded by the RRC also should be considered for implementation, as necessary. "In fact, the entity we're considering at this stage will be aimed at regulating all these matters we are talking about," he said. The minister said the matter has in the meantime been taken up with the prime minister too. Implementation of the RRC recommendations will, however, be a continuous process, he said, which will be regulated by another regulatory body. Replying to a query whether the proposed new pay scale should be officially announced in October, the finance minister said, "Not in October, the matter has been delayed a bit as my secretary and I were abroad for some days." He assured, however, that the revised pay scale may be introduced in early November. Asked why the Padma bridge construction is not taking off, Muhith said, "Well, we can't rid ourselves of all kinds of bureaucratic and traditionally practiced execution styles, which affect any and all project planning and everything. Padma is no exception." "But this much I can assure you about funding the bridge construction that the donors' portions have been determined. Sources of the remainder funds have also been identified." Akbar Ali Khan resigned his office as the RRC chairman on Oct 15 stating that he was not receiving any cooperation from the incumbent government in discharging his responsibilities. About his meeting with the Japanese envoy, the minister said, "We've sound friendly linkages with the Japanese historically." "Our bilateral relations will be further bolstered through enhanced economic and commercial exchanges." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to visit Japan in early 2010, he said, through which our bonds with the nation will be strengthened. bd
