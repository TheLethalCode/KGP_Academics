 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina left Dhaka Tuesday night for the Swedish capital Stockholm to participate in the 'European Development Days 2009' from Oct 22 to 24. "Global climate changes are affecting Bangladesh. I will speak of how Bangladesh can be saved from these adverse effects at the European programme," Hasina said of her trip just before her departure, during a visit to the Hajj camp. The annual programme, hosted by the European Commission and EU presidency, aims to make the EU members' development aid and activities more effective. This year's European Development Days is expected to bring together some 4,000 people and 1,500 organisations from the development community. Delegates from 125 countries will be represented, including heads of state, leading world figures and Nobel prize winners among them. The three-day program will address issues of citizenship, responses to the global economic downturn, democracy and its relation to development and climate change. Hasina will visit Qatar on her way home. She is to reach Doha on Oct 26 and meet with Qatar's Ameer on that day. She will fly home the next day. The prime minister left the country on a regular Qatar Airways flight at 9:45pm.
