 PARIS, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Martina Hingis will not join fellow former world number one players Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin in making a return to top-level tennis. "No, no, no, sure," the 29-year-old Swiss told Tuesday's issue of French sports daily L'Equipe when asked whether she planned another comeback. "You can't just snap your fingers and say 'let's go and play the Australian Open'". Hingis came out of retirement in 2006 and in January 2008 she was handed a two-year ban starting from Oct. 1, 2007 after testing positive for cocaine at Wimbledon. She is now eligible to play again.
