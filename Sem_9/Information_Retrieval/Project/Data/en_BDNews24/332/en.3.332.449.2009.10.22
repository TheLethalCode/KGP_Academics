<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)The bomb attack on Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was carried out to kill him to stop the execution of the verdict on Bangabandhu murder case, the AL general secretary said on Thursday. Syed Ashraful Islam made the comment after the emergency meeting of the party's Central Working Committee after Wednesday night's bomb attack on Taposh's car in downtown Motijheel. Taposh was unhurt but at least 13 bystanders were injured in the blast. Ashraf, also the LGRD minister, said, "The nation believes the killers of Bangabandhu, the extreme communal and anti-liberation forces were involved with the attack." The meeting was held at the party president's Dhanmondi office with acting AL president Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury in the chair. The party spokesman said,"The motive of the attack was to kill him so that the trial can not run and the verdict not executed." The assailants will be identified and tried, he added. "Conspiracies are still on to kill the two surviving daughters of Bangabandhu (independence architect Sheikh Mubihur Rahman) ." Ashraf said, "The trial of Bangabandhu murder cannot be stopped by killings, attacks and threats no matter how powerful the criminals are. "None can stop the Awami League and the Grand Alliance from executing the verdict and establishing human rights and justice. Asked who were behind the attack, Ashraf said, "The nation does not know that." All the necessary measures will be taken against the perpetrators, he said. Home minister Sahara Khatun was also present in the meeting, he added. A protest rally will be launched on Friday and further programmes will be scheduled after the return of prime minister Sheikh Hasina from Sweden, according to Ashraf.
