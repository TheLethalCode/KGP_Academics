 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Monday raised the retirement age for freedom fighters by two years to 59. It also approved four proposed laws, including the Private University Bill 2009. The 42nd cabinet meeting was held at the prime minister's office at noon, with Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, briefing the press afterwards. Azad said, "The retirement age of working freedom fighters has been increased from 57 to 59 years." "Those who have been on Leave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR) within the past 23 months would also get this benefit." The retirement age of the other workers remains the same, at the age of 57, Azad said. The cabinet also approved the Private University Bill 2009 on Monday. University Grants Commission chairman Nazrul Islam, speaking at a seminar on implementation of the proposed National Education Policy 2009 on Sunday, said the UGC-drafted bill intended to bring the private university sector under stricter regulation. The cabinet on Monday also finally approved the Bangladesh Labour (amendment) Bill 2009. The law was issued as an ordinance in 2008. But it was annulled for not being placed in the first session of the 9th parliament. Later an amended version was submitted to the cabinet. The cabinet also approved the Post Office (amendment) Bill 2009, and the Gas Bill 2009 on Monday. Azad said that according to the proposed Post Office law, licensed couriers would be able to deliver and distribute mail. bd
