 Rangpur, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)--Former military strongman H M Ershad says he only followed his predecessor General Ziaur Rahman in rehabilitating the killers of independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "When he was in power (former president) Ziaur Rahman gave the killers of Bangabandhu jobs and many other facilities," he said at his house in Rangpur. "I have just continued with that," said Ershad, chairman of Jatiya Party, the key partner in ruling Grand Alliance government headed by Awami League. Allegations have been there that Ershad rehabilitated the killers of Sheikh Mujib, the first president of Bnagladesh. "I was in power for nine years but not for once did Awami League ask me for the trial of Bangabandhu's assaissination." "Can any Awami League leader say that they demanded the trial of Bangabandhu's killing?" he questioned. "The indemnity bill got passed before I came to power. Rather I and my party backed the Awami League's initiative to revoke the Indemnity Act in 1996." Party leaders and workers greeted them with flowers when Ershad and his wife, Rawshan, reached his house 'Palli Nibash' in Rangpur town at 4pm. Rangpur district Jatiya Party president Moshiar Rahman Ranga, general secretary Mostafizur Rahman Mostofa were present, among others. To his party leaders, Ershad said, "We will be in the Grand Alliance as we have been. But Jatiya Party has to be strengthened. We want to run the next elections on our own." On the conflict among party leaders in Rangpur, he said, "I will not accept any conflict in the party in Rangpur. I hear there was a clash. Why is there so much division? I am the chairman of Jatiya Party, and your guardian." "I will settle issues sitting with you all." "I have asked for formation of new committees by holding councils across the country. Council will also be called in Rangpur. He who will be elected by workers will be the leader only." bdn
