 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh survived a bomb attack outside his office in the capital's Motijheel commercial district on Wednesday, which left at least 13 people wounded, police and witnesses said. Taposh, a lawyer in the Bangabandhu murder case and a close relative of the prime minister, was leaving his office at around 8.30pm when the explosion occurred, his private secretary Wahidul Alam Arif told bdnews24.com. "A bomb went off just behind the car soon after Taposh and his companions got into it." Taposh's assistant, advocate Noor Alam Ujjal, who was with him at the time, told bdnews24.com, "The blast ripped out the glass at the back of the car." The front windscreen was also damaged by the impact, he said. Witnesses said the blast had left a hole in the road and shattered glass everywhere. Officials said among the 13 injured were bystanders, a messenger at Taposh's office, a security guard of a nearby bank and Awami League supporters. They were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The MP was relatively unscathed. He suffered some cuts from the broken glass, said his aides. They said he made his way to prime minister Sheikh Hasina's official residence immediately after the blast, although Hasina herself had left for Sweden the day before. Police and Rapid Action Battalion had cleared the crowds and totally sealed the blast site off by around 11pm. Detective Branch police and CID's crime scene unit were gathering evidence. Police said they could not immediately confirm the type of bomb. Police chief Noor Mohammad told reporters: "It was a bomb attack, we are sure of it. We are looking into what kind of bomb it was and who were responsible." Ramna police chief Shibly Noman said Taposh left the prime minister's Hare Road residence for his Dhanmodi home at around 11.45pm under police escort. Acting Awami League president Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury condemned the attack as "brutal and cowardly". "The attack was made upon a lawyer in the Bangabandhu killing case, when the case is on trial in the Appellate Division for final verdict," said Chowdhury. But, she added, the path to final closure in the Sheikh Mujibur Rahman assassination case could not be hampered in any way by such attacks. DMCH officials said the 13 injured in the blast were Abdul Halim, 35, Kamal Haidar, 40, Takim Gazi, 35, Arman Haque, 28, Mohammad Ripon, 27, Masud-Al Mamun, 40, Salauddin Panna, 52, 'Inu', 28, 'Moinuddin', 35, 'Atiq', 30, 'Shahin', 39, Mahfuzur Rahman, 32, and 'Fazlul', 32. As news spread of the bomb attack, Awami League supporters took out protest processions in parts of the city. The ruling party announced countrywide protest rallies would be held the next day. bdnews24.com/c
