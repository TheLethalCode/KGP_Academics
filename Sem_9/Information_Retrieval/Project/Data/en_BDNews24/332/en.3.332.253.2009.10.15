<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP will convene national council on Dec 8 after a 16-year hiatus. It will be the fifth council of the party founded on Sep 1, 1978 by military strongman General Ziaur Rahman. The National Standing Committee, the highest policymaking forum of the main opposition party, made the decision on Thursday, joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told waiting reporters at around 11:30pm. He said chairperson Khaleda Zia has been made the head of the council preparation committee, the first time she will oversee the lead-up to the council. Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, now expelled from the party, had been made the chairperson to BNP's last council preparation committee. The meeting started on 9pm at Khaleda's political office in Gulshan. The party held its previous council on Sept 1, 1993 at Manik Miah Avenue in the capital. Khaleda and late Abdus Salam Talukder had been elected the chairperson and secretary general, respectively. In addition, elections steering committee with T H Khan as president and 11 council preparation sub-committees have been formed, Khan said. Names of heads and members of the committees will be notified later, he added. But, a member who attended the meeting told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity that ASM Hannan Shah has been made the chief of the discipline sub-committee. Nazrul Islam Khan will head the draft constitution formulation committee and joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy will direct the publication sub-committee. "All preparations will be taken up to make the council a success. All district-wise councils will have been completed by Nov 25." "In addition, a constitution amendment committee has also been formed to amend the (party's) constitution." BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmad, M Shamsul Islam and Mahbubur Rahman attended it. BNP must submit their permanent ratified constitution within 12 months of the start of parliament to be registered with the Election Commission, according to the 1972 Representation of Public Order (Second Amendment) Bill-2009. An earlier deadline had allowed six months ending on July 24 this year, as the ninth parliament went into its maiden session on Jan 25, 2009. A total of 39 political parties were provisionally registered with draft constitutions ahead of the Dec 2008 elections. Of them, 33 parties including ruling Awami League completed their registration process by submitting their final constitutions to the EC by July 24. The rest, including BNP, appealed to the EC for extension of the deadline citing their inability to hold party councils and ratify their constitutions within the stipulated time. The new provision says that registration will be scrapped if the deadline is not met. bdnews2
