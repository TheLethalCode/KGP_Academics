<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday granted BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy interim bail in a wealth related case. The HC bench of justices Md Abdul Wahab Miah and Md Abdur Razzak gave the order on a bail petition submitted by the BNP leader. It also issued a rule nisi to the government and the Anticorruption Commission asking them to explain why Roy should not be given permanent bail. TH Khan and Nitai Chandra Roy stood for the BNP leader in the hearing. The Dhaka Special Judge's Court No 3 ordered the BNP leader to be sent to jail on Oct 12 nine months after the case was filed. The ACC originally filed the case against Goyeshwar, with Ramna Police Station on Jan 5, on charges of accumulating illegal wealth totalling Tk 2.68 crore and hiding information in a wealth statement to the graft watchdog. Goyeshwar surrendered before the High Court on March 9 and sought anticipatory bail. The HC granted him bail until submission of a charge sheet, which was submitted on July 5. On Aug 16, the HC ordered the BNP leader to show up before the Special Judge's Court within eight weeks after the defence requested a bail extension. bdnews24
