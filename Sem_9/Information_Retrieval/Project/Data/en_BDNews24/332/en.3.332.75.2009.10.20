<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)The 1997 peace agreement in the Chittagong Hill Tracts will be fully implemented before the government runs its term in line with the campaign pledge, the state minister for CHT affairs said Tuesday. "We have already reconstituted various committees, which have also started work," Dipankar Talukder told reporters at the Secretariat. The peace accord has not been implemented for 12 years because of the ruling parties' opposition, Jyotirindra Bodhipriya aka Santu Larma, chairman of Chittagong Regional Council, had alleged a day before. Talukder earlier met with CHT Land Commission chairman Khademul Chowdhury and Larma at the Secretariat. Talks have been held on the law and order to make headway with the initiatives there, he said. Asked if the law and order improved after partial army withdrawal from CHT, the state minister said: "There has not been any deterioration. The law and order is now stable though we cannot say it has improved." Six months into office, the Awami League-led government decided on July 29 to withdraw a complete brigade, including 35 camps and three infantry battalions, from the three hills districts. He slammed the BNP-led four-party alliance's criticism over the army withdrawal. "BNP and Jamaat have been making a hue and cry over the withdrawal of the army. But 82 temporary camps were withdrawn during their stint (2001-2006)." "Efforts were made then to spark off communal clashes. They are now mum," he said, referring to the 2001-06 BNP-led government. "According to ISPR, 63 temporary camps were removed only in 2004." Pointing out that there is no precedent of having two cantonments in a district, the junior minister said, "But, there are six cantonments in Chittagong Hill Tracts." Chittagong Hill Tracts consists of Bandarban, Rangamati and Khagrachhari districts. The 1996-2001 Awami League government struck the peace deal on Dec 2, 1997, ending a decades-long bush war between the army and Shanti Bahini militia led by Santu Larma. bdnews24
