 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman on Tuesday called upon political parties to "set their differences aside" and work together for the national good. The president made the call, at the inauguration of Jagannath University Day at Osmani Memorial Hall Auditorium, with a backdrop of bitter disputes and non-cooperation between the country's ruling and opposition parties. "We know that in a democracy differing ideals exist between political parties, which constitutes the beauty of democracy," said the president in his address as chancellor of the university. "But in the greater interests of the nation and the people, political parties should set their differences aside and promote national issues together." "I hope," Zillur said emphatically, "that political parties will all extend a helping hand to the cause of creating a proper democratic environment in the country by practicing tolerance and upholding the spirit of cooperation." Mentioning the vital role of a university in moulding and grooming a nation, the president said, "The country's universities will have to play a more responsible role in implementing prime minister Sheikh Hasina's 'Vision 2021'." "The young students and researchers of this university will surely play a significant role in taking the country forward by fully realising the potentials of their merit and intellect." The president expressed hope that concerned ministries and organisations would also come forward in giving all support to the country's institutions of higher learning. Jagannath University Day is being observed for the first time this year since the previous college was established as a public university four years ago. President Zillur Rahman, as ex-officio chancellor, inaugurated the day's programmes as chief guest. The prime minister's adviser Prof Alauddin Ahmed, Jagannath University vice chancellor Prof Mesbahudin Ahmed, proctor Kazi Asaduzzaman, science faculty dean Prof Shahidul Islam and others spoke at the inaugural event. Also marking the day, a colourful rally was brought out at noon from the University campus in the older part of the city by the Jagannath University authorities, teachers, students and employees. The educational establishment, situated in the south of the capital near the Buriganga river, has a history going back a century and a half, when the Dhaka Brahma School was first founded there in 1863. The school gradually transformed into Jagannath College and in 2005 became the Jagannath University of today. bdnews
