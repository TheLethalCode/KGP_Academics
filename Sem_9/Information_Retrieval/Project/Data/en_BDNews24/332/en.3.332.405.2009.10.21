 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog on Wednesday recommended recovery of Tk 16 crore from former chairman and other top officials of the Anticorruption Commission for their "unauthorised" spending during the military-installed interim regime. The parliamentary standing committee on Public Undertaking said the top ACC officials paid its lawyers Tk 10 crore in violation of the rules, said Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, the committee chairman. He said the ACC, headed by former army chief Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, also spent Tk 6 crore unlawfully for spying. "The committee has recommended realising the money from the former chairman, commissioners, secretary and directors general of the Anticorruption Commission under the public demand recovery law," Alamgir told reporters after the meeting at parliament's media centre. The chairman said the office of the comptroller and auditor general had detected the "misuse" of money at the ACC. Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury resigned on April 2, three months after the Awami League won the Dec 29 general elections. Habibur Rahman and Abul Kalam Monjur Mannan are the two ACC commissioners while the then secretary Delwar Hossain is now serving as the Rector of the Public Administration Training Centre in Savar. The ACC has three directors general. The graft watchdog appointed as many as 50 lawyers after the emergency was declared on Jan 11, 2007. The committee chairman earlier alleged that the ACC under Chowdhury paid remuneration higher than the chief justice of the Supreme Court in violation of the government's financial rules. About 200 politicians including the prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition chief Khaleda Zia were arrested on graft charges. Alamgir, a bureaucrat-turned politician, was one of the those arrested for alleged corruption. Politicians from across the divide alleged that the ACC was used as an instrument to purge the politicians and make ways for smooth military rule in future. "The ACC during the emergency rule also accepted financial assistance from the foreign organisations without government approval. "We have also recommended that the government takes legal actions for this unlawful action," said Alamgir. The Public Undertaking committee on April 12 summoned the top officials to appear before the standing committee for clarifying the ACC expenses. The committee on May 2 charged Chowdhury and two commissioners with contempt of parliament as they did not turn up at the meeting. The ACC former secretary Delwar Hossain appeared at the May 2 meeting and apologised for not appearing at April 12 meeting.
