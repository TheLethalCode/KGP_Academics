<TITLE> E-voting to be piloted in DCC Ward 49: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will introduce Electronic Voting on a trial basis in the Dhaka City Corporation elections, election commissioner Muhamad Sohul Hossain said Wednesday. "We've decided to launch the E-voting Pilot Project at Ward 49 in the Dhanmondi area. The next steps would be decided after analysing its success," he told reporters at the EC Secretariat. The EC has already planned to hold the DCC elections in March. The tenure of the DCC mayor and ward commissioners expired in May 2007. Hossain said the elections will take place after updating the current voter list in the city, adding that the new voters will also be able to cast their votes. The number of voters in the DCC area in 2008 was 35 lakh, which has since increased by 2,29,586 new voters. Updating the voter roll will be complete after photo-processing and registration of those new voters. Replying to a question, Hossain said, "The elections will be held according to DCC's existing electoral map; the EC doesn't have any plan to change it. But the LGRD ministry can initiate any changes if they want to." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had said earlier in the month that the EC was considering introducing e-voting in at least one ward on an experimental basis. BUET's Institute of Information and Communication Technology presented its local-made E-Voting equipment to the EC on Oct 6 for future trials. bdn
