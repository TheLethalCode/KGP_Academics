 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Firefighters working relentlessly for three days and two nights at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board's main depot failed again to get at the source of the still burning fire on Tuesday, while officials have said the warehouse was filled haphazardly with too much paper for the volume of storage space. Stacks of wet-packed paper and books were removed throughout Tuesday through the front of the building but the firefighters could not reach the smouldering source of fire in the north-eastern corner of the building. Fire chief Brigadier Abu Nayyim Mohammad Shahidullah told bdnews24.com, "It's been really tough to remove the tonnes of paper crammed into the 1,15,000 square foot room." On the very first day, Sunday, he had said fire fighting efforts were not going smoothly as the warehouse, built in Pakistan times, was not constructed in line with building codes and some two thousand tonnes of books and paper were piled there in an unplanned way. He said the fire would only be completely quenched once all the burning paper at the source and the surrounding stacks were completely removed from the building. Sheikh Mohammad Shahjalal, director (operations) of the fire service, said Tuesday, "It's become almost impossible to remove tonnes of dense-packed stacks of books and papers stuck to the floor and roof due to watering." Officials have said around 800 tonnes of textbooks and printing paper was consumed in the fire, and 12,000 tonnes remained "unscathed". Asked why the place was crammed so full, senior warehouse officer Naism Haider told bdnews24.com, "We had to store the papers this way as the reams of additional, unused paper was excessive this year. We had nowhere else to store it." The cause of the fire is still unknown. A probe committee was formed late Sunday, headed by Razia Begum, additional secretary of the education ministry, and given three days to submit a primary report of their findings on the cause, an estimate of the losses incurred and those responsible, if any. "We're not overlooking any possibility, but nothing can be specified at this preliminary stage of the investigation," Razia told reporters on Monday. Shahjalal also said, "We're not ignoring any possibility." He said the fire may have been caused by someone carelessly throwing cigarettes or matches. "Short-circuits can't be ignored or arson." "The fire may even have been caused spontaneously by high temperatures building up inside the tightly stacked piles of books," he added. However, the state minister for education Motahar Hossain hinted on Monday that the fire might be "an act of sabotage". Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid and his deputy Hossain, however, have sought to assure the public that the government's distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students would be completed on time. bdnews2
