 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and four others have been acquitted of all charges in a corruption case involving the construction of the Bangabandhu Mausoleum. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge ANM Bashirullah gave the acquittal order on Monday based on the final report by Anticorruption Commission deputy director and investigation officer in the case Mohammed Moniruzzaman Khan. The final report of the ACC investigation, that says charges could not be proved, was presented in court on Monday by ACC lawyer AKM Abdus Salam. Others acquitted in the case are former Awami League government's state minister for culture Obaidul Kader, former joint secretary Mohammed Asaduzzaman and architect Iqbal Habib of the firm Vitti Architects. Case details said that Vitti Architects was verbally appointed for the design, modelling and supervision of 'Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Mausoleum Project' before the project was approved by ECNEC. Later, the firm's appointment was confirmed through misuse of power, it was alleged. The case details said a discussion on the construction of the mausoleum was held at Ganobhaban on Nov 7, 1998, presided over by Sheikh Hasina, also Sheikh Mujib's daughter, during her previous term as prime minister. In the discussion, the army's chief engineer reportedly presented the project's model, plan and master plan. Hasina is said to have instructed the project to be implemented under the ADP. The case details said the then culture secretary, army chief engineer and associated consultants held another meeting on Nov 18, 1998, where a draft project summary was presented. According to the project summary, Tk 1554.16 lakh was approved "at an ECNEC meeting on Nov 25". ACC's investigations later showed that the consulting firm was appointed breaking all rules and regulation and through abuse of power. The fee of the appointed firm was supposed to be cleared from the 'Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Trust. But the fee of Tk 41.84 lakh was cleared from the project's allocated funds breaking all rules and regulations, the case alleged. The case was filed in the tenure of last BNP-Jamat coalition government by then ACC deputy director Manjur Morshed. The investigating officer in the final report mentions that even though rules and regulations had been "manoeuvred past", the four should be acquitted as no evidence of criminal intent or illegal financial benefits were found during the investigation. bdn
