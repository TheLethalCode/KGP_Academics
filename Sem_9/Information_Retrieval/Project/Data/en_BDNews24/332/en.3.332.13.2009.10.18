 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has upheld the High Court's decision to stay the Niko corruption case filed against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. A five member Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, dismissed the Anticorruption Commission's leave to appeal, filed on Oct 15, 2008, in response to a July 7, 2008, stay order on the proceedings by the High Court. The High Court stayed the proceedings of the graft case on July 7 last year on petitions by Hasina challenging the legality of the case. The High Court also issued a rule nisi asking the ACC to show cause for not dropping the proceedings. The Appellate Division upheld the High Court stays on Aug 13 that year, on a counter-appeal by the ACC against the stay orders. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year against seven people including Hasina. The commission later pressed charges against a total of nine. The case alleged that the state suffered losses of Tk 13,630.50 crore under Hasina's previous term as prime minister through mismanagement of the Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields including handing them to inexpert Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd without tender. b
