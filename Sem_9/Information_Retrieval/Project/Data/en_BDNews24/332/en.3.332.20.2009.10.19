 Bandarban, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)Police said they had arrested 28 Rohingyas from Myanmar in Bandarban district on Sunday night for "suspicious movement", amid reports of tension along the border of the two neighbouring countries. Roangchhari Police Station's officer-in-charge Mohammad Mohiuddin told bdnews24.com, "Among the detainees, 15 Rohingyas were arrested from Roangchhari Bazar, as their movement was suspicious." Mohiuddin said they confessed to being Myanmar nationals. But they said they entered Bangladesh, which is already burdened with over 400,000 Rohingya refugees fleeing religious and ethnic persecution and discrimination in Myanmar, through Naikkhangchari border in search of jobs. The remaining arrests were made at Lama and Alikadam upazilas. The Myanmar junta denies the Muslim minority Rohingya population citizenship and property rights in their own country. bdnews2
