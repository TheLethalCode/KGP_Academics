<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The chairman of Transcom Group, editor of leading Bangla daily Prothom Alo and an associate editor of the publication have filed separate general diaries with the police to ensure their personal safety, reportedly fearing "harmful actions" by Bashundhara Group. A statement released by the newspaper Monday said that Latifur Rahman, chairman of Transcom Group that owns Prothom Alo, the Alo's publisher and editor Matiur Rahman and associate editor Mizanur Rahman Khan filed the GDs with Tejgaon, Shahbagh and Gulshan police. The GD complaints stated that Bashundhara Group had published advertisements in several national dailies between Oct 13 and Oct 18 as well circulated pamphlets as a part of a propaganda campaign against Prothom Alo. "It even filed a false GD and tried to sue us on charges of defamation," reads the statement. The statement also said the behaviour of Bashundhara Group, after two reports were published by Prothom Alo on Oct 12 and Oct 13, indicated its intent for "harmful actions in future". The GD filed by Matiur Rahman said that the owners of Bashundhara Group were "well-known" for their misdeeds. Meanwhile, the author of the Prothom Alo reports, Mizanur Rahman Khan, in his GD with Shahbagh police, said that on Oct 14 four unidentified men looked for him at the Supreme Court premises. One of them also misbehaved with Khan's driver, according to the complaint. Transcom Group chairman Latifur Rahman stated in his complaint that a GD filed by the Basundhara Group on Oct 14, accusing him of being involved in setting fire to the Bashundhara City shopping in March, was "totally false, baseless, intentional and of course, a conspiracy". Rahman, in his GD complaint filed with Gulshan police, also said he feared harmful actions by the owner of Bashundhara Group Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, alias Shah Alam, or his family members. The Bashundhara Group filed its GD last Wednesday (Oct 14) against eight people including the editors and publishers of Prothom Alo and Shamokal newspapers. The complaint said the accused were involved in setting fire to Bashundhara City on Mar 13. The fire left seven people dead and gutted the top floors of the mall's office tower. On Oct 15, Bashundhara Group also filed a defamation suit against Prothom Alo. The lawsuit, which was rejected by a Dhaka court the same day, claimed that two reports published in the popular daily had caused the complainant's organisation Tk 500 crore in losses.
