 Sylhet, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)--At least 20 people were injured on Saturday as Bangladesh Chhatra League attacked a programme to mark the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty at Fenchuganj in Sylhet. Fenchuganj Upazila Primary Teachers' Association's general secretary Abdul Awal, local BCL leaders Mizanur Rahman, Abdur Noor, Shamsul Islam, 'Mohsin', Muhid Hasan, village watchman Abdur Rahman, Noorjahan Akhtar, Nazmin Begum and Rahmatunnessa were among those injured. They were treated at Fenchuganj Upazila Health Complex. The names of the other injured were not available immediately. Seven people were scheduled to address the ceremony, but former general secretary Joynal Abedin wanted to speak, a local journalist said. Fenchuganj Upazila chairman Saifullah Al Hossain allowed him to speak. Abedin later demanded that five of his men addressed the programme, he said. However, Hossain did not respond to their demand at that time and BCL men started hurling chairs, the journalist also said. Police later brought the situation under control. Officer in charge at Fenchuganj Police Station Iqbal Hayat said some BCL activists went on the rampage after a heated argument with Abedin. He said assistant superintendent of police (circle) Milu Miah visited the scene. A conciliatory meeting between Fenchuganj and South Surma Upazila chairmen, and local Awami League and BCL leaders was held in the presence of the Fenchuganj Upazila Nirbahi officer, the police officer said. Both sides promised not to file any cases against each another, he added. bdnews2
