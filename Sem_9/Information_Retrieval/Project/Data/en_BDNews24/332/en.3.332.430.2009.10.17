 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)Communist Party of Bangladesh general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim has stressed the need for a change to society that helps to generate poverty. "It is not possible to eradicate poverty without changing the social system that produces poverty," he said in his address at a rally marking International Day for the Eradication of Poverty at the Central Shaheed Minar on Saturday. "Of the total 32 ministries of the incumbent government, 31 generate poverty; only one ministry is engaged in removing poverty," Selim said. The CPB leader said: "We will not be able to develop the social system if we do not come out of the economic system." The government will have to move to amend the constitution if needed, he said. Justice Golam Rabani said that it is unfortunate that Bangladesh could not eradicate poverty 38 years after independence. "We have to see why it was not possible for long. We have to launch another war to eradicate poverty," he said. Awami League central leader Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin MP said the government was relentlessly working to eradicate poverty after taking office. He stressed the need for concerted effort to fight poverty. Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal president Hasanul Haque Inu asked the government to launch programmes to remove poverty. Anti-poverty Stage, an organisation, formed with 16 NGOs, organised the programme. Organisation convener Mohsin Ali presided over the programme. Among those who spoke in the programme were MPs Fazle Hossain Badshah, Sanzida Haque and UN's Salil Shetty
