<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has appointed two amici curiae to advise it about two writ petitions filed challenging the legality of the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury issued the appointment of T H Khan and barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud on Monday. The final hearing on the writ petitions is set to take place on Oct 22. The court asked the government to submit its statement, if any, on the petitions by Oct 20. On Aug 9, advocate Tajul Islam and Badiuzzaman Khan, a CHT inhabitant, separately petitioned the High Court seeking ban on partial pullout of troops from Chittagong Hill Tracts. They had earlier filed two petitions challenging the legality of the peace accord. They appealed for a halt to the army withdrawal fearing the recent pullout would void the earlier petition. The government in late July announced a partial withdrawal of troops from the three hilly districts last month as part of its move to implement the 1997 CHT Peace Accord, which ended decades-long bush war, to bring stability to the long-troubled region. The government has since wrapped up several temporary army camps from the region amid some protests from Bengali settlers in the indigenous Chakma-dominated region. The High Court on Aug 16 directed the government to temporarily suspend withdrawal of troops until Aug 19 following their petitions. The order was lifted on Aug 19. The court in its Aug 19 ruling said the pullout was not made suddenly. The recent pullout was the latest in a series of the last nine years' process of deploying and withdrawing troops. The government had so far withdrawn 200 army camps in many phases  63 in 2004 and 48 in 2007. Recently it has decided to withdraw 35 camps. There will be 300 temporary army camps and six permanent cantonments. Rangamati Parbatya Zila Parishad Law (Rangamati, Bandarban and Khagrachhari) and Parbatya Chattgram Regional Council were formed in 1998 after the signing of peace accord. b
