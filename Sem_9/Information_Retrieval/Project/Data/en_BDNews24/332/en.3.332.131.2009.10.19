 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Monday ordered the government to explain why former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu should not be granted bail in the explosives case regarding the grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. The bench of justices Syed Mohammed Dastagir Hossain and Mohammed Roisuddin made the order on hearing a bail petition filed by Pintu. The government has two weeks to answer the rule nisi. Advocate Khandaker Mahbub Hosain stood for Pintu while additional attorney general AKM Zahirul Haque represented the state at the hearing. Haque told bdnews24.com: "The court did not grant Pintu bail, only issued rule nisi." The court on Oct 13 directed the government and the jail authorities to question the ex-BNP deputy minister at jail gate and asked the authorities to make arrangements for his treatment. Dhaka's Third Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Oct 11 gave the CID police another three days to question Pintu. Pintu was arrested on Jan 17, 2008 in the case. On Aug 16, judge Masder Hossain ordered the case proceedings to be transferred to two trial courts as new investigations would take the trial period over the 135 work days, stipulated by the speedy trial tribunal. The past BNP-led government has been accused of attempting to derail investigations immediately after the grenade attack in 2004. The Criminal Investigation Department pressed charges in the killing and explosives cases on June 11 last year. The proceedings of the murder and explosives cases were running concurrently until their recent transfers. Some 61 among 412 witnesses have so far testified. They include president Zillur Rahman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina, home minister Sahara Khatun and AL's former general secretary Abdul Jalil. At least 24 people were killed and scores injured in the series of grenade blasts on an anti-terrorism rally near the Awami League's headquarters at Bangabandhu Avenue in capital Dhaka. bdne
