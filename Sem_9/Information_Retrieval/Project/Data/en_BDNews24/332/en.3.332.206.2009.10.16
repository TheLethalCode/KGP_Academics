<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed has said that the Anticorruption Commission had filed many cases violating law in their own interests during the caretaker government. "There is no point blaming the judicial system if laws are not properly applied in filing cases. Our judicial system is going on well," he said, in answer to a reporters' query at the Secretariat on Thursday. ACC chairman Golam Rahman on Wednesday blamed the existing judicial system for its cases being stayed in the High Court. As a European Union human rights delegation met with him at his office in the afternoon, Ahmed had responded to Rahman's criticism and said "The Commission has made mistake in the executing of laws." "Cases in higher courts were stayed for not following the due processes of law." Golam Rahman said at a news conference marking his three months in office the same day: "None can be termed guilty or corrupt unless they are proved so in the court according to law." "But the issue of corruption is not being proved in the court. So, there are not many corrupt people in the country. The country will not be purged of corruption unless the court punishes the corrupt." He called on the judges to take the issue into their cognisance and said, "Corruption will continue to pervade society if judges are not tough against the corrupt." "It won't be possible to remove corruption if the judicial system is not reformed in line with the reality," the graft watchdog chief said. "If the judges are not tough against the corrupt people they would continue to commit more corruption under the umbrella of law." The incumbent government formed a committee in March to reform the laws governing the graft watchdog. The amended recommendations were sent to the ACC recently. Rahman said several thousand cases initiated by the former Bureau of Anticorruption and the present ACC still remained pending for investigation and trial. Investigation of several thousand allegations are still under process, he added. He put emphasis on curbing corruption at higher levels and said," "It is not possible to prevent high-level corruption without a strong political will." The ACC boss alleged that the government was clipping the wings of the ACC, reducing some of its powers, in phases. "After making the Anticorruption Commission a 'tiger without teeth', the process is underway to cut the nails from its claws," he said. The government has taken initiatives to strengthen Human Rights Commission and Anticorruption Commission, law minister Ahmed said Wednesday as the delegation asked him about the ACC's stalled cases in the court. "A screening committee has been working to appoint six commissioners to the Human Rights Commission. The Anticorruption Commission has been working independently." "To strengthen the ACC further, the government will reform laws and enact new laws if needed." About the government steps to protect human rights, he said, "There is a provision for protection of human rights in the constitution of Bangladesh .The government is very sincere about their implementation." Earlier on Thursday, the minister presided over an inter-ministerial meeting on the development of National Eidgah Maidan, Dhaka at his ministry's conference room. The meeting decided to build a sewerage system to drain out rainwater. The Public Works Department has been asked to implement the decisions ahead of imminent Eid-Ul-Azha. State minister for religion Mohammad Shahjahan Miah, state minister for law Mohammad Kamrul Islam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal, including representatives from the Supreme Court, Public Works Department, Dhaka City Corporation and other ministries concerned, among others were present at the meeting. bd
