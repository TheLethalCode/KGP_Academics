 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) Local and foreign plots were involved in the killing of president and independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, a defence counsel said on Thursday. "It is questionable whether Bazlul Huda was present during the killing," barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, who delivered his arguments on the appeal by death convict retired Major Bazlul Huda, told reporters about the first day's arguments on appeals in the Bangabandhu murder case. "Though he was called a killer, apparently he was innocent. "If Bangabandhu were alive Bangladesh would be more prosperous. The country would have reached the level of Malaysia. "He (Bangabandhu) is the father of the nation. He had taught us how to struggle. Bangladesh became independent under his leadership." Mamun continued: "Nobody was supposed to have the courage to kill such a personality like Bangabandhu without covering his face. "The complainant in his statement said the convicts had come in Khaki dress. "Chief security officer, divisional superintendent of police Nurul Islam said the convicts had their mouths covered by black cloths. "But the matter was ignored in the rulings of the High Court and trial court. "The two High Court judges avoided the issue while examining the issues related to Bazlul Huda. This is against justice," barrister Mamun said. The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing arguments on the appeals for the first day on Thursday. The hearing that started at 9:37am ended at 1:30pm. Barrister Mamun said at the hearing that there were 1,000 rounds of bullets at Bangabandhu's house on the night of the event. "The assailants could have been resisted with them for several hours. But army member Kuddus, who was deployed in that house, did not find any bullet," he said. "Where had the bullets gone? Another witness, habildar Abdul Gani, said that convict Abdul Ohab Zoarder took away the old bullets saying new bullets would be supplied." The court asked Mamun since the bullets were not in the house there was no point to use them. The court told the lawyer that his statement was self contradictory. "Do such arguments take place in the Appellate Division? Why are you referring these issues here?" it asked. Mamun in his reply said: "I want to show that Huda was not present there." Mamun said: "Witness Kuddus in his statement said he had come to Bangabandhu's house at 5am. He came one hour earlier as Bangabandhu was supposed to join a function at Dhaka University on Aug 15. "Chief security guard Abul Bashar said he was not officially informed that Bangabandhu had a schedule to join the programme. He came to know about that after seeing the newspaper." Mamun said what was assumed to be true about the presence of Bazlul Huda in that house might not be the case actually. The court said plaintiff Mohitul Islam and DSP Nurul Islam in their testimony said they had seen Huda firing on Sheikh Kamal. Mamun replied that there was difference between their statements. "One said that the army members wearing Khaki dresses had shot Sheikh Kamal and another said members with black dresses shot Kamal. "Sheikh Kamal addressing the army members as 'brothers' had asked them to get in the house. "Mohitul Islam told them Kamal was the son of Bangabandhu. Then they shot Kamal. Kamal fell down under Mohitul. They shot Mohitul and the DSP in their legs. They again shot at Kamal. Mamun said: "There was discrepancy between the testimonies of the witness about the accounts on the firing of gunshots. "From this it can be said that Bazlul Huda was not present there. "Mohitul Islam in his statement said he was introduced to Bazlul Huda at Aricha ferry terminal in 1973. Huda came to Bangabandhu's house to monitor the works of the army members deployed there." Mamun said: "Bazlul Huda was a junior officer in the army. It was not easy to remember him after a day's introduction. "Twenty one years after the incident the case was filed in 1996. Plaintiff Mohitul Islam gave his testimony two years later. It is simply fictitious to give testimony that Bazlul Huda had fired shot after so many years." The court questioned why these issues were not mentioned at the trial court. Mamun in his reply said the trial was held in Huda's absence. The lawyer appointed by the state for Huda was changed thrice, he said. Chief public prosecutor Anisul Haque at the start of Thursday's hearing drew the court's attention on the briefing given by barrister Mamun. Mamun on Wednesday told reporters that he was not allowed to read the complete ruling of the third judge. The court sought explanation from Mamun but he did not give any. Before he finished his presentation the court ended the day's hearing. Mamun would resume on Sunday. Earlier on Wednesday, the bench concluded the hearings on rulings given by previous judges on the case. Mamun on Wednesday finished reading out from the ruling given by a third High Court judge, Justice Mohammed Fazlul Karim. He said: "The third judge in his ruling said though the crime of killing Bangabandhu along with his family falls in the nature of rebellion, emotion is not influenced by the nature of crime. "We won't ever know that whether anybody else except the convicts had any links to the killing of Bangabandhu and his family members. "So the evidence on record of the case should be analysed with caution, the judge said," according to Mamun. "The ruling said most witnesses had testified against the accused. We should be cautions to find out the crime of the real criminals doubtlessly. "The statements of Lt Col Syed Faruk Rahman and Lt Col Sultan Shariar Rashid Khan have been kept out of consideration. The two judges in their split verdict could not be unanimous that their confessional statements were true and voluntary. "The statement of Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery) was proved true and voluntary. So the statement will go against him. "But his statement involving Maj Ahmed Shariful Hossain, Captain Kismat Hashem and Captain Nazmul Hosain Ansar was not proved. "Since the prosecution failed to prove allegations against them, the three convicts have been acquitted. "The trial court verdict of awarding death sentence to Lt Col Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery), Captain Abdul Mazed and Risalder Moslem Uddin was right. Their death reference has been accepted." Chief public prosecutor advocate Anisul Haque told reporters after Wednesday's ruling that the Appellate Division had granted 'leave to appeal' on five points. All convicts will be allowed to give their statements on four points while they will be able to give separate statements on the fifth point. The court told the defence that one lawyer would be allowed to place his presentation on the matter. The defence would inform the court whether they would deliver statements together or separately. Haque said the third judge had decided that 12 convicts should be executed on seeing law, statements and evidence. "In the evidence on record in the ruling of the third judge it was said that after the then army chief Gen Shafiullah had gone to radio station Khandaker Mustaque Ahmed told him, 'You have done a job'." "But Gen Shafiullah said that he did not do that job." Barrister Mamun said though there were discussions only over six convicts in the ruling of the third judge the decision was made on 15 convicts. As the third judge did not consider the testimony of all witnesses, the convicts were deprived of justice, he said. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
