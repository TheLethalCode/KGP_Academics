 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)A mobile court has filed cases against 22 shop owners for using banned non-biodegradable polythene bags in the capital's Mohammadpur area, in the first move of its kind since 2007. The Department of Environment said in a statement Monday that the mobile court also awarded on-the-spot fines to the shop owners amounting to Tk 1.32 lakh and confiscated a huge amount of the banned poly bags. DoE Dhaka divisional office director Jamshed Ahmed led the drive, accompanied by executive magistrate Babul Mia, at Krishi Market in Mohammadpur. The DoE's technical director, Md Shahjahan Mia, talking to bdnews24.com on Aug. 11 had said that the government was set to crackdown again on the producers and users of the environmental menace. In 2002, the government banned production, use and display of 'thin' polythene bags of the type that are still widely found in shops and markets throughout Bangladesh, resulting in clogged drainage system, rivers and other environmental degradation. A dedicated mobile court drive against polythene came to halt, however, after the caretaker administration's separation of the judiciary in Nov 2007, which left the mobile court system, headed by executive magistrates, in disarray. Shahjahan Mia had said a recent Awami League-led government decision to kick-start mobile court drives would add much needed impetus to environmental protection initiatives. bdn
