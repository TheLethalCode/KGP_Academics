<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court reprimanded the defence counsel for his irrelevant presentation and wrong media briefing at the third day's hearing of arguments on Monday. The five-judge Appellate Division bench, headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam, ended the hearing of arguments on appeals by death convicts in the Bangabandhu assassination at around 1:30pm. The third day's arguments, that began at 9:42am, took the appeals proceedings into its 11th day. The top court rebuked barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, the counsel for death convict retired Major Bazlul Huda, for his media briefing on the hearings. "You told the media we (the court) are obstructing you from presenting arguments. We asked you not to deliver same points over and over again. "We did not obstruct you. You should not make such comments to the media," the court said. Mamun apologised for his remarks. The court said: "You have annoyed us and delivered irrelevant statements. Give your deliberations on legal points." The court said it had heard many arguments since 1969, but no like the ones of Mamun. The lawyer was advised to take preparations before his presentations. "You should not present such statements before the highest court." On Mamun's claim that his client, retired Maj Bazlul Huda, was involved in the case for conspiracy, the court said: "The arguments you have delivered did not have any relation with conspiracies." "You will have to know the related regulations of Evidence Act to present deliberations on the matter." The court at Sunday's hearing had granted Mamun half an hour to deliver one of the five arguments fixed in the leave to appeal. The court reminded the lawyer the same at Monday's hearing. But he could not finish his arguments. The court asked him to finish his arguments by Tuesday and said if he failed to finish his arguments, another lawyer would be told to present his arguments. It said: "We think you are done with presenting your arguments on Bazlul Huda." "Perhaps, you have not have studied the evidence. The less you speak the better for us." Mamun said: "Nuruddin, who was present in Bangabandhu's house that night, was not made a witness. The verdict of the trial court was not right." The court said no leave to appeal was granted on the ground that the verdict was not right. Mamun said: "Since the court gave the benefit of doubt in the testimony given by defendant Abdul Wahab Zoarder the trial court acquitted him." "But Bazlul Huda was not given any chance though his condition was similar," he said. Mamun told reporters after Monday's hearing he had presented before the court many irrelevances of the statements given by the witnesses. Separate trials would be held for separate killings regarding the Aug 15,1975 event. The verdict on the murder case will be revoked, he said. The court said it was not mentioned in the order of the leave to appeal, the lawyer said. At Sunday's hearing, Mamun had questioned the role of the then army chief K M Shafiullah and air force chief A K Khandker on Aug 15, 1975. The top court during Thursday's arguments on appeals heard that both local and foreign machinations were involved in the killing of then president and independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Earlier on Wednesday, the bench concluded the hearings on rulings given by previous judges on the case. The freshly formed bench began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, president Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdnews2
