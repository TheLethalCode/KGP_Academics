<TITLE> 30pc of new voters in Cox's Bazar could be Rohingya: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Cox's Bazar, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission thinks that 30 per cent of new voters in Cox's Bazar district, added during recent voter list updates, may be illegal Rohingya refugees. "It's essential to re-identify the voters in four upazilas in the district," M Sakhawat Hossain said on Sunday in Cox's Bazar, where thousands of Myanmar's Muslim minority Rohingyas, fleeing religious and ethnic persecution in their country, are living illegally outside official refugee camps. The commissioner also said they had information that two in-laws of ruling party MP Abdur Rahim Badi of Ukhia upazila are exercising influence to enable Rohingyas to become registered voters in Bangladesh. Ukhia upazila Awami League president and some other leaders are also involved, Sakhawat added. In the recently updated voter roll, the number of voters increased by 10 percent in one upazila, which is unusual, said the election commissioner. "The incidence gave rise to suspicion that Rohinyas might have been included in the roll," he said. "Whoever is involved in the process, step will be taken against them," Hossain said. He instructed officials concerned to take necessary action. He also said the EC was thinking of holding elections to union parishads between March and May. bdnew
