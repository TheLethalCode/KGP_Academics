 NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Virender Sehwag has been recalled to the India squad on Thursday following shoulder surgery for the first two games of a one-day series against Australia later this month, though Rahul Dravid was dropped. Sehwag missed the Twenty20 World Cup, and the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa while recovering from the surgery. Dravid had been recalled to the one-day squad for the Champions Trophy to bolster the injury-hit side, though he joined struggling pace bowler Rudra Pratap Singh and all-rounder Yusuf Pathan on Thursday as being unwanted by the selectors. Batsman Yuvraj Singh, who missed the Champions Trophy with a broken finger, was named in the 15-player squad in the hope he would be fit to start the seven-match series, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a release. Uncapped 22-year-old pace bowler Sudeep Tyagi was also included after some good domestic performances for Uttar Pradesh. The first match will be played in Baroda on Oct. 25 and the second in Nagpur on Oct. 28. Squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (captain), Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Ravindra Jadeja, Harbhajan Singh, Ashish Nehra, Praveen Kumar, Ishant Sharma, Virat Kohli, Amit Mishra, Munaf Patel, Sudeep Tyagi. b
