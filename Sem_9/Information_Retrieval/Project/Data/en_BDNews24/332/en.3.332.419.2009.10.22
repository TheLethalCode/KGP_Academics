 WELLINGTON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand Cricket officials have taken the unusual step of reaffirming Andy Moles' position as national coach after local media reported his position was in jeopardy. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan responded to newspaper reports by releasing a statement on Thursday confirming Moles remained in charge of the team and was preparing them for their upcoming series against Pakistan. However, Vaughan also hinted that changes may be possible after saying officials were planning to conduct a thorough review of the team. "Following the Blackcaps' return from Sri Lanka and the Champions Trophy we are undertaking a review of the team's performance," Vaughan said. "This looks at all aspects of individual and collective performance with a view to continuous improvement." Vaughan's comments followed newspaper reports that unnamed senior players had wanted Moles removed from his job. A former English County batsman, Moles succeeded John Bracewell last year as New Zealand coach.
