<TITLE> SQ Chy seeks HC bail in defamation case </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury sought bail at the High Court on Wednesday after a Thakurgaon court had issued an arrest warrant against him earlier in the week in a defamation case. The case is one of a number of similar cases filed by individuals in different parts of the country after Chowdhury made certain "derogatory comments" about the late Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in August. The bench of justices F F M Abdur Rahman and Md Imdadul Haque Azad is likely to hear the bail petition later in the day, Chowdhury's lawyer Manjurul Haque told bdnews24.com. Thakurgaon's chief judicial magistrate Ashiqur Rahman issued an arrest warrant against the BNP leader on Oct 18 after a case was filed against him in the district accusing him of defaming the name of Sheikh Mujib. Chowdhury in a discussion at National Press Club on Aug 13 this year had said that the Aug 15, 1975 assassination of independence architect Sheikh Mujib and his family members, was "inevitable". He secured anticipatory bail from the High Court on Sept 17 in a separate defamation suit regarding the same comment. A Tangail court on Sept 10 had issued a previous arrest warrant against the senior BNP leader on the same charges. Chowdhury also faces similar charges in Magura, Khulna and Narail courts. bdne
