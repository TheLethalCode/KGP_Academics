 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The government will formulate laws to ensure the rights of the people with disabilities, the prime minister said on Monday. The disabled people would give their opinions in the formulation of laws, Sheikh Hasina said in her address at the fifth National Convention of the People with Disabilities at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. She said the state would have to acknowledge the disabled people. "They will be given proper training to make them assets and will be involved with the government's development projects," she said. The prime minister mentioned people with disabilities who went on to become famous artists and scientists in the world. "The disabled can prove themselves successful in any sector if they are provided proper education and training." She asked the government educational institutions to ensure enrolment of the disabled children. Hasina said there was no complete data on the number of disabled people in Bangladesh. A study conducted by National Disabled Forum and Handicapped International in 2005 said that there were about 84 lakh people with disabilities in the country. Prime minister Hasina said the quota was being reserved for the disabled in employment and steps were taken to appoint the vision impaired people in resource schools. Arrangements would also be made to preserve quotas for them in primary schools and they would also be given proper training in sports, she said. To disabled people Hasina said: "Don't think that you are helpless. You will have to move forward defying all hurdles. The government is with you." She asked all to come forward with rehabilitation and development of the disabled people. Social welfare minister Enamul Haque Mostafa Shahid and Bangladesh Economic Association president Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, among others, also spoke. bd
