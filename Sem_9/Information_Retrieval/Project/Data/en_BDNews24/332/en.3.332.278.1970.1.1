 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun said the shooting of a government official in his car in broad daylight on Tuesday, within yards of a police station and the home minister's own residence, was a "rare" but serious occurrence. Forty-year-old Fazle Rabbi Mohammad Morshed, executive engineer of the family planning directorate, was shot at around 9:20am in front of the Imperial Guest House near Tejgaon Police Station. Home minister Sahara Khatun lives near the spot. "It's a rare incident. But the criminals will have to face the law," she told reporters at the Secretariat on hearing the news of the armed attack so near her home. Tejgaon police chief Mahbubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that Fazle Rabbi was on his way to work from his Tejkunipara residence. "The assailants shot at him through the open window of his car that was stuck in a traffic jam in one of the capital's busiest areas," said Rahman. One of the two men, who waylaid and shot the engineer, was caught and arrested by a police patrol with the help of people on the street. The detained suspect, Rakib, in his early 20s, had been injured as the police fired four to five rounds of bullets to stop the assailants. Rakib's companion escaped. Police recovered a firearm and two bullets from him. Four bullets were fired from the gun. Rakib claimed a man named 'Joy' had paid him and his associate Tk 10,000 to shoot the government official, the police chief said. The injured engineer, shot it in the buttock, was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Police initially speculated the incident might have occurred in connection with a public tender. One of Fazle Rabbi's brothers, however, said there was conflict regarding some family land at Gazipur. Tajgaon police chief Rahman said they were investigating the shooting. Sub inspector Abdul Jalil filed a case under the Arms Act and Fazle Rabbi's mother filed another for attempted murder. bdnews24.
