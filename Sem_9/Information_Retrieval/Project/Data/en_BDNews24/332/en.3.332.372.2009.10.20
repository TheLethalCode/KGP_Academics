<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan captain Younus Khan withdrew his resignation on Monday after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said they wanted him to continue leading the national side at least until 2011. "I am obviously very happy that the board has again reposed confidence in me and asked me to continue on. The way the people have supported me throughout this issue I will have to work harder now to satisfy them," Younus told Reuters. Younus, 31, tendered his resignation last week in protest at match-fixing allegations against the team, although sources said there were other issues behind the decision. Younus said he would meet with PCB chairman Ejaz Butt in the next few days to discuss plans for the future. "I feel honored because leading the national team is a matter of pride," he said. "My effort will be to ensure we continue our good progress on coming tours to New Zealand and Australia." Earlier, Butt told a news conference that the PCB wanted Younus at the helm until the next World Cup in 2011. "Obviously every captain needs to have some assurance of his tenure and Younus will continue to captain the side until the next World Cup," Butt said. Younus led Pakistan to victory in the Twenty20 World Cup in July and a host of former test players had urged him to withdraw his resignation. Younus submitted his resignation during a hearing of the National Assembly standing committee on sports in Islamabad. The hearing was convened after committee chairman Jamshed Dasti said he would investigate reports that Pakistan had deliberately under-performed against Australia and New Zealand in the Champions Trophy which ended on Oct. 5. Dasti later denied making match-fixing allegations and said his remarks had been misunderstood.
