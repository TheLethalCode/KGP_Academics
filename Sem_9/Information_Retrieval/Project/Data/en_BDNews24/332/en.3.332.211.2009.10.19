<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The government will bring "massive changes" in technical education to create more jobs home and abroad and meet local demand for skilled manpower, the education minister said Monday. "Only two percent of total education budget is spent for technical sector, despite huge demand for technical skills both home and abroad," Nurul Islam Nahid said. Nearly 17,000 foreigners are employed in the country's garment sector, though local workers should be employed in those positions, the minister said while addressing a certificate distribution ceremony of BGMEA Institute of Fashion and Technology in the capital. He also said most Bangladeshis working abroad were doing unskilled jobs. "We can earn more foreign currencies if skilled workers are sent abroad," Nahid said. He said the government was considering initiatives to reform the technical education. "Technical education in the country will see massive changes." "We will prepare the technical education syllabus in line with the recommendations of investors, while overseas bound workers will learn what skills the destination countries would require." The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturer and Exporter Association, BGMEA established its Institute of Fashion and Technology in 2000 to meet the growing demand for skilled manpower in the sector. bdn
