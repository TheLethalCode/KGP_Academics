 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)Embattled ruling Awami League MP Abdul Jalil, against whom a Dhaka court issued an arrest warrant in a case on charges of income tax dodge on Thursday, is not willing to speak about the matter. Reached by bdnews24.com, he said he declined comments on the issue. An aide at his Gulshan residence, 'Kamrul' told bdnews24.com, when contacted in the evening: "He (Jalil) told him that he didn't want to speak right now." The Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court for Dhaka ordered his arrest hours after the National Board of Revenue filed the case on Thursday on charges of evading Tk 4.07 lakh in income tax after hiding income worth Tk 54.60 lakh. Jalil has been embroiled in controversy after his comments about his own party, touching off a political storm in recent times. There was information of abnormal transaction in the bank accounts of Jalil and his wife at different times, which is not relevant with his income tax return statement. There were savings accounts and FDR in the name of their children, which were not mentioned in the income tax return statement, the case alleged. Jalil inferred in media interviews in London that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. He also said that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to retain his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. bdnews24.
