 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)The government is going to formulate a 'transparent promotion' guideline to make the administration dynamic and accountable, the establishment secretary has said. The work on changing the name of the establishment ministry is at the last phase, Iqbal Mahmud added at a news conference on Thursday. "The government has taken the move for reforms to ensure transparency and accountability in the administration. To make the administration accountable, an attempt is being made to make a transparent promotion guideline. "This guideline will be clear like a crystal so that no question crops up on the question of promotion." Mentioning that the work of the government officials is to serve the people, he said, "On the basis of this guideline, he who will do good work will be promoted." On Sep 7, the alliance government promoted about 500 officials. Even after that, many deprived of promotion expressed resentment. Under orders of the establishment ministry, 60 joint secretaries were promoted to the rank of additional secretaries, 163 deputy secretaries made joint secretaries and 271 senior assistant secretaries got promoted as deputy secretaries. Almost all deprived of promotion under the BNP-led government were promoted. In this regard Iqbal Mahmud said, "Transparency has been maintained in the promotion of public officials. They were promoted in keeping with the promotion guideline. Why promotion was not given was contained in the guideline also". He assured that the applications of those who were not promoted would be reviewed. The secretary said, "In case of human error, that will be amended. If the aggrieved persons come, we will see why they were not promoted. In the meantime, we have received 200 applications. After reviewing those, we will refer them to the Superior Selection Board (SSB). Replying to a question, Iqbal Mahmud claimed, "There is no stir in the administration in matters of promotion. The SSB guideline was not changed in the last promotion. He was not aware of any breach of the guideline". The secretary also claimed that the past record of OSDs was not surpassed by the present government. On placement of 500 promotees, it will take some time, he said.
