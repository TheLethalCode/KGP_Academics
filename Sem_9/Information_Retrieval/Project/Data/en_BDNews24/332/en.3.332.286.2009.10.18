 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  A writ petition has been filed with the High Court challenging the legality of promotion of 223 senior government officials. Supreme Court lawyer Quamrul Haque Siddiqui filed the petition with the bench of justices Tarique Ul Hakim and Moinul Islam Chowdhury on Sunday. Sixty officials were promoted to additional secretaries and 163 to joint secretaries on Sept 7 in one of the biggest mass promotions among Bangladesh civil servants. The establishment secretary, cabinet secretary and 223 promoted officers were asked to explain in four weeks why the promotions should not be declared illegal. The petition was filed seeking an order declaring the promotions illegal and staying their efficacy, Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. The petitioner said the promotions breached the constitutional provision of offering equal opportunity in government appointments. Appointment of unqualified people in the administration would leave the public deprived of the services they deserve, said the petitioner. bdne
