<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission investigators have completed a final report in a corruption case regarding the construction of the Bangabandhu Mausoleum, in which prime minister Sheikh Hasina was implicated. ACC deputy director Mohammed Moniruzzaman Khan submitted the report to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court on Sunday, suggesting all charges be dropped against the four accused, including Hasina. Metropolitan magistrate SKM Toffayel Hasan signed the final report, which will be sent to Dhaka's Senior Special Judges Court for orders on its acceptance. The case was filed on July 3, 2004, by ACC deputy director Manjur Morshed. Others accused in the case were the former Awami League government's state minister for culture Obaidul Kader, former joint secretary Mohammed Asaduzzaman and architect Iqbal Habib of the firm Vitti Architects. The case details said that Vitti Architects was verbally appointed for the design, modelling and supervision of 'Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's Mausoleum' before the project was approved by ECNEC. Later, the firm's appointment was confirmed through misuse of power, it was alleged. A discussion on the construction of the mausoleum was held at Ganobhaban on Nov 7, 1998, presided over by Sheikh Hasina, also Sheikh Mujib's daughter, during her previous term as prime minister. In the discussion, the army's chief engineer presented the project's model, plan and master plan. Hasina instructed the project to be implemented under the ADP. The then culture secretary, army's chief engineer and associated consultants held a meeting on Nov 18, 1998, where a draft project summary was presented. According to the project summary, Tk 1554.16 lakh was approved "at an ECNEC meeting on Nov 25". ACC's investigations later showed that the consulting firm was appointed breaking all rules and regulation and through abuse of power. The fee of the appointed firm was supposed to be cleared from the 'Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Trust. But the fee of Tk 41.84 lakh was cleared from the project's allocated funds breaking all rules and regulations. Investigating officer in the final report mentions that even though rules and regulations had been "manoeuvred past", the four should be acquitted as no evidence of criminal intent or illegal financial benefits were found during the investigation. Abdur Rashid, the ACC's prosecuting officer at Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's court, said the report would be sent for further orders to Dhaka Senior Special Judges Court. b
