 TEHRAN, Oct 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed at least two senior commanders of Iran's Revolutionary Guards in the country's southeast on Sunday during an attack in which 60 people died or were wounded, Iranian media reported. "Attacker detonated explosives strapped to his body during gathering of tribal heads," state Press TV said in a headline, adding that civilians and tribal leaders were also among the victims.

Most people in Sistan-Baluchestan are Sunni Muslims and ethnic Baluchis. Iran rejects allegations by Western rights groups that it discriminates against ethnic and religious minorit
