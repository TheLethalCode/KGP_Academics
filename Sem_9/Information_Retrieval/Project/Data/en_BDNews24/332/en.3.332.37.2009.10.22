 Feni, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)--Elections to 300 municipalities will be held in March and to 4,500 Union Parishads in the six divisions at the end of July, the chief election commissioner said on Thursday. ATM Shamsul Huda made the announcement while visiting the proposed venue for setting up server station of the Election Commission in Feni. Parliament passed laws on municipality on Sep 14 and Union Parishad on Oct 6. Among the 309 municipalities, voting in nine municipalities were held in August last year during the caretaker government's regime. Most of the remaining municipalities have already run their term. The term of over 4,500 Union Parishad bodies also expired. Polls to over 4,000 Union Parishad were held last between January and March in 2003. After the installation of the server station, national ID cards will be made from here, Huda said. He asked the officials to send the design of server station to the commission. Feni deputy commissioner Abdul Quddus Khan, police superintendent Mallik Fakrul Islam, Sadar upazila chairman Abdur Rahman and municipality mayor Nurul Absar were present. Earlier in the morning, Huda visited the proposed sites at Noakhali Sadar and Senbagh Upazila.

During the visit, Huda expressed satisfaction with Noakhali Sadar site, but objected to Senbagh.
