 ABOARD A U.S. MILITARY AIRCRAFT,Oct 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States does not see any alternative to an agreement on rejigging US troops in Japan, despite concerns expressed by Japan's new government, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates said as he travelled to Tokyo on Monday. "There are really, as far as we're concerned, no alternatives to the arrangement that was negotiated," Gates told reporters on his plane. "We've looked over the years at all of these alternatives and they are either politically untenable or operationally unworkable." The change of government in Japan has raised uncertainty among investors eyeing the pivotal role of the US alliance in a region also home to an unpredictable North Korea. Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who swept to power last month promising a more independent diplomatic path from Washington, has said he wants a Marine air base moved off Okinawa island.

"We have indicated that there could be some flexibility in terms of the location but that's really a matter between the Okinawa government and the government of Japan," he said. AFGHAN MISSION Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell added that it was important that any changes on the location of the base would not affect the timing of the implementation of the agreement. Gates will meet the new Japanese government on Tuesday and Wednesday for talks that help clear possible sources of friction before a trip to Japan next month by US President Barack Obama. The United States wants Japan to come forward with new forms of assistance to Afghanistan, should Tokyo follow through with plans to halt a naval refueling mission backing coalition forces, US defence officials have said. Gates, who will also visit Seoul this week, said he will discuss ways that Japan and South Korea could contribute to the stalled war in Afghanistan, which is facing a resurgent Taliban and rising casualties after eight years of fighting. "I'm not coming with a view to making any specific requests of either of these governments," he said. "If they're more comfortable with assistance in areas such as the sustainment of the Afghan national army and police in financial terms or helping with economic development and so on, we're perfectly prepared to discuss th
