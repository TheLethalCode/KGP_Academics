 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has rejected a defamation suit against Prothom Alo newspaper filed on Thursday by Bashundhara Group. The lawsuit claimed that two reports published in the popular Bangla-language daily had caused the complainant's organisation Tk 500 crore in losses. The Judicial Magistrate's Court for Dhaka rebuffed the lawsuit since the FIR could not specify which statement of the report had defamed Bashundhara The Group filed the defamation suit a day after filing a complaint against it and another daily. Bashundhara Steel Complex executive director retired major Zahedur Rahman filed the suit. Prothom Alo editor and publisher Matiur Rahman, reporter Mizanur Rahman and Transcom Group chairman Latifur Rahman were made accused. Gazi Shah Alam, lawyer for the plaintiff, told reporters they would file another civil suit against Prothom Alo. Bashundhra Group on Wednesday filed a General Diary against eight including the editors and publishers of Prothom Alo and Shamokal newspapers for their alleged involvement in setting fire to the Bashundhara City on Mar 13, which left seven dead. The Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, better known as Shah Alam, was belittled socially, politically and financially by the two reports carried in Prothom Alo on May 8 and Oct 12, the lawsuit added. The company faced losses worth Tk 500 crore as many firms lost interest to do business after the reports had been published. The hearing took place at the court of magistrate Shahriar Arafat. The lawsuit also said, the company invested thousands of crore of taka in 20 industries and businesses upon which fate of millions of employees is depending. Every day the company is paying tax amounting to over Tk 1 crore , it said The target of the accused is to stop investment inside the country rather than destroying the company alone. The lawsuit further said the accused became billionaire overnight by blackmailing reputed businessmen of the country. But nobody dare to question their sources of income in the face of their false and fabricated stories. A victim went to South Keriniganj police station to file a case against them but he was asked to approach the court, the plaintiff said in his suit. Later, lawyers Abbas Uddin Matabbor and Enamul Haque belonging to Shahara Khatun & Associates accepted the affidavit and filed the case on behalf the plaintiff. bdne
