 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh government is set to launch a seismic survey in the Bay of Bengal to prepare a full fledged report to be submitted to UN for arbitration on maritime boundary disputes with neighbouring India and Myanmar. The survey will be launched on an emergency basis taking the time constraints into account; a Netherlands-based firm will conduct the survey at a cost of Tk 80 crore, said an official. The decision came at a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs chaired by the finance minister AMA Muhith on Tuesday. The foreign ministry will launch the survey on an "urgent basis, cabinet secretary Abdul Aziz said after the meeting. "The seismic survey is crucial for identifying our maritime boundary and to protect our sea resources including natural gas and oil." A summary paper presented by the foreign ministry at the meeting said the survey work starting from the current month is expected to end by March 2010. A complete report formulated on the basis of the survey findings will be presented to the UN by July 2011, Aziz said. The foreign ministry briefing paper said, "A seismic survey can be conducted by an overseas firm in line with UN Maritime Law Convention 1982 instead of complying directly with the provision 72(2) of the Public Purchase Regulations 2008." As per the PPR-2008, a tender process is mandatory for any project costing over Tk 50 crore. But considering time constraint as well as country's interest, existing PPR is not being followed here, the paper said. Of the total estimated cost of the survey, Tk 70 crore will be spent on collection of scientific data and the rest on data processing and documentation. The foreign ministry also said the ministry concerned had contacted a number of countries, including the US, Netherlands and Canada, but only the Netherlands showed interest in conducting the survey Tension has been mounting with neighbouring India and Myanmar over shared maritime boundaries. The government announced earlier this month that it would submit the sea border disputes for compulsory arbitration before a UN tribunal as Myanmar and India had "unfairly" cut off Bangladesh's sea blocks. Foreign minister Dipu Moni said on Oct 8 that the government had opted for the UN arbitration process as the country failed to resolve the disputes with Myanmar and India for 35 years. She said Bangladesh's maritime boundary would be demarcated in four to five years as per the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The demarcation would establish Dhaka's right to extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. She, however, said Dhaka would continue talks with the two neighbours in addition to arbitration. The foreign minister disclosed the arbitration decision a day after prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament that her government was firm on its decision to extract oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal. The government has already awarded three offshore blocks to two foreign companies for oil and exploration, with a provision that no exploration would be allowed in any of the disputed waters of the blocks. Bangladesh in 1974 passed legislation demarcating its sea boundary though India and Burma (now Myanmar) rejected the move. Dhaka restarted sea border talks with India and Myanmar in 2007-08 after a hiatus of more than 20 years. But the talks failed to reach consensus on the issues. Foreign ministry sources said, out of Bangladesh's 28 offshore blocks, Myanmar and India have made counter claims on 18 blocks. The government has assured Delhi and Yangon that it would not go for oil and gas exploration in the blocks having overlapping claims by any of the neighbours. Tenders in sight for Dhaka transport plan The cabinet committee also gave the communication ministry the go-ahead Tuesday to invite bids from experienced firms for construction of a metro rail and an elevated expressway in capital Dhaka at an estimated Tk 15,000 crore. The committee set aside the ministry's proposal to consider an unsolicited tender offer but gave it the nod to pick pre-qualified investors through the open tender for a final selection. It approved a similar tender for find a contractor to build a second four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway and suggested going for an elevated four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong expressway,. It was also decided that the shipping ministry will prepare a draft project proposal for assistance from development partners for construction of a deep-sea port. bdnew
