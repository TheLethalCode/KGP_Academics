 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid says it will be an unforgettable moment when the prime minister and opposition chief together will call for fight against poverty from the same stage on 'International Day for the Eradication of Poverty' on Saturday. "Two leaders of two main parties of the country will together appeal the countrymen to fight against poverty. It will be an example, not only for Bangladesh but in the world history as well. It will be an unforgettable moment," he said at a media briefing along with chief whips of the two parties. "Both the two main leaders are respectable to me. They will be able to see eye to eye on national unity in the future. This is just the start," he said. At the briefing organised at parliament's media centre, the speaker said prime minister Sheikh Hasina will be present as chief guest at the programmes at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. Opposition chief Khaleda Zia will also be present there. He also expressed hopes that 'International Day for the Eradication of Poverty' would be held annually in the country. The day is being observed for the first time in Bangladesh. When asked if any new steps would be taken to bring back opposition to parliament, speaker said, "Not new, but the efforts to bring them back to the session would continue. I will not consider myself successful until I can bring them back." He pointed to the presence of the two chief whips, Abdus Shahid and Jainal Abdin Farrouque, together at the briefing and said: "We did not see them together for a long time. Now they are here. This is also a sort of progress." Opposition whip Abdin said, "We (government and opposition) are working together outside the parliament to make Oct 17 successful. I am hoping the speaker will create an environment suitable for the opposition to return to the parliament." Government whip Shahid hoped that the opposition will take part in the discussions on second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) in parliament on Oct 28. Various programmes will be organised around the country from Oct 16-18 to observe 'International Day for the Eradication of Poverty'. These programmes are organised with the assistance of National Committee against Poverty, Bangladesh National Parliament, All-party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and People's Empowerment Trust (PET). Member secretary of APPG, Shishir Kumar Shil, said, "The UNDP has approved a budget of US$ 1.28 lakh for the three-day programme. bdnews24.co
