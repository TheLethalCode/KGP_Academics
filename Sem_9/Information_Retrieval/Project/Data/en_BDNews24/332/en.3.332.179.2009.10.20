 WASHINGTON,Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Vice President Joe Biden heads to central and eastern Europe on Tuesday to soothe concerns from Poland and the Czech Republic about Washington's revamped plans for a missile defense system there. The two countries are still smarting from President Barack Obama's decision to shelve a Bush-era plan to install elements of a missile shield on their territory to protect against possible long-range missile attacks by Iran. Obama's plan, which the White House says is designed to face more immediate threats from Tehran, would start by deploying sea-based interceptors and then, in a second phase, land-based systems that would target short and medium-range missiles.

"The Czech government has expressed a strong interest in continuing to play a leadership role as we work with our NATO allies on this issue. And that's something that we welcome." Russia opposed the original US plan and welcomed Obama's shift. Blinken reiterated the US position that resetting previously strained relations with Moscow would not come at the expense of other allies. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton returned last week from a visit to Russia where she sought Moscow's cooperation on US missile defense plans. Afghanistan, Iraq, and energy security are also topics likely to be discussed on Biden's t
