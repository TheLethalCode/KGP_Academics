 Golam Mortuja Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Fourteen firefighting units were still battling to put out a smouldering fire more than 10 hours after flames broke out at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board warehouse in the capital's Tejgaon around 7:15am on Sunday. The education minister has said free textbook distribution for the next year would not be hampered even though huge losses have been incurred. Firefighters said they may have to work through the night to fully douse the fire if the burning stacks of books could not be moved. They also said the builders of the warehouse had not complied with building codes. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid rushed to the spot as soon as he heard about the fire. He feared huge financial losses as the NCTB stores contained expensive printing paper and printed books. The NCTB prints government school textbooks for free distribution. Fire service and NCTB officials said the fire originated on the ground floor and spread through the three-storey building. A total of 14 firefighting units arrived from across the city and struggled to douse the fire, they said. Two teams from the army and the navy were also working with the firefighters. Brigadier Abu Nayyim Mohammad Shahidullah, fire service chief, was also overseeing operations at the spot. "The building wasn't erected as per building codes. That's why we are finding it so difficult to manage the fire." He also said the books and paper had not been properly stored in the godown, which prevented the firefighters from reaching the fire zones and effectively dousing the smouldering books and paper. The bdnews24.com correspondent reported from the scene that firemen and NCTB officials began pulling down the rear walls of the warehouse at 1pm to save what stored books they could. Fire service deputy director Abdur Rashid told reporters: "We had failed to put out the burning paper and books stacked tightly up to the ceiling. "Then we considered breaking and ripping open the walls to salvage as many stored wares as we were able." Earlier in the day, duty officer at fire brigade headquarters, Selina Parvin, told bdnews24.com two firefighting units of Tejgaon fire service station and three from the headquarters had orginally strugglied through the morning to extinguish the fire. Mohammad Ali, an NCTB messenger, was rescued at around 11am with burns. Fire services deputy director Bharat Chandra Biswas said the NCTB store, crammed with books, was still emitting clouds of smoke despite being hosed down heavily with water. Gouranga Sarkar, research officer and member of the stores supervision committee, told bdnews24.com, "The fire spread in the part of the stores containing stacks of book cover printing paper of heavier thickness. "The stores also contain inner book printing paper which costs Tk 19 crore in total." Fire fighters said the water being hosed to extinguish the fire would destroy the books and all kinds of paper materials stored there. bdnews24
