 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Oct 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani forces attacked a Taliban stronghold with aircraft and artillery on Friday, as a suicide bomber killed 12 people in the city of Peshawar in the latest in a wave of militant attacks. The government says a ground offensive against the Pakistani Taliban in their South Waziristan lair is imminent and the army has been stepping up its air and artillery attacks in recent days to soften up the militants' defenses. The militants have launched a string of brazen attacks in the past 11 days, striking at the United Nations, the army headquarters, police and the general public, killing about 150 people, apparently trying to stave off the army assault. Friday's blast was outside an office of the police's Central Investigation Agency in the capital of North West Frontier Province, a staging post for US supplies into neighboring Afghanistan. "I was on the spot within minutes and helped remove bodies. They were really in bad shape," said resident Mohammad Rizwan. Police said a woman appeared to have been involved in the attack, while provincial Information Minister Iftikhar Hussain said the bomber drove up to the police office. "His leg has been found.

Aircraft and artillery struck militant positions in their strongholds of Ladha, Makeen and in the mountainous Shahoor region of South Waziristan overnight, hours after killing 27 militants in the region in various strikes. "We could see thick smoke and flames leaping into the sky from caves in the mountains after the bombing by jet fighters," said a resident near Shahoor who declined to be identified. Security officials said they had no information about casualties in the latest attacks. "SOME FLEEING" An army official in the region said some Taliban were trying to leave the area in disguise ahead of the offensive.Investors would be reassured by an offensive on South Waziristan, dealers say. Pakistani Taliban fighters made advances toward Islamabad early this year, raising fears about the stability of the US ally. But significant military gains in the Swat valley, from where militants have largely been driven out in recent months, have reassured the US and Western allies about Pakistan's commitment to fighting terrorism. In a sign of US continuing support, President Barack Obama signed on Wednesday a $7.5 billion aid bill for Pakistan over the next five years. But Pakistan's military has complained about the bill because the legislation ties some funds to fighting militants and is seen by critics as violating sovereig
