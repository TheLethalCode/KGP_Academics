<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Bhola-3 will go to vote again after its MP Jashimuddin lost an appeal in the Supreme Court on Sunday against a High Court order that stripped him of membership. The five-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin made the order upholding the HC ruling. The High Court on Feb 26 declared illegal the ruling Awami League's MP's holding the office on a petition filed by Hafizuddin, a retired major and BNP candidate, who had lost the constituency to Jashimuddin, also a retired major, in the Dec 29 elections. Hafiz's lawyer barrister Rafique-Ul-Huq told reporters after Sunday's ruling: "Since the Appellate Division has rejected Jashimuddin's appeal the Election Commission will hold by-polls to that constituency." Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com after the ruling: "Arrangements will be made following the court order." Hafizuddin filed a petition to the Election Commission on Dec 3 last year after the returning officer of Bhola had declared Jashim's nomination legal. Jashim was sent into forced retirement on Aug 31, 2004. According to law, one cannot contest for elections until three years after normal retirement and five years after forced retirement. Hafizuddin filed the petition with the High Court after the Election Commission had declared his nomination paper legal on Dec 10 last year. bdnew
