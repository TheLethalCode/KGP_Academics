<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Wednesday rejected a petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka after he had apologised. The bench of justices Syed Refaat Ahmed and Moinul Islam Chowdhury made the order. The mayor filed another petition on Tuesday apologising to the court for ignoring a previous directive and said that DCC would not allow any cattle markets on roads and open places in Dhaka before the Eid-ul-Azha. Advocate Asaduzaman Siddiqui had filed the petition on behalf of Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh on Oct 18 urging the High Court bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam to draw contempt proceedings against Khoka. The High Court on June 29 ordered the Dhaka mayor to take effective measure not to set up cattle markets on roads and open places before the Eid-ul-Azha and remove animal wastes 24 hours into their slaughter. The court had also asked the mayor to inform it by Oct 11 about the implementation of the directives, but he did not do so. b
