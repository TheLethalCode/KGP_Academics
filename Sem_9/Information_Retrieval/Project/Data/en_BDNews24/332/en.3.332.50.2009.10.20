<TITLE> Devastating fire enters 3rd day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Firefighters on Monday midnight were preparing to enter their third day battling the slow-burning but devastating fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board's main warehouse in Tejgaon that has consumed hundreds of tonnes of books and printing paper since Sunday morning. The process of removing countless stacks of wet dense-packed paper and ash is going slowly, though the weary firefighters say the smouldering fire is under their control. "We still couldn't reach the source of fire at the north-eastern part of the warehouse and it's not possible to quench the fire until the papers are removed that are stuck due to watering," Sheikh Mohammad Shahjalal, director (operations) of the fire service department, said on Monday night. He could not give any estimation on when fire might be fully quenched. State minister for education Motahar Hossain earlier in the day hinted that the fire might be "an act of sabotage". He, however, sought to assure people that the government's distribution of textbooks for primary, secondary and madrasa students would be completed on time. "There are three challenges ahead. Final exams are in November, book distribution in December and bringing all children to school in January," Hossain said. Someone may have done this job to throw the government off-track in these crucial tasks, the state minister said when asked if he believed the fire was an act of arson. However, a probe committee formed late Sunday, headed by Razia Begum, additional secretary of the education ministry, has been given three days to submit a primary report of their findings on the cause of the fire, an estimate of the losses incurred and those responsible, if any. "We're not overlooking any option, but nothing can be specified at this preliminary stage of the investigation," she told reporters on Monday. "We began our work at noon. We had a meeting, visited the site and talked to the staff of the warehouse who were on duty on Saturday night." "We'll are also asking for an expert on architecture and one electrical engineer to be added our committee." Other members of the committee are ATM Mohiuddin Ahmed, joint secretary of the education ministry, and other officials of education and home ministries and representatives from the finance section of NCTB, the secondary and higher education directorate and fire service and civil defence directorate. Fire service director Shahjalal said, "We're not ignoring any possibility." "Drug addicts reportedly used to gather on the top of an abandoned factory behind the warehouse, who might have caused the fire by throwing cigarettes or matches." "Short-circuits can't be ignored or arson." "The fire may even have been caused spontaneously by high temperature building up inside the dry piles of books," he added. The state minister said, "All the papers for printing primary school textbooks have gone to press." The fire has burnt most of the teachers' guides and an additional 800 metric tonnes of papers for secondary school and Madrasa books. "But twelve hundred metric tonnes of papers, earmarked for printing books in the next year, have been left unscathed by the fire," he added. An excavator from the Water Development Board was sent to the burning warehouse on Sunday midnight to work through the night pulling down the walls of the warehouse so the burning contents could be removed more effectively. An earlier attempt to break the walls and take out the piles of burning books with an excavator of the Army Engineering Core had failed. Fourteen fire service units fought the fire on the first day with army and navy support teams. Shahjalal said at least 50 firefighters were still engaged along about 200 labourers still working to remove the stacks of papers too. A firefighter on Monday evening said, "Eight-foot high stacks have been removed from the 12 foot high room, 37 metres long and 24 metres wide, where the source of the fire is." The officials are now trying to control the room temperature, to protect the structure of the building, and a smoke ejector has been set in the first floor to keep the ground floor room cool. The Tejgaon warehouse is the main store for paper for government textbooks and other books. The building was constructed during the Pakistan period. Firefighters have said the builders of the warehouse had not complied with building codes. Another NCTB warehouse is situated at Tongi. bdn
