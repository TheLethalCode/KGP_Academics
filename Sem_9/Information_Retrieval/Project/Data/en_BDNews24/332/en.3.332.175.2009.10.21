 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) in UK has advised British Asians to ensure that they make necessary travel preparations before visiting Bangladesh, India or Pakistan to avoid problems while staying abroad. The advice contained in a recent report published by FCO based on the consular assistance cases that had to be dealt with abroad. Some 1,411 British visitors reported problems while staying in those South Asian countries between April 2008 and March 2009. The report reveals that last year India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka attracted approximately 1,189,000 visitors from the UK alone, a significant proportion of whom went to visit family and friends. About 75,000 British nationals visited Bangladesh last year and 10,000 of them were in the country for a year or more. Visitors to India and Pakistan during that period were 734,000 and 285,720 respectively. According to FCO, in India nearly 20 percent of all reported consular cases required assistance whilst in hospital and nearly half of them needed support in the event of a death. For British travelers in Pakistan, 86 percent of consular cases were related issues such as child abduction, missing persons, assault and forced marriage. Lost or stolen passports also ranked highly with 687 incidents reported across the region. David Grahame, Consular Regional Director in South Asia says: "South Asia is an increasingly popular region for many British travelers. Although lost and stolen passports remains the number one incident for travelers, we deal with many situations, including hospitalisation where British travelers haven't got health or travel insurance and end up with enormous medical bills. We therefore urge anyone travelling to these countries to be fully prepared before flying out." British Foreign and Commonwealth Office has an ongoing campaign call "Know Before You Go (KBYG) which encourages British nationals to prepare for their foreign travels so they can avoid preventable problems. Campaign Manager for KBYG Jess Prasad says, "Many British Asians regularly travel to South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Many make the assumption that because they have friends and family there, or because they once lived there, they do not need to take health precautions or get travel insurance. This can lead to serious and expensive problems whilst abroad, which could be avoided by making simple pre-tip preparations." The FCO advises British nationals travelling to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and other South Asian countries to take out travel insurance. Medical expenses can be very high. For example, it can cost up to 45,000 to get transported by air ambulance back to UK from the Indian subcontinent
