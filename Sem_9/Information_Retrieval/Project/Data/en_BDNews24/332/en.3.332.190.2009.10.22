<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  There is a link between the ongoing Bangabandhu murder case appeals hearing and Wednesday's bomb attack on ruling Awami League MP Fazle Noor Taposh, the home minister said on Thursday. Taposh, also the lawyer in the Bangabandhu murder case, survived the bomb attack in the capital's Motijheel commercial area on Wednesday night. Some 13 people were wounded in the attack. "Bomb attack on Fazle Noor Taposh during the trial of Bangabandhu murder case is not a discrete event," Sahara Khatun told reporters when she went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to see the wounded people. Taposh's parents, Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni and Arzu Moni, were also killed in the military coup on Aug 15, 1975. Sheikh Moni was the nephew of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Sahara alleged the associates of Bangabandhu's killers had a hand in the bomb attack on Taposh. She said Wednesday's event should be investigated. "We have to probe why the attack was carried out." "The trial of the attackers must be held. I have instructed the law enforcers to find out the attackers immediately after the incident," the minister said. "The attackers must be nabbed. They should be punished." The minister was at the DMCH by the side of the wounded for about an hour from 11am. The bomb attack on Taposh was carried out at a time when the Bangabandhu murder case appeals hearing is underway at the Supreme Court. bdnews
