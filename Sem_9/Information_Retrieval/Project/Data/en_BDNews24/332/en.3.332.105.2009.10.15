<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)--The communications minister has said an agreement with India will soon be signed on 'regional connectivity', or transit, in the interest of the country. "Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will visit India in December. The interconnectivity treaty and others unsolved issues would be settled during the visit," Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after a meeting with Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty on Thursday. India has agreed to provide Bangladesh "connectivity" with Nepal and Bhutan through Indian territories in exchange for access to Ashuganj port to facilitate movements of Indian consignments through Bangladesh. The agreement was reached after the two-day talks on Sept 8-9 between foreign minister Dipu Moni and top Indian leaders including prime minister Manmohan Singh. Chakravarty said, "India is wondering why the opposition is so against the connectivity treaty. "India will sit with the opposition party to settle the issue. Discussion between the two sides should get rid of the complications." "The connectivity treaty will benefit both countries. Bangladesh will earn a lot in tax. On the other hand India will establish communication with far-off areas." Referring to Bangladesh's sea limit disputes with India and Myanmar, the envoy said, "India is also making its move in the arbitration court. But at the same time, India will continue bilateral diplomatic discussions." Bangladesh had recently submitted the maritime boundary dispute to compulsory arbitration before a UN tribunal as Myanmar and India have made claims on Bangladesh's sea blocks 5, 10 and 11. The government had endorsed a proposal on leasing out blocks 5, 10 and 11 to ConocoPhilips and Tullow Oil plc for offshore oil and gas exploration. b
