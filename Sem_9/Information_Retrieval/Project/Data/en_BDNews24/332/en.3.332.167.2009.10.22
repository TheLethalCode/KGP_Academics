 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The devastating four-day fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board warehouse in Tejgaon might have been sparked much earlier than detected, burning through the previous night, before being reported on Sunday morning, fire fighters said on Wednesday. The fire that broke out amid the thousands of tonnes of books and printing paper has consumed almost half the contents of the warehouse. Four days into the fire, firefighters said it was "almost out" on Wednesday. A fireman of Tejgaon Fire Station said they were called out to NCTB depot Sunday morning to find the building already enveloped by heavy smoke. "The source of the fire was difficult to discover due to the thick blanket of smoke," he told bdnews24.com. "We couldn't tell at first which floor was on fire. It seemed it might be the first or second floor. So, confusions were there from the start over the source of fire," he said. It was eventually pinpointed to the ground floor, the fire official said. Tejgaon Fire Station received the report about the NCTB fire shortly after 7am on Sunday, and two fire engines reached there very quickly as they are stationed very nearby, firemen had said earlier. "But the way smoke was billowing looked like fire had been burning for some time," another fireman, among the first at the scene, told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Fazlul Haque, officer in charge of the NCTB depot who lives on the premises, has said he woke up Sunday hearing shouts of "Fire" and called the nearby fire station. An employee of Synthia Rubber Factory situated behind the warehouse had said on Sunday that he and other locals saw smoke coming out of the exhaust fan at the warehouse at around midnight Saturday. But they did not assume it was a fire. "The fire might have been burning for some time before it was discovered Sunday morning," Sheikh Mohammad Shahjalal, director (operations) of the fire department, told bdnews24.com. "On the other hand, fire among paper can produce a lot of smoke in a short time." bd
