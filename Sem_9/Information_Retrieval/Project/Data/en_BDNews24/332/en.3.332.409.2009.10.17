 CHENNAI, India, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 32 people were killed in an accidental blaze at a firecracker warehouse in southern India, officials said on Saturday. The victims had gathered late on Friday at Pallipattu village, in Tamil Nadu state, to buy firecrackers to celebrate the Hindu festival of "Diwali." "The bodies were so badly burned that only 23 bodies have been identified so far," V. Palanikumar, a local government official, told Reuters. Two people, including the owner of the warehouse, had been arrested. Explosions are common at Indian fireworks factories or stores that sell them with little protection from accidents. Diwali was being celebrated on Saturday.
