<TEXT>
 STOCKHOLM, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Notts County director of football Sven-Goran Eriksson is no longer a candidate for the job of Sweden coach, Swedish FA chairman Lars-Ake Lagrell said on Tuesday. "He said that the (Notts County) owners put a stop to his idea," Lagrell told Swedish soccer website Fotbollskanalen (www.fotbollskanalen.se). Swede Eriksson, the former England manager, had been mentioned in media reports as a possible successor to Lars Lagerback as Sweden coach. Lagerback retired this month following Sweden's failure to qualify for next year's World Cup in South Africa. "We can conclude that in the race horse number one has withdrawn," said Lagrell. "I have nothing more to say other than that he (Eriksson) never promised us anything. "We have checked the pre-conditions with a handful of candidates, one of which was Sven, but he never promised anything, he only said he would investigate it and get back to me."
