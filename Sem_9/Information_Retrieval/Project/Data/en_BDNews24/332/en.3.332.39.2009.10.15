 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the Zia Orphanage Trust corruption case against former prime minister Khaleda Zia should not be cancelled. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir and Mohammed Raisuddin gave the order on Thursday on a petition filed by Khaleda and her elder son Tarique Rahman. Barrister Rafiq-Ul Haque argued the case for Khaleda and Tarique at the hearing. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, assisted by additional attorney general A K M Zahirul Haque, stood for the state. Haque later told bdnews24.com, "The petition was filed to cancel the proceedings of the case. But the court did not give a stay order. A rule was issued asking (the government and the ACC) to show cause as to why the proceeding should not be cancelled." On Sep 15, two separate petitions were filed at the High Court for cancelling the proceedings by Mahbubuddin Khokon on behalf of Khaleda and Tarique. The hearing on the petitions started on Oct 7. The High Court vacation bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Rezaul Hasan had rejected their petitions on Sep 24. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges against Khaleda, Tarique and four others on Aug 5, accusing them of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust, which allegedly existed only on paper. Haque told the court on Sep 16 that the Trust was a private-owned organisation and the ACC cannot interfere with its activities. He said the defendants were not guilty of any corruption and the case should be quashed. Attorney general Alam had said the merit of the case was to be decided by a court and the petitions were 'worthless' in this situation. The petitions claim ACC deputy director Harun-or-Rashid had filed the cases and pressed charges without the proper approval of the commission. Moreover, the petitions pointed out, charges were submitted 392 days after the cases were filed. The ACC rules require charges pressed within 60 days of the filing of the case. The four other accused in the case are former BNP MPs Kazi Salimul Haque and Sharfuddin Ahmed, former principal secretary at the prime minister's office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui and Khaleda's nephew Mominur Rahman. Charges were later dropped against two other accused, Syed Ahmed and Giasuddin Ahmed. The court of Dhaka metropolitan special judge A N M Bashirullah on Sep 7 set Oct 25 to frame charges against five other defendants. It issued arrest warrants against defendants Mominur Rahman, nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary Kamal Uddin Siddiqui who did not appear in court. The Supreme Court on Aug 2 upheld the previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. Tarique is out on bail to receive medical treatment in the UK. b
