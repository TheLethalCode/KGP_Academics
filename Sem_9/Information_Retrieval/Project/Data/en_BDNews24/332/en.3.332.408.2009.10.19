 Golam Mortuja Antu bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)The fire at the National Curriculum and Textbook Board warehouse in Tejgaon was still unquenched Monday, some 30 hours after it broke out on Sunday morning. An excavator from the Water Development Board was sent to the burning warehouse Sunday midnight as firefighters were still battling to douse the smouldering fire. The digger was working through the night to pull down the walls of the warehouse, WDB executive engineer Nizamuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com at Sunday midnight. The WDB sent the excavator at the request of the education ministry, he said. An earlier attempt to break the walls and take out the piles of burning books with an excavator of the Army Engineering Core had failed. Firemen, who had been fighting the fire since morning, had said they might have to work through the night. They said the burning stacks of books had to be moved if the fire was to be completely doused. The education minister has said textbook distribution for the next year would not be hampered even though huge losses have been incurred. There were no reports of casualties, but no one could pinpoint what caused the fire. Firefighters, however, said the builders of the warehouse had not complied with building codes. The government formed a probe committee in the evening, some twelve hours into the fire, asking it to submit a preliminary report of its findings within three days. Minister Nurul Islam Nahid had rushed to the spot Sunday morning, as soon as he heard about the fire, fearing huge financial losses as the stores contained expensive printing paper and printed books. The NCTB prints all the government's school textbooks for free distribution. The Tejgaon warehouse is the main store for paper for the textbooks and other educational publications. Another NCTB warehouse is situated at Tongi. Fire service and NCTB officials said flames had originated on the warehouse's ground floor at around 7.15am in the morning and spread through the three-storey building. A total of 14 firefighting units from across the city were struggling to douse the fire, they said. Police, RAB and teams from the defence forces were working with them. Brigadier Abu Nayyim Mohammad Shahidullah, fire service chief, was overseeing operations at the spot through the day. "The building wasn't erected as per building codes. That's why we are finding it so difficult to manage the fire," he told bdnews24.com. He also said the books and paper had not been properly stored in the repository, which also prevented the firefighters from reaching the fire zones and effectively dousing the burning books. He told bdnews24.com, "It will be tough for us if the piles of books can't be removed." "But the fire is under our control in a 60 by 70 feet room, we didn't let it spread" "We're also taking measures so that the fire doesn't spread to the adjacent rooms and upstairs. However, we're also concerned about a neighbouring chemical factory." The reason behind the fire is still unknown, the fire service chief said. On dousing the fire, Shahidullah said, "The papers are burning slowly. But we hope that we might be able to put out the fire completely by the night." A special unit of the army came on the spot at around 4:15pm, he added. bdnews24.com's correspondent reported from the scene that firemen and NCTB officials began pulling down the rear walls of the warehouse at 1pm to better get at the fire and see what books they could save. Fire services deputy director Bharat Chandra Biswas said the NCTB store, crammed with books, was still emitting clouds of smoke despite being hosed down heavily with water. Another deputy director Abdur Rashid told reporters: "We had failed to put out the burning paper and books stacked tightly up to the ceiling. "Then we considered breaking and ripping open the walls to douse the fire and salvage whatever we could." But the attempt of the Army Engineering Core to take out the piles of burning books through that way with an excavator also failed. A worker of the neighbouring Synthia Rubber Industries, Selim, said he and some others saw smoke from the building at around Saturday midnight. NCTB's security personnel Ahsan Habib, who was on duty through Saturday night, also told bdnews24.com, "We first saw the smoke in the early hours when switching off the lights after Fazr prayers. "Then we patrolled the building, called NCTB and warehouse officials from their nearby quarters. "We called the firefighters and opened the main gate." A fire service unit is situated close to the warehouse, he said. Duty officer at fire brigade headquarters, Selina Parvin, told bdnews24.com two firefighting units of Tejgaon fire service station and three from the headquarters had originally struggled through the morning to extinguish the fire. Mohammad Ali, an NCTB messenger, was rescued at around 11am with burns. Gouranga Sarkar, research officer and member of the stores supervision committee, told bdnews24.com, "The fire spread in the part of the stores containing stacks of book cover printing paper of heavier thickness. "The stores also contain inner book printing paper which cost Tk 19 crore in total." Fire fighters said the water being hosed to extinguish the fire would destroy the books and all kinds of paper materials stored there. bdnews24.com/gma
