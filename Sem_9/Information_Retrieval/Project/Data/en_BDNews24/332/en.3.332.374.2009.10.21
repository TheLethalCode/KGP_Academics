 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  The fire at National Curriculum and Textbook Board main warehouse in Tejgaon was an act of sabotage, the education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said Wednesday two days after his deputy minister Motahar Hossain hinted the same. Nahid also said it would "undoubtedly" hamper the government's education goals. Visiting the scene of the fire, which has devastated the depot after burning for three days and three nights, he told reporters, "We would not like to say anything based on assumption." "But I firmly believe it was an act of sabotage, though we can not say right now who may be behind it," he said. "Let the issue be proved through investigation. Let's see then whose names come out." Asked about the investigation, the minister said "The probe committee is working. They are looking into this." The probe committee was supposed to submit its initial report Wednesday. "But, there may be a delay," said the minister. There will not be any party influence in probing the incident, he added. Nahid repeated several times, "Such a fire cannot be explained except by some kind of sabotage." "There are reasons too to term it an act of sabotage," he said. "Many a person wants the government to fail in its challenges." Nahid said three of those challenges were the upcoming final exams in government schools in November, textbook distribution in December and bringing all children to school. He said the fire had incurred "a huge loss". "What the fire gutted has gone of course. More losses may be due to smoke, heat and water." He said they were worried too about the building suffering major damage. "The losses from the fire will undoubtedly hamper us in reaching our goals," he said. "Yet, we are determined to meet our challenges." bd
