 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)--Jatiya Party, a key ally of the ruling Awami League, has opposed the proposed education policy, saying it will cause discontent among teachers, students and the people. "Something like an education policy should not be imposed on the people. A more realistic and generally accepted policy should be implemented," chairman H M Ershad said at a meeting with ruling Grand Alliance leaders on Thursday. The Awami League-led government has moved to completely remodel the education system through implementation of a new education policy amid opposition by BNP and conservative parties. Now the Jatiya Party chief has expressed his opposition to the policy. The government formed the National Education Policy Formulation Committee-2009 headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury. The committee handed over its report to the prime minister on Sep 4 through the education ministry. The policy document is furnished with separate chapters on primary, secondary and higher education, technical education as well as madrasa education. However, Ershad, the former military strongman who added Islam as the state religion, has been venting his frustrations due to not getting 'vital' posts in the coalition government. He said on Oct 14, "We are in the coalition. We did not lose our hopes for not getting what we expected after the sweeping win (in the general elections)." "The current government is facing complications due to past failures. We hope that in more stable situation, Jatiya Party would be appropriately evaluated," said Ershad. The AL-led coalition won absolute majority in the December elections and formed government. Ershad's younger brother and Jatiya Party MP GM Kader is the civil aviation and tourism minister. b
