<TITLE> Uniform timing for banks countrywide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)All banks across the country will remain open from 10am to 6pm from Monday, in line with new timings set by the government, a central bank circular said Sunday. The circular said the banks will be open for customer transactions from 10am to 4pm, instead of previous 9am to 3pm. The decision came to remove complications in inter-bank transactions across the country that erupted following the government's directive for banks in the capital only to obey the new 10am-6pm timing as part of new school and business timings to combat Dhaka's traffic woes. The government set different timings for government and non-government institutions, banks and schools in recent weeks to reduce congestion in the capital. But banking executives said that two kinds of schedules for banks in and out of the capital was creating complications in inter-bank exchanges. Heads of state-owned commercial banks and private-owned banks informed the Bangladesh Bank governor about the complications of separate timings. bdne
