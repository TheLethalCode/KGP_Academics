<TITLE> Khaleda decision draws flak </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Political commentators have criticised BNP chief Khaleda Zia for her last-minute refusal to join prime minister Sheikh Hasina in launching an anti-poverty campaign on Saturday. They said that there should be open scope for resolving problems through dialogues by discarding partisan outlook and practice of boycott. They, however, also expressed doubt over positive outcome of such get-together of leaders. Rather, they believe, emphasis should be laid on the speaker's initiative to bring the opposition leader back to the parliament Khaleda and her bitter political rival Hasina were scheduled to make the anti-poverty call at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre on International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. At a news conference at her office in Gulshan on late Friday afternoon, Khaleda said: "It will not be possible for us to join tomorrow's programme in the current circumstances." "We cannot unilaterally cooperate with the government by condoning its crime, repression and violation of human rights." Political analyst professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Friday night: "It is an unexpected incident as the whole nation has been looking forward to seeing the two leaders together." "Conflict may persist between them on political ground. But they need to come under the same umbrella over certain issues," he said. It was not proper for the opposition leader to boycott the programme, he said Professor Mozaffar Ahmed, the anti-corruption campaigner, told bdnews24.com: "It will make no difference whether the two leaders meet on any occasion or not." "What changes occurred after the two had joined a programme at Senakunja where they talked to each other?" "Rather, let the steps initiated by the speaker to bring the opposition leader back to the House be made successful," he said. Senior journalist Ataus Samad said: "It seems unlikely to me that the political culture of our country will change positively if the two leaders sit to eat together and deliver joint speech on a single issue." They jointly launched movement in 1990 but it did not improve their relationship, he said. "Khaleda Zia might have decided to boycott the programme as part of realising her pending demands but it is nothing unusual," he said. But, he said, it would have been better had she announced her decision earlier. He said there should be open scope for resolving problems through dialogues discarding the practice of boycott. Former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hasan Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "As the whole nation has been eagerly waiting for the moment to see the two leaders share the podium, the opposition leader's decision shocked me like the entire nation." "We expected the two leaders will announce a war against poverty ignoring partisan narrowness but it did not happen." He said he would expect the opposition leader to reverse her decision as the programme had several hours to kick off. bdnews
