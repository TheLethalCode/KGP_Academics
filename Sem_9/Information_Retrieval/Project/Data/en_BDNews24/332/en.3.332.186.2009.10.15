 BEIJING, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China, reluctant to isolate Iran in its standoff with the West over its nuclear programme, will maintain cooperation with Tehran and foster "close coordination in international affairs", Premier Wen Jiabao said on Thursday. Wen made the comments to the visiting First Vice President of Iran, Mohammad Reza Rahimi, in Beijing for a forum of Central Asian states, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

China has voiced concern about the enrichment plant, but urged nations to solve the latest flare-up through negotiations. Growing energy ties bind China, the world's No. 2 crude oil consumer, and Iran, which has the world's second-largest crude oil reserves but needs investment to develop them. Iranian oil made up nearly 12 percent of China's crude imports last year. Beijing's distaste for sanctions and appetite for Iran's oil mean it could use its power as a permanent member of the Security Council to soften any proposed resolution on the disp
