 By Maruf Mallick, bdnews24.com correspondent, in Stockholm Stockholm, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)Swedish prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, at the launch of a European development summit in Stockholm Thursday, has said his government was wholly behind global efforts to combat the adverse affects of climate change. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina joined the inaugural session of the European Development Days 2009 meet in the Swedish capital, a three-day event aiming to strengthen global cooperation on Millennium Development Goals, focusing on the challenges presented by global warming. Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to address the conference on Saturday. "Bangladesh is among the most affected by global climate change. I will speak of how Bangladesh can be saved from these adverse effects at the European development meeting," Hasina said just before her departure for Stockholm on Tuesday. The annual programme, hosted by the European Commission and EU presidency, aims to make EU members' development aid and activities more effective around the world. This year's meeting will address issues of citizenship, responses to the global economic downturn, democracy and its relation to development and climate change. Some 80 high officials and 3,000 representatives from 125 countries are participating including heads of state and leading world figures. Some 1,500 organisations from the development community are also participating while Nobel Prize winning researchers and experts will present their papers in the conference. Crown Princess of Sweden Victoria Ingrid Alice Dsire inaugurated the three-day programme, saying she hoped it would play a key role in the development of the people around the world and extend new ideas. Rajendra K Pachauri, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said we have to come out of contemporary development thinking as its time to renew our ideas. Around 1.6 billion people around the globe are still deprived of electricity, he said. Sheikh Hasina called on the European Commission chief Jos Manuel Barroso after the opening session. She is also scheduled to sit with the Swedish prime minister on bilateral issues during her visit and join a dinner in his honour. The Bangladesh delegation, including state minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, and the Bangladesh ambassador to Sweden Emtiaz Ahmed, will also meet the speaker of the Swedish parliament, members and the minister for international development. bdn
