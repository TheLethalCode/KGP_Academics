In the afternoon, prime minister Sheikh Hasina will release postage stamps and envelops commemorating the day. Moreover, the district and upazila administrations around the country are observing the day through holding discussion meetings and rallies. President Zillur Rahman, on the eve of World Food Day on Friday, said proper measures must be taken to ensure food security in a changing climate. In his message on Thursday, Rahman said, "I believe sufficient research and adequate technological innovation and usage can play an important role to produce more food." Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, "Agriculture is the most affected and vulnerable sector due to climate change. It is absolutely needed to ensure food security by fighting the situation." "Bangladesh achieved self-dependency during the previous Awami League government in 1996-2001. But the succeeding government could not carry the success." The incumbent government is pledged to guarantee food security for all being self-dependent again, the prime minister added. In his message the UN chief Ban Ki-moon said, "Food and nutritional security are the foundations of a decent life, a sound education and, indeed, the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals." "Over the past two years, volatile food prices, the economic crisis, climate change and conflict have led to a dramatic and unacceptable rise in the number of people who cannot rely on getting the food they need to live, work and thrive. "For the first time in history, more than one billion people are hungry," he added. He said, "At this time of crisis, I encourage all nations to pursue coordinated and comprehensive strategies for agricultural development and effective social protection so that vulnerable people  women and children in particular  can get the food they need for nutritional security and well-being." FAO representative in Bangladesh AD Spijkers said, "The achievement of the MDG 1to eradicate extreme poverty and hungerfaces the risk of serious setbacks." "It has occurred because of the economic crisis and panicky price hikes that have reduced incomes and access to food of the poor, more severely those in the poorest parts of the globe," he added. Spijkers said, "The government has taken a strong resolve to return to self sufficiency in food by 2012 and to sustain it. The farmers of Bangladesh may rightfully aspire to attain that target. We believe they can, and they will." bdnew
