 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)--The National Museum premises sprang to life with the chirping of the children who had come with their parents well before afternoon on Saturday. The first floor of the museum was already buzzing with activity and when a cultural ceremony started there, the atmosphere was pulsating. It was somewhat different from other functions, though. Because all participating children were autistic, who have the brain development condition, a problem which mainly affects social skills. Those in attendance became were swept off their feet when 12-year old Mina, clad in red saree, began dancing to the beats at the captivating ceremony titled 'Share with Innocence-4'. You could hardly tell that an autistic child was dancing to the popular tunes 'Ranga Bou Machh Katere Uthane Bosia'. There were gasps when it was revealed that she had an open heart surgery at the age of 3. Her condition improved after she had begun receiving care SWID Bangladesh school. She now can not only walk but also dance. The function, organised by Hallows Association of Neophyte Students, had the children of seven city schools sing songs, dance, recite rhymes and poems, walk the ramp, tell stories and act. Their charming presentations only reinforced the idea that mentally challenged children can also fully bloom if they get the right care. A Danish entrepreneur recently formed an IT consultancy made up mostly of people with autism-spectrum disorders, who troubleshoot software for companies like Microsoft and Cisco Systems. Ishtiaq Shariar Shanta, general secretary of HANS, said more than 800 children of different ages are trained and educated in eight schools to make them do things on their own. Joint secretary at the ministry of social welfare Nasima Begum was the chief guest at the ceremony. Mir Sohrabul Hossain, chairman of HANS, delivered his welcomed speech. The country's first online newspaper and news agency, bdnews24.com, Daily New Age and private television channel Ekushey TV were media partners of event.
