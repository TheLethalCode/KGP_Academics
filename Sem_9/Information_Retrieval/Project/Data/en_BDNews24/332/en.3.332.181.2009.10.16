 Natore, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman inaugurated this fiscal year's agriculture loan distribution programme on Friday by handing over cash loans to 37 landless framers and share-croppers. Rahman handed out Tk 10.26 lakh loans among those farmers on behalf of Rajshahi Krishi Unnayon Bank at Kacchihata High School premises under Gurudaspur Upazila. Supervision has been strengthened this year to avoid irregularities in distributing loans, he said and added that importance had to be given to the farming sector and the farmers to develop the country. The governor had announced loan distribution through drum beating across the country. The central bank is set to allocate a record Tk 11,512.30 crore as farming credit in the current fiscal year, up more than Tk 2000 crore from Tk 9,389 crore target of last year. The loan will be provided at 2 percent interest, he said. "About 90 percent of the debtors are sharecroppers and landless farmers." The central bank chief said, "We have to put emphasis on agriculture to eradicate poverty. So the central bank has fixed the target in line with the government's preference to agriculture sector." Mentioning agriculture as the lifeline of economy, he said, "Farmers are giving support to the economy while their children are contributing by sending remittance." The foreign exchange reserve would soon cross $ 1000 crore with the huge contribution of their foreign currency. Necessary measures have been taken to stop irregularities, he said. "Eighty officers have been deployed to oversee the distribution programme from the spots around the country." Rahman at a news conference on July 14, spelled out the agriculture loan distribution target and policy for the current fiscal year, with a vow to curb widespread allegations of irregularities in disbursing the loans. He said, "Usually money shifts from village to cities, but we want it to reverse and hence the target." Four nationalised banks and two specialised ones, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, have been asked to disburse Tk 8,453 crore alone in loans. The country's 29 private banks have been given a Tk 2,594 crore target, while 10 foreign banks have been set Tk 465 crore. Later, the governor distributed Tk 7.60 lakh among nine fishermen at Chatila villag under Moharajpur upazila. Rahman was pleased to see fish farming in hundreds of ponds at Chapila and Moharajpur. He pledged to try to reduce land tax for the fisheries to Tk 5 percent per decimal to help spread the 'silver revolution'. Managing director of RKUB Mohammad Fazlul Huq, head of the governing body Rabindra Kumar Majumder, Rustam Ali Ahmed, administrative officials, among others, attended the ceremony. bdnews
