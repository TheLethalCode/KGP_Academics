 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Oct 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anger among Palestinians over President Mahmoud Abbas's original position on a Gaza war report critical of Israel has cost him public support in a rivalry with Hamas, a poll showed on Sunday. The survey by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center (JMCC) indicated Abbas would receive 16.8 percent of the vote, with Hamas Islamist leader Ismail Haniyeh running neck-and-neck with 16 percent, if a presidential election was held now.

The council passed a resolution that singled out Israel for censure without referring to any wrongdoing by Hamas. Abbas has said he would proceed with plans to hold presidential and parliamentary elections in January unless Hamas agreed to a deal proposed by Egypt to delay the ballot until June. Egypt has been trying to mediate a reconciliation pact between Fatah, which has accepted the unity proposal, and Hamas, which is still weighing the plan. The JMCC said it interviewed 1,200 people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip between October 7 and 11, a few days after the Palestinian Authority agreed to defer the UN report. It said the poll had a margin of error of three perc
