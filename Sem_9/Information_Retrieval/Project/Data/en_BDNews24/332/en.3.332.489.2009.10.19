 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Private University Bill will be tabled at Monday's cabinet meeting, University Grants Commission chairman Nazrul Islam said Sunday. "The UGC-drafted bill, intending to bring all private universities under stricter regulation, is to be discussed in Monday's cabinet meeting for approval," said Islam at a seminar on implementation of the proposed National Education Policy 2009 at Dhaka University's senate building. The UGC chairman, quoting law minister Shafique Ahmed, said, "There are high chances the bill will be approved in the meeting. Then it will be presented in parliament as a step to making it law." Islam also said, "The proposed bill was finalised sacrificing many aspects after considering the realities of the situation. But still various quarters are trying to ensure that the law is not passed." But, he said, the education minister and the law minister were joined in all-out efforts for passing the bill into law. "If the bill is passed the highly lucrative private university sector would come under strict regulation", he told bdnews24.com. "It will bring transparency to the administration and working of the universities. Direct interference of the owners would be curbed and the universities' academic syndicates will be able to exert more power." The proposed bill also empowers the vice chancellor. The present law leaves more power in the owners' hands. Allegations about misuse of this power have come up regularly as have complaints of high fees, poor teaching standards and facilities. Islam said, "A special aspect of the new bill is that an 'accreditation council' will be formed to overview academic activities and maintaining standards of education at private universities." "Implementation of this bill will be quite hard," conceded Islam. "But with the law enacted, chances of controlling numerous irregularities increases." Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said last month the bill will be passed soon. There are 54 private universities in the country at present. Most have fielded complaints of poor education standards and various irregularities. A Private University Ordinance 2008 was passed under the past caretaker government for stricter regulation of the sector. The ordinance expired after the newly elected government came to power in January. The new bill was redrafted based on the previous ordinance with some changes. bd
