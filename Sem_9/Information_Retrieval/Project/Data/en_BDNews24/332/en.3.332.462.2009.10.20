<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court on Tuesday ordered re-investigation into a case of attempted murder of late writer Humayun Azad. Dhaka's first additional chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammed Ehsanul Haque also asked the additional inspector general of police to submit investigation report to the Criminal Investigation Department by Dec 20. Azad's brother Manjur Kabir filed a petition to re-open investigations into the case. The court had set Oct 18 for next hearing and asked the complainant's lawyer, Ayat Ali Patwari, to present the decision of the higher court regarding further investigation during testimony after the court frames charges against the defendants in the case. Since the lawyer failed to submit the document the court set Tuesday for the hearing. The petitioner said the investigation officer had not properly identified the accused in the case. Humayun Azad, while alive, had said that after the publication of his book titled 'Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad' he had received many threats. The late professor of Dhaka University's Bangla department came under attack in front of Bangla Academy while he was on his way back from 'Ekushey Boi Mela' on Feb 27, 2004. After he recovered, Azad was sent to Germany where he died on the night of Aug 11, 2004, the day he reached Germany, the petitioner added. Kabir had filed two cases against unknown people with Ramna Police Station the day after he was attacked by criminals. On Nov 14, 2007, Criminal Investigation Department's inspector Kazi Abdul Malek pressed charges accusing Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh kingpin Shaokh Abdur Rahman, top leaders Ataur Rahman Sunny, Noor Mohammad Sabu aka Shamim, Minhaj aka Shafiq aka Shaon aka Hamim and Anwar Alam aka Khoka aka Bhagne Shahid. The IO later appealed for dropping Shaokh Abdur Rahman and Sunny off the chargesheet as they were already executed on a court verdict in another case. Of the remaining three, police only arrested Minhaj. The case is currently in the process of cross-examining the witnesses. bdne
