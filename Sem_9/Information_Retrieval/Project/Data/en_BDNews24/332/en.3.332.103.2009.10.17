 Mainul Haq Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)The hajj flights will start from Wednesday and the pilgrims will report from Sunday at Ashkona near the Dhaka airport, an official said on Saturday. "Preparations are at the final stages to ensure facilities for the pilgrims both under private and government management," hajj officer Mohammad Bazlul Huq Biswas told bdnews24.com. "The passengers will start reporting from Sunday according to flight schedules." This year 58,460 men and women will observe hajj in Saudi Arabia. Among them 8,043 will go under the government initiatives and the others under management of private agents. "The pilgrims will fly from Oct 21 to Nov 21 while ferrying passengers under government management will be complete by Nov 13," Biswas said. Saudia will ferry 20,000 passengers and Biman Bangladesh Airlines will carry more than 38,000. Biswas said, "Schedules were made in accordance with passengers from Rajshahi, Dhaka, Barisal, Chittagong, Sylhet and Khulna divisions. Letters have already been issued to them. They will receive the letters one week ahead of their flight, he said and added everyone has been advised to call 8916570 for further query. The return flights will start from Dec 2. House rent issue of the pilgrims under the government's management has been solved and houses for 20,000 of those under private management have been managed. Accommodation for the rest will be finalised in phases, he added. "Police and personnel of other agencies have been deployed to ensure security. Preparations for living, food, water and medical team have been finalised." The medical team has already started to vaccinate the pilgrims. Police patrol has also been strengthened, the officer added. On-duty sub inspector at the hajj camp Ahsan Habib said, "Eight platoons of police have been deployed at the camp. They will work from Sunday." About the absence of details of the pilgrims and flights on the website of religious affairs ministry, assistant hajj officer Abdul Malek said, "Only the information of the first day are uploaded there. "The whole database of passengers under government management will be added soon." Medical in-charge of the hajj camp Dr Wahidul Huq said, "Twelve male and female doctors will be on duty for 24 hours from Sunday." Sultana Rahman, a pilgrim at the camp, said, "I hope there won't be any hassle as everything is in order until now." As many as 179 guides will accompany the pilgrims this year although most of them are inexperienced. Biswas said, "The ministry has appointed them. However, it's not mandatory to have experience. The matter is whether they can serve." He said the preparations are underway in line with the inter-ministerial meeting held on Sep 30. "We hope irregularities and mismanagement would not be seen this time like the previous years." The number of pilgrims last year was 7,605 under the government management and 41,158 under private facilities. bdn
