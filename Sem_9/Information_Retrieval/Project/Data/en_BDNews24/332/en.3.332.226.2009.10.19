<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission will move to hold the vote in Bhola-3 constituency after a gazette notifying the earlier election is out in line with a court verdict. Election commissioner Sohul Hossain told journalists on Monday they were waiting for the papers of the verdict. "We will complete the election within 90 days following the gazette notification." The EC will then intimate the parliament secretariat about vacation of the post, announce election schedule before holding the by- election, he added. The Appellate Division on Sunday dismissed the appeal against the High Court order that had ruled that the election of ruling Awami League MP Jasimuddin was illegal. His lawyer barrister Rafique-UL Haque told journalists that that the commission will hold by-election to that constituency. Jasim, a retired major, defeated BNP candidate retired major Hafizuddin Ahmed Hafiz in last year's general elections. The electoral law stipulates that none can contest the polls in three years from the date of retirement and in five years after compulsory retirement. Jasim went into compulsory retirement on Aug 3, 2004. The EC said Jasim's application was validated following the opinion of judge advocate general (JAG) Lt Col Mohammed Aziz Ahmed after the chief election commissioner sought opinion. The JAG told the EC that Jasim's retirement had not been a mandatory one. "Against this backdrop, his application was treated as valid since he had passed three years after retirement." bd
