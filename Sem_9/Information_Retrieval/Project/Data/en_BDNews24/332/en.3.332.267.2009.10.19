 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)Arrangements for hajj pilgrims have been completed, state minister for religious affairs Md Shahjahan Miah has said, with the first flights to Saudi Arabia to depart this week. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will visit the hajj camp located near Zia International Airport on Tuesday, with flights to take off from Wednesday, he said. "There will be no problems this year. We have made faultless arrangements," said the state minister. He told bdnews24.com on Sunday that besides the scheduled flights, two planes are being kept on standby. "An advance team from the religious affairs ministry reached Saudi Arabia on Sunday. A medical team will also go. And a high-powered government delegation will reach there on November 21." The Hajj Agencies Association of Bangladesh (HAB) says agencies have ensured enough housing, which is often a problem. The association's general secretary MA Rashid Shah Samrat told bdnews24.com that 93 per cent of pilgrims from Bangladesh go under the arrangement of HAB members. "We have tried to ensure that hajjis have no complaints this year about arrangements. Regular complaints were raised in the past about their food and lodging provided by private agencies." Questioned about agency arrangements, the state minister said, "Steps will be taken against the persons responsible in case of any complaints. A 35-member administrative team is going to Saudi Arabia to oversee the arrangements. Besides, there are 179 guides." Hajj pilgrims started reporting to the hajj camp from Sunday. Shahjahan Miah will formally open the hajj camp at 5pm on Monday. This year some 58,460 men and women have applied to go for hajj. Of these, 8,043 are going under government arrangement and others under the private supervision Assistant hajj officer Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com that the prospective pilgrims must report to the camp three days before they want to fly, for travel formalities such as registration, vaccination and check ups to be completed. Pilgrims going under government arrangement will undergo customs clearance in the camp and others at the airport. Return flights for pilgrims will begin on Dec 2, say officials. bd
