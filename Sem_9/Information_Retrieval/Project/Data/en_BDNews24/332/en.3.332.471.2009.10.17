<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)The much-hyped "all-party" event to launch an anti-poverty campaign in Bangladesh started shortly after 3:30pm, but without the opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who backed out at the last moment. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, Speaker Abdul Hamid is chairing programme where finance minister A M A Muhith, chief whip Abdus Shahid and member secretary of All-Party Parliamentary Group Shishir Kumar Shil were on stage. Speaker Abdul Hamid said he was saddened that the main opposition chief had not joined the conference. The chief patron of the APPG, he said the programme was not a political one. "The nation was eagerly waiting to see the two leaders on the same stage. "I finalised the programme after getting her approval," Hamid said. "It hurt me that she did not attend the conference. She could have delivered her yesterday's statement on this stage. Hamid hoped to see the two leaders together sometime in the future. "There is no alternative to national consensus," the speaker said. He said he was neutrally discharging his duty as speaker. "The parliament is directed in line with the Constitution and the Rules of Procedures. The government never interferes here." Muhith said: "We were supposed to make a concerted pledge against poverty from this programme. It will be somewhat disturbed as the opposition chief has not come." Chief whip and APPG chairman Shahid said: "Refraining from attending the conference proves that Khaleda Zia does not want a Bangladesh free from poverty. "She does not want to work for the development of the country. Terming her statement on Friday 'untrue', he said: "She proved that she does not do what she says. Her lame excuses have surprised many even in her own party, Shahid claimed. Flanked by Shahid and opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque, speaker Hamid at a media briefing on Thursday said both Hasina and Khaleda would attend the opening function to launch the anti-poverty call. The programme, organised by the APPG as per Bangladesh's international commitment to halve the number of poor people by 2015, kicked off after Hasina had reached the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, the venue. National Committee against Poverty, Bangladesh National Parliament, and People's Empowerment Trust are assisting in the event. Khaleda and her arch political rival Hasina were scheduled to launch a call to combat poverty but she announced on Friday that she would not share the stage with her. Shil made his introductory speech and then United Nation's Millennium Campaign director Salil Shetty delivered his. Awami League MP Asaduzzaman Noor is conducting the programme. No BNP leader or MP was in attendance, though cabinet members and ruling AL MPs were there. Shetty said: "From the UN campaign for poverty side we've converted this day from seminars and speeches to a day which mobilises millions of ordinary people in the grassroots level in the programme "Stand up and take action against poverty, stand up and take action for the MDGs. "I am really pleased the parliament has taken the leadership to organise the event and is supporting this initiative. This is the body which can ensure execution of the programme." Millennium Development Goals were signed on Sep 29, 2000 by 189 world leaders both from rich and poor countries. "We've seen some big achievements, 40 million more children are now at schools, 800 million people have come out of poverty, 2 million lives of children have been saved," the UN official said. Bangladesh has made a commendable progress in many portions of the MDGs and it has been a high performer in comparison with many countries of the South Asia, Shetty said. It has made considerable headways in the fields of child mortality, action against malaria, sending children to schools and political challenges, he said. At Friday's news conference, Khaleda hit out at the Awami League-led government for not cooperating with the opposition. "Unilaterally cooperating with the government amounts to condone its crime, anarchy, repression and violation of human rights." The opposition chief said: "Observing the events over the last few days, we regret to announce that it will not be possible for us to join tomorrow's programme in the current circumstances." Shil said on Thursday that the UNDP had approved a budget of $ 1.28 lakh for the three-day programme. b
