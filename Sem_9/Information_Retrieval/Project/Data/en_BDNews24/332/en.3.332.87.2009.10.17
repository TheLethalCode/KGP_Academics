<TITLE> UK court wants to publish US intelligence on detainee </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sensitive US intelligence on former Guantanamo Bay inmate Binyam Mohamed should be published, Britain's High Court ruled on Friday in a move condemned by the British government but welcomed by anti-torture campaigners. In February, High Court judges said they would not release information on Mohamed's treatment supplied by U.S. intelligence. Washington had threatened to end intelligence cooperation if Britain released evidence about his alleged torture in detention, they said. But in a new ruling on Friday, the same judges said there was a "overwhelming" public interest in now disclosing the seven paragraphs cut from their original judgment. "As the risk to national security, judged objectively on the evidence, is not a serious one, we should restore the redacted paragraphs to our first judgment," they said. Mohamed, an Ethiopian with British residence, returned to Britain in February after being held at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for four years. He accused the U.S. government of inflicting "medieval" torture on him with British collusion. He was detained in April 2002 in Pakistan for trying to travel on a friend's passport. He was held for four months, when he says he was tortured and abused by Pakistani intelligence agents in the presence of British intelligence officers. In July 2002, he said he was taken to Morocco on a CIA plane and again tortured and abused for 18 months before a transfer to Afghanistan and then finally to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in September 2004. Mohamed says his genitals were cut with a scalpel, he was suspended from his wrists and he was subjected to "waterboarding," or simulated drowning, while in detention. U.S. authorities never charged him but at one time accused Mohamed of receiving training from al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Mohamed has denied receiving training. Mohamed told the BBC on Friday: "There is information in there, I'm 99 percent sure, which states that the US sub-contracted the UK government to do its dirty work." The seven paragraphs will not be released for now however, after the British government served notice that it would appeal. "The government is deeply disappointed by the judgment ... which concludes that a summary of U.S. intelligence material should be put into the public domain against their wishes," Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement. SUPPORTERS PLEASED Katherine O'Shea, a spokeswoman for legal charity Reprieve which supports Mohamed, said: "We're thrilled with the ruling. It upholds what we've always said -- the public has the right to know what was done to Binyam, and by whom." The British government has repeatedly denied its intelligence agents were complicit in overseas torture but police said last month they were investigating an incident involving intelligence agents operating overseas. The judges' initial decision not to publish the contested paragraphs sparked a debate about secrecy and alleged rights violations in the U.S. "war on terror" and raised questions about the close ties between Britain and the United States.
