 KABUL, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghanistan's election commission was preparing to announce a final result in the country's disputed election on Tuesday, as President Hamid Karzai looked set to agree to a run-off amid mounting global pressure. The UN-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) sent its long-awaited findings of an investigation into fraud in the Aug. 20 poll and the Afghan Independent Election Commission (IEC) is now assessing the report and will announce on Tuesday if Karzai will face a run-off. "Our commissioners are meeting now to discuss the figures sent by the ECC and will announce a final decision today," IEC spokesman Noor Mohammad Noor said. The heavily disputed Aug. 20 vote has fanned tension between Karzai and the West and complicated US President Barack Obama's decision on whether to send thousands more US troops to Afghanistan to fight a resurgent Taliban. The US group Democracy International said the ECC report showed the number of votes invalidated by the UN-backed group pushed Karzai's total below the 50 percent needed to avoid a run-off. Provisional results had given Karzai 54.6 percent. Western sources have said that Karzai is likely to accept a second round verdict by the IEC. Analysts say Karzai -- who is a Pashtun, Afghanistan's largest ethnic group -- is likely to win a runoff, but the scale of fraud alleged in the first round may continue to cast a shadow over the legitimacy of his rule. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she expected word from Karzai on Tuesday and hoped for a quick solution. "I am going to let him do that but I am encouraged at the direction that the situation is moving," Clinton told reporters. "I am very hopeful that we will see a resolution in line with the constitutional order in the next several days." Karzai indicated in private meetings this week, including with Senator John Kerry, he would be open to taking part in a run-off with his main challenger, Abdullah Abdullah, but did not commit to a specific timetable, Western sources told Reuters. But officials cautioned that Karzai could still change his mind and there was likely to be intense political haggling. The United States cannot wait for problems surrounding the Afghan government's legitimacy to be resolved before making a decision on troops, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said late on Monday. However other Obama administration officials have said there must be a legitimate and credible partner in place in Kabul for any new Afghan strategy to succeed. Casualties are rising among the 68,000 U.S. troops already in Afghanistan and many Americans are tiring of war. The US and NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley McChrystal, has recommended sending 40,000 additional soldiers to seize the initiative back from Taliban militants. POWER-SHARING DEAL ? Democracy International and the Washington-based US Institute of Peace both said the ECC's audit showed Karzai had about 48.3 percent of the vote. Abdullah's total rose to about 31 percent from 28 percent. Under Afghan law, the Afghan government-appointed Independent Election Commission (IEC) must accept the findings, recalculate the tallies and then announce final results. "Everything we are hearing is pointing at the second round. That is what we are bracing for," a Western diplomat in Kabul said. But Zalmay Khalilzad, a former US ambassador to Afghanistan, said from his conversations with Karzai this week, the Afghan president was also open to a power-sharing deal with Abdullah. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, said he was ready to go to a second round and would discuss with Karzai what to do if a run-off proved impossible due to poor weather and security as the Afghan winter closed in. Gates said he was confident US and NATO forces could provide security for a run-off, should one be decided, but added bad winter weather could prevent Afghans from voting. "I think the key consideration before us at this point is actually less (one of) security ... (it's) the weather," he said. "So getting something done before winter sets in will be very importan
