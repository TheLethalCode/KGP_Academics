 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a defence petition to ban the state counsels from the appeals hearing on the grounds of late submission of a 'concise statement' in the Bangabandhu assassination appeals hearing. Advocate Khan Saifur Rahman, lawyer for death convict Syed Farukur Rahman, filed the petition on Sept 29 seeking to have the top state counsels removed for their failure to meet a deadline for submitting the 'concise statement', or summary, of their arguments against the appeals. The petition was filed on behalf of Syed Faruk Rahman, the dismissed lieutenant colonel of Bangladesh Army, and retired lieutenant colonel Mohiuddin Ahmed (artillery). At the start of the 13th day of sitting, the five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam heard the petition on the summary for over an hour. Rahman told the court: "The leave to appeal was included on the cause list on Oct 23, 2007. There is an obligation of submitting the summary within 30 days of the leave to appeal." "Since the prosecution submitted the summary on Aug 23 this year, it has lost the right to participate in the hearing," he said. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam contested the contention, saying: "The rule was made for the convenience of the court, but it was not mandatory." He said: "Though the prosecution could not submit the summary at the proper time the court received it. This means that the court has accepted the prosecution's summary." "The court can accept the summary pardoning the delay." Alam cited examples of the higher courts of India and Pakistan in such case. Chief state prosecutor advocate Anisul Haque citing an example of Pakistan Supreme Court said that the case was not hampered for the late submission of the concise statement. The case was not even hampered if the summary was not submitted, he said. In his reply, Rahman said the examples given on the late submission of summary happened in the civil cases. "It is a criminal case," he pointed out. After the court rejected the petition, Rahman began delivering his arguments on behalf of Faruk. He said the two-member High Court bench had given a split verdict. It was later sent to a third judge. The third judge only gave resolution on six convicts instead of the whole case, Rahman said. He cited examples of several related cases in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The case was sent to the third judge to resolve the split verdict. He gave his verdict only trying six convicts and did not give any explanation on nine remaining convicts, Rahman said. Of the six convicts the third judge upheld the sentence of three convicts and acquitted the remainder, the counsel said. At the end of the verdict he upheld the death sentence of 12 convicts. The third judge has the authority to give verdict on his own, he said. He then gave examples of a number of cases in India. Rahman continued: "The two-member High Court bench was divided over taking into cognisance the confessional statements of the three convicts. "The third bench took only one's confessional statement into congnisance," he said. Starting at 9:45am, Wednesday's hearing ended at 1:30pm. In the beginning the court again warned barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, the first defence counsel, for his Tuesday's briefing. The court said Mamun briefed the media on those statements he did not deliver before the court. Everybody was asked to be cautious about delivering statements on the contents of the case, it said. The court summoned Mamun and asked him: "Did you deliver any presentation to the court on sending the case to the trial court again? "Why did you tell the media so without giving any such statement in the court? We warned you earlier." Mamun apologised to the court for his comments. Khan Saifur Rahman did not comment before the media after the hearing. He told bdnews24.com: "I won't make any comment on issues pending trial." Alam, the attorney general, told reporters after the hearing that the defence cannot refrain the prosecution from participating in the hearing on the grounds of the late submission of the concise statement. The court had dismissed the petition, he said. A newly formed Supreme Court bench began hearing the long-stalled appeals by death convicts on Oct 5 to conclude the Mujib assassination case more than three decades after the bloody carnage. After reading out of the case paperbook, arguments hearing on the appeals started on Oct 15. The top court on the fourth day heard the concluding arguments of barrister Mamun that the entire armed forces were involved with the assassination of independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, but suggested the then deputy army chief Ziaur Rahman was not. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators of the military coup and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. President Mujib's personal assistant Muhitul Islam finally filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001, Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe. bdne
