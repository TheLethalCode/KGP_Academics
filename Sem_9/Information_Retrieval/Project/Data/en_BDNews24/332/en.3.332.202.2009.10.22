<TEXT>
 Cox's Bazar, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Rifles questioned Myanmar about the latter's reported troop build-up along the shared border at a flag meeting Wednesday. Lt Col Mozzammel Hossain, commander of 42 Rifles Battalion, who led the talks for Bangladesh, said The two-hour meeting was held in the southern Myanmar town of Moungdaw from 11am. Hossain told bdnews24.com after his return, "We asked about their army deployment at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border." "They completely denied it." He said Nasaka claimed they were conducting normal activities along with erecting a fence to stop border crime. They also said any other contention was "a figment of Bangladeshi media". A number of Bangladesh newspapers and foreign news agencies have reported escalating tensions in recent days, with Myanmar mobilising heavy forces along their side of the border and Bangladesh replying with similar action. The reports have also suggested that Myanmar was trying to push thousands of the Muslim minority Rohingya population into Bangladesh as they did in 1991-92. Hossain quoted Nasaka's Sector 6 commander Lt Col Ne Meu, leading the Myanmar delegation, as saying, "No extra army deployment has occurred at the borders. We are only performing our regular activities." "We are erecting barbed wire fencing in compliance to international border laws. It is to stop illegal immigration and smuggling," "The situation at the Bangladesh-Myanmar border is normal. Both border forces have a warm relationship. But Bangladeshi media is raising false allegations against Myanmar," Meu was reported to have said. Another BDR officer, Maj Abu Nayeem, said, "Mention of the 'Rohingya push' during the meeting was deemed as not courteous by them, they said that there is no group termed 'Rohingya' in Myanmar. They requested Bangladesh to refer to illegal immigrants as 'Myanmar citizens' or 'Myanmar Muslims'." Nayeem also said Nasaka handed over nine Bangladeshi nationals to BDR. "Of them, seven are from Naikhangchhari and two from Ramu." BDR also informed Nasaka that about 89 Myanmar nationals were waiting to be repatriated after jail terms here. The list was handed over to the Myanmar border officials. Nasaka in return handed over a list of 53 Bangladeshis in their jails. Lt Col Mozzammel Hossain said they would make the exchanges at a suitable time. bdn
