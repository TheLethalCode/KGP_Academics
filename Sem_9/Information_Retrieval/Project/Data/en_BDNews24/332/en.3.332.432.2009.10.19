 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court ordered Rid Pharmaceuticals managing director Mizanur Rahman to jail on Monday after his surrender to authorities earlier in the month facing charges of manufacturing a toxic paracetamol product that caused the deaths of at least 25 children. Metropolitan sessions judge ANM Bashirullah rejected the bail petition filed by Mizanur on Oct 12, the day he surrendered. The judge in his order said that innocent children were killed after the intake of toxic syrup produced by the company. Though the accused was not present at the scene of the deaths, the children died after taking syrup made by his company, said the judge. "There is no scope to show any compassion to the accused by allowing him bail," judge Bashirullah added. Mizanur's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman told the bail hearing that the whole affair was manufactured by the media and the case was filed against his client for reasons of business enmity. Public prosecutor Abdullah Abu and assistant commissioner of the police prosecution department Mokbul Hossain were also present in court. Mizanur and his wife Sheuly Rahman, a director of the company, had earlier sought anticipatory bail on Aug 18 from a High Court bench before their surrender. The HC granted Sheuly six months' anticipatory bail but ordered Mizanur to surrender before the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court. The metropolitan sessions judge was also given authority to consider any bail plea by Mizanur on surrender. The Directorate of Drug Administration filed the case on Aug 10 against five officials of Rid Pharma for manufacturing a children's paracetamol syrup that was found to contain a toxic ingredient. The court issued arrest warrants the next day. The Drug Administration had ordered Rid Pharma, on July 21, to halt manufacture and marketing of all its products, including the children's paracetamol preparation after it was initially linked by the media to renal failure leading to the deaths of children. On July 29, health minister AFM Ruhal Haque announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical diethylene glycol in the paracetamol syrup produced by the company that was suspected of killing more than 25 children across the country. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was allegedly used in the preparation as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol. b
