<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The Jeddah-bound first Hajj flight carrying some 518 pilgrims to Saudi Arabia took off from Zia International Airport on Wednesday noon. Civil aviation and tourism minister GM Qader and religious affairs state minister Md Shahjahan Miah were at the airport to see the first Hajj flight take off. In 2009, a total 58,634 pilgrims from Bangladesh will perform the Hajj, of whom 8,043 under government management and the rest are supposed to make it under various non-government arrangements. Biman Bangladesh Airlines will carry 38,634 pilgrims and Saudi Arabian Airlines will carry the rest of them. After inaugurating the flight, Qader said, "We've already hired a Boeing 747 and agreements have been signed for hiring two more similar aircraft for operating the Hajj flights." "The two planes will arrive on Thursday and Friday. We should have no difficulty in transporting the pilgrims this year." He said, Biman's own DC-10 carrying pilgrims will leave on Wednesday afternoon and the Jeddah-bound night flights will also carry some pilgrims. The pilgrims, however, sounded apprehensive about the quality of guide services as the guides appointed this year have reportedly no past experience in Hajj guidance. Md Ali Azam, a pilgrim travelling by the first Hajj flight told bdnews24.com, "My guide has told me he has had no experience of working as a Hajj guide. Therefore, I'm a bit apprehensive about what is in store for me there." When the religious affairs state minister was asked about the guides, the tourism minister volunteered to explain on the former's behalf, "The religious affairs state minister has assured me that that all guides employed are experienced. But still we'll check out about the allegation and rectify any lapses, if found." ZIA sources said, Bangladesh Biman will operate 77 dedicated flights for carrying Hajj pilgrims from Oct 21 to Nov 21 and 68 dedicated flights again from Dec 1 to Jan 1, 2010 for bringing the pilgrims back home. Besides, the Jeddah-bound regular flights will carry Hajj pilgrims. Devotees will perform the Hajj in end-November, subject to sighting of the Jilhajj moon. Religious affairs state minister Md Shahjahan Miah said on Sunday all preparations were made to ensure the Hajj pilgrims' journey safe and sound. "It's not likely that the pilgrims will suffer any flight anomalies this time. We left no stone unturned to manage and execute the Hajj flights smoothly," said the minister. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited the Hajj camp at Ashkona near ZIA on Tuesday. MA Rashid Shah Shamrat, general secretary, Hajj Association of Bangladesh (HAB), said his organisation had been working tirelessly to ensure accommodation and all other services for the Hajj pilgrims. In recent past, most pilgrims used to perform Hajj under private arrangements. Pilgrims have been complaining all along that arrangements for accommodation and meals etc organised by private companies for the Hajj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia had always been in a mess. The return flights carrying the Hajjis after the pilgrimage will start arriving from Dec 2 and by Dec 27 most of the pilgrims are expected to return home. bdne
