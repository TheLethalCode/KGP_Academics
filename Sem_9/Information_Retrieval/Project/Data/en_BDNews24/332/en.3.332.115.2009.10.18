<TITLE> US trade official arrives in Dhaka </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)The US assistant trade representative Michael J Delaney arrived in Dhaka Sunday on a five-day visit to Bangladesh. This is Delaney's first visit to the country, which has been lobbying for duty-free market access of its ready-made garments and shrimp to the US. Foreign ministry sources say Delaney will meet the foreign minister, commerce minister and labour minister during his visit. The office of the USTR is very important for Bangladesh's market access as it holds hearings on labour standards in the exporting countries. Meeting US labour standards is one of the conditions for getting such facility. A press statement issued by the local American Centre said he would hold discussions with government officials on trade issues between the US and Bangladesh. "He will also take a tour of Chittagong and talk to both government and private sector officials there," said the statement.
