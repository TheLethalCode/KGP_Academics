 TEHRAN, Oct 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed 29 people, including six senior Revolutionary Guards commanders, in a rebel attack on Sunday in Iran's turbulent southeast blamed on foreign-backed elements, Iranian media reported. State television said a local Sunni rebel group had claimed responsibility for staging the attack, the worst on the elite Revolutionary Guards in recent years. Another 28 people were injured in the attack on a meeting with tribal chiefs. But the Guards themselves accused "foreign elements" linked to the United States of involvement and state TV also pointed the finger at Britain, another long-standing foe of Iran. The bombing and allegations of foreign involvement are likely to raise tension between Tehran and the West, a day before nuclear talks in Vienna including Iranian, US, French and Russian officials. TV reported that a rebel group called Jundollah (God's soldiers) -- linked by some analysts to the Taliban in neighbouring Pakistan and led by Abdolmalek Rigi -- was to blame. "Rigi's terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the attack," it said. State Press TV said the attacker had detonated explosives strapped to his body during a gathering of tribal heads, adding that civilians and tribal leaders were also among the victims. The Revolutionary Guards blamed "foreign elements" linked to the United States, which Tehran accuses the United States of backing Jundollah to create instability in the country, a charge that Washington denies. State broadcaster IRIB said the attack occurred in the morning at the gates of a conference hall in the city of Sarbaz in Sistan-Baluchestan. The province is the scene of frequent clashes between security forces, Sunni rebels and drug traffickers. Two high-ranking commanders among the dead were the deputy head of the Guards' ground forces, General Nourali Shoushtari, and the Guards' commander in Sistan-Baluchestan province, General Mohammadzadeh, news agencies reported. Shoushtari was also a senior official of the Guard's elite Qods force. Citing authorities and experts, a presenter of English-language Press TV said "the finger of accusation is directly pointed at the Jundollah group," referring to ethnic Baluch Sunni insurgents who have been blamed for previous attacks in the region. FOREIGN ELEMENTS The Revolutionary Guards accused the United States of involvement. "Surely foreign elements, particularly those linked to the global arrogance, were involved in this attack," a Guards statement quoted by television said. Iran often uses the term "global arrogance" to refer to the United States, its old foe. There was no immediate comment on the attack by Washington. The Revolutionary Guards is an elite force seen as fiercely loyal to the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution. It handles security in sensitive border areas. State TV also singled out Britain. "Some informed sources said the British government was directly involved in the terrorist attack ... by organising, supplying equipment and employing professional terrorists," it said. The Foreign Office did not directly comment on the accusation but said in a statement that Britain "condemns the terrorist attack in the province of Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran and the sad loss of life which it caused. "Terrorism is abhorrent wherever it occurs" it said, expressing sympathy for the victims and their families. The Revolutionary Guards said the aim of Sunday's attack was to foment sectarian strife in the region. Jundollah, which claimed responsibility for a bomb attack on a Shi'ite mosque in May that killed 25 people, says it is fighting for the rights of Iran's minority Sunnis. Some analysts believe that Jundollah has evolved through shifting alliances with various parties, including the Taliban and Pakistan's ISI intelligence service, who saw the group as a tool against Iran. Predominantly Shi'ite Muslim Iran has also linked Jundollah to the Sunni Islamist al Qaeda network. Most people in Sistan-Baluchestan are Sunni Muslims and ethnic Baluchis. Iran rejects allegations by Western rights groups that it discriminates against ethnic and religious minorit
