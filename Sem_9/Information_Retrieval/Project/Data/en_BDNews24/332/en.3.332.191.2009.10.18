 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court resumed its second day's hearing arguments on the Bangabandhu appeals on Sunday after a two-day recess. Barrister Abdullah Al Mamun, who delivered his arguments on the appeal by death convict retired Major Bazlul Huda, claimed his client innocent. Mamun, while reading out the testimony by witness Abdul Quddus, said Maj Huda had gone to the airport with Bangabandhu's body after killing him. Huda had earlier carried the remaining nine bodies to Banani. He had also gone to Mohammadpur to procure ten wooden crates for carrying the bodies. Mamun said: "It is not humanly possible to run so many errands after committing a murder. One generally becomes quite abnormal after killing anyone." The five-judge Appellate Division bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began the hearing at 9:45am. The apex court on the Thursday's arguments on appeals heard that both local and foreign machinations were involved in the killing of the then Bangladesh president and independence leader 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Earlier on Wednesday, the bench concluded the hearings on rulings given by previous judges on the case. The freshly formed bench headed by Justice Mohammed Tafazzal Islam began hearing the appeals on Mujib murder case on Oct 5. A day before, chief justice M M Ruhul Amin constituted the bench with justices Mohammed Abdul Aziz, Bijoy Kumar Das, Mohammed Mozammel Hossain and Surendra Kumar Sinha being the other members. None was allowed to file a case immediately after the assassination of the president and independence hero 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on Aug 15, 1975. The government of Khandker Mustaque Ahmed that was installed after the bloody military coup passed an ordinance in November that year indemnifying the perpetrators and closing the door on the possibility of a trial. The Awami League government revoked the indemnity ordinance in 1996 and cleared the way for the trial. Then, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's personal assistant Muhitul Islam filed a case on Oct 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 24 persons. On Nov 8, 1998, Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul awarded death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Four of the convictsMajor (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruk Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmedappealed to the High Court against the verdict. On Dec 14, 2000, the High Court gave a split verdict in the caseJustice Md Ruhul Amin upheld death sentences of 10 of the convicts but Justice A B M Khairul Haque retained death sentences of all the 15. On April 30, 2001 Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim of a third High Court bench upheld death sentences of 12 and acquitted three. Of the 12 death convicts, four submitted 'leave to appeal' in the Appellate Division in the same year. Another death convict, lancer AKM Mohiuddin, made an appeal from jail after he was deported from the United States on June 18 last year. Of those having received death sentence, former Lt col Abdur Rashid, Lt Col Shariful Haq Dalim, Lt Col Noor, Risalder Moslemuddin, Lt Col Rashed Chowdhury and Capt Majed are absconding. Absconding convict Aziz Pasha died in exile in Zimbabwe.
