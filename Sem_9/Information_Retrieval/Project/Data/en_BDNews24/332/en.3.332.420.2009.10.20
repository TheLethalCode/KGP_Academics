 KHARTOUM, Oct 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Khartoum government said on Monday that US President Barack Obama's new policy on Sudan had positive points and was a strategy of engagement, not isolation.

Salahadin expressed disappointment that the White House was still using the term "genocide" for the conflict in Darfur. "It's unfortunate that the administration insists on using the word genocide...but it does not reflect the realities in Darfur," he said.

Khartoum mobilized mostly Arab militias to crush the uprising, unleashing a wave of violence. The conflict has since descended into a free-for-all involving bandits, rival tribes and rebel splinter factions.
