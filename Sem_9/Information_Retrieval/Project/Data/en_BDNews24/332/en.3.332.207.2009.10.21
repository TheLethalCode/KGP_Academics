 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)--The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Tuesday gave the communication ministry the go-ahead to invite bids from experienced firms for construction of a metro rail and an elevated expressway in capital Dhaka at an estimated Tk 15,000 crore. The committee set aside the ministry's proposal to consider an unsolicited tender offer but gave it the nod to pick pre-qualified investors through the open tender for a final selection. It also approved a similar tender for finding a contractor to build a second four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong highway and suggested going for an altogether new elevated four-lane Dhaka-Chittagong expressway, officials with the knowledge of the matter said. The committee at a meeting at the Cabinet Division with finance minister A M A Muhith in the chair also cleared the foreign ministry to conduct a seismic survey in the Bay of Bengal to prepare a fully fledged report to be submitted to UN for arbitration on maritime boundary disputes with neighbouring India and Myanmar. It was decided that the shipping ministry will prepare a draft project proposal for assistance from development partners for construction of a deep-sea port.
