 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)The government has lowered the flood danger levels of the Jamuna to give earlier flood warnings and better protect Sirajganj town and the Bangabandhu Bridge approach road from the strong currents of the historically unpredictable river. Officials say the Water Development Board has reduced the danger levels at the three most vulnerable points along the Sirajganj Town Protection EmbankmentSirajganj, Kazipur and Mathurapara. If any one of the three points is damaged, the adjacent Sirajganj town and the approach road to Bangabandhu Bridge are likely to be inundated within hours, they feared. Md Salim Bhuiyan, a WDB superintendent engineer, told bdnews24.com that the danger level at Sirajganj point has been reduced to 13.35 metres from 13.75 metres and Kazipur's danger level lowered to 14.85 metres instead of the previous 15.24 metres. Mathurapara danger level is now down to 16.7 metres from 16.77 metres, according to Bhuiyan. "We have reduced the danger levels at the three most critical points of the Jamuna in Sirajganj district for better preparation ahead of serious flooding," said Bhuiyan, now in-charge of the board's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre. "The (water development) board has already approved the proposal," he said. The bridge's approach road and the Sirajganj town have been fully protected by the dyke built only since the construction of the country's largest (4.8 km long) bridge over the mighty Jamuna. The semi-circular shaped dyke saw some serious breaches on July 10 and 17 this year. One of the holes was 3 metres wide, which could have destroyed the town and approach road, according to the water board officials. Board engineers, locals and navy divers working together for several days at a time managed to stop further erosion on those occasions. The breaches have also rung alarm bells for the structural integrity of the Jamuna Bridge, situated just 8 kilometres away from the Sirajganj point. Bangabandhu Bridge is a strategic installation which connects 16 agriculturally rich northern districts with the capital. The board formed a probe body to investigate the causes of July dyke breaks. The body, headed by Salim Bhuiyan, recommended lowering of the Jamuna danger levels for better management of such incidents in future. "The danger levels are set to give warning of floods. Besides, it makes board officials extra cautious about flooding," Shawkat Ali, another superintendent engineer, told bdnews24.com. "The engineers will now be taking better preparations as soon as the river's water level hits 13.55 metres (in Sirajganj) instead of the previous 13.75 metres," he said. Bhuiyan also said the lowered danger levels would give more time for people to evacuate before approaching floods. In 2007-08, swelling water of the Jamuna caused a series of destructive floods inundating almost the whole of Sirajganj town. Thousands of households went under water during the hours of the deluge. Flood water stood for weeks causing huge damage to the standing crops and property and spreading diseases in its aftermath.
