 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)-- Awami League MP Abdul Jalil, whose controversial comments about his own party created a political storm in recent times, has been sued for tax evasion. The National Board of Revenue filed the case on Thursday with Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court for Dhaka on charges of evading Tk 4 lakh in income tax after hiding income worth Tk 54 lakh. The case was filed at around 2:20pm after completing the court formalities. The hearing will take place at 3:30pm, additional public prosecutor Shah Alam Talukder of Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court told bdnews24.com. There was information of abnormal transaction in the bank accounts of Jalil and his wife at different times, which is not relevant with his income tax return statement. There were savings accounts and FDR in the name of their children, which were not mentioned in the income tax return statement. The disgruntled former AL general secretary was removed from the chair of the parliamentary standing committee on commerce ministry on Oct 6 after he returned home from the UK the same day. Jalil inferred in media interviews in London that the Awami League won the ninth parliamentary elections with the backing of the military-installed caretaker government. He also said that he should have challenged Sheikh Hasina to retain his party post as general secretary after his return from treatment in Singapore earlier this year. He went to Singapore last year after falling seriously ill during his detention by the caretaker government. He has alleged that he was tortured in custody. Since then, he has made various criticisms of his party and party chief Hasina, alongside allegations against the past caretaker government, culminating in the most recent controversy. Jalil later apologised for the outpouring of emotion, from London, for the allegation against his party saying such a comment came from his grievance against military intelligence agency DGFI that tortured him during detention. He also claimed his comments were 'misinterpreted'. There was another case against Jalil related to hiding information on wealth. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against him. Jalil was arrested on May 28, 2007. He went to Singapore for treatment on March 2, 2008 after he was released on parole. The High Court on Oct 20, 2008 granted him bail in the wealth related case. b
