 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--Government-run Telephone Shilpa Sangstha (TSS) has resumed making telephone sets after a break of seven years. Initially, it will cater for government offices before commercially marketing the sets. "The production of land-phone sets have resumed at TSS factory after a long stop on Saturday. An average of two hundred sets is distributed every day," TSS managing director Mohammed Ismail told bdnews24.com on Monday. "Official distribution of these sets has started from Monday morning. Around 50 sets were distributed at the prime minister's office and telecommunications ministry. On Sunday, 100 sets were distributed at the Ganabhaban." TSS will give Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd 2,000 sets before marketing sets to private companies. Ismail said the 8,080 sets will be made in the first batch, with full-fledged production starting in January. The process of importing spare parts is underway. "Even though it is not very profitable initially hundreds of workers who had been sitting idle at TSS are now at work. A Chinese company called Goldsim is providing us with technical assistance." "Currently the sets with caller ID are priced at Tk 700. Plans of producing cordless and semi-cordless sets in the future are there. But in that case prices would change." Officials at TSS said other than land-phone sets, plans are there to diversify production to electric meters, mobile-phone handsets, parts and laptop computers, reducing import dependency. A full operating TSS will require further recruitment to 300-strong workforce. The factory at Tongi has been out of operations from 2002. It was established in 1967 as Telephone Industries Corporation under a joint venture between the government of Pakistan and Siemens AG, West Germany. Siemens later handed their share to the government for free. TIC was transformed into Telephone Shilpa Sangstha Ltd after independence. The 2007-08 caretaker government took steps to reinvigorate the company a. The incumbent government has attempted to make the company fully operational. A relevant parliamentary standing committee has asked the on telecommuncation ministry to get the company make affordable land and mobile-phone handsets and laptops. Hasanul Huq Inu, the head of the committee, said last month that TSS was looking to manufacture and sell mobile-phone sets for the local market from January. He also said the decisions have been taken to offset the losses the company had been incurring for years. bd
