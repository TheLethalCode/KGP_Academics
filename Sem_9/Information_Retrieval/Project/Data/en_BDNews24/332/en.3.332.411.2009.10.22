Considering the costs, these will be installed first in new buildings and then gradually in old buildings, he said. Asked how much energy will be saved, he said, "We will have to build the mentality of saving first. If we can match usage with production, then 10 to 30 percent electricity can be saved."

German Technical Co-operation (gtz) programme coordinator Dietrich Stotz spoke among others. The workshop titled 'Go-green series: Energy saving = cost saving' was organised by DCCI and gtz. b
