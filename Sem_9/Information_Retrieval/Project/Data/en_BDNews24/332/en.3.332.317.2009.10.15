 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)The National Committee on Protection of Oil, Gas and Mineral Resources, Power and Ports on Thursday submitted a 'draft bill' to a parliamentary watchdog, opposing gas and coal exports in any form for the next 50 years. The pressure group of left-leaning politicians and professionals asked the parliamentary standing committee on energy ministry to recommend cancellation of the Model Production Sharing Contract (PSCs) with foreign oil companies and invite fresh tenders for gas blocks bidding. Sheikh Mohammed Shahidullah, convenor of the National Committee, told reporters that his team had specifically pointed out at the meeting that the PSC had gas export provision. Standing committee chairman Subid Ali Bhuiyan said the Model PSC-2008 did not contain any specific provision for export. Committee member Abdul Matin Khasru said the national committee's draft bill "was not bill at all". He also said the standing committee was not convinced by the national committee's statement and would sit with its leaders again. "I am a lawmaker. Is it a bill? This is not a bill at all," Khasru told journalists at the media centre in parliament building. "Will any oil company sign PSC if we say first that you cannot export gas?" He said the PSCs were framed in line with the PSCs signed in 10 other countries. The committee chairman said as per the PSC-2008, the international oil companies would first offer Petrobangla if it could explore gas in the Bay. It would sell gas, Bhuiyan said, to the local market if the Petrobangla refused buying the same. "If the local market cannot consume, the companies will export the gas in LNG form (liquefied natural gas)," said the chairman. Khasru backed him: "We have huge demand in the domestic market. So, the question of exporting gas does not come." "We just told them that we are not convinced. So, we will sit with you again." On scrapping the PSC, committee chairman Bhuiyan said, "Can an international agreement be cancelled? It can be modified." Shahidullah told reporters after the meeting, "We have submitted a draft law for passage in parliament for banning exports of all minerals (gas, oil and coal) for the next 50 years for energy security of the country. "We will not allow our mineral to be exported at any cost." He claimed that the standing committee members agreed with them that Bangladesh could not export gas. The national committee's member-secretary Anu Muhammad said, "We have pinpointed the provisions of the PSC having export options." "If this government prohibits gas and coal export, no government in future will dare export them," he said. "We have demanded cancellation of the PSCs and go for fresh bidding." Fazle Noor Taposh, a committee member, told reporters it would take five years to get gas if the government signed PSCs with the companies now. "If we do not go for gas exploration now, India and Myanmar will take our oil and gas away," said Taposh, a nephew of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, also energy minister. Khasru said Bangladesh did not have enough money for oil and gas exploration which involved huge investment. "So, we need the international oil companies and the PSCs", he said. The military-installed interim government in 2008 signed an agreement with US ConocoPhillips and Irish company Tullow Oil for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. The government in August approved the proposal to award ConocoPhilips and Tullow contracts to explore oil and gas in three offshore blocks. ConocoPhillips, the third largest energy company in the US, will get deep-sea blocks 10 and 11. Shallow-sea block 5 will be awarded to Irish company Tullow that already operates in Bangladesh's Bhangura gas field. The government will soon sign the PSCs with the two companies soon, energy ministry sources say. The National Committee is protesting against the deals which it claims would allow the two foreign companies to export up to 80 percent of gas extracted. The government has said the committee is confusing the public on the issue with such false information. The National Committee called a general strike in capital Dhaka on Sept 2 protesting the government's move for "oil and gas export". The parliamentary standing committee, which backed the government for signing the PSCs, invited the national committee leaders to the parliamentary body for talks.
