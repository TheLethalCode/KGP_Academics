 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy was released on bail Tuesday after spending eight days behind bars on illegal wealth charges. Emerging from Dhaka Central Jail at around 11:15am, Goyeshwar told reporters: "I was sent to jail ahead of our party council as part of a conspiracy." Dhaka Special Judge's Court No 3 sent the BNP leader and to jail, denying him bail, on Oct 12, nine months after the case was originally filed. The High Court granted Goyeshwar interim bail on Sunday. On Monday, he said: "Plots are being made against BNP. The leaders are being sent to jail before our council." The party has announced it will hold its national council on Dec 8. The senior opposition leader demanded release of all BNP leaders across the country. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Goyeshwar with Ramna Police Station on Jan 5, accusing him of holding illegal wealth totalling Tk 2.68 crore and hiding information in a wealth statement to the graft watchdog. Goyeshwar surrendered before the High Court on March 9 seeking anticipatory bail. The HC granted him bail until submission of a charge sheet, which was pressed on July 5. On Aug 16, the HC ordered the BNP leader to show up before the Special Judge's Court within eight weeks after the defence requested a bail extension. bdne
