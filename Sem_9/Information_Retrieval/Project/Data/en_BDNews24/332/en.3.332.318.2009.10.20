 Chittagong, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)--Five militants of banned Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh including 'Bomber Mizan' have been sentenced to eight years in prison for a series bomb attack in Cox's Bazar in 2005. Judge Mohammed Shafiqul Karim of Chittagong Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal on Tuesday found Abdul Malek alias Laltu, Shahadat Ali alias Masum Billah, Naimuzzaman alias Zafar alias Sohagh and Monirul Islam alias Saifullah. All are in prison now. Three other militants including JMB commander Javed Iqbal alias Mohammad were acquitted. Two more, Shafiqul Islam alias Abdullah and Abdul Hafiz alias Khalil, are in the prison because there are other cases against them. Other two defendants in the case, top JMB leaders Shaokh Abdur Rahman and Ataur Rahman Sunny were acquitted because they had been hanged. Five places of Cox's Bazar were bombed simultaneously on Aug 17, 2005 when the JMB carried out a series bomb attack. They bombed the district and senior judge's court premises, Nazrul Boarding in Laldighir Par, the deputy commissioner's office, Modhuphul Sweetmeats on Masjid Road and the Cox's Bazar Bus terminal. Police filed two separate cases--one under the Explosives Act and the other for being involved in subversive activities--against the state. Tuesday's verdict was delivered in the case filed under the Explosives Act after taking deposition of 24 witnesses, said public prosecutor Mohammad Ayyub Khan. Commander Javed Iqbal had supplied the accessories of bombs but he was acquitted because of lack of evidence, Khan said. The charge sheet was submitted at the court by the investigation officer of the case, sub-inspector Humaun Kabir, on Nov 9, 2005. Charges were framed at the court on March 31 this year, said Khan. b
