 By Syed Nahas Pasha London, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)An exhibition of paintings by one of the UK's most innovative artists Jamie Hewlett is being held in the heartland of London's Bangladeshi community Brick Lane. The 'Under Water Colours' show by Hewlett, known for Gorillaz, Tank Girl and Monkey: Journey to the West, includes nine watercolours of a trip he made with Oxfam to Char Atra in Bangladesh earlier this year. The exhibition, organised by international development agency Oxfam, opened to the public on October 17 and continues to October 31 at the Dray Walk gallery, just off Brick Lane. Among the people Hewlett met during his trip in Bangladesh were families trying to raise their homes above the flood levels, parents who had lost children to floods and children who have swum to school with books on their heads determined not to allow floods prevent them from getting an education. Hewlett says: "Char Atra is such an idyllic place and it's horrific to think of it being simply washed away, devastating the community." "I wanted my paintings to be optimistic as well as realistic and I wanted to show what a beautiful place it is." "I hope by concentrating on the people and their every day lives that I have given people here in Britain something they can relate to." "This exhibition shows how climate change is already affecting people around the world but also how we can all do something now to stop this from getting completely out of control." Drawings by some of the children Jamie met showing what climate change means to them will also be on display at the exhibition, along with photographs, film and stories collected in Bangladesh by Oxfam. Eighty percent of Bangladesh's landmass is floodplain. The tiny country, with a population of 149 million, projected to grow to 231 million by 2050, has a population density of 1045 per sq km, the 11th highest in the world. It accounts for less than 10 percent of South Asia's land mass but channels more than 90 percent of South Asian water to the Bay of Bengal. The exhibition is being launched just weeks before the UN's Copenhagen climate talks in December. There, rich nations will be pressed to take the lead in negotiating a deal that prevents dangerous temperature rises and protects the world's poor, who are already feeling its effects despite being least responsible. According to scientific reports, to be presented at the Copenhagen summit, 26 million people have already been displaced because of climate change and 200 million people may be on the move each year by 2050 because of hunger, environmental degradation and loss of land. International charity Oxfam's climate change campaign is calling for rich countries to lead on cutting global emissions by 40 percent on 1990 levels by 2020. Average carbon emissions per year per person in the US stands at 20 tonnes; in the UK at 9 tonnes and in Bangladesh at 0.3 tonnes. Oxfam hopes the exhibition will encourage people to join Oxfam's climate campaign and march at The Wave in London and Glasgow on December 5 to demand that the UK government pushes for the right deal at Copenhagen. Phil Bloomer, Oxfam's Campaigns and Policy Director, said: "Jamie's artwork gives us some powerful insights into daily life in Bangladesh, despite the looming and growing threat of increasingly dangerous floods." "This exhibition not only shows how climate change is a real and devastating threat to poor people, like those in Bangladesh, but provides people in the UK with a way to add their voice for a climate deal in Copenhagen that will address both the causes and effects."
