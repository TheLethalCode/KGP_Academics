<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)--Telecoms officials have called for a common network among the Saarc countries and reduced call charge on the second of the South Asian Mobile Summit on Thursday. They recommended shared land, tower, antenna and other accessories among different operators to cut operating costs and use of energy-saving technology to prevent fuel crisis. At a seminar at the Radisson Water garden Hotel in Dhaka, they emphasised increasing interaction between the regulatory organisations and active operators, and said the mobile phone will help foster regional cooperation and economic growth. Coordinated regional policy, infrastructure, regional communication through fibre-optic cable and regional coordination among the stakeholders in the mobile, Internet and telecommunications sector are needed for the thriving market in South Asia, they said. Traditional social system, globalisation, security threat, climate change are challenges for a thriving telecommunication sector, said Telenor Group Asia project director (business environment development) Khalid Hasan. He urged joint initiatives to tap big population and labour market and ensure growth, political stability, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, fair competition, a modern telecoms policy, and rationalisation of tax rates. Investors are wary to put their money in Bangladesh because of a lack of specific, stable and transparent plans and policies and a business-friendly environment for new investment, he said. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Company has taken the role of revenue-earning company instead of being the watchdog, said the official of Norwegian company Telenor, the parent firm of Grameenphone. Costs of international and roaming facility calls are much higher in this region than they are in Europe, America though 71 percent of the total international calls are generated here, said Biswanath Goyel, deputy managing director (business) of Nepal Telecom. He urged the governments of Saarc countries to form a 'common network' and reduce call rate to increase regional cooperation. By joining with India and China through fibre optic cable, he said, Nepal increased communication with the two countries and played an important role in expanding the market of mobile phone. Shared network can facilitate the use of alternative communication system during an accident or calamity, he said and stressed forming an 'equivalent regional network' of the mobile operators. New technologies have introduced new dimensions in internet connection and telecommunication sector in Bangladesh, said Jerry Mobs, chief executive officer of Augere Wireless Broadband Bangladesh, which launched WiMAX service in Bangladesh on Wednesday. WiMAX technology will be the driving force in the telecommunications of South Asia, he said and claimed that WiMAX will not suffer even after introduction of 3G mobile technology next year. These are two different technologies but the subscribers will benefit more from WiMAX, he said. Any new technology introduced in Bangladesh without licence will affect the telecoms and foreign investment, said Mehbub Chowdhury, chairman of South Asia Mobile Forum, the organiser of the seminar. GSM Association director Christiana De Hogue discussed the role of government and regulating organisations to distribute spectrum to strengthen the future of telecommunications in the region. Bhutan B Mobile managing director Tandy Wangchuk and Dialogue Global Sri Lanka's group head Legag Trinace Fernando presented papers on telecommunications. bdnew
