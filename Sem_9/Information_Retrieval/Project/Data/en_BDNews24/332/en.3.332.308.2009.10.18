<TITLE> Dhaka to lead LDC call for free trade access by 2010 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Least Developed Countries, led by Bangladesh, will place their demand for duty-free, quota-free access to world markets by 2010, at a ministerial conference of the World Trade Organisation later this year, commerce minister Faruque Khan said Sunday. "We discussed the LDCs' possible role in the upcoming WTO Geneva talks," Khan told reporters on his return from a meeting of commerce ministers of the 39-nation LDC Group in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. "Bangladesh, as chair of the Group, will lead the LDCs and member countries have already accepted a good number of proposals by Bangladesh." He hoped that there would not be any disagreement in opinion among the LDC members from Asia and Africa at the Geneva conference. The WTO's seventh ministerial conference will be held in the Swiss city from Nov. 30 to Dec. 2. The ministers at the Dar Es Salaam meeting adopted a declaration and work plan, aiming to unify the position of LDCs on world trade issues and give guidance to negotiators ahead of the Geneva meet. Citing the declaration, the commerce minister said the LDC will call for full implementation of the decision of the Hong Kong ministerial declaration on duty-free, quota-free market access for all LDCs by the year 2010. "We are yet to get DFQF market access to the USA and now lobbying to get 90 percent facilities," he said, replying to a query. "We will also call for submission of DFQF lists by the developed countries well before the conclusion of the Doha Round so that developing countries can assess the commercial value of the market access," Khan said. The LDC ministers have also agreed to develop a common position on commercially meaningful market access and treatment of Disproportionately Affected Countries, which is feared to have adversely affect export of Asian LDCs including Bangladesh, said the minister. Khan said the LDCs will also call for lifting all export restrictions from developed economies on food items imported by developing countries to ensure food security, in line with a proposal by Bangladesh. Citing the Geneva conference crucial for Bangladesh, Khan said they would also ask for the pledged $1.1 trillion for environmental degradation. Khan said he held a bilateral meeting with the WTO chief in Dar Es Salaam, explaining the necessity for full implementation of the DFQF market access decision and Bangladesh's concerns on the Disproportionately Affected Countries issue. "He assured all-out support in these regards," the minister said. However, the WTO director-general Pascal Lamy has said poor countries would have to wait for the Doha Round of trade talks, now in their eighth year, to conclude and are unlikely to get an advanced package directed to them before then. The Doha talks, launched in late 2001, to boost world trade by slashing farm subsidies and agricultural and industrial tariffs to help poor countries prosper, will come to an end in 2010. Though the LDCs' call for DFQF access have already been widely accepted, rich economies such as the US and EU want the whole round of negotiations to end, so that measures benefiting poor countries are part of an overall package. "For the moment there is no mandated 'early harvest' (of measures to benefit LDCs), contrary to previous negotiations in the past," Lamy told Reuters in an interview on Saturday. But leaders of the G20 rich and emerging countries have called for a conclusion of the Doha Round next year, and negotiators are working hard in Geneva to close the gaps. bdnew
