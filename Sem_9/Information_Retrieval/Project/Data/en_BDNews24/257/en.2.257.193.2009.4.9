<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission has rejected a summons from the parliamentary standing committee on public undertakings, saying the watchdog has no authority to summon an autonomous body. ACC acting chairman Habibur Rahman told reporters Thursday: "We have decided not to attend the standing committee meeting. This decision has been intimated to them." "They believe they have the legal authority to summon the commission. We disagree," said the acting ACC chief. "The ACC is accountable only to the president for its activities. Besides, the name of the ACC is not included in the list of government organisations (under their purview)." The government sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members earlier in the week to attend an Apr 12 meeting of the parliamentary watchdog on government institutions. The letters said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties. The ACC has been summoned to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. Rahman had said Wednesday the commission would decide whether to appear after examining the legal aspects of whether an autonomous body is bound to turn up at a parliamentary standing committee meeting. The government appointed Habibur Rahman acting chairman on Tuesday after former chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury quit his office on Apr 2. Ex-ACC secy also declines Former ACC secretary Md Delwar Hossain has also refused to appear before the parliamentary watchdog. "As the Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution, it is not proper to summon me as its secretary," Dewal told reporters earlier in the day. "That's why I have declined to join the parliamentary standing committee meeting," he said. Delwar, currently land secretary, was also summoned to appear before the committee meeting on Apr 12. "The committee can summon me as land secretary and I can go. But I cannot go as the commission's former secretary," he said. "The ACC only answers to the president. If such a committee summons any member of the commission it hampers the freedom of the institution." "If such incidents take place, the commission will lose its neutrality, which will hamper public interest," Delwar said. Delwar served as ACC secretary from Dec 14, 2006 to June 28, 2007. It was during his tenure that the much-publicised "List of 50" high-profile graft suspects was made upin absence of a chairman or commissioners who had earlier resigned and were yet to be replaced. The listwhich included top politicians, businessmen and bureaucratswas issued on Feb 18 2007 as part of the then caretaker government's ambitious anti-graft drive that put both Sheikh Hasina, now prime minister, and Khaleda Zia, now leader of the opposition, behind bars for a time. b
