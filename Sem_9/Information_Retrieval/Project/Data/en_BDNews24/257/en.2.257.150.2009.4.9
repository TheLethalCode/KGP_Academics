 Dhaka, April 9(bdnews24.com) Bangladesh Chhatra League's Jagannath University unit on Thursday "expelled" some 36 members for an "indefinite period" on charges of mugging, extortion and violence. "We have been forced to take the action to protect the image of the organisation," said BCL's JnU unit general secretary Kazi Abu Sayeed. The JnU unit took the decision in an emergency meeting with its president and general secretary signing the order. 7 injured in latest clashes Seven students were injured in the latest bout of violence between BCL factions at Jagannath University on Thursday. Clashes between two groups of BCL activists sparked off in front of the commerce faculty "without any provocation" at around 11:30am, Kotwali police chief Salauddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The police later brought the situation under control, he said and added that additional police were deployed on the campus. The university unit president Kamrul Hasan Ripon said the perpetrators of the latest violence did not belong to their organisation. "They are opportunists in the guise of Chhatra League activists," he said. But the general secretary, Sayeed, said some overenthusiastic BCL activists had sparked the incident to meet their own agenda. University proctor Kazi Asad said they were trying their best to maintain calm on the campus in the face of ongoing violence. "We will examine why these incidents are taking place," he said. bdn
