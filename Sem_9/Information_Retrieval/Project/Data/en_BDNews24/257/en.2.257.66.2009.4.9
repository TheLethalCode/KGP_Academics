<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesians went to the polls on Thursday across the vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands in parliamentary elections that are considered key to setting the pace of further reform in Southeast Asia's largest economy. The elections, a massive exercise in democracy with more than 170 million eligible voters, were marred by overnight violence in which at least six people died in the eastern province of Papua. The ballot has faced logistical problems ranging from incorrect voter rolls to confusion over new voting procedures, but the economy, jobs, and corruption are among the top issues. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's Democrat Party is tipped to win the most seats in the parliamentary poll, lifting its share of the vote from 7.5 percent in 2004 to as much as 29 percent, according to one recent poll. That would pave the way for Yudhoyono, a reform-driven ex-general, to run for re-election in the July presidential poll, most likely with a stronger mandate to continue his pro-investment policies of reducing graft and shaking up institutions such as the judiciary, civil service and police. "I hope parliamentarians can help make everything cheaper," said Sukinah, 79, after voting in Yogyakarta on Java island. "This election is difficult, it's (the procedure) different from the last one," she added, after having her finger dabbed with ink as a precaution to stop people from repeat voting. The first indications of the winner may come within a couple of hours of polling stations closing at midday in a quick count to be taken from a sample of stations. Local markets were closed on Thursday, but indicating perceived risk, the cost of protection against a default in Indonesia's sovereign debt was steady at 510 basis points, as measured by its five-year credit default swaps. PAPUA TENSIONS There are 38 parties contesting the elections, but opinion polls suggest only three -- the Democrats, PDI-P of former president Megawati Sukarnoputri, and the Suharto-era Golkar party -- will end with major blocs of votes.

The parliamentary elections are seen as referendum on Yudhoyono's performance, particularly when it comes to clamping down on corruption and reviving economic growth. Yudhoyono, who has an approval rating of 45-52 percent according to recent opinion polls, was Indonesia's first directly elected president and the first to serve a full five-year term since the autocratic Suharto was forced to step down in 1998. His administration has delivered stronger economic growth and brought relative peace and stability to the world's most populous Muslim nation, which also has sizeable religious minorities. But tackling endemic graft in one of the world's most corrupt countries has proved far tougher. Several high-profile officials, including central bankers, have been investigated and imprisoned but some Indonesians feel powerful vested interests have been spared punishment. Indonesian elections are traditionally chaotic affairs and Syamsuddin Haris, a political analyst at the Indonesian Institute of Science, said that apart from "small ripples", the polls had gone fairly smoothly so far although there could be protests later on. Voting kicked off in Papua, which is two hours ahead of Jakarta, and was due to have ended in the province at 0300 GMT. Papua police said at least six people died and a string of buildings, including a university in provincial capital Jayapura, were set ablaze after attacks on several police posts by gunmen and by a crowd armed with bows and arrows and petrol bombs. Tensions in Papua, where a separatist movement has simmered for decades, have been running high in recent weeks and some Papuans have called for a boycott of the election. Voting in Aceh, seen as another potential election risk after a series of shootings in recent months, appeared to go smoothly. "Whoever wins, national parties or local, it is okay as long as there is no intimidation," said Ramadhan, 30, at a polling station in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. Aceh, which saw three decades of separatist violence before a peace deal in 2005, is the only province where local parties, often represented by former rebels, are contesting the polls.
