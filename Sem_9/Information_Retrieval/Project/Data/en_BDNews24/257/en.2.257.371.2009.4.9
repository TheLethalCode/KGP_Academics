 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee bin Mortaza made his debut for Kolkata Knight Riders claiming 1-33 in his four-over spell during a warm-up game at Bloemfontein on Wednesday. Kolkata Knight Riders reached the target with five balls to spare after restricting Free State to 152 as Sourav Ganguly hit a brisk unbeaten 61 and was well-supported by Cheteshwar Pujara, who also remained unbeaten on 66. Bangladesh vice-captain Mashrafee was treated badly by the batsmen in his first and last over, but he had two good overs in the middle that made the bowling figures of the six-lakh-dollar-man more than satisfactory. Ajit Agarkar and Charl Langeveldt fired alongside Mashrafee with each taking two wickets as Knight Riders restricted Free State, the home of former South African greats Hansie Cronje and Allan Donald, to a mere 152. The next warm-up match is on Saturday, when the Knights will be playing amongst themselves. The third game is on Tuesday, once again against Free State. The second edition of the Indian Premier League will begin on April 18 with Chennai Super Kings facing Mumbai Indians at Cape Town, South Africa. Knight Riders will play their first match against Deccan Chargers the next day at Cape Tow
