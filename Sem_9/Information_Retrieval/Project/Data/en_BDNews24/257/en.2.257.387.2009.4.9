 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)The government will appoint an investigating agency, prosecutors and form tribunals within two weeks, for the long-awaited war crimes trials, the law minister said on Thursday. "The trial process has started," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters after the first meeting of the committee for investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. The government earlier termed the formation of the high-level probe committee as the "first step" toward the long-awaited trials. Home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, state minister for law Kamrul Islam, state minister for liberation war affairs AB Tajul Islam, attorney general Mahbubey Alam, home secretary Abdus Sobhan Shikder, the police chief, RAB director general and chiefs of intelligence agencies were present in the meeting. Demands from civil society for war crimes trials in Bangladesh have gathered momentum in recent years. The new government came to power in January with a pledge to try war criminals. It has already announced that the trials will be held under the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973. The UN has also offered support for the trials. Following a meeting earlier in the week with home minister Sahara Khatun and the law minister, UNDP country representative Renata Lok Dessallien said her agency had offered the government all assistance to ensure the trials met international standards. bdnew
