 Isfahan, Iran, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will decide on the offer of nuclear talks made by the United States and five other world powers after reviewing the details, a senior adviser to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday. "We will review it and then decide about it," Ali Akbar Javanfekr told Reuters. Underlining Tehran's determination to press ahead with its disputed nuclear program, Ahmadinejad was expected to announce later on Thursday in the central city of Isfahan that Iran has mastered the final stage of atom fuel production. The West suspects Iran is seeking to develop nuclear bombs. The Islamic Republic, which marks its National Nuclear Day, says it only aims to produce electricity. The new U.S. administration of President Barack Obama is trying to reach out to the Islamic Republic, offering a "new beginning" of engagement after three decades of mutual mistrust. Wednesday's invitation to direct talks marked a major policy change in Washington, which under former President George W. Bush spearheaded a drive to isolate Iran over its atom activity. The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said in a statement they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Tehran to the talks to find "a diplomatic solution to this critical issue." Breaking with past U.S. policy of shunning direct talks with Iran, Obama's administration said the United States would join in nuclear discussions with Iran from now on. "We strongly urge Iran to take advantage of this opportunity to engage seriously with all of us in a spirit of mutual respect," the six powers said in a statement after a meeting of senior diplomats in London on Wednesday. NUCLEAR ANNOUNCEMENT Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States would be a "full participant" in major power talks with Iran. Iran has so far reacted cautiously to U.S. overtures since Obama took office in January, saying it wants to see a real shift in Washington's policies rather than a change in words. "If you (Obama) say you are after change ... change your method, change your literature and your way," Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech on Wednesday. Analysts say Iran may be setting tough conditions for dialogue in a bid to buy time. Adding to uncertainty, it holds a presidential vote in June in which Ahmadinejad faces a challenge from a moderate politician seeking detente with the West. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which has final say on the nuclear issue, last month spelled out Iran's position, telling Washington: "You change, our behavior will change." Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil producer, has repeatedly rejected Western demands to halt sensitive uranium enrichment, which can have both military and civilian purposes. One Iranian analyst said he expected Ahmadinejad to say in Isfahan, where Iran has a uranium conversion facility, that it has perfected the last of several phases of fuel output, with the production of uranium pellets and fuel rods for reactors. Iran has long been working on its uranium enrichment capability to fuel its developing nuclear power program, which it says it needs so that it can export more gas and oil. Foreign nuclear analysts believe Tehran has yet to prove it has mastered industrial-scale enrichment of uranium, the key to making fuel in large, usable quantities and the most technically difficult aspect of churning out nuclear energy. The nuclear fuel cycle includes mining and milling of uranium ore, uranium enrichment, fabrication and use of nuclear fuel, reprocessing of used fuel, and disposal or management of radioactive waste or unreprocessed spent fuel.
