 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)Unknown gunmen sprayed bullets into the office of a manpower exporting agency in Banani in the capital Thursday, leaving a staffer dead and another wounded. Enam Ahmed Chowdhury, owner of the 'Dahmasi Corporate Ltd' on Banani road 12, told bdnews24.com, "Unidentified terrorists broke into the office at around 11 am and started shooting without taking aim." The indiscriminate shooting left office cook Nazrul Islam, 28, and messenger Jahirul Islam injured. They were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the duty doctor declared Nazrul dead. Chowdhury said the 'packet' the criminals left behind contained fabric for shroud and a chit demanding Tk 5 crore in toll. The chit, signed by a Shahadat, asked Enam and his elder brother Noman to pay the toll money or wear shrouds and wait for death. It also bore a cellphone number. Senior police officials have visited the crime scene. bdnews24
