<TITLE> Public interest prompted lease cancellation: Shafiq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)The government cancelled the lease on BNP chief Khaleda Zia's cantonment mansion in the interest of the people and the state, the law minister said on Thursday. Shafiq Ahmed told reporters it was not done, as the main opposition BNP claims, to satisfy any political vengeance. "I'm talking about morality, not about political vengeance or anything like that," he said after the first meeting of the committee for investigating and prosecuting war crimes committed during the 1971 independence war. It was done simply because the house had been allotted illegally and to right that wrong, the lease allotment has to be repealed, he clarified. "You'll get the answer to this riddle if you ask anyone if the same person can be entitled to receive two similarly appointed government houses," Shafiq said. "If one raises the issue of [late president] Ziaur Rahman's attachment to the house, then someone else might argue that Ganabhaban bears the burden of Bangabandhu and his family's memories." He said the government had allotted prime minister Sheikh Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana a house in Dhanmondi. But the past BNP-led alliance government cancelled the allotment, built a police station there and the then prime minister, Khaleda, inaugurated that. Shafiq said, replying to a question, "If that government could do that, why the present one would not commit similar acts?" Asked if he believed the decision might touch off political unrest, he said, "In Bangladesh, everything is given a political colour, whereas this is only an ordinary decision taken in the interest of the state and its people." "The allotment process followed while handing the house to Khaleda Zia was illegal. And, one person cannot be the recipient of two houses," he said. "One person's decision alone cannot make it happen. Former president (HM) Ershad who had allotted the house has said he would not do it if he knew Khaleda would be carrying out politics in the house." On BNP leader Moudud Ahmed's claim that they had got the house deed in their possession, the law minister said, "It won't work, because any deed made would be treated as fake, because the allotment process had been wrong." Asked if the authorities allotting the house 'illegally' will be taken to task legally, he said, there was no use asking how they had done that. b
