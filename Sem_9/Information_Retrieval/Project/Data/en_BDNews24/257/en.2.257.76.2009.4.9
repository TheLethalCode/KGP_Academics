 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com) - State Minister for Youth and Sports Ahad Ali Sarker promised Commonwealth Games gold medallist Asif Hossain Khan to settle his case filed in 2006 by police following a scuffle between cops and shooters at the National Shooting Complex. Asif and his mother called on the state minister on Thursday at the ministry. "He assured me that he would let the Prime Minister know of what actually happened that day and take measures after talking to the home ministry," Asif told bdnews24.com. Asif also gave the newspaper clippings to the sports minister. Asif Hossain said that the case was an obstacle to preparing for the upcoming SA Games in Bangladesh and other international meets. "I cannot focus my attention on preparation for upcoming important national assignments because of this police case. The case is reminder of the traumatic experience I suffered," Asif said. On October 2, 2006, Asif was grievously assaulted by the police, who also clubbed scores and wounded 25 including coach Shoaibuzzaman in Gulshan as they were preparing for the Doha Asian Games. The police beating followed an argument between a security guard of the shooting complex and a police driver. The police also arrested five including Asif and Shoaibuzzaman on the pretext of manhandling on-duty police but were granted though the case remained open. bd
