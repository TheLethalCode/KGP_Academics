<TITLE> US shootings raise new questions about gun laws, economy </TITLE>

 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, April 9 (bdnews24.com)Shooting rampages are not uncommon in America. They happen every now and thenso much so that, sadly, many Americans appear to have accepted them as part of their life. Still, the carnage and mayhem that occurred across the country over less than 48 hours last week shocked most Americans, making them wonder why their society has become so senselessly violent. In Binghamton, a hitherto quiet little town in upstate New York, a Vietnamese man angry about losing his job burst into an immigration centre and killed 13 people before turning the gun on himself. In Pittsburgh, a former Marine opened fire and killed three police officers. And in Graham, Washington, a man whose wife was leaving him shot and killed five of his children in their mobile home before taking his own life. The bloody incidents capped a recent string of mass killings, which crime experts say have touched more people and occurred in more public settings than in any time in recent memory. Comparative statistics are difficult to come by, but during the past month alone, at least eight mass homicides in this country have claimed the lives of 57 people. On Tuesday, four people were discovered shot to death in a modest wood-frame home in a remote Alabama town. The factor underlying the violence, some experts think, is the dismal state of the nation's economy. Criminologists theorise that the epidemic of layoffs, the meltdown of storied American corporations and the uncertainty of recovery have stoked fear, anxiety and desperation across society and unnerved the most vulnerable and dangerous segment of the population. "I've never seen such a large number [of killings] over such a short period of time involving so many victims," Jack Levin, a noted criminologist at Northeastern University, told the Washington Post. The simple fact, criminologist James Alan Fox said, is that more Americans are struggling. "The American dream to them is a nightmare, and the land of opportunity is but a cruel joke," said Fox, also of Northeastern. "There's a combination of feeling despair and hopelessness at the same time as a certain degree of anger and blame." Predictably, the carnage has focused attention on the nation's gun laws. Paul Helmke, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said it is too easy for dangerous people to acquire guns. "The common denominator in all these is that they're all using a gun," Helmke said of the recent killings. "You don't see police officers in Pittsburgh being killed by people throwing knives at them. We've always had violence, but in the old days you couldn't take out so many people so quickly. Now we make it very easy to do that." Experts agree that most mass murderers share one trait: a traumatic event such as a layoff, divorce or separation that sets off an internal rage and a desire for revenge. The gruesome incident late last year in Los Angeles underscores that point. A 45-year-old electrical engineer, named Bruce Padro, took the ultimate revenge. His life swiftly turned sour last fall when his wife divorced him and he lost his job and his beloved dog. On Christmas Eve, Pardo swung open the door of his ex-wife's parents' home, where a party was underway, opened fire on the party guests with a semiautomatic handgun before dousing the home with gasoline and setting it ablaze. He killed nine people, including his ex-wife, before taking his own life. Late last month, a gunman barged into a nursing home in North Carolina, looking for his estranged wife. He killed seven elderly residents and a nurse who cared for them. His wife, a nurse's assistant, escaped by hiding in a bathroom. And just five days later in Binghamton, a man wearing body armour burst into the New York state immigration center where he had studied English and opened fire on immigrants taking an exam to become US citizens, authorities said. "The nursing home in North Carolina and the community centre in Binghamton were not randomly chosen locations," Fox said. "It's not just some gunman walking down the street. They're very deliberate choices and reflect the anger and blame that the killer has.
