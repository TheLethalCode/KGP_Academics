 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  Seven students were injured after two Bangladesh Chhatra League factions clashed at Jagannath University on Thursday. A group of BCL activists clashed with a rival group in front of the commerce faculty 'without any provocation' at around 11:30am, Kotwali police chief Salauddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The police later took the situation under control, he said and added that additional police were deployed on the campus. The university unit president Kamrul Hasan Ripon said the perpetrators of the latest violence did not belong to their organisation. "They are fortune-seekers in the guise of Chhatra League activists," he said. But the general secretary, Gazi Abu Sayeed, said some overenthusiastic BCL activists had carried out the incidents to meet their own agendas. University proctor Kazi Asad said they were trying their best to maintain calm on the campus. "We will examine why these incidents are taking place," he said. bdnew
