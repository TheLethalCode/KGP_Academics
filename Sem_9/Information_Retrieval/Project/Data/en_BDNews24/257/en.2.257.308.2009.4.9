 Karachi, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's biggest private ambulance service said on Thursday it was worried its ambulances could be used for terrorist attacks and it was appealing to authorities to include its vehicles in security checks. Pakistan is facing a surge in militant violence that has raised fears about prospects for the nuclear-armed U.S. ally. Abdul Sattar Edhi, founder of the Edhi Foundation relief group, which runs 2,000 ambulances across Pakistan, said he had asked the government to ensure that the foundation's ambulances are subject to security checks. "I fear that our ambulances may be used for any terrorist activity," Edhi told Reuters. "They can be hijacked, the drivers can be given money to help terrorists, anything can happen. So it is very appropriate that the ambulances should also be checked the same way as other vehicles," he said. The foundation's ambulances are often waved through security checks, even at airports, said group spokesman Anwar Kazmi. "While we appreciate the respect that we're given, I think the current situation calls for stricter security measures," Kazmi said. Edhi said his group had not received any specific threat.
