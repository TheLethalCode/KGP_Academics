 Dhaka, Apr 13 (bdnews24.com)  A businessman, who said he was tortured by the joint forces during the caretaker government's rule, filed a case Monday against Major Sarwar and two others. Md Shamsuddin Ahmed filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court at around 10:30am. According to case details, on July 26, 2007 Maj Sarwar along with six to seven other members of the joint forces in plainclothes went to Shamsuddin's Naya Paltan office and beat him. He said they took him to a joint force's makeshift camp at Paltan Community Centre and further tortured him there. Shamsuddin was first admitted to Rajarbagh Police Line Hospital. As his condition worsened he was later taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The case was not filed that time due to the state of emergency, Shamsuddin said. Human-rights organisation Institute of Human Rights's lawyer Shahnur Islam Shaikat assisted the plaintiff in filing the case. bdne
