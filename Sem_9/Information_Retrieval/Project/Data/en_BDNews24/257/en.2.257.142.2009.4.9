 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  Former Anticorruption Commission secretary Md Delwar Hossain has refused to appear before a parliamentary watchdog. "As the Anticorruption Commission is an independent institution, it is not proper to summon me as its secretary," Dewal told reporters Thursday at the Secretariat. "That's why I have declined to join the parliamentary standing committee meeting," he said. Delwar, currently land secretary, was summoned to appear before the committee meeting as a witness on Apr 12. "The committee can summon me as land secretary and I can go. But I cannot go as the commission secretary," he said. "The commission can only go to the president. If the committee summons anyone of the commission it hampers the freedom of the institution. "If such incident takes place the commission will lose its neutrality, which will hamper public interest," Delwar said. Delwar served as ACC secretary from Dec 14, 2006 to June 28, 2007. The government sent separate letters to the ACC, its members and former members earlier in the week to attend an Apr 12 meeting of the parliamentary watchdog on government institutions. The ACC has been summoned to appear with all procedural documents of the commission since its inception, along with its latest annual and audit reports. Commission mulling legal aspects of summons ACC acting chairman Habibur Rahman said Wednesday the commission would decide whether to appear after examining the legality of the summons. "We will examine the legal aspects of whether an autonomous body is bound to turn up at a parliamentary standing committee meeting," Habibur told bdnews24.com "After that we'll decide whether to attend." The letter, which the ACC says it received on Tuesday, said the meeting would discuss the problems of the anti-graft body in discharging its duties. The government appointed Habibur Rahman acting chairman on Tuesday after former chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury quit his office on Apr 2. bdn
