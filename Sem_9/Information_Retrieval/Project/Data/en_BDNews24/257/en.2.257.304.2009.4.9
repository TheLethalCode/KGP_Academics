 Dhaka, April 9 (bdnews24.com)An opposition MP has asked the speaker to relieve him as a member of the parliamentary standing committee on home ministry to make a way for a BNP member. Andaliv Rahman, the lone MP from the Bangladesh Jatiya Party, sent a request to speaker Abdul Hamid to axe him from the committee. ""But I can to do nothing. As parliament elected him a committee member, only parliament can elect another MP in his position," Hamid told bdnews24.com on Wednesday. BNP, BJP's main ally, had earlier demanded Andaliv be removed from the standing committee. Chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque told the House on Tuesday, the last day of the just-concluded parliament session, that Andaliv was not nominated as a member of the parliamentary watchdog. "If his name is not changed, we will not attend any meeting of the standing committee," he said. In reply, chief whip Abdus Shahid told parliament that selection of the MPs for standing committees was the discretion of the leader of the House. BNP staged a walkout in protest.
