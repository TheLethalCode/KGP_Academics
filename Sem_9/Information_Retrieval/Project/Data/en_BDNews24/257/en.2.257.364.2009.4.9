<TITLE> Iran to decide on nuclear talks after reviewing offer </TITLE>

 Tehran, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will decide on the offer of nuclear talks made by the United States and five other world powers after reviewing the details, a senior adviser to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Thursday. "We will review it and then decide about it," Ali Akbar Javanfekr told Reuters. Wednesday's invitation to direct talks marked a major policy change in Washington, which suspects Iran's nuclear program has military aims, a charge Tehran denies. The United States, Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain said in a statement they would ask European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana to invite Tehran to the talks to find "a diplomatic solution to this critical issue." Breaking with past U.S. policy of shunning direct talks with Iran, President Barack Obama's administration said the United States would join in nuclear discussions with Iran from now on. "We strongly urge Iran to take advantage of this opportunity to engage seriously with all of us in a spirit of mutual respect," the six powers said after a meeting of senior diplomats in London. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States would be a "full participant" in major power talks with Iran.
