<TITLE> AL marks Aug 21 anniversary in muted manner </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League is observing the fourth anniversary of the 2004 grenade attack on a party rally in a limited way this year, under the ongoing state of emergency. A number of organisations offered flower tributes in the morning hours at a temporary memorial erected in front of the party's head office on Bangabandhu Avenue. The AL will hold a two minute silence at 5:22 in the afternoon to mark the tragedy, which many party leaders and activists will observe at the site of the massacre in the heart of the capital. A meeting will be held immediately after at the same location. The terrible and bloody events of August 21, 2004, have left an indelible impression on the collective psyche of the Awami League. The sudden multiple explosions which followed an address from party chief and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina resulted in immediate chaos, horrific deaths and hundreds injured. Many of the injured in the attack are still struggling to come to terms with the terrible toll inflicted on them by assailants who are yet to be brought to justice for their senseless and brutal acts. Twenty-four party leaders, workers, journalists and members of the public lost their lives, including Ivy Rahman, the AL's women affairs secretary. The serial detonations were followed by a hail of gunfire, apparently targeting Hasina, the then opposition leader, although her personal bodyguard took the brunt of the fire sparing the party leader's life but leaving her hearing impaired. A terrible irony was that the day's rally was held to protest an earlier bomb attack launched in Sylhet. bdnews24.c
