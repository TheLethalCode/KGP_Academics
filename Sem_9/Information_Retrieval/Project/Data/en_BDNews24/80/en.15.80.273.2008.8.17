 PARIS, Sun Aug 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev told French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday that Russian forces would begin withdrawing from Georgia around midday (0800 GMT) on Monday, Sarkozy's office said in a statement. Sarkozy, whose country holds the rotating European Union presidency, telephoned Medvedev on Sunday to discuss the French-brokered ceasefire deal Russia has signed with Georgia. "He stressed that the signature of the six point ceasefire agreement signed by all the parties concerned, most recently by the President of the Russian Federation, must result in the immediate withdrawal of all Russian military forces that have entered Georgia since Aug. 7," the statement said. Russian commanders said on Sunday their forces had begun regrouping around Georgian cities, but the Russian Defence Ministry said the troop movements were preparatory rather than an actual withdrawal. The French statement said Sarkozy warned Medvedev of "serious consequences" for Russia's relations with the EU if the accord were not implemented rapidly and competely. It said Medvedev had assured him that the Russian withdrawal would begin on Monday. "President Medvedev announced to the President of the Republic that the withdrawal of Russian troops would begin tomorrow, Monday Aug. 18 in the middle of the day," the statement said. The Kremlin confirmed the conversation and said Medvedev had informed Sarkozy "that from tomorrow Russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce Russian peacekeepers after the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia... to the security zone and to the territory of South Ossetia." Sarkozy's office said the two leaders agreed on deploying international observers from the Organisation of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as rapidly as possible. Sarkozy and Medvedev will have a daily telephone conversation to discuss implementation of the ceasefire, the statement said
