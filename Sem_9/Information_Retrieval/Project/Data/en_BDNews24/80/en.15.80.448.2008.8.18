 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammedan Sporting Club confirmed their quarterfinal berth in the Citycell Federation Cup when the black and white outfit came from behind to defeat Rahmatganj MFS 3-2 in the Group D encounter Monday. Francis gave Rahmatganj a 33-minute lead before Bokula restored the parity for Mohammedan two minutes later on a rain-soaked pitch at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The first half ended in a 1-1 lock, and Mohammedan regrouping in the second half, went ahead in the 52nd minute riding a strike from Robin. Rahmatganj, however, bounced back in the 74th minute with Hirok levelling the margin to make it 2-2. When it seemed the match was going to end in a draw, Bokula struck his second goal in 90th minute to see off Rahmatganj, who earlier lost to Arambagh KS. With the second straight win, Mohammedan raised their points tally to six, three points more than Arambagh, whose Monday's match against Sunrise in Gazipur was called off due to rains.
