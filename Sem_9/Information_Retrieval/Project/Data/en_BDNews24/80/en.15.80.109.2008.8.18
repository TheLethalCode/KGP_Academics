 Chittagong, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Chhatra League held demonstrations on Chittagong University campus Sunday against an attack by Islami Chhatra Shibir supporters on a Bangabandhu mourning procession the previous day. Leaders of the Awami League student wing said they would continue their protests until their 'eight demands' were met, including punishment by expulsion of the Shibir activists they said were tied to the attacks. The demands of the BCL activists also included resignation of the vice chancellor and proctor of the university and removal of the Hathazari police chief. They further pressed for indoor politics to be resumed on campus. At least seven people were injured in clashes between supporters of BCL and Shibir on Saturday. Both organisations blamed the other for instigating the violence. CU proctor, Prof Jasim Uddin said university authorities held a meeting at the VC's office to discuss law and order on the campus. He said the authorities would sit with both the student groups soon. University authorities have also decided to seek additional contingents of police for all rail stations between Chittagong city and the university campus. bdnews2
