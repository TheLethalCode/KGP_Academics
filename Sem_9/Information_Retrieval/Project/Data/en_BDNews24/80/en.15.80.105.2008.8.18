<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Trial of a Tk 3 crore extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina resumed Monday, after the Supreme Court overrode a High Court ruling that had cancelled the case as illegally tried under emergency powers rules. The plaintiff of the case continued with his statement to the court, after a break of over sixth months, before the defence began cross-examining him in the makeshift Special Judge's Court- 5 of Md Ashraf Hossain. At the start of the proceedings, the defence had complained to the court that their cross examination should have begun immediately as the plaintiff, businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, had completed his deposition to the court on Jan 30. "We were meant to start quizzing [Chowdhury] in this case immediately after his deposition," a defence lawyer argued, adding that the plaintiff should not be permitted to give further testimony. The prosecution, however, countered that Chowdhury had not completed his deposition to the court previously and should be allowed to conclude now. The defence eventually began their cross-examination in Monday's hearing once Chowdhury had finished giving his statement. The case, filed by Chowdhury on June 13, 2007, accuses Hasina of extorting Tk 2.99 crore during her 1996-2001stint as prime minister in return for allowing the plaintiff to set up a power plant. The Awami League chief's sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin, former Awami League health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim also stand accused in the case. Chowdhury, however, went on the record with the media later to say that he had not named Hasina in the case and that he had never met with her over the issue, let alone bribe her. Hasina was arrested at her Dhanmondi home on July 16, 2007, named arrested in the case the following day and detained pending trial. The High Court on Feb 6 cancelled the case after ruling illegal its trial under emergency powers rules. On May 8, on a government appeal, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court cancellation, allowing its trial to resume. On June 11 this year, Hasina was released by the government for eight weeks to seek medical treatment abroad. She left for the United States the next day, after being excused on medical grounds from personal appearance in court proceedings against her. bdnews24.c
