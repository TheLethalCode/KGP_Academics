<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 14 (bdnews24.com)The process of releasing both BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and elder son Tarique Rahman is progressing, home adviser MA Matin said Thursday. "The Khaleda Zia release process is on. The file will come to the home ministry after its journey through the law ministry is completed." "We'll then act on the matter and take necessary decision," the home affairs adviser said at noon replying to reporters' queries at his Bangladesh Secretariat office. Replying to another question, Matin said progress has also been achieved regarding Tarique's release. Asked if Khaleda has to petition seeking release, the adviser said: "I don't know anything about that." Khaleda, in the meantime, has conveyed through her lawyer that she will not file any petition with the government for her release. The home adviser's comments Thursday came on the heels of a statement by the chief adviser the day before that efforts were on to release Khaleda Zia 'as soon as possible'. However, Matin had denied any knowledge of Khaleda's release when reporters had questioned him on previous days. Khaleda was arrested on Sept 3, 2007, in connection with a graft case. She has since been interned in a special jail set up in the Sangsad Bhaban area. Four graft cases against Khaleda are on trial at the moment. Khaleda's son Tarique was arrested on March 7, 2007, in a graft case. Suffering from a number of physical ailments, including spinal cord injuries, Tarique is under treatment at a prison cell of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. A total of 16 graft cases including extortion and bribery against him are on trial now. bdnews24.co
