 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number two Germany rediscovered their best form to reach the semi-finals in men's Olympic hockey with an imposing 3-1 victory over New Zealand in pool A on Tuesday. In pool B, the Dutch also reached the last four when they beat Pakistan 4-2. Penalty corner specialist Taeke Taekema unleashed two vicious drag flicks to help the Dutch to victory. Bronze medallists four year ago, Germany struck twice by the ninth minute to send out a warning that they have regained their touch after a shaky start had almost wrecked their campaign. Back-to-back drawn games against Belgium and South Korea had checked their progress, but Germany had got their campaign back on track with a 1-0 win over co-favourites Spain in their previous game. Underling their potential, German striker Florian Keller scored the final goal with a fabulous solo run. He kissed his sweatband in the black, red and gold colours of the national flag in jubilation. Germany were ruthless in their execution with precise passes and speedy forays. Skipper Timo Wess converted a penalty corner in the fifth minute. Four minutes later Matthias Witthaus dived in the striking area to score off a long pass. New Zealand, who were in contention for a last four place, stung back in he 46th minute through a penalty corner by Hayden Shaw. But Keller's strike put the match out of their reach. "We took the fight. If we play like this we can beat anyone," Wess said. Germany have set their sights on gold they last won in 1992 Barcelona. "After the third game (following two draws) I said it was not all over and we'll come back. The same is for the next two matches," Wess said. Defending champions Australia are effectively guaranteed a semi-final spot after three wins and a draw with the Dutch. The Australians play Britain in their final match later on Tuesday. Britain trail Australia by three points and have a much inferior goal difference. Spain take on South Korea in a match that will determine the second team from pool A and the semifinal line-up
