 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Singapore were guaranteed their first Olympic medal since 1960and only their second of all timeby beating South Korea 3-2 on Friday to advance to the women's team championship final in table tennis. Singapore will face China, who coasted into the final 3-0 without dropping a game to Hong Kong. Somewhat dulling the achievement for the country of 4.6 million, the players and coach that carried Singapore to victory were all imports from table tennis powerhouse China. "I feel very honoured.

Despite the acrobatics of Korea's Park Mi-young in the fifth and deciding match, the unflappable Feng prevailed 11-7 12-10 3-11 and 11-9, winning when the Korean committed a rare error, faulting on her serve. "In a battle like that, everyone is nervous. So if you can just keep it cool, you've got an advantage," Feng said. China's dismantling of Hong Kong in their semi-final prompted the venue managers to bring out a panda mascot for an unprecedented dance interlude, just to slow things down.
