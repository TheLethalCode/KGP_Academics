 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World champion Shawn Johnson swallowed her disappointment at missing out on the Olympic all-around gold on Friday and said the most important thing was that U.S. gymnasts had won the top two medals for the first time. The 16-year-old American was outclassed by her team mate and close friend Nastia Liukin in the race for the title of best individual gymnast, finishing second ahead of China's Yang Yilin. The result was all the sweeter for the Americans coming after their runners-up finish behind the hosts in the team event. "It shows the world we can come back no matter what. I gave my heart and soul out there. It's been a really long road, and I'm proud to be here. It's easier than coming second to a different country," Johnson told reporters. "Whether it's me up there or Nastia, we are both wearing USA and it makes us both proud to see our colours and our country up there. Nastia deserved the gold." The pair have been sharing a room in Beijing and Liukin said they had encouraged each other all the way on Friday. "We both supported each other 100 percent and just wanted to go out there and give it our all and have fun because this is the Games, nothing is bigger or greater than this," she said. "In between events, we look at each other and give a head nod. It means so many words. I was trying to encourage her and say 'come on!' without distracting her." Liukin became the third American woman to win the all-around crown and it was the first time the country had two representatives on the podium in the event. "It's going to be a great motivational event for the young generation to come. I'm so proud," Johnson's coach Chow Liang told a news conference. Liukin's coach, her father Valery, added: "This is absolutely incredible for the United States of America gymnastics. There's more to come." Johnson said she was determined to be part of that successful future, saying she aimed to take part in the next Olympics. "After being here and experiencing the whole experience, it's a dream come true. I'd give anything to do that again. If I can, I'll be here in 2012," said Johnson, who still has a chance of gold in the floor and beam finals
