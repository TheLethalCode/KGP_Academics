 Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com) After a six-year hiatus, the nation observied National Mourning Day on Friday, the 33rd death anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The national flag was raised at half-mast atop government, semi-government, non-government and private buildings. Awami League offices hoisted the national flag, the party flag and a black flag in mourning for the assassination of the founding president of Bangladesh and family members on Aug 15, 1975. The day began with Awami League leaders, led by acting AL president Zillur Rahman, laying wreaths and observing a minute's silence before the portrait of Sheikh Mujib enshrined in front of Bangabandhu Bhaban in Dhanmondi. After paying tribute, Zillur said: "The trial of Bangabandhu's murderers will be held in Bangladesh. We renew our vow to reconstruct Bangladesh following the ideals of our martyred leader." AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed added: "We vouchsafe on this day of mourning to realise Bangabandhu's vision of a just and fair society." Fellow presidium member Suranjit Sengupta called upon the government to officially recognise Sheikh Mujib as 'Father of the Nation' as soon as possible. President Iajuddin Ahmed paid homage at the Bangabandhu mausoleum in Tungipara Friday morning, laying a wreath at the grave shortly after 10am. The three chiefs of the armed forces accompanied him. Three smart contingents of army, navy and air force ceremonially saluted the grave of the national leader, marking the recently restored National Mourning Day. The president joined others in a prayer for the salvation of the departed soul and wrote in the condolence book of the mausoleum. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed arrived at the mausoleum at 11.05am, placed a wreath and also offered a prayer for the soul of the national leader. AL leaders also paid respects at the graves of Sheikh Mujib's assassinated family members at Banani graveyard Friday morning. Prayers were held before Zillur inaugurated food distribution among the poor there. Dhaka Metropolitan Awami League distributed food among the poor at different places around the city Friday. Special prayers were offered at all mosques after jumma prayers. Churches, temples and other religious organisations also did the same in memory of the national hero. Strict security measures were deployed at all points of assembly and congregation throughout the morning. bdnews24.c
