 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)Sylhet mayor-elect Badruddin Ahmed Kamran returned to Sylhet jail Monday after being paroled for six hours to attend his mother's namaj-e-janaza and burial, a jail official said. Kamran's mother Nurunnessa Khanam Lalan, 84, died Sunday at Square Hospital in Dhaka due to old age. The detained mayor-elect was brought from Comilla jail to Sylhet Sunday night at 9.30pm preparatory to granting him parole, Sylhet jailer Monir Hossain said. "The government let detained mayor Kamran out on parole [Monday] morning at 10:05 am for six hours to enable him attend his mother's janaza," Monir Hossain told bdnews24.com. The Awami League Sylhet city president attended the namaj-e-janaza of his mother at the Naya Sharak mosque following zohr prayers. Hundreds of local AL leaders, activists and supporters of the party, were present alongside friends and relatives. The coffin was brought to the graveyard adjacent to the mazar of Hazrat Manik Pir, where she was buried in the presence of Kamran and relatives. Kamran was elected for a second term as mayor of Sylhet City Corporation on Aug 4, bagging an overwhelming majority of votes. He was arrested by the joint forces on May 28, 2007, on graft charges. bdnews24.com/c
