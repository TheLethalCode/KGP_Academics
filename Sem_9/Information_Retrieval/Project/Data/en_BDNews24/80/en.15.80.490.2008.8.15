<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com)  The release of former home minister Mohammad Nasim, convicted of graft, is likely to be delayed as the scrutiny of the bail orders is taking time, a top jailer said on Friday. "Mohammad Nasim's bail orders have reached us. The process for his release is going on. However, as Friday was public holiday the examination of papers at the jail office is taking some more time," deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com at 3:20pm. "The process of his release is not getting completed until those works end. So the exact time of his release cannot be said for sure," he said. However, he said, the jail authorities were trying to quickly complete the work of examining the bail papers. The High Court on Aug 6 granted four months' bail to Nasim, who was admitted in LabAid Hospital in the city on June 24 following a stroke. Younger brother Rezaul Karim told bdnews24.com Friday noon: "The jail authorities have informed us that my brother will be released in the afternoon. We are waiting. He will continue to be treated at LabAid Hospital though." A special court sentenced Nasim to 13 years in jail on Oct 8, 2007 for amassing illegal wealth worth Tk 1.26 crore. He was arrested on Feb 4, 2007 under Emergency Powers Rules. bdnews24.com/rb
