 QINGDAO, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paul Goodison defended his spoiling tactics after he secured Britain's third gold of the Olympic regatta and denied Sweden's Rasmus Myrgren a medal in the Laser class on Tuesday. The Swede was in silver position going into the medal race but finished sixth overall. Goodison, who had a commanding points advantage and could only be overhauled for gold by Myrgren, pinned back the Swede at the rear of the fleet to ensure his rival had no possibility of taking the victory he needed, while hoping Goodison finished last. Myrgren limped home 10th and last and with his medal hopes extinguished. Slovenia's Vasilij Zbogar, the Athens bronze medallist, went one better this time and Italian Diego Romero secured bronze. "It might not have been the best way to do it but with the conditions being so tricky, it was the best way of making sure of gold," Goodison told reporters. "I apologised to Rasmus but I think he was still a bit stressed and upset about the race," the 30-year-old told a news conference. "He was distraught and I can understand how he feels. I feel really sorry for Rasmus, I wish it had not happened to him but at the end of the day there can only be one winner." Victory for Goodison made up for just missing out on a medal in Athens four years ago, after which he considered quitting the sport because of the frustration of coming fourth. Goodison and Zbogar leapt out of their boats and embraced each other in a bear-hug in the water after the finish. The pair then posed for photographers in Zbogar's boat before heading back to the marina. "It's been a testing week but I hung in there and delivered yesterday, which made it a bit easier today," Goodison said. He began the regatta in slow fashion, finishing 15th in the first and third races before hitting form, as he had done when winning the Games test event in Qingdao last year. While Goodison shone, double world champion and world number one Tom Slingsby failed to get into contention. The Australian was eliminated before the medal race, in which the top 10 from the opening series compete, and finished 22nd overall. Athens Laser gold winner Robert Scheidt of Brazil is competing in the Star class at the Games. Britain, the leading nation in Olympic sailing, have also won gold in the Finn and Yngling, and silver in the men's 470
