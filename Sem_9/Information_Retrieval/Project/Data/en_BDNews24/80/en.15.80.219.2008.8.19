 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Henry Cejudo gave the United States its first wrestling gold medal of the Olympic Games on Tuesday with a clinical victory over Japan's Tomohiro Matsunaga in the men's 55kg freestyle. Besik Kudukhov of Russia and Bulgaria's Radoslav Velikov, both former world title holders, won bronze medals. Cejudo, a 21-year-old from Colorado Springs taking part in his first Olympics, had tears in his eyes as he wrapped himself in the Stars and Stripes, following a winning campaign he attributes to his "American way" of non-stop wrestling. Coach Mike Duroe lifted Cejudo off the floor in a bear-hug. The coach of Matsunaga, 28, had disputed a point in the first period but judges reviewed the video tape and ruled in favor of the young American and let it stand. "He's testament to the fighting spirit of America," Duroe said. "This means so much to him. Gold medals are the American dream." Cejudo, with an eye coming up black, said: "My life has changed already. Watching the flag go up on that podium feels real good.
