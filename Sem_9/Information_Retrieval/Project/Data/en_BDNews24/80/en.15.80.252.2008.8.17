 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Criminal Investigation Department has filed some154 cases to date against Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh for the countrywide series of bombings on Aug 17, 2005, and a further 119 cases involving bomb attacks carried out across the country by the banned extremist party up to Nov 12, 2007, a top CID official has said. CID chief additional inspector general of police Mohammad Jabed Patwari told bdnews24.com that the speedy disposal of cases and duration of the sentences for bomb attacks were greater compared to general cases. The CID is carefully monitoring all cases related to bomb attacks, Patwari said. Of the total 273 cases filed against JMB, charges have been pressed in 244 cases, some 817 people have been arrested, 41 people have been sentenced to death, 98 to life sentences and the 132 sentenced to various terms in prison. Of the 154 cases filed against JMB for the August 17 bomb blasts, 19 are still under investigation. Of the 244 cases in which chargesheets have been submitted, 17 have gone to trial while 157 cases are pending trial. "The quick resolution of the cases and the moves of the CID and Rapid Action Battalion have greatly decreased the activities of the banned Islamist party," Patwari said. The death sentences carried out on March 29 last year of a number of top JMB leadersincluding the party chief Shaikh Abdur Rahman, Siddiqul Islam (Bangla Bhai) and four top figuresalso helped to discourage their activities, the CID official said. "Resolution of 25 cases are being delayed, however, as the cases are complicated in nature," Patwari said, adding that witnesses were difficult to find in these 25 cases. The countrywide serial bomb attacks, carried out in all districts except Munshiganj on Aug 17, 2005, was unprecedented, created widespread fear of extremism and brought JMB and its militant activities to the attention of the public. On Nov 14 the same year, the killing of two judges Sohel Ahmed Chowdhury and Jagannath Pare in Jhalkathi reinforced people's fears of growing militancy n Bang. Bomber Iftekhar Hassan Al Mamun was caught red handed on the occasion, while a Jhalkathi court on May 29, 2006, sentenced to death seven JMB men, including party kingpins Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai, for the attack. Another of the main accused Asadul Islam Arif remained fugitive at the time of his death sentence, but was recently arrested by RAB and has appealed to the High Court against his sentence. bdnew
