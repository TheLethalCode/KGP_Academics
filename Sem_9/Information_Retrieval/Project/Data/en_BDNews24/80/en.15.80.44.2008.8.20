 Kabul,Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Army Chief of Staff General Ashfaq Kayani arrived in neighbouring Afghanistan on Tuesday, a day after Pervez Musharraf resigned as president. The visit had nothing to do with Musharraf's resignation and was planned in advance, a spokesman for President Hamid Karzai said, adding Kayani would not meet the Afghan head of state. "It doesn't have any link with Musharraf's resignation," presidential spokesman Humayun Hamidzada said. "This was a pre-planned visit for taking part in the tripartite commission involving the coalition, Pakistan and Afghanistan." Afghan, NATO and Pakistani army leaders hold regular meetings to help coordinate military activities along the long and porous Afghan-Pakistani border. Kayani travelled to the main US base in Afghanistan, at Bagram, close to Kabul, to attend the meeting. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan have reached a new low in recent months as Afghan leaders accuse Pakistani intelligence agents of aiding a series of high-profile attacks, including the July suicide bombing of the Indian Embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people and wounded dozens more. Pakistan denies aiding Taliban insurgents in any way and says violence in Afghanistan is Kabul's own domestic problem
