 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World record-holder Usain Bolt looked in ominous form as he swept into the Olympic 100 metres semi-finals along with fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell and American world champion Tyson Gay on Friday. The 21-year-old Bolt had time to look around while ambling through his second-round heat in a time of 9.92, two tenths of a second outside his best but impressive given the lack of effort he seemed to expend in running the fastest time of the day. "I just ran the first 50 metres, then I looked around to make sure I was safe and I shut it off," he told reporters. "I'm ready for my best. I just came to run and do what I can do  I got my stride back." Bolt, a 200 metres world silver medallist who has been running the shorter distance for just a year, is aiming to become the first man to complete the men's Olympic 100 and 200m double since Carl Lewis in 1984. Gay won both sprints at the world championships in Osaka last year but a hamstring injury deprived him of a shot at the 200 in Beijing. The third fastest man of all time behind Bolt and Powell, the 26-year-old looked less comfortable in the second round than he had in the first but easily qualified in 10.09 behind heat winner Richard Thompson of Trinidad and Tobago, who ran 9.99. "It's feeling great," Gay said when asked about his leg. "I felt good and relaxed. I just wanted to make it through." STOMACH ACHE Powell, who had complained of a stomach ache in the morning session, ran the fourth quickest time in 10.02 to win his heat and remain in the hunt for a first global title. The 25-year-old former world record-holder joined seven other runners from the Caribbean to make up half the field for the semis, which take place along with the final on Saturday evening. Churandy Martina was another impressive performer from the Caribbean, breaking under the 10-second barrier for the first time for the joint second fastest time of the day in 9.99 seconds. "I am not surprised," said the Netherlands Antilles sprinter, whose islands have never produced an Olympic medal winner. "I know I'm going to win for sure. Otherwise, I would have stayed home and watched it on TV." The best time of the morning session came from Briton Tyrone Edgar in 10.13 and he improved that to 10.10 in round two to reach the last 16. "I just want to be in the final," the 26-year-old said. "That's what I want to do
