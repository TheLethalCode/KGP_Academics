<TITLE> Hearing won't delay Bali bombers' execution: official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's Attorney-General said on Sunday the latest plea by the three Bali bombers to the constitutional court would not affect plans for their execution. Lawyers for the three men -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi and Mukhlas, also known as Ali Gufron, lodged a legal challenge earlier this month, saying that Indonesia's method of executing convicts by firing squad was inhumane. The three men would prefer an Islamic method of execution by beheading. All three have been on death row since 2003, when a Bali court sentenced them to death for their roles in the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, many of them Indonesians and Australians. "In accordance to regulations, the plea won't delay executions," Attorney-General Hendarman Supandji said. Supandji had said previously the execution could occur before the start of the Muslim fasting month in September after the men had exhausted all their legal options. "The formal process isn't yet completed. When the requirements are met then it will be carried out," Supandji added without elaborating. There are concerns executing the three men could exacerbate militant anger in the predominantly Muslim country of about 226 million people. But several analysts have dismissed fears of widespread anger, saying most Indonesians had little sympathy for the violent methods of the Bali bombers.
