 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan held Brothers Union to a goalless draw in the Citycell Federation Cup at Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) Wednesday. With the outcome, both teams are level on four points from two outings to make Group C difficult as Sheikh Russel KC tasted their first win to remain just behind them with three points from two matches. Brothers will now have to face Sheikh Russel in the group final match while BKSP will face Victoria Sporting Club, who went down 2-0 against Sheikh Russel in the day's second match. In Group A, Farashganj SC confirmed their quarterfinal berths beating Dhaka Wanderers Club 1-0 at Gazipur Stadium with Emanul Haq scoring the all-important goal in the 67th minute. Back at the BNS, Brothers Union faced a tough challenge from the BKSP, who stunned Sheikh Russel 1-0 in the group opener. They, however, should have opened the scoring in the eighth minute when Ariful Kabir Farhad found a Tapu through pass inside the box, but the balled striker saw his right-footed shot saved by BKSP goalkeeper Mustaq for a corner. Two minutes later, Brothers striker Tapu volleyed a Munna cross that went miles off the target when a good composure was needed to find the destination from the danger zone. BKSP's Sabuj got into a good position and beat Brothers goalkeeper Zia, but defender Ariful cleared the ball for a throw-in in the 20th minute. After the breather, Brothers stepped up the attack with bringing three changes in the midfield, but it hardly had any impact on BKSP defense marshalled by Rasel, Kanak, Any, Saikat and Pranab. In counter-attack, BKSP went close to scoring in the 63rd minute when Pranab drove a powerful curving free kick on the edge of the Brothers box, but goalkeeper Zia fisted the ball at the cost of a corner. Afterwards, following the corner, Pranab again forced Zia to palm a powerful drive away. Substitute Abdullah Parvez drove a left-footer outside the box that narrowly went to the BKSP post to frustrate Brothers Union. In the second match, Sheikh Russel had to wait for 41 minutes to open their account against Victoria SC. Veteran striker Alfaz Ahmed gave Sheikh Russel a lead four minutes from the half time while Moroccan striker Toati Youness sealed the match in the 67th minute.
