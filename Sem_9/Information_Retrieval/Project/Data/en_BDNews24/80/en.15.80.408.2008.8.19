 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) - Mohammedan SC's hockey secretary Sajed AA Adel Tuesday alleged that his club's general secretary Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan and Usha KC general secretary Abdur Rashid Shikdar proposed that he drop points in the Mohammedan-Usha match to give Usha an opportunity in the last Premier Division Hockey League. Adel, involved with Mohammedan since 1979, made his comments at a hurriedly arranged press conference to inform the media that all candidates of the Shahriar Alam-Sajed AA Adel panel had withdrawn their nominations for the Bangladesh Hockey Federation's scheduled 28 August election. When asked why, despite being a Mohammedan councilor, he was not being backed by his own club, Adel said, "Probably they are not satisfied with me as I had disagreed to drop points against Usha KC to give it an unnecessary opportunity in the last premier hockey league." Adel said, "(Abdur) Rashid proposed that Mohammedan drop points against Usha in return for a Tk 3.5 lakh benefit, but I refused." The former player-turned-organiser said, "Later, I learnt that he (Rashid) sent Protap Sangkar Hazra to Mohammedan general secretary Lokman Hossain Bhuiyan with Tk 3.5 lakh for Mohammedan to pay off its foreign players. "Lokman also requested me to drop points against Usha, but I refused and that's why the club is not backing me in the election," added Adel, the immediate past general secretary of the BHF ad-hoc committee. Adel also alleged that Mohammedan had dropped points for Usha to clinch the maiden League title in 2004. Both Lokman and Rashid denied the allegations and said that Adel wanted to tarnish the image of the clubs. Lokman, however, said that the club would take measure against Adel. Meanwhile, Mohammedan beat Usha 5-3 in the 'talked about match' to keep the opponents waiting till the last match against Abahani Limited, in which they emerged champions. With the withdrawal of the Alam-Adel panel, a total of 24 candidates will compete for 19 member posts in the BHF election as five vice presidents, one general secretary, two joint secretaries and one treasurer were declared winners unopposed. Protap Sangkar Hazra, KRM Manjur, Azizur Rahman Raju, MA Gafur and Shahajan Sarkar were elected vice presidents while Khandoker Jamiluddin general secretary. Abdur Rashid Shikdar and Mashirur Kabir Ritu were elected joint secretaries while Kazi Mainuzzaman Pila was treasurer. "Will the committee be accepted in the sports arena without any representative of Mohammedan and Abahani," was the question of Shahriar Alam, a director of Abahani limited and vice chairman of Abahani hockey committee. In another development, both the panels had almost come to a consensus on an amicable BHF committee, but it broke down Tuesday following a disagreement over the inclusion of Sajed AA Adel as a vice president.
