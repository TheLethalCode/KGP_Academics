<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) Former prime minister and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina wants to return from America at the end of September "even if her US doctors want to extend her treatment", her personal physician said Sunday. Reminded about the Sept 6 deadline of her release term, her personal physician and eye specialist Prof Syed Modasser Ali told bdnews24.com: "We hope her release will be extended until the end of September." "Sheikh Hasina believes she is completely innocent. Even if her US doctors want to extend her treatment further, she will return at the end of September," he had earlier told reporters at Mozibunnessa Eye Hospital. "No obstacle will keep her abroad or bar her from participating in the election," Modasser Ali said. The former prime minister wants an elected government to take power as soon as possible to solve the country's problems, he said. Syed Modasser Ali visited Hasina in the US, from July 17 to Aug 8, on her request. "Sheikh Hasina is under the treatment of Harry A Quigley, director of the Wilmer Institute at the world-renowned Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. I went there at her request and coordinated her treatment," he told reporters Sunday: "Sheikh Hasina is now taking full rest there. She uses the computer, reads the newspaper and watches the news. But she does not receive any phone calls and meets very few people," he said. "The doctors there have said it will take longer to complete her treatment. They may have to operate upon her left eye. She would need six more months for follow up treatment after that. However, she wants to return at the end of September." The Awami League president continues to suffer from eye and ear ailments, fluctuating blood pressure and allergy-related complaints, the doctor said. "Her right eye is okay but 20 per cent vision in the left eye has been damaged. Her left ear has suffered complete damage and she needs the use of a hearing aid in the right ear." "Her blood pressure is now under control. Though allergy problems have decreased, they are not completely gone," said Modasser Ali. Asked whether he had discussed politics with Sheikh Hasina in the US, the doctor replied: "Sheikh Hasina believes terrorism and poverty are the main enemies of the country right now." "A secular democratic government can eliminate terrorism; terrorism spreads when an unconstitutional government stays in power, she believes. She expressed concern that Bangladesh must not turn into an Afghanistan," he said. The personal physician claimed Hasina's health condition deteriorated due to the impact of the Aug 21, 2004, grenade attack on an Awami League rally, and lack of correct medical treatment during her 11 months in special jail. Criticising the home adviser and inspector general of prisons for the latter, he said: "The advisers think they are angels. They think it is their sole duty to correct our behaviour. I think the home adviser does not hold the concepts necessary for holding his post." "Action should also be taken against the inspector general of prisons for Hasina's present poor state of health." bdnews
