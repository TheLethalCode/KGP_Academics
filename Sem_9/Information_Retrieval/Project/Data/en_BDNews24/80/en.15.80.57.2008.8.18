 Yangon,Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari arrived in military-ruled Myanmar on Monday for five days of talks to try to kick-start negotiations between the junta and the democratic opposition led by Aung San Suu Kyi. With little to show from his previous five missions to the former Burma, hopes of a breakthrough on Gambari's sixth visit are low.

The military will have an automatic 25 percent of seats in parliament, control of key ministries and the right to suspend the constitution at will.
