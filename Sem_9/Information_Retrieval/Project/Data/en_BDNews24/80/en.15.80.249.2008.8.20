<TITLE> Govt wants Khaleda free for 'meaningful' polls: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government is eager to release Khaleda Zia for the sake of "a meaningful election", says adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Asked by reporters why the government was so keen when the former prime minister was refusing even to petition for freedom, the adviser said Wednesday: "We want a free and fair election, and a qualitative change. That's why the issue of her release is important." "Granting permanent bail to Khaleda Zia or releasing her on parole will not be a problem, provided a greater understanding can be reached (by two sides)," the adviser said. "The government position on this was made clear when Sheikh Hasina was released," Hossain Zillur Rahman said. Asked if the government made a mistake by arresting Khaleda Zia, Hossain Zillur Rahman said: "History is a continuous process ... the decision to arrest her was the necessity of the time ... there's nothing to be mistaken about it." Hossain Zillur's comments came after a meeting with US ambassador James Moriarty at his education ministry office. But his cabinet colleague Ghulam Quader was more measured in his statement on the same subject. "We are not in control of things when it comes to releasing Khaleda Zia. Both the political party and the government are working on this. It is difficult to give you a date," Quader said. "Nothing has changed since the chief adviser spoke (last week) on the issue." "It's easier for the government to free anyone on parole, bail depends on the court. The government has no control on the courts," Quader told a questioner who asked about the procedure. Both advisers confirmed receipt of an Awami League letter seeking date for a second round of dialogue. Asked if the Awami League meeting was likely this month, Quader said: "We have so much in hand this month. We'll travel to Khulna for a cabinet meeting but still try to find time for the meeting." The Awami League said it wanted to discuss parliamentary and upazila polls among other issues. Hossain Zillur gave more details about the on-going dialogue with various groups. "Preparations are on to meet with the trade unions. Later, we'll sit with the representatives of women and the youth community, followed by representatives from the media. "In addition to this, regional dialogues have been planned in Barisal and in Mymensingh. But the dates are yet to be finalised." He said the first round of dialogue with political parties remained incomplete with the BNP refusing to take part. "But we are encouraged by their recent positive statements." bdnews24.com/
