 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)The closing day of the week was marked by rising indices on the country's stock exchanges. The day opened flat before buying occurred in midday trade, which pulled the indices up, an official with brokerage house Latif Securities told bdnews24.com Thursday. "Institutional and large scale investors went into buying. But small investors did not participate largely," he added. This caused volume and turnover to decline from the previous trading day. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark DGEN or general index started flat, gained in the midday sessions, followed by losses due to sell-offs. But it recovered towards the end of trade to climb 13.81 points or 0.51 percent to 2675.07. The DSI or all-share price index rose 11.23 points or 0.49 percent to 2295.94. The blue-chip DSE-20 closed at 2479.53, up by 13.02 points or 0.52 percent. All indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange also closed upbeat, paced by gains in ICT, chemical and insurers. The CSCX or selective categories index advanced 28.07 points or 0.52 percent to close on 5380.15. The CASPI or all-share price index closed at 8274.16, rising 32.65 points or 0.39 percent. The bourse's blue-chip CSE-30 gained 14.16 points, or 0.18 percent, to end on 7541.06. Turnover leader Titas Gas gained 8.19 percent to Tk 363.
