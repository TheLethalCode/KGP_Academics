 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League wants to hold talks with the caretaker government and the Election Commission in the first week of September, a party leader said Wednesday. AL sent two separate letters to the chief adviser and the chief election commissioner on Tuesday seeking a date and time for a fresh round of dialogue on issues related to timing of parliamentary and upazila polls. "The [CA's office and the EC] contacted us yesterday and are eager to sit for talks now," AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "But we want to hold talks with them in the next month as we have programmes this month," he said. AL and its associated organisations chalked out a month long programme marking the Aug 15 National Mourning Day, and the party has another major programme on Aug 21the fourth anniversary of a grenade attack on an Awami League rally in 2004. It would also take some time to prepare for the issues of discussion, Ashraf said. "We are not going for another dialogue only for the sake of talk. We want a fruitful discussion," he said. Asked whether AL had set the issues of the dialogue the party leader said: "We will discuss some incomplete topics of the last dialogue, including how constitutional bodies can be made neutral and their recruitment process made transparent, including unbiased recruitment in the judiciary." "We will also discuss the upcoming upazila elections, date of national elections and the state of emergency," he said. The Election Commission earlier held two rounds of electoral reform dialogue with 17 parties between Sept 2007 and Feb 2008. The government also held two rounds of informal talks with AL and other parties between April and June, leading up to the first round of formal dialogue concluded in July. bdnews
