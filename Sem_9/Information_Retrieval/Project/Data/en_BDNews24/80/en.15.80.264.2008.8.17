<TEXT>
 Jamalpur, Aug 17(bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed claimed Monday the present caretaker government during its 20-month rule has set the country back to twenty years. Speaking at a Jamaat rally in Jamalpur Monday, he said poverty had increased 23 per cent during the interim administration. He also demanded lifting the emergency and national elections as soon as possible. Addressing another meeting of district Jamaat leaders in Sherpur later the same day, Mojaheed repeated verbatim that the caretaker government had brought ruination to the country during its tenure. Speaking at the district town hall, he added that corruption rather than falling had increased during the term "by 2.5 percent". "Bribes worth Tk 5,000 crore has exchanged hands in one year," he claimed. Mentioning that Bangladesh now had no friends in the international arena, Mojaheed said "Nobody wants any more of this unelected government." bdnews24.com/cor
