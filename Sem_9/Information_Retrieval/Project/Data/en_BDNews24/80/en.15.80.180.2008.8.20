"The reintegration of Iraq into the Arab world is the principle objective that we should all work for," Siniora told a joint news conference with Maliki in Baghdad after talks in the Iraqi capital. Washington has been pressing Arab states to embrace the government in Baghdad, which has complained of being spurned by the rest of the Arab world.
