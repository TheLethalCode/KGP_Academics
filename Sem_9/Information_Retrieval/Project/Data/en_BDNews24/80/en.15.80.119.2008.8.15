<TITLE> Do not expect too many positive drugs tests - IOC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There will be far fewer positive drugs test at the Beijing Olympics than initially expected because testers are catching up with cheats, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday. The IOC had initially said it expected some 30-40 positive cases out of 4,500 tests, the most conducted at an Olympics. The previous Games in Athens four years ago saw a total of 26 cases of positive tests or other anti-doping rule violations such as refusal to provide a sample or missed drugs controls from some 3,300 tests. But furious pre-Games testing by international sports federations, national Olympic committees and the World Anti-doping Agency have yielded results this time round, the IOC said. "The cheaters are not way ahead," IOC Medical Commission chairman Arne Ljungqvist told reporters. "Recent events show we are on the heels of those trying to cheat. I expect we will end with a fairly low number (of positive cases)." "Mathematically it will go up to 6, 7, 8. Figures show they are rather encouraging more than anything else," he said. "There is greater awareness from the sporting community." While banned drugs have become more sophisticated in recent years so has drugs control. Tests in Beijing include a new and improved test for the once undetectable human growth hormone (HGH) and the IOC has warned athletes not to try it. Testers have also said they are able to detect a new version of endurance-boosting EPO that some had thought would go undetected in Beijing. So far only three athletes have tested positive out of about 2,200 tests after six days of competitions. A Spanish cyclist, a North Korean shooter and a Vietnamese gymnast have been banned from the Games, the latter two being announced on Friday. "In the Athens (2004) Games there were some additional cases. This time many federations have conducted intensive out-of-competition testing," Ljungqvist said. "We have seen the consequences of that." Dozens of athletes from several countries were barred from going to the Aug. 8-24 Games after testing positive in their countries in the weeks and months before the Olympics. Some national Olympic committees conducted as many as three drugs test before their athletes boarded the flight to Beijing. The IOC has also said as of July 1 any athlete suspended for doping for more than six months will be banned from the London 2012 Games as well. Any first-time offender is usually banned for two years. "It is encouraging, hopefully, that the athletes that are here and competing are clean," Ljungqvist said
