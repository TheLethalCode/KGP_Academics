PDP chairman Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi, speaking at a discussion on National Mourning Day Friday, said: "Bangabandhu's politics is today the ideal of politicians." "We faced all struggles and movements under his leadership. We learnt many things from him." "PDP will make all efforts to materialise Bangabandhu's guidelines into reality in the interests of the nation and the country." PDP has formulated a plan to coordinate Sheikh Mujib's national ideals and Ziaur Rahman's plan of action, said Qureshi of the country's two assassinated leaders. "We want to give everybody due honour in nation building." Quarishi felt that the changed situation had brought an opportunity for the practice of politics of understanding and amity.
