 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)--The government will permit trade union activities to resume on a limited scale in a week's time, labour adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday. Talking to reporters at the labour ministry, the adviser said: "After reintroduction of trade union activities, permission to hold polls will also be given in good time." "The workers' organisations will be able to hold elections after obtaining permission from their local police stations, after official approval has been announced to the public," said the adviser. A date for sitting with workers, as part of the political dialogue process, would also be finalised within a week, by which time the trade union activities will have started, Anwarul said. Meanwhile, the government has asked Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association to pay their workers the same 20 percent dearness allowance as has just been declared for government officers and employees. "BKMEA has already announced that it will pay its sectoral workers allowances equivalent to the 20 percent government dearness allowance." BGMEA too has been asked to pay their workers similar allowances, he said. On the garment factory owners' allegation about governmental failure to provide proper security to the sector, the adviser said: "The garments factory owners don't end up acknowledging all of the governmental facilitation efforts." bdnews24.c
