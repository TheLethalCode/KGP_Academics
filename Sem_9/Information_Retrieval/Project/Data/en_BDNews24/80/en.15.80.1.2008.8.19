<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue will for the first time award the country's 'best' tax payers, the NBR chairman said Tuesday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to hand the awards to the best tax payers of 64 districts at a programme slated for mid-September in Dhaka. "Five tax payers of each district will be awarded, of them two will be selected for paying taxes regularly over a long period and three who have paid most taxes," Muhammad Abdul Mazid told reporters at the NBR office in Segunbagicha. "We have requested the chief adviser to distribute the awards either on Sept 15 or Sept 16. The day will be officially declared 'National Income Tax Day'," he said. "The programme will also reward the best VAT paying organisation of each district. But how many will be rewarded is yet to be decided," the NBR chairman said. "Apart from 64 districts, separate awards will be given to the best income tax payer and VAT paying organisations of six city corporations of the country," Mazid said. "There will also be a separate programme for those awards, but how many people or organisations of each city corporation will be decided at a later date," he added. The NBR is still working to further extend the tax net outside Dhaka, the chairman said, adding that he and other officials were visiting districts and upazilas to that end. "We are getting positive responses," he said. In July, the NBR netted 9,778 new tax payers from the mufassal areas. They enlisted themselves, requesting Tax Identification Numbers, voluntarily. "Many people are coming forward to paying income taxes willingly," the NRB boss said. Replying to a query, Mazid said: "Measures against tax evasion is an ongoing process and it will continue countrywide round the year." "Nobody will be exempt; allegations will be investigated, and necessary steps will be taken against them in line with the income tax laws," he said. In reply to another question, he said: "The NBR will assist the Election Commission as much as it needs in the interests of a free and fair election." Mazid also mentioned successful revenue collection in the first month of current fiscal year. "We have got a positive response at the very beginning of the year." "We have realised revenue of Tk 3,709.52 crore in July, which is 6.81 percent more than the target and 23.67 percent more than achieved in the same month of the previous fiscal," he said. bdnews
