<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) - Tamim Iqbal blasted 85 from 45 deliveries but Bangladesh fell 14 runs short in their first warm-up match against the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) in Darwin. Chasing 331 on a flat pitch, the visitors were given the perfect start when Tamim took to the Queensland-contracted bowlers Grant Sullivan and Ben Cutting. When Tamim fell - the first of three wickets for Moises Henriques - Mohammad Ashraful kept the score ticking with 71 from 59 deliveries, according to a report on the cricinfo website. He guided them to a solid platform of 3 for 238 before he was bowled by Jon Holland, the rookie Victoria left-arm spinner, who went on to finish with 4 for 43 from his ten overs. The middle order could not capitalise and when Bangladesh needed 15 from the final over, Sullivan returned to pick up the final wicket. The positive batting was a good sign for Bangladesh, who before play lost the batsman Nazimuddin when he severely hurt his hand during a fielding drill. The bowlers were a little more rusty - nobody picked up more than one wicket - and will benefit from the remaining four practice matches before the three-game ODI series with Australia. The AIS posted an imposing 4 for 330, with Peter Forrest (83) and Greg Moller (74) the main contributors, while Henriques had a fine all-round game and remained unbeaten on 69 from 41 balls. b
