 Srinagar,Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian army troops came under mortar fire on Thursday from across a military control line that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, an army spokesman said. "Our troops did not retaliate," Indian army spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel S.D. Goswami said. "We are checking whether mortars were fired by terrorists or Pakistani soldiers." No one was hurt in the shelling in Rajouri sector on the Line of Control (LoC), or ceasefire line, in south Kashmir. There have been a series of clashes in the past few months along the 742-km de facto border after relative calm following the beginning of a peace process between the nuclear-armed rivals in 2004. New Delhi says Islamist guerrillas regularly slip into India under cover of shooting by Pakistani troops to join an insurgency in Kashmir that began in 1989. Islamabad denies the charge. The two countries have fought two wars over Kashmir, which they claim in full but rule in part, since independence from Britain in 1947
