<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government, before leaving office, will take steps so that all utility bills can be paid through electronic transactions, special assistant to the chief adviser M Tamim said Thursday. "Before we go in December, we will make arrangements for people to pay all four utility bills (electricity, gas, water and telephone) through electronic billing and payment systems," he said, at the launch of a new payment service by Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company and Grameenphone. The service enables Titas Gas consumers to pay their bills either from mobile phones with GP connections or at over 1,500 GP-authorised 'BillPay' centres across the country at anytime. Managing director of Titas, Md Abdullah said the new initiative would remove consumer hassles like standing in long queues, travelling, limited payment hours and various post-payment harassment. The service covers Titas Gas consumers in the Dhaka metro areas, Savar, Munshiganj, Mymensingh, Netrokona, Gazipur, Ashuganj, Bhairab, Narsingdi, Narayanganj, Manikganj, Sherpur, Jamalpur and surrounding areas. The pilot of the service kicked-off in Chittagong in December, 2006. GP's chief information officer Frode Stoldal said at the launch that BillPay is a reliable, fast and convenient service ensuring end-to-end transparency and ultimate convenience for Titas Gas consumers. "This is the first time a mobile operator has launched a service with universal access for all, regardless of having a mobile phone, including consumers who subscribe to other operators," he said. Energy secretary Md Mohsin and head of GP's financial services Delwar Hossain Azad were among those who spoke on the occasion. b
