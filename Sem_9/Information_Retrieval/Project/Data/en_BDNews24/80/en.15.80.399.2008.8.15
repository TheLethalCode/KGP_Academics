 GORI, Georgia, Fri Aug 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian troops remain deep inside Georgian territory on Friday, hours before US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrives to secure Tbilisi's signature to a peace deal with Moscow. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Sochi, near Georgia's border, to urge Russia to embrace diplomacy in its showdown with its small neighbor. Georgia has yet to formally place its signature on the deal brokered this week by France, and President Mikheil Saakashvili appeared uncertain about it. Saakashvili said he would need to "take a closer look" at the French-brokered peace proposal brought by Rice before signing it. "We have to see what she has to bring," he told CNN late on Thursday. Beyond two breakaway regions where thousands of Russian troops are deployed, Moscow still has tanks and soldiers in three Georgian towns, three days after declaring its military counter-offensive against Georgian forces over. On Friday, Russian tanks and armored vehicles were again blocking the main entrance to the key Georgian town of Gori, west of Tbilisi, a Reuters correspondent said. Russian soldiers relaxing under trees at the Gori checkpoint said looters had been active in the town overnight. Residents blame the lawlessness on Ossetian militias. Rights groups say militias are raiding Georgian villages abandoned by Tbilisi's forces and now held by Russian troops. Russian troops have occupied parts of Georgia since repelling a Georgian attack last week on the tiny separatist territory of South Ossetia, which threw off Tbilisi's rule in the 1990s. The West is determined to stop the Caucasus sliding further into conflict, not least out of fear for the security of key oil supply routes through the region from the Caspian Sea. On Thursday, witnesses said Russian tanks had rolled through the Black Sea port of Poti, accompanying trucks with troops to the port area. A large column of Russian troops was seen in the western town of Zugdidi, not far from the second pro-Moscow separatist region of Abkhazia. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on Thursday he was "extremely concerned" about the humanitarian situation in Georgia and called for a halt to lawlessness. Saakashvili said Russia was behind a "deliberate policy of ethnic cleansing". The conflict has further soured relations between Russia and the United States. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Thursday warned that U.S.-Russia ties could be "adversely affected for years to come" unless the Kremlin rethought its "aggressive posture" in Georgia. TROOPS PULL-OUT, INTEGRITY French President Nicolas Sarkozy, architect of a three-day old ceasefire, said Saakashvili's signature to the six-point peace deal would "consolidate" the halt to fighting and lead to the withdrawal of Russian troops. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said: "We can forget about talks on Georgia's territorial integrity because it's impossible to force South Ossetia and Abkhazia to agree that they can be returned into Georgia's fold by force". Mentioning Georgia's territorial integrity in any document settling the conflict would be seen by people as "the deepest insult", he added in a radio interview. Russia has said the case of Kosovo, a breakaway province of Serbia whose self-proclaimed independence was promptly recognized by major Western powers, creates a legal precedent for Georgia's separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. White House spokeswoman Dana Perino, responding to Lavrov, said Georgia's territorial integrity was not under debate. "Georgia's borders have been reaffirmed by numerous Security Council resolutions. So the question of Abkhazia and South Ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the UN Security Council," she said. "The resolution of Kosovo's status is covered by a UN Security Council resolution and that resolution envisions an international process. So the two cases are totally different. In a move likely to sour further Russia's ties with the US, Poland finally agreed on Thursday to host elements of US global anti-missile system on its land after Washington improved the terms of the deal amid the Georgia crisis. Russia views the planned US anti-missile shield in Eastern Europe as a threat to its national security
