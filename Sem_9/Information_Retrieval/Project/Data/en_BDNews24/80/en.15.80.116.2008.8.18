 Chittagong, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University came to a standstill on the first day of a 'siege programme' called by Bangladesh Chhatra League. Students were unable to travel to the university as movement of all CU-bound shuttle trains and other transport remained suspended, and no classes were held. Authorities suspended examinations, as well. The student wing of the Awami League staged demonstrations on the campus Sunday against an alleged attack by Islami Chhatra Shibir supporters on a mourning day procession the previous day. BCL leaders said they would continue their protests until their 'eight demands' were met, including punishment by expulsion of the pro-Jamaat-e-Islami activists they said were tied to the attacks. The demands also included resignation of the vice chancellor and proctor of the university and removal of the Hathazari police chief. They further pressed for indoor politics to be resumed on campus. At least seven people were injured in clashes between supporters of BCL and Shibir on Saturday. Both organisations blamed the other for instigating the violence. Monday saw two railway workers injured as rowdy students hurled stones at a university-bound shuttle train. They have been admitted to the Railway Hospital. GRP police officer-in-charge Mohammad Shahjahan told bdnews24.com: "Driver Mohammad Idris and his assistant Golam Maula were injured when some students hurled stones at the engine of a shuttle train as it was crossing Jautola station at around 7:30am." "After the incident, university-bound trains came to a stop," he said. bdnews24.
