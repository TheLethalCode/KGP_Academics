<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu has claimed that Jatiya Sramik League is not a 'front organisation' of Awami League, as it has separate registration. "The organisation is run as per the rules of International Labour Organisation," said Amu Sunday, at a discussion organised by Jatiya Sramik League's Dhaka city unit at the AL central office. He said no labour organisation can be a front or associate organisation of a political party. Amu also took the opportunity to once again urge the government to bring essential prices within the reach of the common people. AL ready to sit with govt: Zillur Meanwhile, more than 100 AL leaders and supporters, led by Naogaon district AL president Fazle Rabbi Bakul and general secretary Abdul Malek, met with AL acting president Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home. They urged Zillur Rahman to take active steps to get Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil released. Replying to a question from reporters on the occasion, Zillur Rahman said: "The next date for talks with the caretaker government has not yet been fixed." "We are ready to sit across the table if talks could solve all problems." Aug 15 not Khaleda's but BNP's real birthday: Tofail Also speaking at the Sramik League discussion Sunday, held to commemorate National Mourning Day on Aug 15, AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed urged the caretaker government to form a committee to find out the real date of birth of former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. "August 15 is not Khaleda Zia's real date of birth, it is BNP's actual date of birth. The day gave political birth to BNP through the killing of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman." Also indignant at the observance of Aug 15 as Khaleda Zia's birthday, fellow AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta said: "BNP's actions have not changed at all over the past 19 months." He urged the government to issue orders to hang the portrait of Bangabandhu in all government and non-government offices. He also repeated AL's claim that the caretaker government was promulgating ordinances which were unconstitutional. bdnews
