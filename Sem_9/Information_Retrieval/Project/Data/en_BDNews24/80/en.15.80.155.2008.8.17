 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Journalists say they will press the caretaker government to redraft the right to information ordinance that has been approved by the interim cabinet, calling it a 'black law' and claiming that as it stands the new law would curb rather than extend press freedom. Editors and representatives of journalists' organisations met Sunday at a discussion titled 'Review of the draft of the right to information ordinance', organised by a forum named the 'Media Commission' at the National Press Club. They said the ordinance approved by the government has such provisions which would curb the right to information, and it was therefore not acceptable to the journalist community. Some termed the new ordinance approved by the council of advisers a 'black law' and recommended legal action against it. Professor Sakhawat Ali Khan, former chairman of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism of Dhaka University, said the ordinance would curb rather than ease the right to access of information. "It is of course painful for journalists and people of the country," he added. National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud, pressing for a redraft of the ordinance, agreed: "If the new law is implemented, right to information will be curbed. We want a law in light of recommendations submitted by the Media Commission." He termed a bar on seeking certain information in the final ordinance "serious", and predicted that an independent information commission, if formed under the new ordinance, would face many hurdles and discrepancies amid the different laws governing freedom of information. The Right to Information Law Formulation Committee, under the ministry of information, prepared a draft of the "Right to Information Ordinance 2008" on Feb 6. On April 23, the Federal Union of Journalists, National Press Club and South Asian Free Media Association (SAFMA) submitted recommendations on the draft to the information secretary. The organisations say there has been no reflection of their recommendations in the final ordinance. Amar Desh editor Ataus Samad felt the ordinance approved by the government will create serious obstacles to attaining certain information. "It may rather be described as a black law to conceal information." "It is not acceptable to journalists," said Samad. Mahbubul Alam, editor of The Independent and a former information adviser, said reviewing the final law had been "frustrating." Jaglul Ahmed Chowdhury, chief editor of Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, said: "There are some discrepancies in the ordinance. Steps have to be taken to correct them taking these discrepancies into account." SAFMA president and The News Today editor, Reaz Uddin Ahmed said: "The final ordinance on right to information is nothing but a new edition of the Official Secrecy Act." New Age editor Nurul Kabir said: "After the finalisation of the ordinance it is clear that this government does not want to give people the right to information. It has to be resisted." President of the 'Media Commission' Mizanur Rahman Shelley presided over Sunday's meeting, attended among others by: SAFMA secretary general Zahiduzzaman Faruq, Dainik Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Dutta, heads of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists (BFUJ), Dhaka Union of Journalists (DUJ), Women Journalists Forum and Diplomatic Correspondents Association, Bangladesh (DCAB), human rights lawyer Advocate Elina Khan and convenor of the New Yorkbased Mukto Forum Masudur Reza Chowdhury. The meeting unanimously decided to press the government to redraft the ordinance. bdnew
