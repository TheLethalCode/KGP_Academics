<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Thursday said that overseas employment during the current fiscal would cross nine lakh. He urged the recruiting agents to procure decent work-offers instead of unskilled odd- jobs to stop exploitation of Bangladeshi workers abroad. "If the present trend continues, I expect that employment abroad for Bangladeshis will exceed 9 lakh this year," Iftekhar told reporters at his foreign ministry office. "This will be an all-time record, breaking even the previous year's record of 8 lakh 32 thousand," he said. According to the adviser, the government cleared 590,000 applications for overseas jobs till August. "I call upon the recruiting agencies to procure better and more decent offers of jobs from foreign companies, and not to exploit the poor aspiring migrants," said Iftekhar, also in charge of the ministry of expatriates' welfare and overseas employment. The adviser thanked the recruiting agency that got 200 skilled job offers from the US. "That is exactly the kind of offers we are looking for," he said. Regarding labour unrest in Kuwait, the adviser said: "We have nominated a new ambassador for Kuwait". The post of ambassador in Kuwait was vacant. "I have urged upon the Kuwaiti ministers to help resolve any outstanding issues". Unskilled Bangladeshi workers in Middle Eastern countries and Malaysia mainly serve as cleaners, sweepers, construction workers and odd- job men. bdn
