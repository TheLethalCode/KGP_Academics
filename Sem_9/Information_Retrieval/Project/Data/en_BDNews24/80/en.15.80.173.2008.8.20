<TITLE> Lack of data is leading to poor policy: Aziz </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com) Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam laments that a lack of updated and accurate information is leading to poor policy planning in the country. "We still lag behind as regards assured flow of timely and accurate information. I faced a lot of difficulties myself back in 1976 in accessing required information when I had undertaken my PhD thesis writing," Dr Aziz said in a view-exchange meeting Wednesday in the NEC conference room. "I guess that kind of handicap still bugs us, when the targets of our national economic development are to accelerate growth, poverty alleviation and employment creation. Timely and correct information is a must requirement to be met without fail for a flourishing industrial sector." The meeting aimed to expedite the manufacturing industry survey and the annual establishment and institution survey launched by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). "The government should discard the outdatedsay, the 10-year old data pools and seek out appropriate information for policy making." Referring to increasing dependence on imports, Mirza said, "Our tendency to import almost everything today is making it difficult to balance our forex earnings and expenditures." "Remittances from the Bangladeshi wage-earners abroad are helping the country strike a balance of a kind; but urgent steps must be taken to uplift our industry and exports. "To effect this, we need accurate and timely data supply and the BBS must wake up to this calling and provide all productive sectors with updated information in time." "The main hindrance in obtaining the much-needed information is that the data collectors lack required passion and eagerness and the information provider also lack cooperation. "For example, an industry providing correct data is likely to be cornered by the revenue people as regards its tax payments." The law provides that the BBS should treat all information provided by any industry confidentially, Aziz said and assured that the government will ensure its proper implementation. Presided over by the planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, the view exchange meeting was addressed by Mahbub Jamil, special assistant to the Chief Adviser in charge of industry ministry, NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid, BBS director general AYM Ekramul Haque, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies senior research director Zaid Bakht and Dhaka University economics professor Abu Ahmed. bdn
