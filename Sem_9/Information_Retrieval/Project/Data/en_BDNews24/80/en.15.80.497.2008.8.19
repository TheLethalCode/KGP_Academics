<TITLE> Dhaka closer to better global market facility: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Monday said Dhaka made headway at the WTO talks to getting meaningful market facility in the world market. He made the claim at a dialogue on "Collapse of Recent WTO Talks and Bangladesh: Experience and Options" at the CIRDAP auditorium Monday. He said many may think the ministerial-level meeting of World Trade Organisation at Geneva from July 21-31 has been a failure. "But it is not true that we did not achieve anything from it. Some progress has been made in getting meaningful market facility in different countries of the world including the USA and the European Union." The adviser said Pakistan and Sri Lanka had now softened their stance on the increase of Generalised System of Preference (GSP) facility for Bangladeshi goods in the US market. "We had been demanding for the increase for a long time. But Pakistan and Sri Lanka were making strong objections. They argued that if GSP facility was increased to Bangladesh they would lag behind in competition. "Now the two countries have moved from their previous stand. They have said that they don't have reservations about Bangladesh getting increased GSP facility. It is believed that the USA will now give Bangladesh 10 percent GSP facility," Hossain Zillur said. "There is nothing to be frustrated about. In the Geneva meeting we as a team comprising representatives from government, non-government and research organisations bargained for realising meaningful market facility. In some case we have achieved success. "We will have to gain facility by using this experience." Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) organised the dialogue where ambassador and permanent representative of Bangladesh to the WTO, UN office Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya presented the keynote paper. CPD chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan presided over the dialogue where commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, former foreign secretary Farook Sobhan, BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez and CPD executive director Mostafizur Rahman spoke. Debapriya said, "Many people hope that the WTO should assist in food security and combating fuel crisis. But it must not be forgotten that WTO is not a development agency, it's a trade body. The main job of the WTO is to assist different countries in matters of commerce." He said meaningful market facility has to be realised through bilateral and multilateral dialogue and bargaining. bdnew
