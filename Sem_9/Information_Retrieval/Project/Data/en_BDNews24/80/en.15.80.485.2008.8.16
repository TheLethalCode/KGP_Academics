 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  If you thought people who mind road and vehicles safety are qualified, you'd better go get yourself...er, well, a shock absorber! A glance over rsums of officers at the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) would tell you that as many as 25 of the 29 first-class officers (assistant directors) are undergraduates. Worse still, one of the 25 assistant directors has not passed the SSC examinations, according to BRTA's director of engineering Humayun Rashid Khalifa. These 29 officers head the regulatory body's 29 regional offices dotted across the country. The BRTA issues fitness certificates for all vehicles and route permits and monitors road safety issues and maintenance of government vehicles. "Only four assistant directors at my field-level offices are graduates. Mirpur office has two graduates while Jessore and Khulna offices have one graduate each," he told bdnews24.com Thursday. A 1992 recruitment policy for BRTA gave employees who had joined as mechanical assistant (Class Four employees) the opportunity to get promoted gradually to the post of assistant director thanks to their service length, Khalifa said. The mechanical assistants rose through the ranks, and were finally elevated to the position of assistant director. One only needed to complete Class Eight in high school to qualify as a mechanical assistant, according to the BRTA recruitment policy. The policy stipulates 50 percent of the posts of the assistant director be filled through internal promotion. The remaining posts are filled by a direct appointment procedure through the Bangladesh Public Service Commission (PSC). The minimum qualification required to be appointed directly as an assistant director is a bachelor's degree in engineering. "Because of their poor educational background, these officers don't understand the laws well and cannot implement government decisions." "The field level officers are key people of the BRTA," said Khalifa. "How can you expect quality service from the BRTA?" The BRTA staff are also in charge of "condemning" the government vehicles as per the Motor Vehicles Ordinance, 1983. "We have sent a proposal to the communications ministry to change the recruitment policy of the BRTA," said Khalifa. bdnew
