 David Wiessler WASHINGTON, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Time is running out for both presumptive presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, to name their running mates. Democrats begin their national convention in Denver on August 25 with Republicans going to St. Paul, Minnesota, a week later. Neither Obama nor McCain has given any clues as to whom they are considering as their vice presidential picks when they face off in the November 4 election. A string of potential VP candidates were queried on Sunday about the possibility of being picked for the No. 2 spot but all remained mum on their chances. One, Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal, flatly said he did not want the job. "I've got the job that I want," Jindal said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "I don't want to be the vice president. I am not going to be the nominee." Neither Obama nor McCain has given any clues as to whom they are considering as potential running mates when they face off in the November 4 election. McCain created a stir last week when he said former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a supporter of abortion rights in an anti-abortion party, could not be ruled out as a possible vice presidential choice. Some conservatives reacted angrily, but Ridge said on Sunday he was sure they would be pleased with McCain's final selection and his administration would be strongly anti-abortion. "The last time I checked, the vice president is not an independent voice. He echoes the position of the president of the United States," Ridge said on "Fox News Sunday." "If you're unwilling or unable to do that, then I think you should defer to someone else." Ridge and Jindal joined fellow Republicans Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on the Sunday television talk show circuit. A group of Democrats believed to be under consideration -- former South Dakota Sen. Tom Daschle, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and Govs. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bill Richardson of New Mexico -- also appeared on the shows. "I hate to disappoint you, but nothing to report today," Bayh said on CBS' "Face the Nation." "Same answer here," Pawlenty said. Both Bayh and Pawlenty are from states that could be in play in November and their presence on the ticket could help the presidential candidate there. "I don't have anything for you on the vice presidential front," Romney told ABC's "This Week." Romney, who was a major challenger to McCain early in the primary season, has been criticized by some conservative Republicans for liberal position he held earlier in his career. Kaine, who comes from a state that has not voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since 1964 but is considered a toss-up this time around, would not discuss any conversations about the No. 2 spot, but did say there was one advantage to being mentioned for the job. "My mom loves that," he told NBC.
