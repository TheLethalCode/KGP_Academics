<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government has asked authorities to stabilise power supplies across the country during the holy month of Ramadan, despite a nationwide deficit of 600MW a day, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources said Tuesday. Special aide M Tamim told bdnews24.com that this would be achieved in part by ceasing routine maintenance work at power plants during the month. The government has decided to keep load shedding to a minimal level during iftar, tarabih prayers and sehri during the holy Ramadan," he had earlier told reporters after a meeting at the energy ministry. "All power production units have been asked to keep fully operational during the month, and keep power supplies at the highest level from 6pm through 9pm for iftar and tarabih prayers and from 3am to 5am for sehri," he said. Directives have also been given for 'backup supplies' to mosques, if needed, Tamim said. He asked the business community to be careful of their power expenditure during Ramadan. "We are holding meetings with them so that any misuse can be curbed and they can be more economical in using power." "The total power demand for Ramadan will be 4,200 megawatts a day. But total production will be between 3,600 to 3,800 megawatts. There will be an unavoidable deficit of 400 to 600 megawatts," Tamim pointed out. The CA's special aide said that though all power plants in the country were operating, production was being hampered due to lack of water supply at Kaptai Water Supply Station and failure to ensure gas supply in Chittagong. "All units together are currently generating an average of 3,300 megawatts per day," he said. "This average will be increased during the evenings through Ramadan, by keeping generation to a maximum of 3,200 megawatts during the day so that the supply can be boosted to a maximum 4,000 megawatts in the evening." Tamim vowed to ensure even supplies throughout the country, but added: "It will not be possible to make up the deficit of 150 megawatts in Chittagong." Asked how long it would take to overcome power crisis, the special assistant said: "We will be able to boost average daily production by another 300 to 500 megawatts by October with the introduction of rental power plants." "The government has signed a deal to purchase a total 1,100 megawatts from these plants in the following months," he said. On whether there would be closing times for shopping malls would be extended beyond 8pm, Tamim said: "We don't have any such plans yet. It might be extended in the latter half of Ramadan." There would be a ban on illuminations during the month, he added. The CA's special assistant met earlier in the day with power production and supply agencies including Dhaka Power Distribution Company, Dhaka Electric Supply Company and the Power Development Board. bdnew
