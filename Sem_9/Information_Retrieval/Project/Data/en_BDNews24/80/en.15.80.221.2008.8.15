 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Friday said the national leaders should be held in huge respect by everyone whatever the political divide. "The national leaders should be shown profound respect by all together rising above politics," he told reporters after attending the South Asian Soroptimist Conference. Asked whether the government would declare independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the Father of the Nation, he said, "Nothing can be said right at the moment. It can be discussed." When reporters asked him whether the death anniversary of former president Ziaur Rahman would be observed at national level, he said, "To show respect to the national leaders all should rise above politics." Earlier, speaking at the conference organised by Soroptimist International Club of Dhaka on its golden jubilee, Hossain Zillur said women in Bangladesh had advanced a lot but needed to go further. "The presence of women in social and economic activities is more visible now than it was in the past. They are working in different fields including garment industry. "At the time of liberation the percentage of women primary school teachers was 2, now it is 40. Besides, the visible movement of women has increased." He stressed on physical education of women. "In our country physical education is required for making both men and women stronger. They fail to shine in sport events like Olympics. So stress should be given on physical education." President of Soroptimist International Club of Dhaka Arifa Rahman said, "Five women established this organisation in Bangladesh in 1983. Since then the members of the organisation have been working for the betterment of the women who are lagging behind." Representatives from south Asian countries and Great Britain have joined the two-day conference. bdne
