 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Left-handed Zunaed Siddique was called on Monday to national duty after a finger injury ruled out opener Nazimuddin for the one-day international series in Australia. "Nazim has torn one of the tendons on his left ring finger during the pre-match warm-up of the practice game against the Australian Institute of Sports in Darwin Monday," Bangladesh Cricket Board said in a statement. "The injury would require six to eight weeks of immobilisation in a splint," read the statement, adding that Nazim had been declared unfit by the team physio. The BCB selection committee picked Zunaed, who was on standby for the tour, after the team management asked for an immediate replacement. "We considered the Australian condition before picking Zunaed, who knows well how to face bowlers at this level of cricket," chief selector Rafiqul Alam said. He added the opener would leave for Australia in the first available fight. Nazimuddin was included only after fellow opener Shahriar Nafees opted out to attend exams. The one-day series is scheduled for Darwin on Aug 30, Sept 3 and Sept 6. b
