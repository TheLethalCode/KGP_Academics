 Dhaka, Aug 21(bdnews2.com)  The National Board of Revenue chairman has said they have proposed to the government for expansion of the central tax administrator. "We have submitted a draft proposal to the government and we hope it would be a reality soon," Md Abdul Mazid said at the NBR's Self-Motivated Taxpayer Awareness Programme Thursday.. He said Bangladesh could not be self-dependent if revenue collection did not increase. More than 2,500 people of tax circle-7 (Dhaka) paid Tk 89.26 lakh in taxes to register as taxpayers in the programme . Mazid, also the secretary for internal resources division (IRD) of the planning ministry, handed TIN (tax identification number) certificates among the new taxpayers. He said tax was necessary for a country as it contributes towards the betterment of the future generations. "It is really unexpected that a country of almost 15 crore people has only 5 lakh tax payers." Mazid said they had been working on simplifying tax payment process. "We are planning to set up one-stop service booths in the capital and camps in upazila to accept tax returns." The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam and Channel I managing director Faridur Reza Sagar attended the programme, chaired by tax commissioner Ziauddin Mahmud, as special guests. Sagar said revenue was an important tool for development. "It is very much essential as it would make us less dependent on foreign aid," he said. Anam appreciated the NBR's initiative that he said would sensitise citizens to pay taxes. He also stressed on constant training and development of tax officials to increase revenue collection. Mahmud sought cooperation of all quarters in their campaign to raise awareness among people to pay tax. b
