 CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand's cricketers remain concerned over the security situation in Pakistan ahead of next month's Champions Trophy, players' association chief Heath Mills said on Saturday. An International Cricket Council (ICC) taskforce and Pakistan coach Geoff Lawson spoke to the New Zealand squad in Christchurch on Thursday to update them on the state of affairs in the host country. However, Mills told The Press newspaper that nothing the taskforce or Lawson said had allayed the players' fears, adding that the situation in Pakistan was changing daily and had worsened even after the delegation had visited New Zealand. He conceded the security plans were impressive on paper and some of the best he had seen. "But the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether Pakistan could deliver on those plans," he said. "Getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there I don't know if the military could handle it." Mills said Lawson talked about his year living in Pakistan and generally painted a positive picture. "Our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions I thought, but I didn't get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation," he said
