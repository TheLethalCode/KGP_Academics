 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Sales of government bonds in the form of national savings certificates halved over the past fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal, due to spiralling prices and lower saving incentives created over the post-1/11 period, say experts. Out of line with previous year on year rises, sales of NSCs plummeted to Tk 2,228.29 crore in 2007-08 from Tk 4,174.92 crore in 2006-07. Investment in NSCs had amounted to Tk 2,996.58 crore in 2005-06. Zaid Bakht, Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies senior research director, told bdnews24.com Saturday: "There are two main reasons for the drop in investment." Soaring commodity prices was a major factor, he said. "Sometimes people are having to maintain family expenditure by withdrawing their previous savings." "The investment in NSCs also saw poor performance due to an order by the National Board of Revenue last year -- deduction of tax at source from the profit of savings certificates," Bakht said. The state of the nation after 1/11 last year, in particular the government's anti-graft drives, also dissuaded people from savings instruments, he said. NBR chairman Muhammad Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com: "The first half of the previous financial year saw a fall in the sale of savings certificate due to the complication of deduction of tax at source." "However, a resolution to the problem meant a turnaround in the second half." On July 10 last year, the NBR issued a directive to deduct 10 percent tax at source on the total profit of national savings certificates if the profit exceeded Tk 25,000. On Oct 6, the interim cabinet approved the raising of tax-free profit on NSCs up to Tk 1.5 lakh, to be applicable on savings from July 1, 2007. There are currently three types of national savings certificates, ranging from three-year term Bangladesh Savings Certificates to five-year term pension savings certificate. bdnews
