 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain, among the favourites for the men's Olympic hockey gold, muscled their way past inspired China 2-1 on Friday to close in on a semi-final spot with their third straight victory in pool A. The Netherlands, silver medallists four years ago, also stayed on course for a last four place by demolishing Canada 4-2, their third win in as many matches in the opposite pool. China, inspired by a vociferous home crowd, went ahead in the sixth minute through a penalty corner by Na Yubo, a livewire upfront, but went into a shell afterwards. "China played incredibly defensive," Spain's coach Maurits Hendriks told Reuters. "They really didn't come out to put pressure at all, which one can understand. "But I think one should give credit to their level of play. They have made Germany suffer, they made Korea suffer and they have made Spain suffer," he added. The hosts, playing in their first Olympics, are yet to win a point but have shown remarkable posture playing the world's top teams. They still have an outside chance of qualifying for the last four but need to win both their remaining games to stay in contention. Spain forced five penalties but converted just one through Xavier Ribas in the first half, and made 17 other attempts at goal. "With all the corners we should have put a margin on the board," Hendriks said. "We make ourselves suffer because of that. We are too forgiving in the circle without a doubt." Spain, who finished fourth in the 2004 Athens Olympics, have pool matches against Germany and South Korea remaining. Taeke Taekema, renowned for his wicked drag flick, spearheaded the Dutch attack with three goals, converting two penalty corners and one penalty stroke. Four more group matches, also featuring reigning champions Australia, will be played on Friday evening
