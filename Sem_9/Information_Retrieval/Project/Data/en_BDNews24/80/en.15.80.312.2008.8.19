 Dhaka. Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  Business leaders continue to voice concerns over the government's 'failure' to ensure security at garment factories but refuse to say what are the causes of recurring unrest, questioning instead the role of some NGOs and trade union leaders. "This year has witnessed labour unrest at 107 garment factories, with workers vandalising many of the units," FBCCI chief Annisul Huq told reporters after a meeting in Dhaka Tuesday. "Investors in this sector say they are not safe." Huq said the government must do its job and protect such investment. "The factories that have been victims of unrest are the ones that pay better wages." Then what are the reasons for the resentment and unrest? Huq evaded a direct answer. "Ninety percent of the violence is taking place in the sweater factories. They pay workers between Tk 4,000 and Tk 17,000." "Those paid less often put pressure on employers. But that has never been the cause of unrest," said Huq, a former BGMEA president. He claimed most of the factories had implemented the 2006 minimum wage rules by 2007. "Let the government provide protection. Wages and allowances of workers will be ensured by BGMEA and BKMEA." When told the owners were responsible for managing their workforce, Huq said: "They are trying. And in some places welfare committees for workers are being formed. But we also need the government to come out with a tough statement against labour unrest." Asked about the implementation of the tripartite agreement between government, owners and workers, BGMEA president Anwarul Alam Chowdhury Parvez said: "We have implemented 99.49 percent of it, including appointment letters, identity cards and maternity leave." The BGMEA president at a June 4 press conference blamed some NGOs and workers' federations for instigating labour unrest, but this time he did not comment on the issue. But BKMEA president Fazlul Huq took the question: "We are confused as to why a factory has been vandalised cannot be found out and the authorities cannot arrest anyone." Those present in the three-hour meeting included former adviser to the caretaker government Syed Manzur Elahi, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Latifur Rahman, International Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Mahbubur Rahman, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries president Hossain Khaled, Bangladesh Textiles Mills Association president Abdul Hye Sikder and former BGMEA president Fazlul Huq. bdnews24
