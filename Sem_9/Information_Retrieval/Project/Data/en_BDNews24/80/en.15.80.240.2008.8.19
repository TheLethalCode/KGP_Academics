 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hosts China stormed into the semi-finals of the women's Olympic basketball tournament with a 77-62 victory over Belarus on Tuesday. Captain Miao Lijie, China's best player during the group stage, again provided the spark, scoring 28 points to keep alive her team's chances of a first Olympic medal in 16 years. "I'm relieved," China's Australian coach Tom Maher told Reuters. "After we beat the Czechs and Spain (in the first round) there's no way we should lose to Belarusno offence." Maher accused his players of "sloppiness" after allowing Belarus to reduce China's 22-point lead to just nine in the final quarter until Miao hit a key fadeaway jumper in the corner. "We're like reformed drug addicts," he said. "We have to focus very, very hard from staying away from the evil things, Otherwise we fall back to it very quickly." Chen Xiaoli added 15 points from China, who finished runners-up behind gold medal favourites the United States in their preliminary group. The Chinese next play the winners of Tuesday's second quarter-final between world champions Australia and the Czech Republic. The U.S., bidding for a fourth straight Olympic title, Australia and Russia are expected to fill the podium places in Beijing. China last won an Olympic medal in women's basketball at the 1992 Barcelona Games, taking silver behind the unified team of former Soviet republics
