 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com)NRBs are now keener than ever before to come and invest in Bangladesh, an NRB group claimed Wednesday. Scholars Bangladesh, which organised a conference of non-resident Bangladeshis in December last year, made the claim at the launch of a report on their progress so far. The NRBs reportedly saw opportunities in higher education and health sectors and were willing to provide financial and technological support. "The proposals seem quite interesting. I'll ask you to consider the financial capacity of your country though," said cultural affairs adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury, present as the chief guest. The report said the government had also been providing better facilitation. The report listed the NRBs' "achievements" during the past months following the conference: uplift of passenger services at the Dhaka airport, Rajuk allotment of residential plots to NRBs, positive government attitude with respect to resolving NRBs problems, better research opportunities for the NRBs in the agriculture sector and plans for an economic zone for the NRBs in Sylhet. Dr Ziauddin Ahmed, professor at Drexel University in the US, proposed that the NRBs working with different universities and institutions abroad be given opportunity to help transfer technological know-how and expertise. For example, he said in his presentation, health and teaching professionals working at reputed organisations and hospitals may extend their hands of cooperation in increasing the knowledge and skills of professionals in Bangladesh. Dr Ataul Karim from Old Dominion University, USA, showed a video on how an institution similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology could also be founded in Bangladesh. Rasheda Chowdhury said the failure to enforce copyright law was not helping the artisans and painters, rendering them paupers, while cheats and impostors were minting money. "Only laws can't help much. Self-regulation also has its role in ensuring one's due," the adviser said. Those who spoke also included Dhaka Medical College professor Dr Fazle Hossain, Dr Manzur Ahmed, Dr Zahin Ahmed, NSU pro-vice chancellor professor SAM Khairul Bashar. bd
