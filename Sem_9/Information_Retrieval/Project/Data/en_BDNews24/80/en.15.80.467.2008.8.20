<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 20 (bdnews24.com) Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman Wednesday said his party remained pessimistic over a successful outcome to the August 21 grenade attack case, pointing to a general lack of commitment from the state to secure any convictions. "People in power have treated the case rather indifferently since it opened four years ago," Zillur told reporters following a meeting with the Bangladesh Rural Physicians' Welfare Society at his Gulshan home. "No one has so far taken any positive steps which might convince people that the case will be tried justly and the criminals involved punished in an exemplary manner," said the acting party president. Zillur yet again urged the caretaker administration to hold the parliamentary elections ahead of any other polls, saying: "We are prepared." He added that the AL is planning to launch a "democratic movement" demanding the Jatiya Sangsad polls be held first. AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta, who also spoke to reporters after the meeting, pointed to the experience of Pakistan, warning that local leaders should pay heed to the fate of Pakistan's Musharraf and take "an about-turn towards democracy." "Democracy has no alternative, though it faces a lot of hurdles in societies like ours," he said. bdnews24.c
