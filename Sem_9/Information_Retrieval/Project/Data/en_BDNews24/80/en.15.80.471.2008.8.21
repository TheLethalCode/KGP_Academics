 Dhaka, August 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Thursday sentenced Tariqur Rahman Prince, son-in-law of former caretaker government adviser Justice Fazlul Haque, to three years in prison for not submitting a wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission. Justice Khandakar Kamaluddin of Special Judge's Court-9 also fined the fugitive Tk 5 lakh or another three months behind bars on failure to pay. Prince has been on the run since the ACC asked for his wealth statement. The sentence will be effective from the day of his surrender or arrest. ACC assistant director Mohammad Ibrahim filed the case on May 8 with Dhaka Cantonment police. The antigraft body had previously filed a case against Justice Fazlul Haque on March 13 accusing him of amassing illegal wealth totalling Tk 97 lakh and concealing information in his wealth statement submitted at the ACC. bdnews24.com
