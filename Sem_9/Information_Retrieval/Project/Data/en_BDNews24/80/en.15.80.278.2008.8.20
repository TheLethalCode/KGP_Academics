<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) Banks were set a deadline by the central bank Tuesday to appoint two directors from among depositors by Sept 30. Bangladesh Bank, in a move to protect the interests of depositors, has made it mandatory for all private commercial banks to appoint two depositor directors, despite long-standing objections from bank owners and bankers. The central bank earlier issued the rules of appointment to the chairmen and chief executives of private banks, after a months-long tussle with bankers over the matter. Resistance from bank owners had earlier forced the central bank to relent after issuing a first circular on March 13 directing the banks to appoint depositor directors. On May 22, governor Salehuddin Ahmed assured bank owners at a meeting that they could choose independent directors to their boards instead. Two months later, on July 23, in another change of mind the central bank finally declared it mandatory for all private banks to appoint two depositor directors each. bdn
