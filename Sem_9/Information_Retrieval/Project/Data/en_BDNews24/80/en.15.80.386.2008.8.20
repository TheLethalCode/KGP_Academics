 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka University teachers backed by BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami of the White Panel swept the dean elections Tuesday, running away with eight of 10 posts up for grabs. A notable casualty was the incumbent dean of the biological sciences faculty, microbiology professor Dr Anwar Hossain of the Blue-Pink alliance supported by the Awami League and its Left allies. Blue candidate and general secretary of the DU Teachers' Association, Hossain was arrested, sentenced and then pardoned for his alleged role in the student protests of August last year. As many as 82 colleagues voted for his challenger Dr Abul Bashar while Dr Hossain could attract only 61. The Whites' victory was led by arts faculty dean Prof Sadrul Amin, who retained the top faculty post with 116 votes. Fellow professor of English, Dr Fakhrul Alam of the Blue-Pink combine, trailed him with 107 ballots. Political science professor Harun-or-Rashid was re-elected to the social sciences faculty with 100 votes, however. His rival White candidate, Prof Ferdous Hossain of political science, pulled just 53 votes. Science went to the Whites, with Prof Tajmery SA Islam securing 67 votes. Rival professor M Muhibur Rahman got 47. Prof Abbas Ali Khan (White) won commerce with 65, 12 votes more than Prof Mizanur Rahman's 53. The pharmacy faculty was retained by the incumbent, professor M Abdur Rashid, who won 30 votes. With just six votes, Prof Farida Begum was no match. White nominee Dr Shahida Rafique bagged 37 votes to win the engineering and technology faculty. The wife of former BNP minister barrister Rafiqul Islam Miah beat Prof Nimchandra Bhoumik who got 19 votes. White candidate Dr Shahnaz Huq (14 votes) became the dean of the earth and environmental sciences, with rival professor Hossain Mansur finishing just two votes behind. The Blue-Pink alliance's second seat came from the faculty of fine arts. Celebrated cartoonist professor Rafiqun Nabi, better known as Ranabi, won with 14 votes. White Abdus Sattar bagged 13 while independent professor Mahmudul Huq could muster 11. The law faculty failed to find a second candidate to challenge incumbent dean professor Borhan Uddin Khan of the White panel. bdnews24.c
