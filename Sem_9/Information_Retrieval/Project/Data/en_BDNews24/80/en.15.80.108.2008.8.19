<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League has written a letter to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed seeking a date and time for another round of dialogue with the interim government on issues related to timing of parliamentary and upazila polls. Awami League office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan and deputy office secretary BM Mozammel Haq handed the letter signed by AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam to the CA's secretary Quazi M Aminul Islam Tuesday. Later, the AL officials distributed copies of the letter to reporters outside the Chief Adviser's Office. Addressing the chief adviser the letter said: "Various questions have been raised and confusion has been created over important issues such as the Jatiya Sangsad election and upazila parishad polls." "We think it is necessary to have another round of dialogue with the chief adviser and his team as soon as possible on our proposals regarding the timing of parliamentary and upazila polls." "It is also necessary as a follow up to our earlier dialogue." Abdul Mannan told reporters that a similar letter had also been sent to the chief election commissioner seeking separate talks with the EC on the schedule for the upcoming elections. The Election Commission had earlier held two rounds of electoral reform dialogue with 17 parties between Sept 2007-Feb 2008. AL's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam has previously stated, after the AL-backed candidates swept the Aug 4 mayoral polls, that the interim government had no right to take unilateral decisions on major issues such as timing of parliamentary elections. The interim government, as part of the first round of political dialogue, held formal talks with the party on July 3 following party chief Sheikh Hasina's release on parole. A number of caretaker advisers met Sheikh Hasina at her private residence in Dhanmondi the night she was freed. The government also held two rounds of informal talks with AL and other parties between April and June, leading up to the formal dialogue. bdnews24.com/
