 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  No action can be taken against the police officers who investigated the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on an Awami league rally, and whose reports were proved wrong, as they have all retired, according to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Noor Mohammad. "We have examined the legal aspects, but have found no way to take action against them as they are all retired," Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Investigation officers in the case have been changed a total of four times in the past four years. According to the latest probe under senior assistant superintendent of police Fazlul Kabir of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), previous reports were proved wrong. The police chief earlier this year told the press that the process of action against the previous IOs for inaccurate or false investigations was on. But on Tuesday, he said only: "If any victim of the attack takes any initiative in this regard, we will help him." Public prosecutor Ehsanul Haque Samaji of Dhaka metropolitan judge's court told bdnews24.com: "The court can order action against the investigation officers for their wrong reports during delivery of its verdict." The 2004 attack on an Awami League-organised anti-terrorism rally left more than 20 people dead in front of the party headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped serious injury in the blasts. Shortly after the attack, sub-inspector Sharif Ahmed of Motijheel Police Station filed a case and sub-inspector Amir Hossain was made the investigation officer. The case was then handed to sub-inspector Shamsul Islam of the CID. Assistant superintendents of police Abdur Rashid and Munshi Atiqur Rahman were later assigned to investigate the case and special police super Ruhul Amin to supervise. The CID's senior assistant superintendent of police Fazlul Kabir was most recently made IO of the case on Aug 22 last year. Fazlul Kabir submitted a charge sheet before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on June 11, accusing 22 people in the case including former state minister for education, Abdus Salam Pintu, and banned Harkat ul-Jihad (Huji) leader Mufti Hannan. Mention of the militant group Huji's involvement was completely avoided in the previous police reports. Before Fazlul Kabir had taken the responsibility, 20 people were shown arrested in the case, three of whom gave confessional statements. Joj Mia was one of the three. Police, quoting him, sparked a controversy by alleging that listed criminal Subrata Bain masterminded the attack. Dhaka city Awami League leader Mokhlesur Rahman was also arrested. But the investigation under Fazlul Kabir did not find proof of involvement of the previous 20 suspects. Previous IOsAbdur Rashid, Munshi Atiqur Rahman and Ruhul Amin also face allegations of destroying evidence in the case. Fazlul Kabir however ruled out such allegations, saying: "Evidence was not destroyed, but one sample went missing." CID chief Zabed Patwary also said they had no information of evidence being destroyed. Patwary also conceded that previous investigation reports were flawed. He left the matter of punishment to the court. "It is up to the court. It can take action against the concerned officers or ask the CID to do so," Patwary told bdnews24.com. bdnew
