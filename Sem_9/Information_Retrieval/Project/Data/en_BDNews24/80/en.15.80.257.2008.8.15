 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hungarian Laszlo Cseh, beaten into second place by Michael Phelps three times at the Beijing Olympics, says his opponent is "unbeatable" at the moment but that he can surpass him. Eventually. The triple-silver medallist could be forgiven for throwing in the towel after the record-breaking Phelps, chasing an unprecedented eights golds at a single Games, beat him to the 200 metres individual medley title on Friday but he said he will fight on and can beat the American. "I always try, always go for the win, of course, but the reality is that at the moment he is unbeatable," Cseh told Reuters. "I'm not going to lack motivation. It's always been the case that I wanted to beat him. "I always aim for his times as my target. That is going to continue to motivate me. "I think he can be beaten and I want to beat him." Cseh also won silver in the 200 metres butterfly and the 400 metres medley and said he had no bitterness for his haul. "I'm satisfied with those three silvers. I don't feel like I missed out on something. "I felt like I could have got a better time in this one (200 IM) but that's what I could manage this time, maybe next time I can do better, I feel I have more inside me.
