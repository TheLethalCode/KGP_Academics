 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States battled its way into the final of the Olympic women's waterpolo on Tuesday with a 9-8 victory over arch-rival Australia. Brenda Villa scored a stunning goal in the last minute to set up a clash against the Netherlands, who defeated Hungary 8-7 in the other semi-final. "I wanted to start crying. It was a huge goal," said team mate Brittany Hayes. The U.S. team, who lost out to the Australians in the battle for gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, put its victory this time down to stamina. "Both teams were going all out for it. This is what we have been training for all yearto keep up with any team today," Jessica Stevens said. The Australians were quick to praise the American victory. "The girls fought a good fight. We knew it was going to be a tough game. But our girls came back (from 8-5 down at the end of the third quarter). That was incredible," said Emma Knox. "It is a great rivalry," said Australian coach Greg McFadden after a gladiatorial contest that lit up the Yingdong Natatorium. "We cannot make any excuses. They were a better team today." The other semi-final was equally close. Hungary took an early 2-0 lead against the Netherlands, which had beaten Olympic champion Italy on Sunday in a penalty shoot-out. Lefke van Belkum scored three goals for the Netherlands to take a 6-4 lead. Team mate Marieke van den Ham also scored three. The Hungarians threw everything at the Dutch who stayed doggedly ahead in a stamina-sapping last quarter before landing their place in the final with a 8-7 victory
