 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has replied to Awami League's letter for fresh talks, asking the party to clarify what issues it wants to address, the chief election commissioner said Wednesday. Awami League sent letters to the chief adviser and the EC Tuesday seeking a date and time for another round of dialogue on issues related to timing of parliamentary and upazila polls. "We have sent a letter to AL asking to know the particular issues they want to discuss," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after a meeting on voter listing at the EC Secretariat. "The commission has previously met with the political parties on issues related to schedules of national and upazila polls," Huda said. "The AL has not pointed out any specific agenda in the letter. We hope if the party specifies its agenda the commission will be able to clarify its position on that matter," he said. The CEC said: "Anybody may sit and talk with the commission. Our door is open." "We have not set any specific date to hold another dialogue with AL." Asked how many upazilas polls may be held in October, he said: "We have not mentioned the numbers yet. We suppose the polls will be held in between 300 to 350 upazilas." "The commission will fix the number of upazilas prior to announcing the polls date, after the promulgation of upazila election regulations," he said. The EC has already finalised the draft of regulations for the upazila parishad polls, Huda said. The Election Commission earlier held two rounds of electoral reform dialogue with 17 parties between Sept 2007 and Feb 2008. The AL also sent a letter to the chief adviser Tuesday for another round of political dialogue with the interim government. Addressing the chief adviser, the letter said: "Various questions have been raised and confusion has been created over important issues such as the Jatiya Sangsad election and upazila parishad polls." "We think it is necessary to have another round of dialogue with the chief adviser and his team as soon as possible on our proposals regarding the timing of parliamentary and upazila polls." "It is also necessary as a follow up to our earlier dialogue." The government held two rounds of informal talks with AL and other parties in April and June, leading up to the first round of formal dialogue. bdnews
