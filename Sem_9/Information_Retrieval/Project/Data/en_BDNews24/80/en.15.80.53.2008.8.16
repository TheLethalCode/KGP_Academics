 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Zhang Ning successfully defended her Olympic women's badminton singles title on Saturday with a hard-fought battle over compatriot Xie Xingfang, becoming the oldest woman to win the gold. Xie took silver and Indonesia's Maria Kristin Yulianti won the bronze. Zhang took game one 21-12 but Xie fought back to win the second, pushing her 33-year-old opponent all over the court with spiralling lobs and punishing drop shots.
