<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Naim Ahmed stated on Monday that the Political Intelligence Office was not formed to harass politicians. "PIO is not a new body. It started work about two months ago with the aim of supplying information for advance preparations in maintaining law and order," Naim Ahmed said at a press briefing at his office in the afternoon. The statement came in line with some news reports in both national and international media on the special intelligence outfit of the DMP. Naim stressed that although it had been named the 'Political Intelligence Office', it was not aimed at harassing anybody. "Educational institutions and the readymade garment sector are also under the purview of the body. A hotline has already been set up for garment factories," he added. "The PIO has been formed under the Dhaka Metropolitan Police Rules 2006. It was published in a gazette on October 19 in 2006." On activities of the body, Naim said the PIO members would collect information relating to law and order in the metropolitan area from police outposts. "They will also keep contact with the Special Branch of police," he said. The body is manned by an assistant police commissioner, two inspectors and sub-inspectors. Naim said the metropolitan police were trying to implement other sections of the DMP Rules 2006 gradually. Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman vowed Monday to resist any move "to spy on political parties by the Political Intelligence Office". "The government does not want politics in the country. The Awami League will resist the move," Zillur said at a meeting with Bangladesh Chhatra League activists at his Gulshan home. The PIO is a special detective outfit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police to keep an eye on grassroots activities of political parties, students and labour organisations, which started its activities two months ago with 20 members, Naim told bdnews24.com Sunday. bdnews24.c
