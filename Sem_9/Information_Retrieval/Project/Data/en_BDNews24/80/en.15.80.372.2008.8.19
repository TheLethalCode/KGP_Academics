<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Tue Aug 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The latest fighting between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tiger rebels in the island's far north has killed 22 people, the military said on Tuesday. The government said its forces had killed 21 rebels and lost one soldier on Monday, during an extended campaign to flush the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) out of their northern strongholds. The fighting in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna and Vavuniya districts comes days after the government claimed it stormed and captured a rebel training base with underground bunkers and also took over a town the LTTE uses as a logistics hub. "Troops killed 21 LTTE terrorists in Monday's fighting," said a spokesman at the Media centre for National Security, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity. "One soldier also died and 11 were wounded from the fighting." The LTTE had no immediate comment. Independent casualty reports are difficult to establish. The military claims its forces have entered the Vanni region in the north where the rebels' de facto capital Kilinochchi is located, amid a barrage of land, sea and air attacks. The LTTE have been fighting for an independent state for the ethnic minority Tamil people in northern and eastern Sri Lanka for the last 25 years. So far this year, according to a compilation of military data, some 5,867 rebels have been killed against the loss of 776 soldiers
