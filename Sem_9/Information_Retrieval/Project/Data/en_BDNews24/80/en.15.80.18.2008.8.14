 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government has finalised a Tk 2000-crore 100-day job generation scheme set to begin by mid-September throughout Bangladesh, says a senior government official. "The guideline has been formulated today (Thursday). Two million jobs will be created in two phases in all 64 districts," food and disaster management secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman told bdnews24.com. "But", he said, "monga-hit, haor-baor and river erosion areas will be given priority." The first phase of the programme would start in September for 60 days and a 40-day second phase would start in March next year, the secretary said. Each will get Tk 100 for a day's work and just one person from a family will be eligible. Work or no work, those, aged between 18 and 50, registered as destitute will get paid. "Those who will register will get at a minimum Tk 40 for the first 30 days even there's no work for them. They will get Tk 50 for the rest of the days," the secretary said of the unemployment benefit package. But absenteeism will not be tolerated. "There'll be no money for those not showing up for work." Anyone benefiting from any other state social safety net scheme will not qualify. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam had announced in his budget speech that the scheme would get Tk 2000 crore for 2008-09. The disaster management ministry will be in charge of the project. A steering committee led by the secretary will supervise the programme. bdnews24.c
