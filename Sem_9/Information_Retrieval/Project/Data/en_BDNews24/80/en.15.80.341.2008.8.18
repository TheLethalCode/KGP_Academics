 KARACHI, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Nasim Ashraf resigned on Monday just one month before his country hosts the Champions Trophy. His decision to stand down, announced by the PCB, came an hour after the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. The Pakistan president directly appoints the PCB chairman. Musharraf appointed Ashraf in 2006 after Pakistan forfeited the fourth test against England at the Oval. England were declared winners after Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq refused to lead his team back on to the pitch when they were docked five runs for ball-tampering. Last month the International Cricket Council amended the result to a draw. "I have sent my resignation to the president's secretariat and told them I can't continue performing my duties. After the president resigned I didn't think it would be ethically right to continue," Ashraf told Reuters. Ashraf said his resignation would not have any effect on the Champions Trophy one-day tournament which would be held on schedule from September 12. "The tournament will go on because the board is an institution and it will continue working. I will continue performing my duties till the resignation is accepted," he said
