<TEXT>
 SRINAGAR, Tue Aug 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shops, businesses and schools opened in Indian Kashmir for the first time in two weeks on Tuesday, as separatists called for three days of calm after the biggest protests in two decades against New Delhi's rule. Hundreds of people queued outside banks in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian Kashmir, and crowds thronged around markets to buy essential supplies. "There was little food left in our house, it is good they have called off protests for sometime," Mohammad Yaqoob said near a grocery shop. A dispute over land for Hindu pilgrims visiting a shrine in Kashmir snowballed into full-scale rallies this month, boosting separatists who want India's only Muslim-majority region to secede. Police have killed at least 22 Muslim protesters, including a senior separatist leader, in some of the biggest demonstrations since a rebellion against Indian rule broke out in 1989. The call for three days of calm appears to be a tactic by the separatists to keep up the protest momentum in the months ahead, something political analysts have said would be one of the most difficult tasks facing their movement. The largest protest took place on Monday when tens of thousands marched peacefully past the United Nations office in Srinagar, calling on the international body to intervene over the region that Pakistan and Indian claim in full but rule in parts. "Keeping in view the hardships of people we have decided to give relaxation in the strike on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday," Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of All Parties Hurriyat (Freedom) Conference, said. Protests would resume after Friday prayers, Farooq added. The recent crisis began after the state government promised to give forest land to a trust that runs Amarnath, a cave shrine visited by Hindu pilgrims. Many Muslims were enraged. The government then rescinded its decision, which in turn angered Hindus in Jammu who attacked trucks carrying supplies to the Kashmir valley and often blocked the region's highway, the only surface link with the rest of India. Thousands of Hindus were arrested on Tuesday and driven away to jails after they protested against the government's decision. In Kashmir, more than 43,000 people have been killed in violence, involving Indian troops and Muslim militants, since 1989
