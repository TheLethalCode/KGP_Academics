 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Co-favourites Germany suffered another setback on Friday in their quest for a semi-final spot in men's Olympic hockey when they were held to a 3-3 draw by feisty South Korea in pool A. Bronze medallists in Athens four years ago, Germany needed to win their remaining matches to keep a clear route to last four following a 1-1 draw with Belgium. The second drawn result in three matchesthey beat China 4-1 in the othermeans they cannot slip up in their remaining two outings, with New Zealand, who they play in their last match, nipping at their heels. Germany next play Spain on Sunday. "Just three chances for the Koreans and they took all," Germany captain Timo Wess told Reuters. "Frustrating for us, still everything is possible. We need just two wins in the next two games." Reigning champions Australia came back from a goal down to beat Pakistan 3-1 in pool B, their third straight victory to stay on track for a place in last four. The Netherlands, silver medallists in Athens four years, also held course for a last four place from the same pool by defeating Canada 4-2 for their third win. In the other group, in-form Spain, shooting for their first men's Olympic hockey gold, muscled their way past hosts China 2-1 to close in on a semi-final spot with their third victory. New Zealand beat Belgium 4-2 for their second victory to keep their semi-final hopes alive and Britain recorded their second win by beating South Africa 2-0 in the other pool. Germany, 2006 World Cup winners, came back from a goal down to lead 2-1 through strikes by Philip Witte and Matthias Witthaus. But Asian Games champions South Korea equalised through a penalty corner by Hyun Jong Jang amid rising tension and tempers. Germany went up 3-2 through Christopher Zeller, but South Korea drew level through captain Ho Jong Seo when Germany were down to 10 with a yellow card suspension. "It was unlucky and frustrating but it is hockey and 70 minutes on the pitch, and you can't be out of concentration even for one or two minutes or it goes like this," captain Wess said. "It was a much better performance from the last one against Belgium. We have a good chance to win against Spain is we play like today
