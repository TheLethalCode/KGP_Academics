 Darwin, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) - After their narrow loss in the first warm-up game against the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) the Bangladesh team would want to give a much improved display, particularly in the bowling department when the sides meet again at the Gardens Wednesday. Monday's defeat by 14 runs while chasing 331 might have given the batsmen some comfort but coach Jamie Siddons reckoned it was the bowlers who needed to pull their socks up. "I am happy with the way the batsmen are going and we have been making some big totals. Scoring 316 against any opposition anywhere in the world is creditable and theirs (the AIS') is a decent attack," said Siddons according to a report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Siddons said: "We could have won that match after being in control until the middle overs. But it is our bowling that has not managed to restrict oppositions in recent times and unless you do that you don't give yourself a fair chance of creating winning situations." The Bangladesh team had an hour and a half's solid training at the Marrara Oval this morning. Tomorrow's game could see the return of pace spearhead Mashrafe Bin Mortaza and middle-order batsman Alok Kopali who were both rested in the first match. Dollar Mahmud, the fast medium bowler, might also get his first game. The AIS side has already proved that they have a vast amount of talent and pedigree. All 14 players who have been picked are Cricket Australia contracted cricketers of State teams and the majority of them have first class experience. There are five cricketers from New South Wales and three each from Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. The age-level is between 20-25 and they all have been exposed to the hard grind of Australian domestic cricket. For the matches against Bangladesh the AIS team had prepared for four months. Bangladesh squad: Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Tamim Iqbal, Mehrab Hossain, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Alok Kopali, Dhiman Ghosh (Wicketkeeper), Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (Vice Captain), Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Farhad Reza and Dollar Mahmud. AIS squad: Matthew Wade, Greg Moller, Peter Forrest, Moises Henriques, Michael Hill, Liam Davis, Stephen O'Keefe, Steven Smith, Ben Cutting, Jon Holland, Grant Sullivan, Usman Khawaja, Theo Doropoulos and Peter Georg
