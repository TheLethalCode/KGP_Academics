 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) - Swimmer Dolly Akther slightly bettered her time in the international meet when she clocked 30.23 seconds to finish 73rd among 90 competitors in the 50m freestyle heat in the Beijing Olympics Friday. Dolly took part in the Heat 4 along with eight competitors to finish last at the National Aquatic Center in Beijing. The 5'2" height swimmer's previous best in the same event was 30.72 seconds in the 2004 Athens Olympics, though the 50m freestyle event is not one of Dolly's favourites. She also competed in the 100m breaststroke in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Bangladesh's fastest man Mohammad Abu Abdullah finished 67th out of 80 contestants, taking 11.07 seconds at the National Stadium in Beijing. Abdullah, who finished last among eight athletes in Round-1 Heat 8, became fastest man in the 2008 national athletic championship at home with a hand time of 10.30 seconds.
