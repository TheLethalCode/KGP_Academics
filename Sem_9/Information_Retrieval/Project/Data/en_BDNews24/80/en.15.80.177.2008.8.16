 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent, writes from Berlin Berlin, August 16 (bdnews24.com)--The focus is not on making money, but on achieving a sound balance between economical needs, environmental protection and good social standards, says Berlin-based BSR, a public company that manages domestic waste in the German capital. A German energy firm generates power from domestic public waste, opening yet another window on cheap, innovative energy options. Berliner Stadtreinigung (BSR), a public company based in the German capital, also produces steam that drives the turbine to generate power. The waste management system of BSR is well organised with the Berliners segregating the waste right at the source in different garbage bins and the BSR taking care of the rest. The BSR gathers waste from the grey bins, generated by some 3.4 million people in Berlin. It then treats the garbage to convert to products that abide by the waste management norms. Most of the waste is converted to harmless dust residue and slag; and the steam is generated with the energy produced from burning the garbage and supplied to a nearby power plant. Germany has strict laws about waste disposal, and BSR says it conforms to the law. BSR produces 1 million tons of steam a day by burning wastes and generates 6 times the power it needs. "We don't make profit, it's a non-profit organisation," says Dr. Thomas Kloeckner, a BSR spokesman. Wastes collected from the grey bins are put into the furnace and burned at 470 degrees Celsius with calcium to remove hazards materials and toxic gases, Dr Kloeckner explains. The chemical reaction with calcium helps convert waste to harmless by-products  25 tons of dust residues and slag a day. The slag is used for road construction; it had been used for land-fills before it was banned in Germany in 2005. The smoke produced by the furnace is released into the atmosphere after meeting the standard requirement. The treatment plant, located in the western part of Berlin, treats 50 percent of household wastes in Berlin. "Since June 2005 it is forbidden to cover land fill sites with waste in Germany, so we bury it 800-1000 meters below the ground in sand; and this is completely safe for the environment', says Dr Kloeckner. "We regularly observe the air quality here, we have to send the data to ministry of environment. We are very much cautious about further pollution," he adds. "Our focus is not on making money. But it is on achieving a sound balance between economical needs, environmental protection and good social standards." "The most important thing in waste management is to get rid of the dangerous stuff and that is our basic focus," the BSR spokesman says. BSR charges 65 euro per quarter for a 60-liter waste bin, 76 euro for 120-liter, 90 euro for 240-litre, 216 euro for 660-litre and 270 euro for 1100-liter waste bin. BSR has its critics, too. Kristen Freimann, a young Berliner, pays 300 euro per month for her flat and then pays BSR a further 100 euro for rubbish collection. She is not happy with BSR services. "They clean the big street but not the small one," says Freimann. The company employs 200 people besides having a small army of street cleaners and garbage collectors to take care of the entire process. BSR plans to have a biogas production plant within the next three years and a fermentation plant having a capacity of 60,000 tons. BSR has been working since 1967 on waste treatment and is now restructuring the pant for further development. There are around 30 waste treatment plants in Germany. bd
