 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) -- Politicians in Bangladesh saw the resignation on Monday of Pakistan's president Pervez Musharraf as a victory of the people over 'autocracy' and expressed the hope that democracy will now be strengthened in the country. BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said, "No powerful autocrat can cling to power against the will of the people. The rise of the democratic values of the people of Pakistan proves that." He believed with Musharraf out of the political equation, Pakistan's transition to democracy would be smooth. "All military autocrats relinquish power only after earning the wrath of the people. This has also happened in the case of Pervez Musharraf," Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "The autocrats snatch people's human rights and leave power, causing damage to the country. Their sycophants also meet the same fate," she added. Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Muhammad Qamaruzzaman termed the resignation the victory of democracy. "Though the latest election Pakistani people have revived democracy and at the same time gave a resounding verdict against the autocratic rule. Musharraf should have stepped aside much earlier," he said. However, Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) general secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim questioned whether real democracy would return to Pakistan, even with Musharraf gone. He said as long as Pakistan failed to tackle communalism and its foreign policy remained subservient to the USA, its people would not get a real taste of democracy. Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president Oli Ahmed had no second thoughts on describing Musharraf's resignation as a victory of the people. "This resignation is the latest example in the sub-continent that none can hang on to power though coercion. To stay in power one has to have people's trust." "God gives people power to serve the people, not to rule them I hope Bangladesh will learn from the developments in Pakistan." Kalyan Party chairman Muhammad Ibrahim also welcomed the resignation of Musharraf. "Through this resignation Pakistan and its people would be benefited. Democracy will be strengthened. The countries of the South Asia will also benefit." Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) chairman Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi said, "Musharraf's resignation proved that in the end people's will is the base of democracy." He hoped Pakistani rulers would take a lesson or two from the event. Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon congratulated the Pakistanis. "The people of Pakistan could get rid of military rule as a result of their long struggle. They deserve accolades for that. Military rule is not acceptable to any countrythe incidents of Pakistan proved it," he said. bdnews24
