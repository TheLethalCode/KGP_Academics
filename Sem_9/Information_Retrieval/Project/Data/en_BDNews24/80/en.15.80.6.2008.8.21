<TITLE> Kaniskina enjoys rain, javelin throwers don't </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's Olga Kaniskina gritted her teeth through torrential rain to win the Olympic women's 20-kilometre walk, the first of six gold medals available in the Bird's Nest on Thursday. The decathlon got under way with American Bryan Clay setting the early standard and the difficult conditions contributed to several medal hopefuls failing to qualify for the men's javelin final. After days of warm and dry weather, the women walkers were greeted with heavy rain but world champion Kaniskina made light of it to open a gap before the pack had left the stadium. She was never threatened and finished in an Olympic record of one hour, 26 minutes and 31 seconds. Norway's Kjersti Platzer came second 36 seconds back and Italy's Elisa Rigaudo took bronze after a late surge. Russian champion Tatyana Kalmykova was disqualified halfway through the race for lifting. Clay splashed through the puddles in 10.44 seconds to post the fastest time of the decathlon's opening event and injury-plagued defending champion Roman Sebrle clocked 11.21. The American then leapt 7.78 metres in the long jump, also the best of the field, to lead after two of the 10 disciplines. Many of the specialist men's javelin throwers struggled in the slippery conditions. Sergey Makarov, 2003 world champion and bronze medallist in the last two Games, Breaux Greer, bronze medallist at last year's world championships, and South African Robert Oosthuizen, the sixth-best thrower this season, all missed out on qualifying for the final. There were no such problems for the women's high jumpers, however, with all the big names progressing. The highlights of Thursday's evening session should be the women's 200 metres, with three Jamaicans and three Americans in the final, and the men's 400 in which the U.S. are looking for a clean sweep. There are also finals in the men's 110 metres hurdles and triple jump and women's javelin, and the men's 4x100 relay gets under way, though double sprint champion Usain Bolt is likely to be rested from the Jamaica squad for the heats
