<TITLE> Tigers open Australia tour Monday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Darwin, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) - While Saturday's practice was all about getting the bodies moving and easing into training Sunday morning's session of the Tigers at the Marrara Oval was far more intense. The quality of training was helped by the arrival of net bowlers from local club sides and atleast a couple of them packed enough pace to keep the batsmen on their toes, according to a report filed by tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. Balls wheezed past the nose regularly and Roqibul Hassan was rattled by a lifter from Nazmul Hossain and had to administer ice on his fingers. Nevertheless all the batsmen have looked in good touch and have batted confidently in the nets ahead of Monday's first warm-up game against the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS). The match at the Gardens Oval, just a short walk from the team's hotel, would give the tourists opportunity to test themselves against competent opposition. The AIS team is considered the best group of cricket talent Australia have had in recent times and a number of players had graduated from the Australian Under 19 side that had lost to Bangladesh in the Plate final of the 2004 World Cup. Bangladesh is likely to rest some players for this first game where both teams may decide to allow 12 playing members. "We would try to accommodate an extra batsman or two in this match. We would pick our final playing team tomorrow," said captain Mohammad Ashraful. The match starts 10:00am local time (6:30am BST). The weather has been perfect for cricket here and the clear blue sky is unlikely to be any different tomorrow. The Tigers play three more warm-ups against the AIS on August 20, 23 and 25. Bangladesh (From): Mohammad Ashraful (Captain), Nazim Uddin, Tamim Iqbal, Mehrab Hossain, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Alok Kopali, Dhiman Ghosh (Wicketkeeper), Mahmud Ullah Riyad, Abdur Razzak, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (Vice Captain), Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Farhad Reza and Dollar Mahmud. AIS (From): Matthew Wade, Greg Moller, Peter Forrest, Moises Henriques, Michael Hill, Liam Davis, Stephen O'Keefe, Stephen Smith, Ben Cutting, John Holland, Grant Sullivan, Usman Khawaja, Theo Doropoulos and Peter George. b
