 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  Tens of thousands thronged mosques across the country while others prayed to God at home during the holy night of Shab-e-Barat Saturday, for the forgiveness of past sins and in preparation for Ramadan. Falling 15 days before the start of Ramadan, the special night brings annual hopes of forgiveness and good fortune amid traditional festivities. Shab-e-Barat  the Night of Fortune  is believed to be one of the most sacred nights of the Islamic calendar for seeking forgiveness from God. Many believe that God writes the destinies of all men for the coming year by taking into account the deeds committed by them in the past. Devoted Muslims pray in their homes through the night, and distribute roti, halua and other foods to relatives and neighbours through the evening. The relatively modern tradition of distributing the special foods is also extended among the poor irrespective of religion. The Islamic Foundation organised waaz mahfil prayers at Baitul Mukarram Mosque from Saturday evening, to run through to early Sunday. An akheri munajat was offered at dawn Sunday. Dhaka Metropolitan Police banned the carrying and exploding of fire crackers from Saturday evening till further orders to maintain the sanctity and peace of Shab-e-Barat. Also known as Lailatul Barat, the holy night falls on the 15th night of the month of Sha'ban, of the Arabic Hijri calendar, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. Devotees offer nafal prayers, recite from the Holy Quran and perform doa throughout the night to seek God's goodwill. It has also become a long-standing social event and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh in particular, observe the occasion with great festivity. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed gave separate messages Friday to mark the occasion. bdnews24.com/rb/
