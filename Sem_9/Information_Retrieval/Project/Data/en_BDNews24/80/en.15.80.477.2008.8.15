<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Mourning independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman while shunning his ideals has no meaning, the Communist Party of Bangladesh said Friday. CPB leaders in a statement pressed for enforcement of the verdicts in the Bangabandhu murder case, and urged all to remain alert against using the national leader's memory as a commodity, for gaining material benefit or building up a career. They also pressed for identification of conspirators and backers of the assassination of the founding president of the nation, and re-establishment of his four ideals: Bangalee nationalism, democracy, secularism and socialism. The CPB leaders made the demands at a discussion at the party office Friday afternoon. CPB presidium member Shahidullah Chowdhury presided. General secretary Mujahidul Islam Selim, and central members Mahbub Alam, Sajjad Zahir Chandan, Siddique Ahmed, Hasan Hafizur Rahman Sohel, Khan Asaduzzaman Masud and Shakila Ruma attended. bdnew
