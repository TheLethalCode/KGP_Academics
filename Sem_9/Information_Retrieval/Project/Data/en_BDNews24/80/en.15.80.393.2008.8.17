 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  Commercial banks in Bangladesh may be bracing for mergers as they face a three-year deadline to raise capital to at least Tk 400 crore. A minimum paid-up capital of Tk 200 crore is required to be raised in three years, says a central bank circular issued Thursday. A higher paid-up capital is allowed, but the total including reserves must add up to at least Tk 400 crore. "We've given them adequate time and consulted the government," governor Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The circular was sent to the chief executives of all banks on Thursday. Any banks failing to meet the deadline will have to merge with another bank or financial institution, the central bank said. "It is aimed at further strengthening the financial base of the bank-companies operating in Bangladesh," says the circular signed by deputy governor Nazrul Huda. Governor Salehuddin said he hoped it would have a positive impact on the banking sector. Bank owners welcomed the move and the Aug 11, 2011 deadline. "The banks will get enough time to reach the mark," said Nazrul Islam Mazumder, chairman of the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB). "Banks especially ones in the private sector will be able to create a much stronger base and compete with foreign banks," he said. A second circular from the central bank on Thursday explained the new measure. "If necessary, the banks will not distribute dividends. If necessary, the banks will issue IPOs or rights shares." "No bank can give dividends if there's a capital deficit," according to the second circular, signed by general manager Jahangir Alam. The foreign banks will not be allowed to repatriate profits, and are required to bring in additional funds to make up for any deficit, it said. Bankers foresee the number of banksnow 48 in allshrinking, as a result of failure to meet the capital target. "Of course, mergers are likely," said DBBL additional managing director AHM Nazmul Quadir. There are 30 private commercial bankslicensed in three phases since the early 1980s allegedly often as political favourin Bangladesh. In addition, there are four state-owned, nine foreign and five specialised banks. "But it's not always reasons of capital that leads to mergers or acquisitions. Banks often merge to deal with poor management and classified loans," Quadir told bdnews24.com. Another top banker, who preferred to remain anonymous, said he believed Bangladesh Bank's move was targeted primarily to force mergers. In October last year, the central bank ordered the paid-up capital to be doubled to Tk 200 crore by June 2009. The latest directive raised the total (including reserve funds) to Tk 400 crore. bdne
