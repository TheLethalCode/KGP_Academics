 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Top-ranked Netherlands became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals in women's Olympic hockey on Saturday, beating Australia 2-1 for their fourth straight victory in pool A. The Dutch, silver medallists behind Germany in Athens four years ago, lead the pool with 12 points with a match left against Spain, who have won one in three so far. It was Australia's first defeat in four matches, and the three-times champions must win their final group match against China to assure themselves of the second semi-final place from the pool. A clear picture on the semi-final line-up will emerge later on Saturday after the other four penultimate round matches, also featuring China, are completed in both pools. "It's a good feeling. We tried to be the first to make it from our group," Dutch coach Marc Lammers told Reuters. The Netherlands came from a goal down to outclass their opponents forcing four times more penalty corners, but converting just two. Maartje Paumen converted both to take her tournament goal tally to seven. "Australia are really good at defending penalty corners. They are running in to it, they call it the suicide run, and it is difficult for us to shoot the ball well," Lammers said. Australia went ahead in the 17th minute though Sarah Young's strike, the goal set up superbly by Kate Hollywood from the right flank. "I think we didn't make the most of our opportunities. Probably ran into their flat stick tackles a bit too much and it didn't create that many opportunities," Australia co-captain Nicole Hudson told Reuters. "We knew it was always going to be a hard match. They are a very good team. But I think we played well today, probably didn't capitalise. I thought it was a pretty even game. "We just have to win the next match." United States beat New Zealand 4-1 in the opposite pool to their hopes alive for a semi-final place
