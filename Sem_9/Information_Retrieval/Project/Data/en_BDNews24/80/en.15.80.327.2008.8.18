 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com) Defeated Barisal mayoral candidate Shorder Sarfuddin Ahmed Santu accused the caretaker government Monday of stage-managing his defeat in the Aug 4 election. "The government foiled my victory in the elections," said Santu at a press conference held in the Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) office at Segunbagicha. He told reporters: "I had won the election by securing majority votes. But under pressure of certain quarters, or to gratify some political party or clique, responsible officials tampered with the vote counts and declared my opponent the winner." PDP's Santu and Awami League-backed candidate Shawkat Hossain Hiron were neck-to-neck as the results of the Aug 4mayoral election came out in Barisal, but Hiron was finally declared winner. Asked if he was contemplating legal measures to challenge the results, Santu said: "I can't go to a tribunal until I get a copy of the government gazette officially endorsing the poll results. Again, I have to wait for the new mayor's oath-taking before approaching the High Court." Santu, protesting the declared results, had earlier declared he'd sue the appropriate authorities. TV highlights of the Aug 4 vote counting and election results, which had been broadcast live on different channels, were shown to the reporters at Monday's press conference. bdnews2
