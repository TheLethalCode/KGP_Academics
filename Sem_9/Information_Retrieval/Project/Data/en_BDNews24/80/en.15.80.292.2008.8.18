 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  A special court on Monday denied bail to detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia in the Zia Orphanage Trust embezzlement case. Khaleda's lawyers applied for her bail to the court of Dhaka senior special judge Md Azizul Haque , but the judge rejected the bail plea saying the court did not have the jurisdiction to grant bail in the case. Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court similarly rejected an earlier bail plea by Khaleda, on July 30, in the same case. Khaleda's lawyers told the court Monday that she had been accused to politically harass her. They said they would soon appeal against the order and seek bail for Khaleda before the High Court. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on July 3 this year against seven people, including Khaleda Zia and her elder son Tarique Rahman, on charges of embezzling Tk 2.10 crore from the Zia Orphanage Trust. The ACC has already held 'jail gate' interrogations of Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman in its investigation of the case. Meanwhile, the ACC pressed charges Monday against Khaleda Zia's younger brother flight engineer Shamim Iskander and his wife Kanij Fatema, at the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court, accusing them of earning wealth beyond their known income and providing false wealth information statements to the commission. The ACC filed the case on May 18 with Ramna police against Shamim and his wife. Shamim was arrested on July 18. The High Court later granted him bail. The case states that Shamim submitted his and his wife's wealth statement on May 29 last year, in which they declared joint wealth of Tk 3.82 crore. But an ACC investigation later revealed that they amassed assets amounting to Tk 4.75 crore. The case was included under Emergency Powers Rules. bdne
