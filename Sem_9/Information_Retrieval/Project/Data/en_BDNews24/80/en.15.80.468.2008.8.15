 MOSCOW, Fri Aug 15,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's envoy to NATO said on Friday that a deal struck between the United States and Poland on missile defense amid the Georgia crisis showed the system was aimed at Russia. "The fact that this was signed in a period of very difficult crisis in the relations between Russia and the United States over the situation in Georgia shows that, of course, the missile defense system will be deployed not against Iran but against the strategic potential of Russia," Dmitry Rogozin said in a telephone interview. Poland agreed on Thursday to host elements of a US global anti-missile system after Washington agreed to boost Poland's own air defenses. Washington says the system is aimed to protect the United States and its allies from long range missiles that could in the future be fired by Iran or groups such as al-Qaeda. Rogozin criticized the United States for failing to support Russia in the crisis over Georgia and said relations with Washington could be harmed. "I consider that the United States is not acting in a cautious manner in this situation," Rogozin said when asked about US-Russian relations and the situation in Georgia. "Instead of getting full moral and political support in the struggle against real aggression and ethnic cleansing, we have heard a mass of unpleasant words and threats. That will of course not strengthen our relations.
