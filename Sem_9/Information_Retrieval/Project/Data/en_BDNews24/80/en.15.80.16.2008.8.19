 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)-- A transport workers federation on Tuesday threatened strike action throughout the country unless the government allowed trade union activities to resume fully by lifting the state of emergency by October 13. Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation (BRTWF), at a press conference in the city, also demanded the caretaker administration take measures to increase the wages of workers in the sector and implement changes in the passenger insurance system. Shajahan Khan, the BRTWF's executive president, complained of continued low wages in the sector, despite governmental hikes in transport fares. He claimed that according to the government's own rules, workers wages should be raised in line with any increases in transport fares. "As per the Transport Workers Welfare Act 2006, transport owners are supposed to provide appointment letters to their workers, but the employers don't follow the government's guidelines," said Khan. Leaders of the federation also allege that insurance companies have been misappropriating up to Tk 100 crore a year in the name of passenger insurance. "If the government does not implement our demands by the October 13 deadline, we will go for a transport strike across the country," BRTWF general secretary Hobibar Rahman Khan told reporters at the Photo Journalists Association auditorium. He mentioned that insurance companies are required to provide financial compensation to family members of passengers who died in road accidents, and that these companies took yearly premiums ranging from Tk 500 to Tk 4,000 against every vehicle in regard to this. "If the insurance companies collect Tk 1000 from each of the 10 lakh vehicles of the country, on average they receive around Tk 100 crore every year," said the executive president. Khan claimed that due to the difficulty in realising compensation from the insurance companies the vehicle owners themselves ended up compensating the victims of road accidents. "We propose that the government form a trustee board through the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority to dispose of the compensation claims," he said. "The owners will deposit the passengers' safety money to this trustee board, and the board will give compensation to the families of road accident victims," said Khan, who added that a similar board had been formed by the shipping ministry to compensate victims of launch accidents. bdn
