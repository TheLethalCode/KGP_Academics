 MIAMI, Tue Aug 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Storm Fay moved ashore over southwest Florida on Tuesday without strengthening into a hurricane, bringing heavy rains to the south of the peninsula, the US National Hurricane Center said. By 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), the eye of the storm had crossed the shoreline at Cape Romano, around 90 km south of the resort area of Fort Myers, the Miami-based center said. Its top sustained winds never went over 95 km per hour as it passed over the Florida Keys and menaced south Florida, below the 119 kph threshold at which tropical storms become hurricanes. The sixth storm of what experts predict will be an unusually busy Atlantic hurricane season, Fay brought gusty conditions and steady downpours to south Florida. The rain was much needed for an area where development over the past decade has outstripped water supplies. The storm killed more than 50 people in the Caribbean, most of them in Haiti when a crowded bus tried to cross a rain-swollen river and was carried away by the current. The hurricane center forecast that a weakening Fay would track in a northeasterly direction and briefly reemerge over the Atlantic before curving back into the coast of northeast Florida. While not particularly ferocious, the weather system knocked down trees, signs and awnings in the low-lying island chain of the Florida Keys and also uprooted some trees in the Miami area. Several thousand utility customers were without power in the Keys and south Florida. The storm's path was far from US oil and gas rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Nevertheless, some energy companies briefly pulled workers from offshore platforms. Orange juice prices shot up on Monday on fears Fay could hit Florida's main citrus growing areas. But traders said the areas would have to be hit by several much stronger storms, as they were in 2004 and 2005, for fruit trees to be affected. Across south Florida schools canceled Tuesday's classes and Gov. Charlie Crist warned residents to remain vigilant. The state was hit by a series of hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, including Katrina before it went on to devastate New Orleans and kill 1,500 people on the US Gulf Coast. But the United States escaped serious blows in 2006 and 2007, and authorities fear people might have become blase
