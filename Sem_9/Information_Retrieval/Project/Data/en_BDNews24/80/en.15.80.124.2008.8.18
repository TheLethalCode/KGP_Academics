<TEXT>
 PATNA, India, Mon Aug 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Bihar government is encouraging people to eat rats in an effort to battle soaring food prices and save grain stocks. Authorities in Bihar, one of India's poorest states, are asking rich and poor alike to switch to eating rats in a bid to reduce the dependence on rice. They even plan to offer rats on restaurant menus. "Eating of rats will serve twin purposes -- it will save grains from being eaten away by rats and will simultaneously increase our grain stock," Vijay Prakash, an official from the state's welfare department, told Reuters. Officials say almost 50 percent of India's food grains stocks are eaten away by rodents in fields or warehouses. Jitan Ram Manjhi, Bihar's caste and tribe welfare minister, said rat meat was a healthy alternative to expensive rice or grains, and should be eaten by one and all. "We are very serious to implement this project since the food crisis is turning serious day by day," Manjhi, who has eaten rats, told Reuters. In Bihar, rat meat is already eaten by Mushars, a group of lower caste Hindus, as well as poorer sections of society
