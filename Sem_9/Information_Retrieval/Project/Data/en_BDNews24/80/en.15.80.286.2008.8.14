 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has taken three state- owned commercial banks (SOCBs) to task over poor service, unpaid loans and below-par performances. "New managing directors and CEOs have been appointed to the three banks after they became public limited company. The banks have been given some target but they failed to achieve the target," he said after a meeting with the top executives of Sonali Bank at the finance ministry Thursday. "The SOCBs could make no headway in the recovery of unpaid loans and no improvement in customer service is there." "The banks have big amounts of defaulted loans with many state-run organisations. Besides, the banks cannot recover loan from many as there are cases regarding those loans. We are thinking about how these loans can be recovered." Thursday's meeting evaluated the performance of the banks in meeting the target for the first six months of the year. He said there were some improvement after Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks were made public limited company, but their performance was far from satisfactory. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, deputy governor Nazrul Huda, Sonali Bank chairman and cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder. Sonali Bank managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) SA Chowdhury and high officials of the finance ministry and Sonali Bank were present. Agrani Bank was made a public limited company several years back but Sonali and Janata were converted only at the fag end of last year. New managing directors and CEOs were appointed to the three banks in January this year. According to latest data from Bangladesh Bank, 13.15 percent of the loans distributed in the banking sector until March this year have seen defaults on repayments. Unrealised loans with Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks account for 30 percent of the total loans with defaults on repayments. In Sonali Bank the percentage is 35 percent. bdnew
