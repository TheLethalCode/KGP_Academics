 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American Torri Edwards, the fastest woman in the world this year, made it through to the second round of the Olympic 100 meters with the minimum of effort on Saturday. Edwards, who owns a world championship gold medal, confirmed her status as one of the favorites for the women's sprint title with a time of 11.26 to win her heat from the inside lane. "It was easy," the 31-year-old told reporters after running the fifth fastest time of the morning. "I was trying to run as slow as I could and advance." Jamaica's Shelly-Ann Fraser, Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart, who between them kept world 100 meters champion Veronica Campbell-Brown out of the event in Beijing, also moved through to the second round, which takes place later on Saturday. Fraser and Stewart won their heats in 11.35 and 11.28 respectively but Simpson took it a bit too easy and finished came home third in hers in 11.48. France's former European champion Christine Arron, at 34 some 19 years older than the youngest woman in her race, got past former world champion Lauryn Williams to progress in 11.37 even if the American had eased up. "I had no problems," said Williams, a silver medalist in Athens and 2005 world champion. "I'm sure they are not going to make it easy for me. There are a lot of good competitors in this race." Muna Lee, who beat Edwards and Williams at last month's U.S. trials, also made the next round with a comfortable run of 11.33 seconds. Current European champion Kim Gevaert of Belgium won her heat, also in 11.33, pushing defending Olympic champion Yuliya Nestsiarenka into second place. The Belarussian, her country's first track gold medalist, has not shown any kind of form this year but still got through in 11.40. Nigeria's Oludamola Osayomi ran the quickest time of the morning in 11.13 to win heat eight, while the slowest was Robina Muqimyar of Afghanistan who clocked 14.80 seconds. The final takes place on Sunday evening
