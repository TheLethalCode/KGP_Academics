 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one He Chong's easy dominance of the springboard semi-finals put China on course on Tuesday to maintain their monopoly of diving gold medals at the Beijing Olympics. A strong performance by Canada's Alexandre Despatie has however dented dreams of a host nation one-two. He Chong soared into the lead with his third dive, an ambitious forward two and a half somersaults with two twists, and sealed his first place position in the last round with one of the most ambitious dives of the event. China has won the men's springboard gold in the last three Games, and claimed all five diving golds up for grabs so far in the Beijing Olympics. The diving team is keen to extend both winning streaks and ideally pick up a silver as well. But former world champion Despatie threw off his shaky form in the preliminary round to emerge as the strongest challenger to He and Chinese team mate Qin Kai, with no judge awarding him fewer than eight points for any of his dives. "I'm much happier," he said after the competition. "It was important to turn the page and move on, which I did." Despatie edged out current world champion Qin Kai, who dived well but could not match teammate He, ending each round behind at least two other divers and holding on to a top three place only by the consistency of his dives. Mexico's Yahel Castillo, world number two in late July and highest scorer in the last two rounds, pulled off the most difficult dive of the semi-finals to finish in fourth place. Russian veteran Dmitry Sautin, 34, slipped slightly from the standard that won him a silver in the synchronised event and fourth place in the preliminaries, but made it to the finals. He has said these Olympics will probably be his last but would like to add one last medal to a record haul of eight, the earliest from 1992
