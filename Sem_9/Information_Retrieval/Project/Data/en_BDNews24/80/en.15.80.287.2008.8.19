<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The latest edition of the Jamaica v U.S. sprint duel kicked off in the women's 200 metres first round on Tuesday with American Muna Lee leading the qualifiers on another hot and clear morning. Jamaica have taken both 100 metres titles, including a clean sweep in the women's event, and Usain Bolt is a strong favourite to complete the men's double. The last Games in which the U.S. competed and failed to win any of the four sprints was 1976. Defending champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, fresh after missing selection for the 100 and fastest in the world this year, cruised through with fellow Jamaicans Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart, who shared the 100 silver. Allyson Felix, runner-up to Campbell-Brown in Athens but who turned the tables in last year's world championships, is again expected to be her chief rival. She went through smoothly along with Marshevet Hooker and Lee, who led the way with 22.71 seconds. "It's great, I've been sitting around watching everyone else so it's nice to get going," Felix said. "I was happy with my turn, finally. I just came out with the least amount of effort possible." The second round is later on Tuesday with the semi-finals on Wednesday and the final Thursday. There was an upset in the long jump when indoor world champion Naide Gomes of Portugal, whose 7.12 metres is the longest jump of the season, managed only 6.29m after two fouls to miss out on Friday's final. "I lacked confidence and felt a lot of pressure," she said. Brittney Reese of the U.S. led qualification with 6.87m. Carolina Kluft, who missed out on the triple jump final after opting not to defend her heptathlon title, also progressed safely. "I didn't get the speed over the board that I wanted but it was a safety jump," said the Swede. "I the final I hope to break my pb of 6.97 and see how far that takes me." All the major players in the women's javelin went through to Thursday's final, headed by Czech Barbora Spotakova. Tuesday night's action is highlighted by the men's 1,500 metres, where Asbel Kiprop and Augustine Kiprono Choge could lead a Kenyan 1-2. There are also golds up for grabs in the women's 400 and 100m hurdles and the men's discus and high jump. Bolt, bidding to become the first man to complete the sprint double since Carl Lewis in 1984, returns to the track in the 200 semi-finals before Wednesday's final
