 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Senior bureaucrats on Monday asked chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed to reshuffle local administrations in 15 days to help officials prepare for the general elections, a government spokesman said. "The officials will be able to adopt to the new environment if they are transferred now," CA's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim quoted a bureaucrat as saying at a meeting with the CA at the Cabinet Division. At the meeting, secretaries to ministries and departments promised to make the best use of their merit and efficiency to hold a free, fair and peaceful national election, Munaim told reporters. They demanded formation of a commission to oversee the issues regarding their appointment, promotion and transfer. Thirteen secretaries who spoke at the meeting suggested stricter overseeing of the appointment process. Many officials at the field level do not get the opportunity to work at the Secretariat while many at the Secretariat do not work at the field level, the secretaries said. It deprives them of having the exposure needed, and the issue, they said, can be addressed if there was a commission. Munaim said the secretaries also proposed formation of separate committee to train officials of the ministries of finance, commerce, planning and the Economic Relations Division in negotiating agreements with foreign countries. The bureaucrats reiterated their demand to extend the retirement age but did not specify the age. "They have told the chief adviser that the average age of the people of Bangladesh has increased. If the retirement age is extended the government would get more service from the experienced officials and employees," Munaim said. They referred to the retirement age of bureaucrats in India and retirement age of judges in Bangladesh. In India, retirement age of civil servants is 60 and judges in Bangladesh retire at 67. Munaim said the bureaucrats expressed interest to work in the United Nations peacekeeping missions and asked the interim government head to develop The Public Administration Training Centre in Savar. The secretaries demanded a new pay commission be formed and a new salary scale be announced soon. They also demanded the pension be paid in its entirety at the beginning of retirement, instead of 80 percent. They said the new pay commission should pay extra attention to retired officers and employees. bdnews24
