<TEXT>
 Kuwait, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  A small group of Bangladeshi workers in Kuwait went on strike from Sunday, still unhappy over low pay after demonstrations by overseas workers were quelled in the Gulf state in July. Some 16 Bangladeshi workers were arrested by Kuwait police, expatriate welfare and employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Monday. Attempts were underway to release them, Matin had said, later informing bdnews24.com of their release. Quoting officials of the Bangladesh mission in Kuwait, he said some 16 Bangladeshis cleaners had downed tools and reportedly resisted the police. Meanwhile, Kuwaiti daily The Arab Times reported Monday that some 20 Bangladeshis, working at the Kuwait Parliament Building, called the strike. The angry workers alleged that the authorities had deducted a portion of their wages beyond the company act. Acting National Assembly speaker Roudhan Al-Roudhan vowed to discuss the issue with the employer, The Arab Times said. The newspaper also said that the officials of the labour ministry had come to know that other Bangladeshi workers in other sectors might also go for rigorous movements. Security forces were asked to pay heed. Another daily, the Kuwait Times, quoting officials of the ministry of labour and social welfare, said that security measures had been beefed up in the fear of further demonstration. Social affairs and labour minister Bader Al-Duwailah said measures would be taken against companies that were not depriving workers of their deserved salaries. Security was tightened to maintain law and order in the country, he said. South Asian workers in Kuwait, including Bangladeshis, called a strike and held mass demonstrations the end of July, demanding better pay and working conditions. Kuwait police arrested at least 800 Bangladeshi workers at the time, and deported over 1,129 workers to Bangladesh in several phases. Some of these were deported for staying illegally after their work permits had expired. bdnew
