 Istanbul,Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirteen people, including seven police officers, were injured on Thursday in an explosion which ripped through a minibus in the western Turkish city of Izmir, broadcasters said. Television pictures showed large clouds of smoke rising from the scene of the explosion as concerned residents looked on amid the sound of emergency service sirens. Three soldiers were also hurt in the blast when a parked car exploded as a minibus carrying police officers passed by, a reporter from the Dogan News Agency told the broadcaster CNN Turk. The blast shattered windows in the surrounding area, which was near a police housing complex in the Buca district of the Aegean port city of Izmir, Turkey's third-largest city. Police were not immediately available to comment. Islamist militants, Kurdish and leftist guerrillas have often carried out bomb attacks in Turkey in the past. A suspected suicide bomber detonated explosives in his car in Turkey's southern Mersin province on Tuesday, killing himself and injuring nine police officers. Sabah newspaper on Thursday said the explosives used in that blast were the same as those used in a double bombing last month in Turkey's largest city Istanbul in which 17 people were killed. Officials have blamed those bombings on Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas
