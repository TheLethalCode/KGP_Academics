<TITLE> Tsvangirai says Zimbabwe talks going `very well' </TITLE>

 JOHANNESBURG, Sun Aug 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Sunday power-sharing talks at a regional summit were making good progress, raising hopes of an end to a post-election political crisis. He told reporters the negotiations were going "very well". Power-sharing talks began last month after Mugabe was re-elected unopposed in June, in a vote condemned around the world and boycotted by Tsvangirai because of attacks on his supporters. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) will meet southern African leaders at the summit to try to break a deadlock that is holding up efforts to rescue the country's ruined economy, said Tsvangirai spokesman George Sibotshiwe. MDC officials will hold talks with Southern African Development Community (SADC) leaders in the group's politics, defence and security committee "to resume engagement of the issue of Zimbabwe", he said. Neither Tsvangirai nor Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, in power since 1980, seemed to be budging on the issue of who will run Zimbabwe, which is in dire need of a leadership that can rescue its shattered economy. Leaders of 14-nation SADC had discussed a draft agreement in a closed session of the summit and both Mugabe and Tsvangirai had taken part, diplomats said on Saturday. A diplomatic source close to the talks said progress had been made, and that an agreement could be signed soon. All Zimbabwe's neighbors fear the consequences if its political stalemate and economic decline lead to total meltdown, and there are growing signs of impatience. Botswana President Seretse Khama Ian Khama's boycotted the summit. Millions of Zimbabweans have fled across the borders to escape the world's highest inflation rate -- over 2 million percent -- as well as massive unemployment and shortages of food and fuel. South African President Thabo Mbeki, mandated by SADC to mediate in the negotiations, is under immense pressure to secure a deal. He has come under repeated fire for not being tough on Mugabe while Zimbabwe's daily hardships deepen. Mbeki has argued all along that pushing the defiant Zimbabwean president would only aggravate tensions
