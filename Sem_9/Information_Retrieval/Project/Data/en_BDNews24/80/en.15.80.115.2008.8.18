<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Monday made public a probe committee report on Bangladesh's failure in the AFC Challenge Cup and South Asian Football Championship blaming players, coaches, and to some extent, team officials. In line with the recommendations of the probe body comprising Haroon-or-Rashid, Anwarul Haq Helal and Sirajul Islam Bachchu, team coach Abu Yousuf and national team captain Aminul Haq have been relieved of their posts. Yousuf was accused of failing to take his side to an international level despite getting one and a half months as well as for failing to unite the team. He was also charged of making unwarranted speeches against the team leader and team manager, thus breaching the code of conduct through talking to the media to tarnish the BFF image. Yousuf was also blamed for not taking steps against players who breached discipline and also failed to make them fit for 90-minute games. Meanwhile, Yousuf stepped down a few days after Bangladesh's failure to qualify for the semifinals of the SAFF Championship in June. Aminul Haq was accused of failing to lead the team in a unified and disciplined way and for also failing to solve internal problems of the senior and junior players. The BFF also warned assistant coach Golam Rabbani, vice captain Biplob Bhattacharya, defender Hasan Al Mamun, midfielder Aram Aziz and striker Jahid Hasan Emily. Considering the past records, the football governing body advised team manager Sheikh Mohammad Aslam and team leader Shafiquzzaman to be more responsible and careful in the future. The report also blamed the concerned BFF officials of the time for not paying heed to the national team and not monitoring the systems and thus damaging the team's harmony and discipline. It also revealed that the team had not been guided in the proper way as the then BFF executive officials were busy with elections. The BFF on June 18 formed a probe committee after finding dissimilarities in the reports of the coach, team manager and team leader, and after interviewing 11 persons, submitted its report on July 15. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin had earlier promised to bring the probe committee report to light.
