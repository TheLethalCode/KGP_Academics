 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue's amnesty offer to tax dodgers has so far received lukewarm response with only 92 people "legalising" Tk 15.4 crore in the last one and half months, tax officials said. The government received Tk 3.38 crore in taxes. Tax officials say they are expecting a better response in coming months before the end-October deadline. NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com: "Based on our past experiences we can say people rush to take the chance when the deadline nears." He hoped that this time would be no exception. "We gave this opportunity for four months till October 31," Majid said. "After the deadline is over the NBR will start a drive against those who did not legalise their undeclared money within the given time. None will be spared; stern action will be taken under existing tax laws against all kinds of tax dodgers." In the last one and half months, since the offer began, a total of 92 persons have legalised Tk 15.40 crore in undeclared income, NBR income tax cell member Parsha Begum told bdnews24.com Tuesday. NBR realised taxes and fines of Tk 3.38 lakh from the amount, she added. Last fiscal year, 44,449 people legalised or declared Tk 5,213 crore in a similar programme, with the government receiving a total Tk 802 crore. Last time a 5 per cent extra tax had to be paid with the fixed tax for the tax year in which undeclared money was legalised. This fiscal year it is a 7 per cent fine in addition to the tax. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam proposed a repeat of last year's tax amnesty in his budget speech on June 9, to be availed from July 1 to Oct 31. The NBR issued the directive in this regard on June 14. Last year the opportunity was initially given for two months and later extended by another two months up to September 30. Tax dodgers against whom allegations of tax evasion are already being investigated with legal steps under process cannot in any way take this opportunity. A government circular also mentioned that the opportunity would not be applicable in case of money earned or invested by dishonest means. bdnews24.c
