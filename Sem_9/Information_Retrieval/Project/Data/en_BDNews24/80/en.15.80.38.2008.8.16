 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Michael Phelps equaled fellow American swimmer Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven golds in one Olympics on Saturday after coming from behind for a fingertip victory. Trailing Serbia's Milorad Cavic in the 100 meters butterfly, he lunged forward on his final stroke to touch a hundredth of a second ahead, the smallest margin possible. Phelps, the sporting phenomenon of the Beijing 2008 Games, punched the air and screamed with joy as a capacity crowd in the Water Cube rose to hail him. "It's pretty cool, that's all I can say," said Phelps, who thought halfway he had blown it. "I am in a sort of dream world." On Sunday, Phelps can go one better than Spitz if he wins an eighth Beijing gold in the 100 medley relay. The man he may surpass was gracious with his compliments. "He can be called the best Olympian of all time," Spitz told America's NBC television, "not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way he's handled himself and in the way he's actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure." The spotlight shifts later to the Bird's Nest stadium, where the world's fastest men face off in the 100m sprint in front of more than 90,000 people and a vast global television audience. Jamaica's Usain Bolt, who seized the world record by running 9.72 seconds in May, looked ominously fast in qualifying heats for the showcase event of the Games. His main rivals, former world record holder Asafa Powell and American world champion Tyson Gay, have been put in the shade by the tall 21-year-old's 100m performances in the last year. Formerly a 200m specialist, Bolt hopes to be the first man to win the 100m and 200m Olympic double since Carl Lewis in 1984. Despite their tradition of producing world class sprinters, Jamaica have yet to win a men's 100m gold and the Caribbean islanders will be watching tensely at 10:30 pm (1430 GMT). SPITZ RESPONDS Phelps now has 13 career golds, four more than anyone else in the 112-year history of the modern Games. Only seventh at the turn on Saturday, Phelps's second length was one of the comebacks of his career. He clocked 50.58 seconds to Cavic's 50.59, close enough for Serbian officials to protest. Swimming's governing body FINA confirmed the result. "I personally looked at the video footage and it was very clear the Serbian swimmer touched second," race referee Ben Ekumbo said. Phelps said he was hurting during the last 10 meters. "It was my last individual race and I just wanted to finish as strong as I could," he said, laughing and waving at fans. Phelps's success is down to total focus and the perfect swimmer's physique of large torso and huge reach on short legs. His arm span is 3 inches more than his 6ft 4 height. The only surprise was that Phelps did not win in world record time, unlike his other six title-winning swims in Beijing. The women, though, were in record breaking form. Zimbabwe's Kirsty Coventry, who had won three silvers already in Beijing, finally struck gold in the women's 200 backstroke, bringing some rare cheer to her troubled homeland. She shaved 0.85 seconds off the previous world best. "I'm so excited I can hear my national anthem play, I'm so proud, it'll be exciting back home," said Coventry, who has been called a "golden girl" by President Robert Mugabe in a rare accolade from him for Zimbabwe's white minority. Britain's Rebecca Adlington also smashed a 19-year-old world record to take gold in the women's 800 freestyle. She had won Britain's first Olympic women's swimming title in nearly half a century in the 400 freestyle on Monday. Then Brazilian Cesar Cielo Filho won the men's 50m freestyle to give his country their first Olympic swimming gold. WRESTLER THROWN OUT But the Games have had some low moments as well. Sweden's greco-roman wrestler Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his 84kg-category bronze medal after he threw it down in disgust to protest a refereeing decision. Olympic organizers also threw him out of the Games for his medal ceremony protest. China's gold medal charge paused on Saturday, with only one badminton gold coming the way of the host nation as attention switched to sports where the Asian nation does less well. In all, 27 golds are up for grabs on Saturday. Australia picked up two gold rowing medals but lost to Britain in a thrilling sprint for the line in the men's four. More medals should come Britain's way in the cycling. China came second to the United States in the medal table in Athens and would dearly like to win this year to showcase a sporting superpower status to mirror a growing economic clout. Currently China leads the gold medal table with 27 to the United States' 16
