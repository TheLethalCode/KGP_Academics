 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday began trial of the MiG-29 case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, by framing charges against her and seven other accused in the case. If the charges are proved in court, Hasina could face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the minimum being 10 years. Hasina's lawyers appealed to the court to defer charge framing for a month, but Dhaka divisional special judge Golam Mortuza Mojumdar set Sept 3 for witness testimony to begin in his special court on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. Hasina's defense counsel said the former prime minister, who is currently abroad on parole for medical treatment, would return home by Sept 8, and asked for more time. The prosecution argued that Hasina had in any case been exempted from personal appearance, and one of the defendant's lawyers was participating in the charge hearing and standing in on her behalf. Hasina would face no future impediment by being absent during charge framing; the trial should go ahead, the prosecution said. The court on Aug 12 had ordered all accused, including Hasina, to appear in court on Aug 20 for charge framing. Hasina's counsel Advocate Sahara Khatun stood on Hasina's behalf during the indictment and plea. The judge read out the charges against the accused, and asked them for their innocent or guilty plea. All the accused pled their innocence, including Sahara Khatun on behalf of Hasina. The now defunct anti-corruption bureau filed the case on Dec 11, 2001. Seven, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, were accused of incurring state losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore through the purchase of eight MiG-29 combat jets. Charges were pressed against the seven on Jan 29, 2003, though the case later remained suspended for years as Hasina petitioned the High Court to quash the case. Other accused are former air force chief retired Air Vice Marshal Jamaluddin Ahmed, former defence secretary Syed Yusuf Hossain, former defence joint secretary Mohammad Hossain Sherniabat, retired Air Commodore mirza Akhtar Maruf and Unique Group proprietor businessman Noor Ali. Former army chief Mustafizur died on Aug 3 this year. Hasina, 9who is currently in the US seeking medical treatment on a temporary release order from the government, was exempted from personal appearance in the case on June. Her 'parole' is valid up to Sept 6. bdnews24.com
