 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  The holy night of Shab-e-Barat on Saturday brings annual hopes of forgiveness and good fortune amid traditional festivities. Shab-e-Barat, meaning the night of emancipation, is believed to be one of the most sacred nights of the Islamic calendar for seeking forgiveness from God. Muslims traditionally believe that God reviews all people's past deeds on the night. Many believe too that the fortune of each human being for the coming year is determined on Shab-e-Barat. Also known as Lailatul Barat, it falls on the 15th night of the month of Sha'ban, of the Arabic Hijri calendar, ahead of the holy month of Ramadan. Devotees offer nafal prayers, recite from the Holy Quran and perform doa throughout the night to seek God's goodwill. It has also become a long-standing social event and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent, Bangladesh in particular, observe the occasion with great festivity. People prepare special foods such as bread, a variety of sweetmeats and halua , offering them to neighbours and the poor. President Iajuddin Ahmed, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed gave separate messages Friday to mark the occasion. bdnews
