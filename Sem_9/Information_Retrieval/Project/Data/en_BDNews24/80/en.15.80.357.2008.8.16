<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  Some 1800 non-resident Bangladeshis (NRBs) have applied at the Bangladesh consulate in New York in July for special status, a diplomat said . Consul general M Shamsul Haq told bdnews24.com correspondent Shehabuddin Kisslu many more applications remained incomplete because of a lack of information and proper papers. On how the expatriate Bangladeshis would benefit from the special status, Haq said as the NRBs would have identity cards they could expect better services from the government. Besides, those who would send more than $100,000 to Bangladesh would get special services at the airport. The ID cards, valid for one year, would be sent to the selected persons by post or the consulate would distribute those in the specific areas. The diplomat felt they would get more response from the expatriates if the application deadline was extended. bdnews
