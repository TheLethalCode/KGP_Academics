 Jerusalem,Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed in southern Israel on Tuesday, prompting the Jewish state to order border crossings with the Hamas-ruled enclave closed temporarily, Israel Radio reported. An Israeli army spokesman said the rocket landed in an open field near the border with the Gaza Strip. It caused no injuries or damage. Israel Radio said Defense Minister Ehud Barak ordered border crossings with the Gaza Strip to be closed until at least Thursday in response to the latest rocket salvo. The army and Defense Ministry had no immediate comment. Rocket firings have become rare since an Egyptian-brokered truce between Hamas and Israel took effect in June
