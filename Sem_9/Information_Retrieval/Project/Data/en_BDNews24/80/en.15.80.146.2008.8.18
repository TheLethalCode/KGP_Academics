 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Monday appointed Shafiqul Islam Manik national coach assign to prepare the national team for the upcoming Mardeka Cup in Malaysia. "The BFF executive committee today (Monday) approved Manik's appointment in line with the recommendations of the National Team Management Committee (NTMC)," said BFF vice president and NTMC chairman Badal Roy at the signing ceremony of the agreement at the BFF House. Roy said that Manik would take the responsibility of the national side and be involved in the any coaching programme conducted by the BFF during the training period of three months and 14 days. His contract came into effect on Monday. Bangladesh will take part in Malaysia's Mardeka Cup scheduled for October 15-25. The former footballer-turned-organiser said the BFF would consider renewing the contract after evaluating his performance as they had sad experiences with the local coaches. He, however, said that they had a long-term plan with Manik when they would appoint a foreign technical director. On a query, Roy said that they would have some recommendations on the selection of players, but they would reserve their comment once the players were selected. Roy said that they just wanted sincerity and honesty from the new coach. "I want to thank the BFF for evaluating me," Manik said, "I believe we can go far if we are able to work together." Manik, a former national player, last time coached Mohammedan Sporting Club, which finished runners-up in 2007 inaugural B. League and emerged champions in 2005 Nitol-Tata National Football League. The defender-turned-coach, considered a proponent of the defensive strategy, also guided Muktijoddha Sangsad that bagged the Premier League title (twice), the National League (once), the Federation Cup (twice), Independent Cup, DAMFA Cup and the 1998 McDowell Cup in Kolkata.
