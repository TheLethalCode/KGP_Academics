 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police have warned BNP against holding its planned march on the Chief Adviser's Office Thursday, to press for Khaleda Zia's release, saying such a programme is against emergency rules. "Holding a rally and march of this kind without prior application is against Emergency Powers Rules 2007. So all have been asked to refrain from such activities," said a DMP statement issued Wednesday. DMP warned that anybody violating the rules would face stern action. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com Wednesday evening: "The BNP secretary general will meet with other four-party alliance leaders tomorrow morning before the scheduled programme." Rizvi said the alliance leaders would make a joint decision Thursday morning in the light of the DMP statement. The four-party alliance announced the march on the CA's Office and submitted a memorandum to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Aug 14, to urge the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia and the overseas medical treatment of her detained son Tarique Rahman. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain reiterated the demands of the four-party alliance on Wednesday. "Free Khaleda without delay. Our peaceful and regular programmes will continue until she is freed. The four-party alliance's programme on Thursday will also be peaceful," Delwar said at a token hunger strike of BNP associated organisation Jubo Dal. bdnews24
