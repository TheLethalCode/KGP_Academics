 KARACHI, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A planned three match one-day series by New Zealand in Pakistan has been scrapped, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Wednesday. "We have got no confirmation or reply from New Zealand on the tour as yet. And now it would not be possible for us to arrange the series even if they say they are coming," Shafqat Naghmi, the PCB'S chief operating officer, told Reuters. New Zealand had initially given their consent to playing one-day internationals in Faisalabad and Multan from Aug. 24 in preparation for the Champions Trophy. But New Zealand later expressed doubts over the security situation in Pakistan and their players are now also reluctant to play the Champions Trophy from Sept. 12. Naghmi said it would now be impossible to organise a series at such short notice. ICC officials are due to visit Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England to brief players and officials on security arrangements for the eight-nation Champions Trophy
