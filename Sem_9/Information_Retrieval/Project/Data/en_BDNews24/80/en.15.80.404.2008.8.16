 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dara Torres, swimming's oldest Olympic medalist at 41, taught her juniors a sprinting lesson when she posted the fastest semi-final time in the 50 meters freestyle on Saturday. Torres, who helped the U.S. win silver in last Sunday's 4x100 freestyle relay, clocked 24.27 seconds to win the second semi-final from 16-year-old Australian Cate Campbell, who was the second-fastest qualifier with 24.42. "I'm happy, not expecting anything though," said Campbell. "I didn't sleep a lot, I was just lying in bed waiting for my race. I hope to go quicker tomorrow." Germany's Britta Steffen, winner of Friday's 100 freestyle gold medal, won the first semi-final in 24.43, with Marleen Veldhuis of the Netherlands second in 24.46. "My swim was good, tomorrow is another race. I know I'm in contention but so is everybody else, it's all close out there," said Veldhuis, who held the world record for five days in March. Australian world champion Libby Trickett, silver medalist behind Steffen in the 100 freestyle, was fifth-fastest overall in 24.52, well outside her world record 23.97. "I'm just happy to get in the final, obviously with the 50, it's anyone's race, we'll just have to see what happens tomorrow," said Trickett
