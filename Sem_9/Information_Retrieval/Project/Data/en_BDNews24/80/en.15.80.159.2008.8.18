 Rangpur, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Internee doctors at Rangpur Medical College and Hospital went on strike Sunday in protest at the assault of a doctor after the death of a patient, police said. Acting director of the hospital Dr Anisul Karim said the authorities were urgently trying to resolve the crisis as the strike put hundreds of patients of the hospital in trouble. Kotwali police chief Ali Ahmed Hashemi said the doctors stopped work Sunday noon in protest against the attack on intern 'Ratan' and two employees by the relatives of Rahima Khatun, 50, who died in the hospital. The protesters said the doctors were attacked without any reason. They claimed the patient had been given proper treatment. Ratan told reporters that Rahima's family members rampaged through the hospital after her death at 7.30am. "They attacked nurse Ferdousi and ward boy Abdul Aziz. They broke my mobile phone and attacked patient files." Police chief Hashemi said they arrested Rahima's brother Badsha Alam on charges of assault. The protesters later met acting director Dr Anisul Karim and demanded punishment of the attackers. bdnews24
