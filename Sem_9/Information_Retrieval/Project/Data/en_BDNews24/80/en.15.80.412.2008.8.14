 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) - Khandaker Jamiluddin is all set to become Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) general secretary being the lone contestant to submit his nomination Thursday for the 28 August election. Jamiluddin, known as a cricket organiser and a vice-president of the just dissolved BHF ad-hoc committee, is expected to be declared uncontested general secretary on Aug 20, the day of announcing the final list of the candidates, if the election commission finds no mistakes in his nomination during scrutiny. Jamiluddin, however, submitted two nominations for the same post, according to the election commission. It, however, was not an easy path for Jamiluddin as another general secretary candidate Shahriar Alam withdrew his nomination after submitting his candidature. A total of 55 nominations were submitted for 28 executive posts, except for that of president post, generally nominated by the National Sports Council. Two panels -- one led by Jamiluddin and another led by Shahriar Alam -- Wednesday reached a pact for a consensus committee with the District and Divisional Sports Associations Forum getting a total of 11 posts, but it broke down Thursday following the demand of the latter. The panel led by Shahriar Alam had wanted two more member posts for its councillors from Chittagong and Barisal along with a vice president post for the immediate past ah-hoc committee general secretary Sajed AA Adel. Now, both panels expect to reach a consensus on posts' distribution by Aug 19, the day of the nomination withdrawal, but one candidate of the Shahriar Alam panel seeking anonymity told bdnews24.com that they would withdraw all their 16 nominations if their demand were not met. Shahriar Alam, Protap Sankar Hajra, Shahjahan Sarkar, Sajed AA Adel, Azizur Rahman Raju and Abdul Gafur submitted nominations for five vice president posts. Khaza Rahmatullah, Abdur Rashid Shikdar and Masurul Kabir Rintu and two others tendered for two joint secretary posts. Kazi Moinuzzaman Pila and Haji Monwar Hossain submitted nominations for a lone treasurer post while some 40 contestants will be competing for 19 member posts.
