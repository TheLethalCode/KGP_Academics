<TITLE> Arambagh in Fed Cup quarterfinals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) - Arambagh KC moved into the last eight of the Citycell Federation Cup while Muktijoddha Sangsad kept their hopes alive after their Tuesday match. An 85-minute strike from Turjo powered Arambagh to a lone goal win over Sunrise SC at Gazipur Stadium. With the second straight win, Arambagh raised their points tally to six from two outings and ensured their quarterfinal berths. The result also threw Mohammedan into the last eight as the popular black and white outfit remained unbeaten to collect six points from two matches. Rokanuzzaman Kanchan stuck a second-half goal as Muktijoddha beat Khulna Abahani 1-0 at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. Kanchan found the back of the net six minutes into the second half after the barren first half. Muktijoddha, who drew 1-1 against Dhaka Wanderers in the tournament opener, have now four points from two games, one point ahead of Farashganj SC, who, however, played one match less than the freedom fighters' team.
