<TITLE> Ex-guerrilla chief Prachanda to be sworn in as Nepal PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu,Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former Maoist guerrilla leader who led a decade-long insurgency against Nepal's Hindu monarchy will be sworn in on Monday as the Himalayan republic's first prime minister. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who still goes by his nom de guerre Prachanda - meaning "terrible" or "fierce" - was picked on Friday by a special assembly meant to write a new constitution and double as an interim parliament. Prachanda's election, after his Maoist party won a surprise victory in April's assembly elections, caps a peace process ending a civil war in which more than 13,000 died. But the former school teacher will face a tough task meeting the hopes of millions of Nepalis in one of the world's poorest nations eager for law and order and economic improvement. His group still figures in the United States list of terrorist organisations, although US officials have met Prachanda. Prachanda no longer uses the language of Marx and Mao, and he has embraced private investment. But he has also promised land reform for millions of poor farmers that make up the majority of Nepal's population. The United Nations food agency says Nepal is one of the 16 "hunger hotspots" as Nepalis, among the world's poorest, face soaring food prices, a chronic energy shortage including electricity, fuel and cooking gas. Kidnappings and robberies are common. Business officials say regular shutdowns and labour strikes have sapped business confidence and the government must revive investment in industry to create jobs. "There is one reason for all these examples of anarchy: the absence of the state," the Nepali Times weekly said in its latest edition. "We can only hope that all this will change with the election of a new prime minister." The new government also faces the task of integrating more than 19,000 former guerrillas housed in 28 UN-supervised camps and bringing the army, traditionally seen loyal to the now-abolished monarchy, under civilian control. It must also deal with more than 200,000 refugees displaced by the conflict as well as demands for property seized by the Maoists during the conflict to be returned
