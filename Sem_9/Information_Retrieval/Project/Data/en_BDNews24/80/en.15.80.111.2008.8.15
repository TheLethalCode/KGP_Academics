<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Aug 15 (bdnews4.com/Reuters) - Nepali lawmakers elected a Maoist who led an insurgency against the monarchy as the country's new prime minister on Friday. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who still uses his nom de guerre Prachanda won 464 votes out of 577 votes cast in a special Constituent Assembly vote. He defeated Sher Bahadur Deuba, a three-time former prime minister. The election opens the way for the formation of a new government in the nascent Himalayan republic, capping a peace process that ended a decade long civil war.
