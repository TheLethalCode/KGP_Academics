<TITLE> Mbeki says Zimbabwe deal still possible soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Harare,Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Power-sharing talks in Zimbabwe can still succeed soon despite disagreements over leadership, South African President Thabo Mbeki said on Wednesday after failing to secure a deal at marathon talks. President Robert Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai met in Harare for three days without reaching agreement, dimming hopes of an end to a post election crisis that has worsened Zimbabwe's economic decline. "We are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly," Mbeki, the chief mediator in the negotiations, told reporters in the Angolan capital Luanda. Mbeki appealed for patience, saying the crucial issue of leadership positions was still under discussion. "They are working on a truly inclusive government," he said. Negotiations followed Mugabe's unopposed re-election in June in a poll from which Tsvangirai withdrew because of attacks on his supporters. The ballot was condemned around the world. Mbeki said earlier in Harare that Mugabe had agreed on sharing power with a breakaway faction of the Movement for Democratic Change opposition, but the group's leader Arthur Mutambara said on Wednesday that no agreement had been signed. "This is a tripartite negotiating framework. You cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree," Mutambara said, adding that talks were likely to continue. The biggest question is the fate of the main opposition leader Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai did not agree to a power-sharing agreement, raising doubts over whether Zimbabwe's parties can stabilise the country after violent elections
