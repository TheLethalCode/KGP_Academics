 Chittagong, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong port authorities on Thursday cautioned ships in the port's outer anchorage zone to maintain radio links to prevent further tragedies after the sinking of Sri Lankan flag carrier 'Badula Valley' on Wednesday. Zahur Ahmed, port radio control officer, told bdnews24.com that ship movement in the outer anchorage has been going on as normal after a 'marking buoy' was placed at the spot of the accident. As an additional safety measure, after the two ships collided, the port radio office has been warning ships anchored at and negotiating the outer anchorage zone to avoid similar disaster by maintaining radio signal, he said. Tugboat 'Kandari' has also been posted at the spot to keep an eye on shipping movements in the zone as port authorities began preparing salvage operations of the Badula Valley, which sank in the main navigation channel within the port's maritime boundary. The Sri Lankan flag carrier capsized Wednesday after ramming into an oil tanker in the outer anchorage zone of Chittagong seaport shortly after 1pm Wednesday. The ship was carrying 3,600 tonnes of rice from India to Bangladesh. The oil tanker 'Hang Tsu' was anchored out after offloading its cargo at the port. Badula Valley's missing chief engineer Aung Khin, has not been traced up to Thursday noon almost 24 hours after the incident, said a port official. Port authorities, navy and coast guard rescued 16 of the sinking ship's 17 crew members immediately after the accident, but were unable to trace the 56 year-old chief engineer. Preparations are on to mount search and salvation operations, comprising port agencies as well as private rescue and salvation concerns, port authority secretary Syed Farhaduddin told bdnews24.com. He added that a letter would be sent to the concerned shipping agent claiming accident compensation and rescue expenses incurred. bdnews24.co
