 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer gained some compensation for his dismal singles exit when he paired up with Stanislas Wawrinka to reach the quarter-finals of the Olympic doubles on Friday. The Swiss duo, playing on a sun-kissed court after their match had to be called off on Thursday due to torrential rain, eased through with a comfortable 6-2 6-4 victory over India's Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes. Federer, who loses his world number one ranking next week and was sadly out of form in the Olympic singles against American James Blake on Thursday, revelled in the doubles, firing down winners and duelling fast and furiously in the rallies. Sydney gold medallists Serena and Venus Williams were also out to erase both their singles defeats but were not so impressive in a 7-5 6-2 defeat of Japan's Ayumi Morita and Ai Sugiyama. Venus, whose serve is normally one of her most potent weapons, served a stream of double faults and Serena will have to be much sharper at the net if they are to advance beyond the quarter-finals
