The HC bench of justices Sharifuddin Chaklader and Md Imdadul Haque Azad granted bail to Mosharraf Hossain for two months in a land purchase case and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury for the same period in a case filed for amassing illegal wealth. The bench put freezes on proceedings of the cases for two months. It also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the cases would not be cancelled. The same bench also granted two months' bail to Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Quader in a case filed for earning illegal wealth.
