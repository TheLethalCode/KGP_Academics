 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Registration of political parties will start soon under the Representation of the People Order (amendment) Ordinance 2008, which is expected to be gazetted shortly, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Monday. "We hope the gazette will be published in a day or two. The process of registration of political parties starts after that," the CEC told reporters in his office. On Aug 6, the council of advisers approved the amendment to the RPO 1972 which made the registration of political parties compulsory. The amended RPO also bans any front organisation of political parties. According to the Election Commission roadmap, registration of political parties was supposed to be complete by the end of June. Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com on Monday that the EC would set a timeframe for registration. "It may be two months. The EC will take a final decision on it after the law is gazetted," Sohul Hussain said. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain had earlier told reporters that registration would continue until the announcement of the national polls schedule. bdnews2
