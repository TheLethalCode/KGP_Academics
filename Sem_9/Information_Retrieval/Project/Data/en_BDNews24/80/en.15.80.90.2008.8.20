 DAMBULLA, Sri Lanka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India levelled the five-match one-day series with Sri Lanka with a tense, three-wicket victory in a low-scoring second one-day international on Wednesday. Indian left-arm fast bowler Zaheer Khan claimed four for 21 to bowl out Sri Lanka for a paltry 142 in 38.3 overs in the morning. At one stage, as India slumped to 75 for five, Sri Lanka looked capable of pulling off a shock victory but Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni settled the visitors' nerves, leading from the front with his 39 off 54 balls. Dhoni added 60 with S. Badrinath, who scored a composed 27 from 57 balls on his debut. With only eight required for the win, Dhoni was bowled by Dilhara Fernando and then spinner Ajantha Mendis, who finished with two for 22, trapped Harbhajan Singh (one) lbw to leave India on 139 for seven. However, Badrinath and Zaheer Khan (two not out) pushed India past the winning line. Young opener Virat Kohli also impressed for India with a skilful and mature 37. Earlier, Khan had ripped through the top order with the new ball after India won the toss, dismissing Kumar Sangakarra (two), skipper Mahela Jayawardene (two), Chamara Kapugedera (nought) and explosive opener Sanath Jayasuriya (13). Sri Lanka, who had been 1-0 up after an eight-wicket win on Monday, were reduced to 33 for four and later 44 for six. Lower order batsman Thilan Thushara provided some resistance, top-scoring with 44 from 46 balls including seven boundaries and adding 74 runs for the seventh wicket with Nuwan Kulasekera (25). Khan was supported by seamer Praveen Kumar, playing instead of left-arm spinner Pragyan Ohja, who took three for 34. DOUBLE BLOW Sri Lanka's problems started early when Khan produced a beautiful delivery in his first over that cut back off the seam and hit the top of Sangakkara's off stump. Khan struck a double blow in his third over, forcing Jayawardene to edge a catch to Yuvraj Singh at first slip before Kapugedera edged to the 'keeper. Chamara Silva lasted two balls before Kumar had him caught at backward point off a delivery that went off the bat shoulder. Jayasuriya, whose blistering 125 had rescued Sri Lanka from a perilous position in the Asia Cup final, hinted at a recovery before being dubiously adjudged leg before. Thushara and Kulasekera provided the best partnership of the innings. However, when Thushara was caught in the deep off a slower ball from Kumar, the innings quickly subsided. Sri Lanka's bowlers struck back in a short session before lunch with Kulasekera finding the outside edge of Irfan Pathan (five), who had been promoted up the order after Gautan Gambhir pulled out of the game with a stiff neck. India were then reduced to 16 for two when Kulasekera also trapped Suresh Raina lbw for one. Kohli and Yuvraj Singh (20) added an important 36 after the lunch interval before Mendis trapped Singh lbw. Thilan Thushara dragged Sri Lanka further back into the game when Kohli was caught at short cover and Rohit Sharma was pinned lbw. Although Sri Lanka pressed hard, chopping and changing their bowlers in pursuit of wickets, Dhoni and Badrinath were able to guide India home
