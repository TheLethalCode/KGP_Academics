<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) Sergio Aguero scored two second-half goals in seven minutes Tuesday and later set up another to lead Argentina to a 3-0 win over rival Brazil and into its second straight Olympic final. Aguero opened the scoring for the defending champions by chesting in a left-side cross in the 52nd minute, then scored again from two yards on a cross from the right in the 58th. Aguero also set up a 76th-minute penalty kick that was converted by Juan Roman Riquelme. It was the first victory for Argentina against Brazil in three years. It hadn't beaten Brazil since a 3-1 victory in a World Cup qualifier in June 2005. Argentina, trying to become the first nation to win consecutive titles in 40 years, will now face Nigeria in a rematch of the 1996 final in Atlanta, when the Africans won 3-2 for their first and only title. The match in front of a crowd of nearly 53,000 at Workers' Stadium marked the encounter of the tournament's top stars, former FC Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho. Both players displayed their uncanny skills, but Messi threatened the most and created dangerous scoring chances for Argentina. In his first Olympics, the midfielder set up Argentina's second and third goals, while AC Milan's Ronaldinho struck the post with a free kick as he tried to put Brazil back into the match. The teams played cautiously, trying to retain possession in midfield and waiting for the right opportunities to strike. Both teams had their first chances in the 12th. Brazil came close after Rafinha's run on the right side, Aguero missed from close range for Argentina with a shot that hit the outside of the net. Messi sent a dangerous shot across the area in the 32nd, and had one of his best chances in the 41st after clearing three defenders inside the area before firing a shot that was barely saved by goalkeeper Renan. Aguero ran past defender Breno to open the scoring after Angel di Maria's cross, then easily added to the lead in front of the goal mouth after Ezequiel Garay's set-up. Messi started the play on the second goal by eluding several defenders before feeding the ball to Garay. Messi also set up Aguero inside the area before he was fouled by Breno in the play that brought the penalty kick, which Riquelme converted with a right-footed shot into the middle of the net. After Aguero's first goal, striker Rafael Sobis almost equalized with a powerful low shot that struck the post in the 60th. Ronaldinho also hit the post on a free kick in the 65th. Substitute forward Alexandre Pato scored after the free kick, but the goal was disallowed for offside. Brazil midfielder Lucas was ejected in the 81st after a foul from behind on Liverpool teammate Javier Mascherano. Substitute midfielder Thiago Neves was sent off just three minutes later after another hard foul on Mascherano. The teams had drawn 0-0 in World Cup qualifying earlier in June, but Brazil routed Argentina 3-0 in last year's Copa America and won by the same score in a friendly in London in 2006. In the other semifinal where Nigeria beat Belgium 4-1 in Shanghai, Chinedu Ogbuke Obasi scored two goals and Olubayo Adefemi and Ogbuke Obasi added one each for the 1996 Olympic champions. Adefemi scored in the 17th minute, Ogbuke Obasi added goals in the 59th and 72nd, and Chibuzor Okonkwo added a fourth in the 76th. Belgium replied two minutes from the end with a 25-meter (yard) free kick from Laurent Ciman
