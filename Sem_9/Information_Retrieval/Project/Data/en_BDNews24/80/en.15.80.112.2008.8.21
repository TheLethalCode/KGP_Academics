 NAIROBI, Thu Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Thursday that if parliament was convened next week, mediators would have to deal with a violation of the agreed framework for power sharing talks. Tsvangirai told a news conference in Nairobi that President Robert Mugabe's intention to open parliament next Tuesday was a "repudiation" of the Memorandum of Understanding with the opposition on the framework for talks. "A violation of the MOU will have to be dealt with by the mediator," he said. South African President Thabo Mbeki and other senior officials from his country are mediating in the talks, which began last month. "If President Mugabe goes ahead to convene parliament, appoint a new cabinet, it means he is proceeding to violate the conditions of the MOU which means he may have abandoned the basis for the talks but we don't know what his intentions are," Tsvangirai added. He confirmed that the power sharing talks were deadlocked over the roles of president and prime minister in a new government. Mugabe is expected to remain as president but, backed by security chiefs, he is reluctant to cede major powers. Tsvangirai wants a real executive power as prime minister. "There is one stumbling issue which we have been grappling with -- the framework of the power and roles of the president and the new position of prime minister for the duration of the transition leading up to 2-1/2 years," Tsvangirai said. Whereas the opposition wants a comparatively short transition before new elections, Mugabe is believed to be aiming for a full five-year term. Mugabe's decision to forge ahead with the opening of parliament suggests there is no solution in sight to the deep deadlock with Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and could suggest the veteran leader has abandoned negotiations
