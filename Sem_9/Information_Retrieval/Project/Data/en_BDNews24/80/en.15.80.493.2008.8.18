 Dhaka, Aug 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday asked top civil servants to defy all threats and fear and stick to their jobs in the general elections slated for December. "The responsibility goes to all to create an atmosphere conducive to holding a free and fair election," the chief adviser told secretaries to the ministries and divisions at the Bangladesh Secretariat. "I believe that the upcoming election will be held in a festive mood if you discharge your duties properly. The voters will go to the polling centres fearlessly and cast their votes as a part of their civic responsibility." "The government is committed to assisting the Election Commission in holding a proper election," Fakhruddin said. "We will be able to hand over power to an elected government through elections to be held in December if we get your overall cooperation." The interim government head termed completion of the voter registration with photographs and national ID cards within a year 'a great achievement' of the government. In the meeting the secretaries briefed the advancement of various projects and problems they were facing to the chief adviser. He asked the secretaries to be serious on the posting and regulations of their promotion of administrative officials. "Make proper evaluation of the works of the officials. Apply right persons in the right places. Look carefully at their career planning," Fakhruddin said. Pointing out the changes to a number of government organisations and constitutional institutions, he said: "The amendments will reinforce the foundation of democracy." He asked the secretaries to make sure the organisations function properly. Fakhruddin also told them to keep an eye on the open-market sale of essentials, slated for a Aug 20 launch. On the 100-day job generation programme, set to take off in a month's time, the chief adviser said: "We have to ensure so that the real poor people are benefited through this programme." The government's main aim was to alleviate poverty; he said, adding "We cannot take our sights off the target." He called on the officials to start implementing the Annual Development Programme from the onset of the ongoing fiscal year to power economy and generate employment. "The various indices show that the country's economy is back on the previous track." He asked the senior civil servants to find out whether the people were getting the services they needed, what were the problems facing them and ways to resolve those. He stressed immediate implementation of the citizen charter. "Formulating and exhibiting citizen charter is a first step, but its implementation is a tough job. People will be benefited once it is implemented." The chief adviser emphasised the implementation of the guidelines of the Secretariat. "It is the responsibility of those who have formulated the guideline to implement it." He asked the officials to decide fast on the pension of the retired staffs and to increasingly use information technology in offices. bdnew
