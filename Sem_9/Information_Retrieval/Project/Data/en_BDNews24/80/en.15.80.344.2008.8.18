"Kamran was admitted to the hospital at 9.30pm after his blood pressure was recorded to be very high," Sylhet jailer Monir Hossain told bdnews24.com. Kamran was released on parole for six hours Monday morning to attend the namaj-e-janaza of his mother. He was taken back to jail at 4pm. His mother Nurunnessa Khanam Lalan, 84, died Sunday at Square Hospital in Dhaka due to old age. The detained mayor-elect was brought from Comilla jail to Sylhet Sunday night at 9.30pm preparatory to granting him parole, Monir Hossain said.

Hundreds of local AL leaders, activists and supporters of the party, were present alongside friends and relatives. The coffin was brought to the graveyard adjacent to the mazar of Hazrat Manik Pir, where she was buried in the presence of Kamran and relatives. Kamran was elected for a second term as mayor of Sylhet City Corporation on Aug 4, bagging an overwhelming majority of votes.
