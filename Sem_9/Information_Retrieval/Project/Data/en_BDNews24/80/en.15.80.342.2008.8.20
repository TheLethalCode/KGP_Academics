 Dhaka, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com) - BNP leader and former parliamentary whip Syed Ashraf Hossain was released on bail Wednesday night from Dhaka Central Jail, an official said. Jailer Faruque Ahmed told bdnews24.com that "Ashraf Hossain was released in line with a High Court order." Ashraf's son Moinuddin Ashraf said: "Dad has been freed. He is now going home." The High Court granted bail to the expelled BNP leader last week in a case filed under emergency powers rule. Ashraf was previously released on bail on Aug 4, in a corruption case, only to be rearrested at the gate of the jail. Police arrested him on the basis of a general diary filed with Dhanmondi Police Station for 'violating EPR'. On July 31, the HC granted him six months' bail in a graft case relating to the purchase and import of cars. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled the 'reformist' BNP leader from the party shortly before she was arrested on Sept 3 last year. bdnews
