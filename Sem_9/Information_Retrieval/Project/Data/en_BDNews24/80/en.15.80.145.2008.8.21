 ISLAMABAD Thu Aug 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two suicide bombers blew themselves up outside Pakistan's main defense industry complex on Thursday as workers were leaving at the end of their shift, killing nearly 40 people, police said. Pakistan is on the front line of the US-led campaign against terrorism and al Qaeda-lined militants have launched a wave of attacks on the security forces over the past year, bombing military camps, patrols and transport.

Soldiers cordoned off the area and kept reporters back as ambulances arrived to take away casualties, a witness said.
