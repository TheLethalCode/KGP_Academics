 Dhaka, August 19 (bdnews24.com) Senior BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman must be sent abroad for treatment, or he might be rendered permanently disabled, a specialist said Tuesday. Surgeon and joint replacement specialist Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon, of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, told reporters: "Tarique is partially disabled already, as he wasn't given proper treatment in time." "Unless he's sent abroad soon for appropriate treatment, he may become permanently disabled," said Dr Islam. The specialist pointed out that a medical board headed by Prof Sirajul Islam, of which Islam too was a member, had already recommended sending Tarique abroad. Mentioning that he has just visited Tarique on his daily rounds, at the prison ward of BSMMU Hospital, the associate professor said: "Tarique's right leg muscles are weakening and becoming gradually feeble." "Medicines administered in high doses have damaged his kidneys too. He's also suffering from bouts of asphyxia." Tarique was admitted to the hospital on Jan 31. "His weight was 67 kilos at the time, which now has reduced to just 54," Islam said. Joint forces arrested Tarique, elder son of BNP chief and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on March 7 from his Shaheed Mainul Road residence. He faces a number of corruption cases against him. bdnews
