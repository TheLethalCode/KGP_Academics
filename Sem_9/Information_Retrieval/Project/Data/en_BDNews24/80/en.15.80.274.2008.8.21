 NEW DELHI, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scotland will replace Zimbabwe in next year's World Twenty20 in England, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed on Wednesday. Zimbabwe withdrew from the event in July to avert demands that they be suspended because of Robert Mugabe's government. Zimbabwe Cricket confirmed its decision at a meeting with senior ICC officials at the ruling body's Dubai headquarters. "This allows the ICC the opportunity to plan with certainty the ICC World Twenty20 2009, as well as giving Scotland...plenty of preparation time ahead of the tournament," ICC president David Morgan said in a statement on the organisation's website (www.icc-cricket.yahoo.com) after the meeting. Zimbabwe was persuaded by the ICC executive board last month to stay away from next June's event. An ICC statement said the Zimbabwe board recognised the British government was unlikely to issue visas for the team, having already cancelled next year's bilateral series between England and Zimbabwe. Britain led calls to suspend Zimbabwe from international cricket following the widely-criticised presidential election run-off in June, in which Mugabe retained power unopposed. South Africa, a traditional supporter of Zimbabwe, also suspended bilateral cricketing ties with its neighbour before the ICC overcame divisions within its ranks to find a solution
