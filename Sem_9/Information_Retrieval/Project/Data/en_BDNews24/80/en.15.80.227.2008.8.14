 BIRMINGHAM, England, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England pace bowler James Anderson has completed his most successful home season in tests with 34 wickets but increased competition for places prevents him from taking his place for granted. Anderson became a prominent member of the England attack in 2007 after failing to play a home test for three years because regulars Andrew Flintoff, Steve Harmison, Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard were all injured. Although the 26-year-old has built on his progress against New Zealand and South Africa this season, the return of Flintoff and Harmison and with Jones and Hoggard fit, he can still feel their presence and others threatening his place. "I have really enjoyed the summer so far from a personal point of view," Anderson told Reuters in an interview. "I think the extra responsibility improved my game," he said at an event held by England's test sponsor npower in Birmingham aimed at encouraging cricket in inner cities. "The competition now is pretty healthy as we have five bowlers with Stuart Broad, 'Fred' (Flintoff), Harmy, Ryan (Sidebottom) and myself fighting for four places. "On top of that you have all the guys in county cricket and Simon Jones coming back. It's all healthy and keeps you on your toes. "So I'm not sure if I think I belong there (in the team), but if I can keep putting in the performances and keep taking wickets and if I can do as much as I can to impress the selectors, they won't be able to leave me out." MORE CONSISTENCY Anderson made his England debut in a one-day series in Australia in 2002/03, bowling Adam Gilchrist for his first international wicket. Two months later he had figures of four for 29 against Pakistan at the 2003 World Cup in South Africa where his late out-swing embarrassed such world-class batsmen as Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammed Yousuf. Apart from a one-day hat-trick in 2003, also against Pakistan, his career then stuttered. He was troubled by injury and problems with his action, which he felt became "too mechanical" as he allowed himself to take too much advice from too many coaches. But now, with 104 test wickets in 29 matches, he is a more rounded bowler with increased pace, the ability to swing the ball both ways, good fitness levels and the strength of mind to block out unwanted advice. "Consistency is something I have been striving for and the confidence I have got from my consistency and the wickets I've taken this summer has been great," Anderson said. "The one thing that has pleased me more than anything is the way I have kept my speeds up as I have bowled quite a lot of overs this summer. "I have not been used to bowling this many overs in a summer so keeping my speeds up in the mid-eighties and sometimes a bit more is encouraging." After sitting on the sidelines during the whole of the dramatic Ashes home series in 2005, he is already eyeing next year's series against the Australians in England. "I think everyone has got one eye on it," Anderson said. "You can't fail to notice the advertising all around the ground -- it really lets you know about it.
