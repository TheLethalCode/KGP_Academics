A metropolitan judge passed the order following a petition filed by a BAAF councilor, Qamrunnahar Lipi, who accused Faruqul Islam of taking part in the election despite being a government servant. Farqul, a BKSP director currently on LPR, is one of the three general secretary candidates. The two other candidates are Mosharraf Hossain Shamim and Shah Alam. A total of 98 councilors were to vote in the election for 24 posts  four vice presidents, one general secretary, two joint secretaries, one treasurer and 16 members. The court has called for a hearing on August 25.
