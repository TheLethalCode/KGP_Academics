<TITLE> 'Fierce' ex-Maoist chief becomes first Nepal PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kathmandu,Aug 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two years ago, the chief of Nepal's former Maoist rebels was on the Himalayan nation's most wanted list with a price of more than $70,000 on his head. But on Monday, Prachanda, who still goes by his nom de guerre meaning "fierce", was sworn in as Nepal's first prime minister, having jettisoned much of his Marxist rhetoric to embrace democracy and private investment. Prachanda, 53, led an insurgency against the monarchy for more than a decade in the jungles of rugged Himalayan foothills. After laying down its arms as part of a peace process, his Maoist party won 227 seats in the 601-member constituent assembly in an April election to become its biggest group. That body, which also doubles as parliament, overwhelmingly voted to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy a month later, and is now expected to draft a constitution. "We have come from a different background and this is a mandate the people have given to us to lead the country to peace," Prachanda said, soon after his party's surprise victory in the vote. "We'll honour this." The bespectacled ex-rebel has come a long way since a teacher named him Pushpa Kamal, or Lotus Flower, for his mild manners. Colleagues say Prachanda, a former agricultural science teacher, is a skilled organiser and breeds loyalty and discipline among his followers, but critics say he is self-centred and willing to dump even his closest colleagues. And since emerging from the jungle to face television cameras, Prachanda has switched from revolutionary insurgent to politician and has dropped the language used by Marx and Mao. He wants Nepal to become the "Switzerland of Asia" and draw millions of tourists. He says Nepali Maoists are not "dogmatic communists" and pledges to uphold democracy and human rights. He also now says globalisation is a fact of life and has vowed revolutionary land reforms in a country where nearly 80 percent of its 26.4 million people live on income from farming. Prachanda now lives with his wife in a sleepy area in Kathmandu near a filthy stream in a house protected by 50 former rebels, sandbag bunkers, and armed state police. He enjoys singing and dancing during his free time. REVOLUTION When Prachanda was a seventh grader in a village school he saw Mao's picture printed in a magazine for the first time. "He was instantly impressed by the image of the communist icon that left a revolutionary mark in him," said classmate Pushpa Bhurtel, who says he showed him the picture. He began his political life with one of Nepal's several communist groups but soon broke away to lead hardliners, saying others were straying from the revolutionary course. In 1996, Prachanda began fighting to replace the monarchy with a one-party communist republic. That conflict caused more than 13,000 deaths and displaced more than 200,000 others. Washington still considers the Maoists to be a terrorist group, although US officials have met Prachanda recently. In 2006, Prachanda ended the insurgency in a deal with the government after it agreed to his key demand for April's election for a constituent assembly. Despite leading thousands of guerrillas, Prachanda was rarely seen in combat dress and never fought. Media have said that, even when young, he never hid his political ambitions. "If I want to be a minister of the country, I can easily achieve that," he was quoted as telling classmates
