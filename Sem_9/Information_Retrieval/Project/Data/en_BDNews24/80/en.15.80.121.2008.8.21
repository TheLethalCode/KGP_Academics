<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com)  Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal Thursday said the government would not try to make the political parties to take part in the upazila elections. The adviser made the remarks when reporters asked him to comment on Awami League's proposal to hold discussion with the government on three issues including a planned boycott of the upazila polls. "This is a matter of the Election Commission. The commission will sit with them over the matter. If necessary, they will try to make them understand. "However, the government will take no initiative to bring the political parties to the upazila election," he said. On when trade union activities would resume, Iqbal said, "Trade union activities will start on the day dialogue will be held with the labour representatives. Introduction of the activities is being delayed as the talks with labour representatives have been held up." "The dialogue may be delayed further because of the regional dialogues and the cabinet meeting in Khulna next week. However, the government is trying to hold the dialogue very soon." bdnews2
