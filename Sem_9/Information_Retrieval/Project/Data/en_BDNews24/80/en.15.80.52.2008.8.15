 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defending Olympic champion Zhang Ning guaranteed China a gold medal in women's singles badminton on Friday by beating Maria Kristin Yulianti of Indonesia 2-0 in the semi-finals. Earlier, top seed and world No.1 Xie Xingfang pulled back from behind to beat third seeded compatriot Lu Lan 2-1 to reach the gold medal bout. In men's doubles, Cai Yun fell to his knees and yanked off his shirt after he and partner Fu Haifeng knocked out South Korea's Lee Jae-jin and Hwang Ji-man, revealing the tattoo across his back in frilly letters: "Face of Adversity". The crowd-pleasing home team favourites then chucked their towels to the adoring fans after reaching the final. They will play the top seeded Indonesians Markis Kido and Hendra Setiawan, who knocked out Denmark's Lars Paaske and Jonas Rasmussen. Despite being the Olympics' second seed, Zhang said she was surprised to have gone so far. "I've had so many injuries since the last Olympics  I never thought I could perform so well on the court here," she said after collecting a bouquet of flowers from her husband who surprised her by attending the match. "I always say I don't have any problem with my physical strength, but really that's just an excuse to encourage myself. You can't be 33-years-old and come out onto the court in a badminton tournament and not have any problems." Xie had a rocky start on Friday when Lu dominated game one to win 21-7 with accurate drops. But Xie found her game and won the second 21-10 denying Lu the lead from the fourth point of the match onward. Xie cruised to an easy third game win 21-12. Despite giving up game one, Xie, whose boyfriend is the men's singles top seed Lin Dan, said she was not worried. "We all practise together every day and we all know each other very well, also it's not as if she is a bad player," she said. The gold will be decided on Saturday
