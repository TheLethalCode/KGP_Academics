 David Alexander and Oleg Shchedrov TBILISI/SOCHI, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States demanded on Friday that Russian troops end their occupation of Georgia immediately after Georgia signed a ceasefire agreement. Speaking alongside Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili, visiting U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice evoked the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia 40 years ago to crush liberal reforms: "Russian forces need to leave Georgia at once. This is no longer 1968." Saakashvili said following five hours of talks with Rice he had inked the ceasefire pact, negotiated by France on behalf of the European Union. As they were speaking, a Reuters correspondent witnessed a column of up to 17 Russian armored personnel carriers advancing along the main highway to within 55 km (34 miles) of the Georgian capital, their deepest move yet inside Georgia. The purpose of the incursion was not immediately clear. Saakashvili, in passionate remarks, denounced Russians as "21st century barbarians" and blamed the West for triggering the crisis by failing to react firmly to Moscow's previous military moves and not admitting Georgia to NATO fast enough. "Who invited the trouble here?" he said, flanked by several large Georgian and U.S. flags. "...Not only those people who perpetrated this, but those who failed to stop it." The simmering crisis over the rebel Georgian region of South Ossetia exploded last Thursday when Georgia sent a force to try to retake the Russian-backed province, provoking a massive counter-attack by Moscow.
