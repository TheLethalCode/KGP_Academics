<TITLE> Polls amid emergency may bring back 1/11 days: AL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League fears the interim administration may well push the country toward a 1/11-like situation if it held the general elections under the state of emergency. "If the government wants to hold elections without withdrawing the state of emergency it would mean the government does not want election, it wants to create another 1/11," the party's policymaking presidium member Tofail Ahmed said Saturday. He made the remarks in reference to the Jan 11, 2007 takeover by the military-backed caretaker government after days of political unrest and bloody street violence. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam warned the caretaker government not to put the sympathisers of the BNP-led four-party alliance to important posts on the pretext of administrative reshuffle. "Don't try to fix election results through a reshuffle in the administration," he said. Tofail and Ashraful were speaking at a memorial meeting organised by the party in Dhanmondi in the afternoon a day after the National Mourning Day. Acting president Zillur Rahman presided over the meeting. Tofail's presidium colleague Amir Hossain Amu demanded withdrawal of the state of emergency and staging of national elections ahead of all other polls. Another presidium member, Abdur Razzak, said the defeated anti-independence forces killed independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman at a time when the country was about to be self-reliant. Suranjit Sengupta, another leader who sits on the presidium, said, "Why the present council of advisers has not issued an order revoking the four-party alliance government's order that cancelled the National Mourning Day?' He expressed outrage at the celebration of the birthday of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on August 15, the day Sheikh Mujib was killed with much of his family in 1975. "As of now, her five different birth dates have been found. They have showed a rather poor taste by celebrating the birthday on the National Mourning Day." Ashraful urged the government to take punitive measures against the deputy commissioners and superintendents of police of Tangail and Chittagong for not allowing spontaneous observance of National Mourning Day in those places. He also demanded immediate implementation of the verdict of Bangabandhu Murder Case. To president Iajuddin Ahmed he said, "The judges who felt embarrassed to hear Bangabandhu murder case cannot stay in the Appellate Division. Sack them." He termed the judges who got appointment during the four-party alliance rule "partisan". "Remove those partisan judges from the High Court and the Appellate Division. If they go to the Appellate Division the verdict of Bangabandhu Murder Case will not be implemented even in 50 years." Turning his attention to the elections, he said, "If the European Union does not send observers to the election, we believe the USA and other countries will also not send monitors. If there is no observer the election will not be acceptable." Alleging that a 'Rokon' of Jamaat-e-Islami is chairman of Red Crescent Hospital, he demanded his removal, and cancellation of the board of directors of the hospital, as well. AL joint general secretary Mukul Bose said, "There is one person among us who in a talk show claimed that after Sheikh Kamal was killed Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujib) phoned him for his help. But his blood-stained body was lying in Dhanmondi No 32." Organising secretary Abdul Mannan said, "We could not protest and build up resistance after August 15, 1975. We do politics owning up the failure." Dr Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin said, "We went to the house of many central leaders on the morning of August 15, 1975. They were in their houses but we were told that they were not." AL leaders Mahmudur Rahman Manna, Abdur Rahman, advocate Shahara Khatun, AKM Jahangir Hossain, MA Aziz and advocate Kamrul Islam also spoke at the meeting moderated by AL publicity and publication secretary Asaduzzaman Noor. bdnew
