 BEIJING, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Ai Fukuhara found the secret to Olympic success in table tennis but is keeping it to herself after leading her country to a bronze medal semi-final. Fukuhara, who had not lived up to her world number 12 ranking in the first stage of the women's team event, scattered her shots at sharp angles to kick-start Japan's straight-match victory in a best-of-five contest over Austria on Friday. "I finally figured out how to play in the Olympics. But I can't tell you my secret," she said after winning her match 11-7 8-11 11-9 and 11-7 against Austria's Liu Jia. In the new and somewhat byzantine team format at the Olympics, Japan will face the loser of the gold semi-final between Hong Kong and China in yet another semi-final for the right to play for the bronze. "I lost several matches in the last two days and that did affect my confidence. Winning the opening match today has given me back some of that confidence," Fukuhara, 19, said. Austrian table tennis fans could take solace in their men's success. Their leading man, Werner Schlager, took both his singles matches to power the team to a 3-1 victory over Croatia and a spot in the men's bronze semi-finals. Also making it into the bronze semis were Hong Kong's men, who dominated Taiwan in straight matches, and the United States women, who with an average age of 34 outplayed their less-experienced Romanian opponents
