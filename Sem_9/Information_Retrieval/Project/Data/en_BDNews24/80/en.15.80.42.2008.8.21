<TITLE> Bolt should show more respect: IOC chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Aug 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaican double sprint gold medalist Usain Bolt is now on a par with the great U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens but should show more respect to his fellow competitors, IOC chief Jacques Rogge said on Thursday. Owens became one of the biggest names in the Olympics by winning four golds in the 1936 Berlin Games but Bolt's 100 and 200 meters wins, both set in world record times, have earned him a place alongside the American, according to Rogge. "Bolt is another dimension in sprint," the International Olympic Committee president told international news agencies in an interview. "Bolt must be considered now the same way like Jesse Owens should have been in the '30s. It is different in that Bolt has a bigger edge than Owens in his finals." The Jamaican won both races by a wide margin. "Bolt in a wayif he maintains that in the future will bring a mark like Jesse Owens." "MORE RESPECT" The Jamaican won the 100m and 200m sprint gold in world recordsthe latter clinched on Wednesday in 19.30 seconds but Rogge was not completely satisfied with the manner in which he achieved them. "I think he should show more respect, shake hands, give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones. Not making gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters," he said. Rogge was referring to his comfortable 100m win on Saturday in 9.69 seconds where he pounded his chest before crossing the finishing line. "He still has to mature," Rogge said. "I would love him to show more respect to his competitors. He should learn that he should shake hands with competitors." "I understand the joy. He might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived is 'catch me if you can'. You don't do that," said Rogge, who participated in three Olympics from 1968 to 1976 in yachting. Rogge said that was something Bolt would learn with time. "Do not forget that he is still young. He is a young man. Bolt will learn that sooner or later. He is a great athlete, of course." Bolt celebrated his 22nd birthday on Thursday in Beijing ahead of the 4x100 meters relay where he could add a third gold on Friday
