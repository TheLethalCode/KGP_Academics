<TITLE> Citycell Fed Cup resumes Monday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com) - After a recess for a week because of inclement weather, national mourning day and religion occasion, the final round of the Citycell Federation Cup resumes Monday in Dhaka and Gazipur. Mohammedan SC take on Rahmatganj MFS at Bangabandhu National Stadium while Arambgah KS play against Sunrise SC at Gazipur Stadium. Both Mohammedan SC and Arambagh KS will try to seal their semifinal berths from Group D through their second straight win after making their Fed Cup campaign with a winning start. Though Motijheel-based outfit Mohammedan's tournament opener against first division's team Sunrise SC was not convincing, they managed to get away without any kind of jolt, riding on a late-strike from striker Robin. During the Mohammedan-Sunrise match, it seemed that Maruful Haq's side was suffering from a holding midfielder as Mohammedan with all local players could hardly establish their supremacy over the midfield, and Sunrise stunned to produce some scoring chances against the giants. Mohammedan's fans will be hoping that their favourite side show their good performance against Rahmatganj, who will certainly fight to save their skin, keeping the thing in mind that a win against Mohammedan can keep their hope alive. On the other hand, Arambagh KS with their foreign recruits looked more positive in their first game to hand an emphatic 3-1 defeat to Rahmatganj, but they may face a tough test against the first division team Sunrise, which had a fine combination having played a few number of qualifying matches. Arambagh, however, can feel relaxed because of their foreign players, who mainly helped the side take off to a smooth start in their group opener. Now, the audience at Gazipur can expect an exciting match between two sides Monday as the Bangladesh Football Federation last week decided to take six matches outside the capital to reduce the pressure on the pitch of the BNS amid inclement weather.
