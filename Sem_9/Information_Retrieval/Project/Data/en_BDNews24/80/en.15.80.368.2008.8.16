 BEIJING, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States stunned water polo world champion Croatia with a 7-5 win on Saturday, keeping American medal hopes alive and delivering the biggest upset of the Olympic men's tournament. Croatia, seeking a fourth win after crushing Germany, arch-foe Serbia and Italy, succumbed to a U.S. team cheered on by a raucous Chinese crowd and inspired by captain Tony Azevedo. Azevedo opened the scoring with a corner shot in the first quarter, the first of his three goals. Still smarting from a low-scoring Thursday defeat to Serbia during which the Americans found the back of the net just twice, the U.S. defense held Croatia to just 3 goals in the first two quarters and rendered them score-less in the third. "That's what going to put us through: our defense," said Azevedo. "Croatia right now is playing their best water polo, and for us to beat them and control this game today, shows that we're definitely in contention for a gold medal." The U.S. team is now tied with Croatia at the top of their group. Both squads have one more match to decide a final ranking, with the group leader earning an automatic semi-final berth. The Croatians should have an easier time with winless China on August 18. The Americans go up against Germany, who narrowly defeated Italy 8-7 on Saturday. "We'll celebrate for five minutes, then get ourselves ready for Monday," U.S. coach Terry Schroeder said. Hungary, gold medalists in Sydney and Athens, will resume their quest for a third straight Olympic water polo gold when they meet Australia later on Saturday. The favorites in Beijing have scooped up 14 water polo medals in the last 24 Games. Spain will take on European champions Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic making its debut at the Olympics
