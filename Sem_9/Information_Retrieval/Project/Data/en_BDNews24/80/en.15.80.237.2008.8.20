 BRISBANE, Australia, Aug 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's cricketers remain concerned with the security situation in Pakistan and will refuse to travel there for next month's Champions Trophy, local media reported on Wednesday. Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief executive Paul Marsh told The Australian newspaper that a meeting between players, an ICC taskforce and Cricket Australia representatives in Melbourne last Friday had done nothing to ease fears about touring the strife-torn country. The ACA stance mirrors that of the New Zealand players' association, which met with the taskforce on Saturday and later announced it would advise its members not to tour. "The ACA has discussed the situation with its executive and our position is we can't recommend to our players they should tour Pakistan for the Champions Trophy," Marsh said. "We feel for the Pakistan Cricket Board and the people of Pakistan but it is the job of the ACA to make recommendations to our members based on whether it is safe to tour. "Unfortunately in this case we don't believe it is safe." The fate of the eight-team one-day tournament, which is due to begin in Pakistan on Sept. 12, is likely to be decided when International Cricket Council officials meet in Dubai on Wednesday
