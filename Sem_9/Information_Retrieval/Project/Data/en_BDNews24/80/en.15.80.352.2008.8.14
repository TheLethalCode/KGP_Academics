 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP and it allies on Thursday called countrywide protests for Aug 27 to press for the release of party chief Khaleda Zia and overseas treatment of her son Tarique Rahman, a senior BNP leader said. After a meeting of the four-party alliance in NAM flat, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters that a human chain would be formed across the country on the day. The leaders would submit a memorandum to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office on Aug 21. "We don't want any conflict, neither do we want to give any such programme that may create a crisis in the country," Delwar said. The BNP leader hoped the government would release Khaleda without delay as the chief adviser in said in Chittagong on Wednesday. The CA, after a meeting of the cabinet in Chittagong, told reporters that efforts were on to release Khaleda 'as soon as possible'. The BNP and the allies on Sunday gave the government 72 hours, that ended Wednesday afternoon, to release the former prime minister from prison. Delwar disagreed with suggestions from reporters that the latest programme was a bit of an anti-climax after the deadline. He again raised the demand that May 30 be declared as the National Mourning Day, the day former president Ziaur Rahman was assassinated. bdnews24
