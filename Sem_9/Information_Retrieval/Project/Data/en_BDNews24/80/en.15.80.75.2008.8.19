 Dhaka, Aug 19 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Tuesday handed down the death penalty to two men for the brutal murder of Liberation War commander Abul Hossain, while six others received life terms for their involvement. A crowded courtroom heard Judge Md Masdar Hossain, of Dhaka No 1 Speedy Trial Tribunal, award death sentences to Ayub Ali Munshi and Kamrul Matubbar, though the latter remains on the run. According to the case details, the convicted men hacked former freedom fighter Abul Hossain to death with a machete in the morning hours of June 20, 2005, in the Otadi Char Kanda area in Faridpur. Two of Hossain's sons as well as two of his brothers were also injured in the vicious assault. The six who received life terms were also fined Tk 50,000 and cautioned that failure to pay would result in a further one year's rigorous imprisonment. They are Md Nurul Islam, Zahurul Hosssain, Magrib Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Billal Hossain and Badsha Miah. The judge acquitted 10 others implicated in the murder case, filed by the victim's son Sohag Hossain. bdnew
