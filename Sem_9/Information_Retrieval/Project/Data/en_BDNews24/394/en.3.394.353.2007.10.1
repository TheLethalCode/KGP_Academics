 NEW YORK, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Texas oilman Oscar Wyatt pleaded guilty on Monday to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, one of five charges against him for his role in the UN oil-for-food scandal. Wyatt was accused of paying millions of dollars in kickbacks to Saddam Hussein's government to win oil contracts from Iraq.

In one act that created friction with former President George H W Bush, Wyatt flew to Iraq with former Texas Gov. John Connally in December 1990 in a bid to free US citizens held in Baghdad. That came just before the US operation to dislodge Iraqi forces that had invaded Kuwait. They brought back some two dozen people to Texas. Shargel had portrayed Wyatt as a patriotic American whose advice was sought by nearly every US president from John F Kennedy to Bill Clinton, but not the Bushes: former President George H W Bush and his son George W Bu
