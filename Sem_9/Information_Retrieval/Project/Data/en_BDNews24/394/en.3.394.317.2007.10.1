<TEXT>
 QUITO, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa on Monday was set to emerge with a strong mandate to dissolve Congress and approve sweeping reforms after claiming a majority in Sunday's vote for an assembly to rewrite the constitution. The left-winger joins allies Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales in seeking to use a national assembly to bypass restive lawmakers and push through reforms to limit the influence of entrenched political elites. A powerful victory for his Alianza Pais party in the assembly would allow Correa to shore up legislative control and push his "21st Century" socialism and tighter state economic control, proposals that have already spooked Wall Street. Official results trickled in on Monday showed Correa's party ahead with only 2 percent of votes counted. A full tally of the seating could take weeks because of the complex proportional representation system. A government-linked exit poll and a quick count -- in which a sample of the votes are tallied -- on Sunday showed Alianza Pais had won far more than the 66-seat majority needed to control the 130-member assembly. "With Alianza Pais in the driver's seat the new legislature is likely to validate greater government intervention in critical sectors of the economy," Goldman Sachs analyst Alberto Ramos wrote in a note to clients. Ecuador's benchmark 2030 global bond on Monday fell 0.250 point to bid 90.000 with a yield of 11.359 percent while Ecuador's 2012 bond rose 0.250 point to bid 100.250 with a yield of 9.519 percent. Investors are worried about Correa's vows to renegotiate part of the country's $10 billion foreign debt, rework oil contracts in South America's No. 5 crude producer and review mining deals. His government has made varied comments on the reforms they want, but officials say they have no plans for nationalization and will respect foreign contracts. Still, Correa's key delegate is Alberto Acosta, a former energy minister who favors more state control over energy and natural resources. ANOTHER CHAVEZ? Correa, who came into office in January, seeks to purge the influence of traditional parties, which are widely blamed for the instability that ousted three presidents in a decade. He said his party could have secured around 80 seats in the new assembly and ministers forecast at least 70 delegates. The U.S.-trained economist is highly popular for his rallying cry against career politicians as a corrupt mafia, but foes fear he will amass power and follow Chavez by steering his poor Andean country away from free-market policies. "We have won the mother of all battles," Correa told supporters who danced and sang to tropical music with the president on Sunday night outside his party headquarters. He said his majority bloc would push to dissolve the Congress, to be replaced by a legislative committee while the assembly debates. But he said he would consult with other parties and dismissed fears of authoritarian reforms. The make-up of the legislative committee will reflect his majority in the assembly. The assembly will debate a draft of constitutional reforms put together by academics. A final version must be approved in a popular referendum after at least six mont
