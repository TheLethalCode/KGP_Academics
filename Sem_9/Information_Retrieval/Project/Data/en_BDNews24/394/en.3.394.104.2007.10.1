 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com) Student protests on the Dhaka University campus began spontaneously, although they were later diverted to other purposes, Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said Monday. The comment of the head of the judicial commission tasked with investigating the August rioting came after the depositions of two teachers detained in connection with those incidents. Justice Khan told reporters: "After the incident at Dhaka University sports ground on August 20, the initial stage of student's movement was spontaneous. Later it was diverted to another channel." The two detained DU teachers and a Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leader testified before the judicial commission at the Circuit House Monday. Prof Harun-or-Rashid, dean of the social sciences faculty of Dhaka University, was the first to testify. He was followed by Prof Nimchandra Bhowmik, chairman of the applied physics and electronics department. Justice Khan quoted Prof Bhowmik as telling the commission that he had surrendered to authorities only because his name was on the charge list. Detained JCD president Azizul Bari Helal also testified as witness. Justice Khan said Helal claimed he was not involved in the initial incident on campus. According to his testimony, quoted by Justice Khan, Prof Rashid had been present at the general meeting of Dhaka University Teachers Association after the initial incident involving students and army personnel. Prof Rashid was quoted as telling the commission that the teachers could not stop the students from participating in their procession when it was heading towards the Central Shaheed Minar. Prof Bhowmik's deposition lasted about 20 minutes, Justice Khan said. Prof Bhowmik told the commission that he was not involved in the administrative matters of the university. Justice Khan quoted Helal as saying his name has been dropped from the final report of the case in which he has been shown arrested. Helal told the commission that he does not know why he has been arrested "in connection with the DU sports ground incident". Justice Khan said Helal claimed he was not on the scene on the day. Helal claimed, according to Justice Khan, that the reports published in the media saying that he has given a confessional statement was false. After the depositions, the commission head told reporters the initial questioning of witnesses would end on Oct 5. The commission will take statements from a number of journalists on Oct 2, and president of the Asiatic Society Prof Sirajul Islam will testify on Oct 3. Asked whether any similarity or discrepancy was found in the depositions of the 86 people who have so far testified to the commission, Justice Khan said: "The number of witnesses is increasing. In some matters, there were differences in the depositions of some persons." Monday was the 24th day of taking witness statements by the commission, bringing the total count of witnesses to 86. bdnews24.com
