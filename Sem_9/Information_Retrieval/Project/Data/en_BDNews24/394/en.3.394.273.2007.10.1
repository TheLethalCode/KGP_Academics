<TITLE> India govt to meet deficit targets despite pro-poor plans </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Mon Oct 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government is confident of meeting its fiscal deficit targets for the current year and next despite unveiling a slew of schemes for the poor, Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said on Monday. The ruling Congress party-led coalition government is battling its worst political crisis since coming to power in 2004 with left allies threatening to end support if it pursues a controversial nuclear energy deal with the United States. Some analysts are predicting early polls before the administration's mandate runs out in 2009 - possibly as early as the first quarter of next year. "We will adhere to the 3.3 percent (of gross domestic product) fiscal deficit target for the current year. We will set a target of 3 percent or less next year and meet it, too," Chidambaram told reporters when asked whether populist government spending would hurt finances. He was speaking after launching a health insurance scheme for the poor. India's financial year runs from April to March. "We have done our sums. Even after providing for money for these schemes we will meet the deficit target," he said. Under the health insurance scheme, low income families living below the poverty line will be given smart cards granting them access to health care from state-run or private hospitals costing up to 30,000 rupees ($750) a year. Nearly 75 percent of the cost of the scheme - estimated at 7.51 billion rupees in 2008/09 - would be funded by the central government, and the rest by the 29 states. The government is also set to launch two more schemes soon - one expanding the scope of old-age pensions, and another introducing death and disability insurance for the poor. All are likely to be implemented early next year. Last week, the government said it planned to spend $5 billion to extend a rural jobs scheme to cover the entire country from April 2008, two years ahead of schedule, in an apparent indication the government is gearing up for early elections. Economic liberalisation since the early 1990s has created a sizeable middle class and led to average economic growth of 8.6 percent over the last four years. But millions of the country's poor - nearly 26 percent of India's more than one billion population - have remained largely untouched by the boom. Analysts say populist spending ahead of possible federal elections poses a risk to India's fiscal consolidation efforts. Federal law requires India to lower its fiscal deficit to 3.0 percent of GDP and wipe out its revenue deficit by 2008
