 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury has returned to the name of his original party, Bikalpadhara, it said in a statement Monday. A joint meeting of "leaders and workers from all levels" was held for six days from Sept 16 to design the future course of action, according to the statement signed by Bikalpadhara secretary general Abdul Mannan. "On the basis of the opinion of the members of the party executive committee and approval of party president Prof AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury, party activities will be conducted with the name Bikalpadhara." Explaining the change of the party's name, the statement said: "On October 26, 2006, one day before the expiry of the tenure of the coalition government some ministers and lawmakers of the ruling alliance joined our party, keeping trust in the leadership of Prof B Chowdhury." "They urged that the name of the party be changed to the Liberal Democratic Party. Even after taking the new name, the political base and policy of Bikalpadhara remained unchanged." Without naming LDP leader Oli Ahmed, the statement said it was a matter of regret that a leader--after the Jan 11 changeovermade proposals such as dividing Bangladesh into 11 provinces and issued statements, which were not consistent with the politics of Bikalpadhara or LDP. Prof Chowdhury was the founding secretary general of Bangladesh Nationalist Party and contested the 2001 elections on a BNP ticket and won. After the four party alliance government assumed power, he was installed as president. Differences of opinion with the BNP in mid-2002 led to his resignation as president of Bangladesh and the launch of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh, whose leadership included his son Mahi B Chowdhury, retired major Abdul Mannan and others who followed him out of the BNP. Chowdhury became president of the new party. An alliance with Col (retd) Oli Ahmed, another BNP dissenter, led to the formation of the Liberal Democratic Party. Later the LDP split. bdnews24.
