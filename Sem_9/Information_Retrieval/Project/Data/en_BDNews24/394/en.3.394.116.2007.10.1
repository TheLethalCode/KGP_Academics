 MUMBAI, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Skipper Mahela Jayawardene and seven other Sri Lanka players have signed up for the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) to be played next year, organisers said on Monday. Building on the national team's Twenty20 World Cup triumph, the Indian cricket board is to launch its own multi-million dollar professional Twenty20 league, the IPL. It will counter a rival Twenty20 league which has attracted a number of big names but has come under pressure after the board refused to give it approval. The other Sri Lankans to sign up are off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, 'keeper-batsman Kumar Sangakkara, all-rounders Sanath Jayasuriya and Farveez Maharoof, and fast bowlers Lasith Malinga, Nuwan Zoysa, and Dilhara Fernando. "We are all thrilled to be joining the IPL, an innovative venture that has the potential to fuel cricket's growth around the world during the coming years," Jayawardene said in a statement. The Indian board said last month the league would be played in April next year with $3 million in prize money and eight teams to be bought by franchisees. National boards also jointly announced a Champions Twenty20 league from next year offering $5 million in prize money and featuring two finalists each from leagues in India, Australia, South Africa and England. Retired Australian stalwarts Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne have opted for the official Indian version which will also feature New Zealand's Stephen Fleming and India's Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Saurav Ganguly and Anil Kumble. Teams could include up to four internationals besides domestic players and local youngsters
