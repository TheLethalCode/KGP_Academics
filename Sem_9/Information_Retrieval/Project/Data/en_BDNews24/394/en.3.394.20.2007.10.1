<TITLE> Foreign aid often fuels corruption: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Housing and public works adviser Mainul Hosein said Monday that foreign aid often hampered the country's development process and also helped corruption. He made the observation at a seminar organised by the Public Works Department on World Habitat Day. Mainul, also in charge of the law ministry, said: "We are a resourceful country. Besides, a lot of resources come from foreign countries. Sometimes it occurs to me that this foreign aid is an obstacle to our development. It also helps increase corruption. Embezzlements of these funds have been a common scenario." Mainul said that there was information about people smuggling thousands of crores of taka outside the country. "They have homes in countries like the US and Malaysia, and they ride expensive cars. They think they will be better off abroad. There are some cases in which husbands are in jail and wives are living lavishly abroad," he said. The adviser complained that some people are busy depicting the government's failures. "But nobody is focusing on solving the problems," he added. Mainul said that no more businessmen would be arrested, but would be penalised if proven guilty. "The government is taking these measures in the interest of the country's economy and to bring confidence back to the business community," he said. He also said that the country needed a coordinated leadership to move forward. On the significance of World Habitat Day, barrister Mainul said, "A third of the population live in urban areas. That means five crore out of the 15 crore people live in urban areas. Our urbanisation has not reached the level in developed countries," he added. He focused on building shelters for homeless people and for a safer and less risky city life. He also portrayed the government's various projects in this regard. Salma Shafi, an urban planner, presented the keynote paper on the occasion. bdnews24.c
