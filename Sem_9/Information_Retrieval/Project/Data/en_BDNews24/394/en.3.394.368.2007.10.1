"Irrespective of one's view of Putin's democratic credentials, markets respect the stability and prosperity he has brought to Russia, and should react positively to the latest development." STANISLAV PONOMARENKO, ANALYST AT ING BANK, MOSCOW: "It is not entirely clear what will happen to the status of president if Putin becomes prime minister. I cannot rule out that the president will become a ceremonial figure although it is impossible without changes to the existing constitution. "Without those changes, such a structure would hold purely on the loyalty of the president to the prime minister. "(Current Prime Minister Viktor) Zubkov could be such a figure as we can follow through his public appearances that one of his key tasks is to put Putin's orders in place. "I don't expect the market to react sharply. The same people remain in power." MARKET REACTION: Russia's benchmark RTS index closed down 1.19 percent on the day.
