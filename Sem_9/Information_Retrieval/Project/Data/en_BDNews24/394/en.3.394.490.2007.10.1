 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday said it would take special measures to avoid the overloading of launches during the Eid holiday season. At a meeting at the shipping ministry, representatives of the police, BIWTA, BIWTC, different district administrations and launch owners have decided to strictly enforce regulations to avoid accidents. Enforcement measures will include posting mobile courts, uniformed and plainclothes police at launch terminals to prevent overloading. Law enforcers will also crack down on ticket scalping at the terminals. "Eid festivities have been tarnished in the past because of huge launch disasters resulting from overloading prompted by the rush of passengers and launch owners' overwhelming greed for extra profits," communications and shipping adviser MA Matin told reporters after the meeting. "We're taking steps to avoid disasters." He said special arrangements would be in place for a fortnight starting a week before the Eid and continuing for seven days after the festival. Badiuzzaman Babu, president of the Riverine Passenger Transportation Society, also supported special monitoring to avert accidents on the country's vast waterways. Recovery ships Rustam and Hamza will be on stand by in the event of an emergency situation, Matin assured. Babu said launch owners have pledged not to charge passengers excessive fares, and on top of that, they have resolved to give homebound deck passengers a 10 percent discount this Eid. bdnews24
