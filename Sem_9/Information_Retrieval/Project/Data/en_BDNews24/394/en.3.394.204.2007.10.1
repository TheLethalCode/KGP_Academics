 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com) - The emergency meeting between the Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis and the Premier Cricket League's 12 clubs over last season's premier league relegation matches ended in a deadlock on Monday. Of the clubs, eight have urged the CCDM to call off the relegation matches and hold the next Premier League with 14 teams instead of 12. Three clubs, including powerhouses Abahani and Mohammedan, objected to the plan resulting in the stalemate. Three clubs  Indira Road KC, Brothers Union and City Club  are scheduled to play the relegation league that sees two bottom teams being relegated to the first division cricket league. After the meeting, Brothers union representative Masum Ali threatened to take legal action against the BCB if it remained stuck to holding the matches. The BCB has asked three bottom teams -- Indira Road KC, Brothers Union and City Club -- to play the relegation matches on October 4, but the clubs refused to play matches seven months after the completion of the league. "We are still hopeful that the clubs will play the relegation matches," CCDM chairman Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu told reporters after the meeting. "If they have any problem, we will take care of it. We are even ready to defer the matches, if they agree," added the former Bangladesh captain.
