 GENEVA, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Environmental disasters sparked by climate change will increase the number of people seeking to migrate to richer countries from poorer parts of the world, UN refugee chief Antonio Guterres warned on Monday. Speaking to the executive committee of his agency, the UNHCR, the former Portuguese prime minister called on the international community for greater efforts to tackle the problems sparking migration flows. "Almost every model of the long-term effects of climate change predicts a continued expansion of desertification, to the point of destroying livelihood prospects in many parts of the globe," Guterres said.

Crises such as Iraq -- where over 4 million uprooted people inside and outside the country made up the largest-ever population of "urban refugees" -- and around Somalia in the Horn of Africa were adding daily to the totals. Guterres, whose formal title is United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that around the globe the dramatic growth in migration was also driven by a desire "simply to avoid dying of hunger".
