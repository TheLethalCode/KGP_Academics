 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com) - Health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman Monday said that 80 percent of waterborne diseases are caused by unsanitary latrines and bad hygienic practices. However, the adviser said Bangladesh's progress in achieving the United Nation's Millennium Development Goal (MDG) on sanitation coverage remained impressive. Rahman spoke at the opening function of Sanitation Month at Osmani Memorial Auditorium. The MDG set a target in 2003 of achieving total sanitation coverage in the country by 2010. This year the level of coverage reached 85 percent in both rural and urban settings. "Lack of sanitary latrines in the country is a major barrier to the public's health," said Rahman. "Diarrhoea and malnutrition are major reasons behind child mortality rates in the country." "What is more, those who survive do not always lead a healthy life, there is no alternative to good sanitation for everyone." "Nationally waterborne diseases like diarrhoea cost the nation around Tk 500 crore a year. It is the poorer sections of society that bear the brunt of this cost," Rahman added. When the MDG set its target in 2003 it was estimated that approximately one third of families in Bangladesh used sanitary latrines. Coverage reached over 80 percent by June, according to local government ministry officials. Four districts, 54 municipalities, 95 upazilas, the Tejgaon Circle of Dhaka City Corporation and 1,200 Union Parishads have achieved 100 percent domestic sanitation coverage. bd
