<TEXT>
 KOCHI, India, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia skipper Ricky Ponting could return for Tuesday's second one-dayer against India after being sidelined by a hamstring injury during last month's Twenty20 World Cup, vice-captain Adam Gilchrist said. The batsman missed the first game in Bangalore on Saturday which was abandoned due to rain, having suffered the injury midway through the Twenty20 tournament and missed the semi-final defeat against eventual winners India. "Ponting is progressing very well," Gilchrist told reporters on Monday. "He was very close to playing in Bangalore. "He has a good chance of playing tomorrow without necessarily being a certain starter." Australia, who are returning to one-day action after an unprecedented World Cup hat-trick in April, are also without fast bowler Shaun Tait, batsman Mike Hussey and all rounder Shane Watson due to injuries. Gilchrist said left-arm paceman Nathan Bracken was due to rejoin the squad before Friday's third ODI in Hyderabad having flown home to be with his wife for the birth of their first child. Both teams were again frustrated by rain in the southern coastal town and had to skip regular nets. The weather cleared later on Monday but more showers could further damage the soggy ground. "Tricky situation, and all reports are that there is going to be no chance and rain will keep coming," Gilchrist said. "You got to be careful not to totally switch off and almost get into a holiday mode and all of a sudden be out there to play a one-day international." Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh was fit after missing the opening game due to a stiff neck, team manager Lalchand Rajput said
