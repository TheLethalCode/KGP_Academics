A US military judge had dismissed the charges against Hamdan and another Guantanamo prisoner because they had been designated "enemy combatants," not "unlawful enemy combatants" as required by the 2006 law. A US military court last month reinstated the charges in the other case, a ruling likely to apply to Hamdan also. There are about 340 detainees at Guantanamo.
