<TITLE> I am not match fit, says Yousuf after late test pullout </TITLE>

 KARACHI, Oct 1 (Reuters/bdnews24.com) - Pakistan's senior batsman Mohammad Yousuf said his recent break with the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) had nothing to do with his last-minute pullout from Monday's first test against South Africa. Last week Yousuf agreed not to join the ICL and instead accept a central contract with the Pakistan Cricket Board. "I have not played for two months and I require more time to regain full match fitness," Yousuf told reporters.

Yousuf, who scored 1,788 runs in 11 tests last year with nine hundreds, said he was keen to play in the second test in Lahore starting next Monday
