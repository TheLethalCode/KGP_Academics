 AMMAN, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday he hoped to agree with the Israelis on a accord over final status peace talks that could be endorsed during a US-led conference on Palestinian statehood. Abbas said he would strive to narrow differences with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during their negotiating teams' first formal talks in Jerusalem on Wednesday over the goals of the US-hosted Middle East peace conference, planned for mid-to-late November.
