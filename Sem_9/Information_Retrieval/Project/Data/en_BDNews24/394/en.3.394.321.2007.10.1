<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Monday sought permission to withdraw money from her bank account to pay Tk 7 lakh income tax, her lawyer said Monday. Hasina's tax lawyer Khondaker Maniruzzaman said a letter attested by deputy jailor Faruque Ahmed would be sent to the National Board of Revenue Tuesday. Maniruzzaman mentioned that Hasina's bank accounts were frozen. Hasina had earlier sent a letter to the NBR seeking permission to withdraw money from a Sonali Bank account, but the NBR asked her to send another letter attested by the prison authorities as it was not attested at the time. The income tax would be paid as soon as NBR permission was granted, her lawyer said. Maniruzzaman met Hasina at about 3pm at the sub-jail where she is being held. He was with her for about one and a half hours. He said Hasina was worried over the rise in the prices of commodities. Maniruzzaman said that they had discussed the 11 lawsuits against her in addition to some family issues. Politics did not feature in their discussion. bdnews
