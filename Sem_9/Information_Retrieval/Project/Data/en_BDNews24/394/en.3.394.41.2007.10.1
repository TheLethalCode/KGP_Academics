<TITLE> Islamic bank caught between Israel and Hamas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas's takeover of the Gaza Strip has thrust the largest Islamic bank in the territory to the centre of the financial war between Israel and the ruling group. The Palestine Islamic Bank recently received warnings from Israel over its dealings with Hamas, raising the prospect of a crackdown, Israeli and Palestinian officials told Reuters this week. A top Palestine Islamic Bank official said any accounts opened by militants at branches in the Gaza Strip have already been closed despite threats from the Islamist group, which seized the coastal territory by force from the secular Fatah faction in June. The tug-of-war over the Palestine Islamic Bank, which was established in Gaza City in 1995 and follows Islamic banking rules banning interest, highlights the heavy pressure brought to bear by both Hamas and the Israeli government on Palestinian financial institutions. Hamas's ability to fund its government in the Gaza Strip has been hampered at least in part by a campaign by Israel and the United States to block funds from reaching the group through the Palestinian and international banking system. The U.S.-led campaign is meant to isolate Hamas, and bolster Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Western-backed government he appointed in the occupied West Bank after Gaza's takeover. Funds have begun flowing again to the West Bank. Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said regulators recently gave the Palestine Islamic Bank a "verbal warning" to stop any suspected dealings with Hamas. The officials said Israel has raised the issue with the U.S. Treasury Department, which has the power to blacklist banks. Israel is considering taking action itself, the officials said, though they declined to provide any specifics. The head of the Palestine Islamic Bank's board of directors, Mohammed Zakarneh, said the bank does not have ties to Hamas's government in the Gaza Strip. "We do not have any accounts for Hamas people so we are not a bank for Hamas and we do not transfer money to Hamas," he said. Zakarneh confirmed that the Palestine Islamic Bank received a verbal warning from Israel through the Palestine Monetary Authority (PMA), which regulates banks in the Palestinian territories. "I do not work as an intelligence agency. As a bank, I cannot tell if a customer is Hamas or not. But I'm ready to cooperate if I receive information (from the PMA) telling me that this guy belongs to Hamas or (Hamas's) Executive Force, and shut down the accounts," Zakarneh told Reuters. The stakes are enormous for the bank, which depends on access to other financial institutions and the Israeli currency for day-to-day transactions. Israel has sought to tighten its financial hold on the Gaza Strip since Hamas routed Abbas's Fatah forces in June. Israel's largest commercial bank, Bank Hapoalim , said last week that Israel's decision to brand Gaza an "enemy entity" prompted it begin severing links to the territory. Regulators say Discount Bank and other Israeli banks plan to follow Hapoalim's lead, threatening Gaza's money supply and Abbas's ability to pay public sector wages. Despite the international sanctions and pressure on local banks, Israeli officials believe that Hamas is able to bring into Gaza tens of millions of dollars each month, using pro-Hamas businesses, cross-border tunnels and by sea. Israeli and Palestinian officials say the Palestine Islamic Bank conducts at least some of its transactions through larger banks in New York and Qatar. Regulators say the Palestine Islamic Bank was under Israeli scrutiny before Gaza's takeover. But pressure on the bank -- from Israel and Hamas -- has increased since June. A major focus for Israel was how an estimated 3 million shekels ($745,000) was inadvertently deposited into Hamas Executive Force accounts at the Palestine Islamic Bank when Abbas paid government salaries in early August, officials said. When the bank was notified of the mistake, Zakarneh said the bank immediately froze the accounts. Hamas's Executive Force responded by detaining the bank's deputy general manager in the Gaza Strip. Executive Force officials said the banker was picked up for questioning in the morning and returned to his home each night. Zakarneh said the bank, which has six branches in Gaza and seven in the occupied West Bank, has been subjected to threats from Hamas, prompting bank management to begin the process of relocating to the West Bank. "In Gaza, we do not work in a normal banking environment," Zakarneh said. "If Hamas continues to give us a hard time, we will close our branches in Gaza. We won't risk our banking reputation.
