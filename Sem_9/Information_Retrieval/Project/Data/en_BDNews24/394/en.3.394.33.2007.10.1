<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mob of a dozen Germans shouting xenophobic slurs attacked three Greeks at a petrol station in eastern Berlin over the weekend, police spokesman Bernhard Schodrowski said on Monday. Police have arrested 10 men and one woman on suspicion of taking part in the attack on Saturday in Pankow, a district of what was once East Berlin, he said. Schodrowski said that at least 13 attackers punched and kicked two Greek men while hurling insults at them for being foreigners. The attackers pushed and shoved the victims' Greek female companion but did not injure her. The two men were treated for facial injuries at a hospital and then released. Eastern Germany has seen intermittent attacks on foreigners since German reunification in 1990 and far-right political parties are on the rise in Germany. The Pankow attack occurred just weeks after a mob of 50 people shouting racial insults attacked eight Indians in the town of Muegeln near Dresd
