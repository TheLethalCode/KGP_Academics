 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) now seeks the final approval of the National Sports Council (NSC) to form the district and divisional football associations (DFA) after sending the FIFA- approved DFA constitution to them. "If the NSC comes forward to approve the DFA constitution, it needs just 21 days to hold the DFA election," said BFF president SA Sultan on his arrival from Shanghai on Monday after attending a meeting held under the auspices of FIFA chief Joseph S. Blatter. "I will talk to the NSC secretary Tuesday and hope to get the final approval from him," Sultan said, "The BFF executive committee will give its consent within three days after the NSC approval." "We have just got it Sunday and we have to see it meticulously," NSC secretary Aminul Islam said, "Afterwards, we will give our consent." The BFF chief believes they will be able to hold the BFF election by this year. The world's football governing body, FIFA, had postponed BFF's scheduled election on June 23 in a bid to bring democracy in the district sports associations through forming separate DFAs. The FIFA decision gave rise to distrust between the BFF and the NSC, who had a dilemma over approving the draft DFA constitution, but later approved it following the resignation of BFF general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal in August. Sultan said there were small talks in the sports arena about the present committee which plans to remain in office again. It creates distrust between the NSC and the BFF, he added. "The members of the executive committee will step down if the NSC thinks that we want to regain our posts," said the BFF chief.
