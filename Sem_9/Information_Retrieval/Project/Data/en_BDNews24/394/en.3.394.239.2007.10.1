 PARIS, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French Prime Minister Francois Fillon launched six months of national consultations on Monday on plans to overhaul the civil service, in the hope of avoiding the kind of protests that scuppered previous reform efforts. "All the challenges of our time converge towards a necessary and urgent reform of the state," he told a conference in Paris launching a process of debate involving unions, civil servants and employers as well as ordinary citizens. President Nicolas Sarkozy has pledged a leaner, more efficient public service with fewer employees who would enjoy better pay and conditions and greater incentives to perform. He has promised a "cultural revolution", shaking up the way the civil service works with symbolic measures such as cutting the number of places at ENA, the exclusive institute that trains the French administrative elite. First, he will cut the payroll, with about 23,000 public service posts due to disappear next year as staff retire and are not replaced. Already there have been rumblings of complaint and rail unions have called a strike on Oct. 18 in protest against plans to scrap pension benefits that allow some public sector workers to retire years before contemporaries in other fields. Memories are still vivid of the weeks of protest that greeted a previous reform drive in 1995, when strikes shut down the rail system and huge demonstrations forced a humiliating climbdown by Prime Minister Alain Juppe's government. However, the pressure for reform has been growing as France's public debt swells and the government is forced to spend billions to prop up the social security system. "MATTER OF URGENCY" "The renovation of our public service is a matter of national urgency," Fillon said. "Our generation will be judged in large part on its ability to adapt the administration to the challenges of our time." France employs 5.1 million public sector workers -- almost one in five of the total work force -- from nurses, teachers and police officers to railway staff, ambassadors and municipal employees. Staff costs account for 40 percent of public spending. The state apparatus has long been criticised for being rigid and inefficient as labour conditions, some introduced in the 19th century, have ossified. Fillon said many staff were demotivated by rules ensuring most promotion was based on seniority rather than performance or offering widely different pay scales. Despite the rhetoric, the government has been moving carefully, aware of the dangers of trying to impose reform. Although many people grumble about France's army of civil servants who enjoy job guarantees not always available in the private sector, they still command respect. An opinion published poll in the newspaper Le Parisien showed 66 percent of the French wanted reform but the same poll showed 77 percent had a good opinion of civil servan
