 SINGAPORE, Oct 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Global stocks hit an all-time high on Tuesday with financial companies in the driving seat as subprime losses set out by big banks, including Citigroup, calmed fears that the credit crunch would derail the global economy. The beaten-down dollar found brief respite from its lifetime lows reached on Monday, after Citigroup's Inc's reassurance that profits would return to normal raised hopes the worst of the credit squeeze may be over. Easing credit worries took the shine off gold's safe haven status, and the precious metal backed off a 28-year high to trade at $738 an ounce. Guarded relief that the losses banks have taken from securities linked to risky US mortgages, which have turned up in the portfolios of institutions in countries such as Australia and Singapore, are largely in the open was set to drive European share markets higher. Financial bookmakers in London expect the FTSE 100 index to open 30 to 32 points higher, the DAX to open 39 to 47 points up and the CAC 40 to gain 21 to 30 points. Citigroup helped drive the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high on Monday after its chief executive said that third-quarter profit would drop 60 percent but the financial services company would "return to a normal earnings environment in the fourth quarter." By 0556 GMT, MSCI's All-Country World Index was up 0.3 percent, just off a record high of 417.34 set earlier. MSCI's Asia-Pacific ex-Japan and emerging market indexes also hit record peaks. Asia's biggest market, Tokyo, closed 1.2 percent higher, helped by the dollar's firmer tone against the yen. "Investors like a record finish in the United States. But the Nikkei isn't powering higher as investors are feeling a bit concerned about Japanese corporate earnings," said Naoki Koga, senior fund manager at Toyota Asset Management. "Financial stocks had been sold too sharply and they are returning to where they were. They are unlikely to keep pushing much higher, though." Citigroup's announcement followed similar hefty losses for European investment bank UBS AG and Credit Suisse in the wake of the credit squeeze. The banking giants are the latest in a string of global finance houses that have reported damage from the fallout in the US housing downturn. FINANCIAL HAND But relief that the impact may ease in the near term boosted financials. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index hit a record high at 6,666.8 points and closed up 1.5 percent at 6,659.9, lifted by financials such as Babcock & Brown and Macquarie Bank. Japan's Nikkei stock average cleared 17,000 points for the first time in nearly eight weeks, after financial shares such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc gained. Seoul's KOSPI index closed 2.62 percent up at 2,014.09, notching an all-time closing high and marking its biggest daily gain since September 19. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index hit an all-time high above 28,200. Singapore's Straits Times Index also struck a record for the fourth straight trading session, thanks to gains in banks such as DBS Group Holdings. Japanese government bonds slipped, handing back gains from the previous day as the jump in Tokyo shares prompted selling of safe-haven debt. December 10-year futures fell 0.21 point to 134.88, slipping towards a six-week low of 134.32 struck last week. US Treasuries were steady, eyeing pending home sales data due later in the day. The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGB edged up 1.5 basis point to 1.675 percent. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note yielded 4.565 percent. Oil prices headed back down toward $80 a barrel, retreating from near-record highs last week and still nervous over the threat of a deeper economic slowdown in the United States. US crude was down 14 cents at $80.10 a barrel in Asian trade. "In the long-run, I expect prices to fall below $70 on the modest global economic outlook and the decline in the hurricane premium," said Dariusz Kowalczyk, chief investment strategist at CFC Seymour.
