 PARIS, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defeated French presidential candidate Segolene Royal accused her rival Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday of leading a gaffe-prone foreign policy that has alienated France's closest rivals.

"At a time when even our British friends are distancing themselves, Nicolas Sarkozy has made the choice of closer ties with the United States. It is a decision with grave consequences," she said.
