<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  The benchmark index or DGEN hit a record high Monday as a buying frenzy among investors drove Trust Bank shares to more than seven times its book value on its debut in the market. Market operators termed the rally "hyped and flimsy" as the fundamentals did not match the debut trading price of the bank's shares. Trust Bank led the market and climbed 749.25 percent to Tk 849 from its book value of Tk 100. The bank floated primary shares at Tk 150 with a premium of Tk 50. "It appears to be overpriced considering the earning per share of Trust Bank. Prospects of growth and some rumors have pulled its prices up," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. Trust Bank said it had earned Tk 17.6 each share in the six months to June 2007. Its reserves, as per the data at the Dhaka Stock Exchange, stood at Tk 454.26 million. The DGEN or general index rallied 78.84 points or 3.09 percent to close at 2627.0, the highest point since September 10. The DSI or all price index ended at 2168.44, up 59.95 points or 2.84 percent. The DSE-20 blue chip index advanced 18.64 points or 0.93 percent to 2021.25. Turnover crossed the Tk 2.0 billion mark again after three weeks, to stand at Tk 2.33 billion, from transactions of 15,475,744 shares. Of the issues traded, 120 gained, 57 dipped and 12 held steady. "The market looks pretty good. But the rally in Trust Bank shares appear to hyped and flimsy," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage about Tk 800 million in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. "Its fundamentals don't justify its debut price." He said such a rise in Trust Bank shares indicated price distortion in the primary market. "Our primary market lacks any price mechanism. Therefore there are serious distortions in flotation and listing prices." "Such a fixed pricing system acts as a disincentive for the entrepreneurs as they do not get actual prices against the issued shares," he added. "We should implement the book building method to help good companies get market-based prices," Sayeed said. Banks went up significantly along with life insurance. The power sector also gained BRAC Bank, AB Bank, AIMS 1st mutual fund and Power Grid Company of Bangladesh also led the rally Monday. BRAC Bank, second most active share, advanced for the second day to finish at 1297.25, up 1.64 percent. AB Bank climbed 3.4 percent to Tk 2460.25. AIMS 1st MF advanced 1.94 percent to Tk 7.86. Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, third biggest share by market capitalisation, led the gain in power stocks. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange rallied, with turnover rising to Tk 293.45 million from trading of 1,594,903 shares. Gainers ruled losers 58 to 30. Some eight issues ended unchanged. b
