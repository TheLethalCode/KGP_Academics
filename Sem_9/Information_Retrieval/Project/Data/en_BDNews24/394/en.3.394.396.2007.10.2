 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Staff correspondent Dhaka, Oct 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Road Transport Authority weighs a plan to bring joint forces on board for a campaign to curb fare-padding and other offences by CNG-run auto-rickshaw drivers. "There are a lot of complaints against CNG auto-rickshaws and taxicabs. Two mobile courts are already on the road to punish fare refusals and to curb fare hiking," BRTA chairman Abu Bakar Md Shahjahan told bdnews24.com Monday. "Some drivers have been sent to jail because drivers and operators seem unmoved by fines. Things will get stricter after Eid. We are thinking of asking the joint forces for help," Shahjahan said. Despite a government price-hike for CNG auto-rickshaw fares, drivers regularly refuse to take passengers to their destinations or refuse to turn on the meter. If they agree to a trip, they tack on a Tk 10 or Tk 15 surcharge, passengers allege. Observers say the situation is getting worse as Eid approaches. BRTA officials said fining non-compliant drivers was proving ineffective. Drivers are now being awarded jail sentences for their offences. The last few days have seen some 20 CNG drivers being sent to jail for two-month terms. At least 1,350 cases have been filed and some 150 auto-rickshaws have been seized. The authorities have brought in some Tk 10 lakh in fines so far. But where does the buck stop? A meeting between the government, auto-rickshaw owners and drivers in May 2007 decided to increase the metre fare to meet costs. The meeting set Tk 13.50 for the first two kilometres instead of the previous rate of Tk 12 and Tk 5.50 per km, and a rate of Tk 0.75 per minute for waiting. For short distances the fare was set at Tk 15. Under the new rule, drivers were to deposit Tk 450 instead of Tk 300 to owners. Despite this, fare hiking and other problems have continued unabated, leaving commuters unhappy. Maintenance costs come to at least Tk 3,000 each month, they said, and the prices of small parts had increased. Rents had to be paid to garages, and long queues at filling stations mean lost-fare time. Drivers allege that owners charge for two shifts a day. The first driver pays the daily charge of Tk 450 for a shift from 9:00am to 6:00pm. For a second shift beginning after 6:00 pm, a second or the same driver is charged Tk 250 to Tk 350, which means an owner obtains up to Tk 900 a day. Abdus Sattar, owner of CNG auto-rickshaw in Mirpur, said, "I don't make even Tk 10,000 per month from each vehicle. It costs Tk 4.5 lakh to purchase the vehicle, and expenditures have increased. "If the vehicle cost less it wouldn't have been a problem to take less money. Because of rising maintenance costs, many people have opted to buy Mishuks." BRTA officials said that 13,000 CNG auto-rickshaws and 10,000 taxicabs had been registered so far. They said many of them were not in operation and added that no CNG auto-rickshaws had been registered since 2005. "This crisis has resulted from capping the registration of CNG vehicles despite growing demand," an official said. bdnews24.com
