 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)A senior ruling Awami League leader has opposed the move by the Election Commission to extend the July 25 deadline for submission of permanent party constitutions. "It would be against the law. President Zillur Rahman has to declare an ordinance to do so," Awami League presidium member Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury told reporters after the 'National Labour Convention-2009' at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka on Friday. AL spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam said on Thursday that the government will consider the Election Commission's request to amend the law to extend time, if and when the EC makes it. Opposition BNP and eight other parties have sought extensions. Chowdhury said party general secretary Abdul Jalil's name was not on the council preparation committees due to his illness. "He will not be available regularly," Sajeda added. The AL plans to hold its national council on July 24 to approve a final constitution. Asked if the young leaders would get important positions, she shot back, "Shall we stay for the whole life?" Chowdhury is the acting chairman of the preparation committee in absence of party president prime minister Sheikh Hasina who is away in Egypt to attend the NAM summit. Earlier, addressing the convention, she said, "The prime minister has already promised to train up the female workers and send them abroad for work." She criticised the 2001-2006 BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government for killing people in the name of religion. "They shut the Adamjee Jute Mills, once the largest mill in the world, and made many workers jobless." Alluding to Col Abu Taher's execution in 1976, Sajeda said, "Ziaur Rahman gave the death sentence to the war-injured Taher. Trial of this killing will be held." Bangladesh Jatiya Sramik Jote president Shirin Akhter asked the government to fulfill their election manifesto by helping to develop the lifestyle of the workers. "The workers were never happy in the last 38 years. Before the election AL promised a change to their life by mounting food, living place and medical services for the workers." Akhter sought full implementation of the labour law, declaration of labour policy and minimum wages, and elimination of gender discrimination to ensure comfortable environment for the female workers.
