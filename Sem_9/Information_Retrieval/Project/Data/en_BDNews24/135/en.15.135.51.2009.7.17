Assisted by the local administration, the Water Development Board employees and the community members were dumping sand-filled bags in an attempt to repair the gaping dyke that breached at around 2pm. On July 10, the rain-fed river started eating into about 600 feet along the 'hard point' zone of the embankment in Shashan Goila Ghat area. It was repaired by dumping sand bags and concrete blocks. The government then formed an investigation committee to look into the reasons for the breach. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen visited the affected area at night. He told WDB officials that the continuous breaches had created panic on the minds of the residents of the town. "Protective measures need to be taken so that they don not feel helpless," he added. The minister asked for a report on the gaping holes in the embankment after sending divers underwater.
