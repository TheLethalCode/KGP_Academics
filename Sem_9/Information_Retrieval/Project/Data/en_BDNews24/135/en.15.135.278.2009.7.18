 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)Party figures and civil society leaders across the spectrum called for a national stance against India's planned Tipaimukh dam on Saturday, putting politics aside. BNP vice-president Hafiz Uddin Ahmed and Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon MP were united in their concerns about the impact of the proposed Indian dam on Bangladesh, though they differed on past actions that led to the current impasse. Hafiz, a former BNP water resources minister, said government officials in Bangladesh had given their consent to construction of the Tipaimukh dam as far back as 1972, without fully understanding the potential impact of the controversial project. He said meetings of the Joint River Commission were held from 1972-75, and during the period the then Awami League government had agreed to the proposed site of the dam. "Later, in 1978, Bangladesh demanded an expert survey. All this went on clandestinely," Hafiz told a meeting organised by the International Farakka Committee at the National Press Club. He said a further three meetings of the Joint River Commission were held between 1996 and 2001 under the AL administration, although the Tipaimukh dam project had not been discussed at the meetings. Speaking earlier, Menon accused the BNP-led alliance of failing to take any action regarding the planned dam during their administration. "Khaleda Zia did not utter a single word on the matter when she was prime minister, even though I supplied a detailed report on the project to the then water resources minister in 2003," said Menon. He said the BNP were raising the issue now they are out of power, when they failed to take any steps while in government. Menon, however, was concerned about the dam's impact. "We have to inform people about the harmful impact of the dam. If necessary, there can be a joint commission with India, China, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh." He said the Ganges Treaty with India clearly stated that constructions on certain rivers required international dialogue. "Our Joint Rivers Commission is very weak on this issue. They don't have the authority to take any decisions. They only act according to political decisions," said Menon. Hafiz said the BNP government during its tenure sent three letters to India regarding the dam, but got no response." "We don't want to get into a squabble with our neighbour, but we do want a solution to this problem," he said. Mostafa Kamal, coordinator of the International Farakka Committee and editor of New Nation chaired the conference. BNP urged to raise issue in House In a separate discussion Saturday, calls were made for the main opposition BNP to return to the House and raise the Tipaimukh issue in the national interest. BNP have been most vocal against the Indian dam but have been boycotting parliament over a seating dispute. Calls were also made to highlight the issue globally. The discussion entitled 'Trans-Boundary Water Sharing: Concern and Prospects' was jointly organised by Centre for Sustainable Development and Bangladesh Centre for International Studies at the CIRDAP auditorium. Former state minister for foreign affairs under the previous Awami League government, Abul Hassan Chowdhury, said, "Foreign diplomats should be informed about the adverse impacts of the project. Moreover, we should include leading civil society members of the region such as Dr Amartya Sen and Prof Yunus." Discussions must be fruitful, but construction and discussion should not run alongside, said Chowdhury. "The foreign ministry must start off the dialogue." He insisted the opposition return to parliament and speaking out on the issue, which would help the government to deal the issue. "The nation will be benefited too." "We must also take advice from our experts who will assist the government with a decision. This would prevent the [opposition] of taking political advantage of the dispute," Chowdhury added. Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury, a former caretaker government adviser, also asked the opposition to rejoin the parliament for the greater interest, ignoring the political conflicts. Former member of the Joint River Commission, Touhidul Anwar Khan, gave data on how water fluctuates in the rivers of Bangladesh, according to Indian flow. Anwar said 93 percent of Bangladesh's river water comes from India. Professor Dilara Hafiz of Jahangirnagar University said, "We should contact international forums while discussing the matter with India." International law Executive director of the Bangladesh Environment Lawyers Association, and award-winning environmentalist, Syeda Rezwana Hassan said neither Bangladesh nor India had signed the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses. But Rezwana, in reaction to a comment made by Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty last month that 'no international law could stop the dam', said, "I would like to ask the high commissioner, in turn, how India could carry out the project if no international law existed." "The answer is, many principles are included in treaties between South Asian countries, even without signing UN conventions," she said. Rezwana said India has different stances on different joint river agreements with neighbouring countries. "The agreement on the Sindhu river with Pakistan says both countries must inform the other before launching construction work on the shared river." "In the Indo-Bangladesh Ganges water sharing agreement of 1996 it was mentioned that distribution of shared waters must be done without harming any of the signatory countries and on mutual understanding." "It is very important to recall this today," she added. bdn
