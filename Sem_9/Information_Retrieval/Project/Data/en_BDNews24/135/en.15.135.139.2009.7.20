 ST.GEORGE'S, July 19 (bdnews.com/Reuters)  The makeshift West Indies side struggled against Bangladesh's spin again on a rain-affected third day of the second Test as the Caribbean side closed on 192 for eight in their second innings. Shakib Al Hasan took four for 62 after the West Indies, who had a five-run first-innings lead, struggled to make a score that would give them a chance of levelling the series. Only Travis Dowlin, who made 49 to follow his 95 in the first innings and Dave Bernard who completed his third half century in the series, showed any competence against tight slow bowling from Bangladesh. Bangladesh deployed an attacking field with close catchers around the bat throughout the day, illustrating their confidence that, as in the first Test and the first innings in Grenada, West Indies would wilt against the constant probing. They were encouraged left-handed opener Omar Phillips holed out to square-leg off Shakib and Ryan Hinds inexplicably tried to sweep a ball going down leg side and gloved to Mahmudullah Riyad at leg slip. Skipper Floyd Reifer's miserable series with the bat continued as he was again trapped lbw by Mahmudullah for three. In four innings, the 36-year-old Reifer has been dismissed on each occasion by Mahmudullah's off-spin, three times via lbw decisions. Dowlin was harshly judged lbw off Enamul Haque Jr bringing together the last two recognised batsmen in the West Indies line-up --- Darren Sammy and Bernard. Sammy made 22 before he lobbed a soft shot to midwicket off Enamul, becoming the latest West Indian to display woeful shot selection. Chadwick Walton, who has been solid behind the stumps but looked out of depth with the bat, was next to go slicing to second slip off Shakib and finally a seamer struck when Shahadat Hossain got Ryan Austin caught by Tamim Iqbal. With tailender Tino Best joining Bernard who was unbeaten on 61 any further runs for West Indies will be a bonus and they must now produce something special with the ball if they are to avoid a 2-0 series de
