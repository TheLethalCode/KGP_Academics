<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)President Zillur Rahman has said the unresolved issues between Bangladesh and India must be settled through bilateral negotiations. Addressing the convocation of a private university on Monday, Rahman in presence of former Indian president A P J Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to India for its generous supports during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. "India is our trusted friend and next-door neighbour. "We firmly believe that the unsolved issues between the two countries would be solved through dialogue and negotiations," Rahman, who presided over the convocation of the University of Information Technology and Sciences (UIST), told the gathering. "We solemnly acknowledge the immense contribution made by India during the war of liberation in 1971," said Rahman, a freedom fighter. Kalam, formerly a nuclear scientist credited with designing India's nuclear programme, presented his speech as the convocation speaker. Bangladesh and its biggest neighbour India have disputes on many bilateral issues, including sharing waters of 54 common rivers, construction of the Tipaimukh dam across the common river Barak in India, land border management, and sea boundary demarcation. Rahman recognised the role of Kalam as president for bringing peace, prosperity and stability in South Asia. Kalam, who early in his life used to sell newspapers in village Rameswaram, said the education in the 21st century should be "borderless". "One of the challenges for the developing countries is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and utilise energy from sun and other renewable sources." He added that the leadership must have visions to transform them into action. He said he was inspired by the works of poet Kazi Nazrul Islam. Kalam at the outset of his speech recited a poem of Nazrul amid huge applause. The prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs Gowher Rizvi also addressed the convocation. Chairman of the UIST board of directors Mohamed Mizanur Rahman and UIST vice-chancellor Abdul Aziz also spoke.
