 COLOMBO, July 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Bowler Chaminda Vaas could play his final Test after being recalled to the Sri Lankan side to face Pakistan starting on Monday. Vaas, 35, is expected to announce his retirement from Test cricket before the start of the third Test, which would be his 111th game in a 15-year career that has bagged 354 wickets. He could play ahead of one of the spinners, probably Ajantha Mendis. Sri Lanka toyed with the possibility of playing Muttiah Muralitharan, who has recovered from a knee tendon injury, but decided not to risk the 37-year-old off spinner, having already taken a winning 2-0 lead in the series. Captain Kumar Sangakkara said his team needed to raise their game to complete a clean sweep. "We have played some good all-round cricket and our bowlers have been fantastic, but we have to be honest that we have been below par with the bat," Sangakkara told Reuters on Saturday. "We batted positively in the second innings during the second Test and were clinical in the manner we finished off the match, but we should have batted Pakistan out of the Test in the first innings," he added. Pakistan captain Younus Khan wants his young team to win the match to boost confidence ahead of a five-match one-day series starting on July 30. "We have to win this game to boost confidence for the one-day afterwards," Khan said. Squads: Pakistan: Younus Khan (captain), Salman Butt, Khurram Manzoor, Mohammad Yousuf, Misbah-ul-Haq, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Mohammad Aamer, Danish Kaneria, Abdul Razzaq, Abdur Rauf, Fawad Alam, Faisal Iqbal. Sri Lanka: Kumar Sangakkara (captain), Malinda Warnapura, Tharanga Paranavitana, Mahela Jayawardene, Thilan Samaraweera, Tillakaratne Dilshan, Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera, Chaminda Vaas, Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Thushara, Nuwan Kulasekara, Dhammika Prasad, Kaushal Silva, Suranga L
