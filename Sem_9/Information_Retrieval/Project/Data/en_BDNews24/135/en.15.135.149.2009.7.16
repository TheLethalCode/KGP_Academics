 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com) - Newly appointed Appellate Division judge SK Sinha said Thursday the "tyrannical" caretaker government wanted to remove him as a High Court judge during the two-year state of emergency. He said lawyers of the Supreme Court Bar Association supported him. Sinha, after taking oath, said, "It will be inconsiderate if I don't show gratitude to the lawyers' society as a justice of the Supreme Court." He was speaking at a ceremony hosted by the SCBA for the four newly sworn in justices of the Appellate Division. "Lawyers inspired and emboldened me during those two years." "All know is how the tyrannical government undertook to remove me unconstitutionally during the emergency," he said. "Bar association members stood beside me. They struggled against those then in charge to maingain rule of law." "They emboldened me not to bow down to unconstitutional demands." Justices BK Das, ABM Khairul Haque and Mohammad Muzammel Hossain, also sworn in on the day, along with SCBA president AFM Mezbahuddin, attorney general Mahbubey Alam and others spoke on the occasion. Das said lawyers and justices have to continue their efforts in unison to establish rule of law in the country. "The dignity of the constitution and the judiciary has to be upheld," said Haque. Hossain said lawyers and justices have to ensure the majority of the countrymen are not deprived of justice. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin administered the oaths Thursday. Judges from both Supreme Court divisions were present. b
