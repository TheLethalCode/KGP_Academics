 JAKARTA Fri Jul 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bomb blasts ripped through luxury hotels in the heart of Indonesia's capital on Friday, killing nine people and wounding dozens in attacks the president said badly hurt confidence in the country. The bombs targeted the JW Marriott hotel, scene of a car bomb attack in 2003, and the Ritz-Carlton, both popular with visiting international businessmen and thought to boast some of the tightest security in Jakarta. A car bomb killed two people along a toll road in the north of the capital, police said and an unexploded homemade device was also later found on the 18th floor of the Marriott. A visibly upset President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, re-elected this month on the back of improved security and a healthier economy, told a news conference that the bombings were the act of a terrorist group bent on damaging the country. "I am sure most of us are deeply concerned, feel very sorry, and are crying silently, like the way I am feeling," he said, adding the perpetrators were "laughing and cheering with anger and hatred." "They do not have a sense of humanity and do not care about the destruction of our country because of this terror act will have a wide impact on our economy, our business climate, our tourism, our image in the world and many others." FINANCIAL MARKETS FALL Indonesian financial markets fell after the blasts, with the rupiah down 0.7 percent at 10,200 per dollar, prompting state banks to sell dollars to support the currency, traders said. Indonesian stocks were down 2 percent. The apparently coordinated bombings are the first in several years and follow a period in which the government had made progress in tackling security threats from militant Islamic groups, bringing a sense of political stability to Southeast Asia's biggest economy. Suspicion was likely to fall on the Jemaah Islamiah militant group, blamed for the previous Marriott attack as well as bombings on the island of Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people. The group, which wants to create an Islamic state across parts of Southeast Asia, was blamed for a string of attacks until 2005, but many militants have since been arrested. "The attack is particularly severe for investor confidence because ... it has affected the hotels that are seen to be among the most secure in Jakarta and also either killed or wounded numerous prominent expatriate business people," said Kevin O'Rourke, a political risk analyst in Jakarta. Tim Mackay, president director of cement maker PT Holcim Indonesia, was among those killed, the company said. According to police, the casualties included citizens of Indonesia, the United States, Australia, South Korea, the Netherlands, Italy, Britain, Canada, Norway, Japan and India. The Manchester United soccer team said it had canceled the Jakarta leg of an Asian tour. A Ritz-Carlton employee said the team had been due to stay at the hotel ahead of a game in Indonesia early next week. BLOOD ON THE STREET Witnesses said the bombings at the Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton were minutes apart and it appeared both had occurred inside the hotel restaurants during breakfast. At the Ritz-Carlton, torn curtains flapped around broken windows and glass lay around the hotel. There was blood on the street across from the Marriott. The hotels are near each other in a business area home to many offices, embassies and bars. "It was very loud, it was like thunder, it was rather continuous, and then followed by the second explosion," said Vidi Tanza, who works near the hotel, describing the blasts. Parliamentary elections in April and the presidential poll this month had passed peacefully, underscoring the progress made by the world's most populous Muslim nation since the chaos and violence that surrounded the downfall of ex-autocrat Suharto in the late 1990s. "I would say it damages foreign investor confidence since the attacks appear aimed at Westerners, but does not shatter it, so long as there is no further violence for some time," said Sean Callow, currency strategist at Westpac Bank in Sydney. An Australian security report on Thursday said Jemaah Islamiah could be poised to strike again. Leadership tensions in the group and recent prison releases of its members raised the possibility that splinter groups might now seek to re-energize the movement through violent attacks, said the report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The report said Jemaah Islamiah was now a splintered group which may not be capable of replicating mass casualty attacks, but warned there was evidence that members released from prison "are gravitating toward hardline groups who continue to advocate al Qaeda-style attacks against Western targets." Sidney Jones, a Jakarta-based expert on Islamic militants at the International Crisis Group, said Jemaah Islamiah as an organization did not appear to be responsible. "It's more likely to be a splinter group than JI itself, which doesn't mean you couldn't have JI members but it's very unlikely to be JI as an organization behind this attack," said J
