<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jul 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US-based carrier Continental Airlines apologised to former Indian president A P J Abdul Kalam on Wednesday after staff had frisked him at Delhi's airport, to Indian uproar. The government has filed a police report against the airline, as protocol at Indian airports exempts specific dignitaries from security checks, and gave Continental Airlines seven days to respond. "Continental Airlines apologises to the former President of India, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam for any misunderstanding and/or inconvenience related to the security screening," the airline said in a statement. "Our intention was never to offend Dr. Kalam or the sentiments of the people of India." Continental Airlines had earlier said there were no exemptions to its security procedures and that it believed Kalam had not been offended. Kalam is seen by many Indians as the founding father of the country's missile programme and a man with a common touch. He was frisked in April but the check caused an outcry in the Indian media and parliament when it became public knowledge. The aviation minister called it "unpardonable", according to local media reports. Indians posted blogs or comments on the internet asking how Americans would react if a former U.S. president were frisked by a foreign airline.
