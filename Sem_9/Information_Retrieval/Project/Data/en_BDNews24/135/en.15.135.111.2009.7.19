 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com) A documentary on 'Women's Football in Bangladesh' will be made with the help of FIFA development officer Mohsin Gilani, said a BFF officer on Sunday. "Gilani has proposed us to make a documentary on women's football in Bangladesh as the FIFA development officer, who also looks after the women's football affairs, has already talked with a film production company, which will make the documentary at their own cost if the football federation could provide local facilities as well as bear two air tickets," BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi told reporters on Sunday. Quoting Gilani Sadi said, "BBC Television has shown interest in showing the documentary once it is made and the film company will own the right of the documentary to distribute abroad while the BFF will retain the local rights of the film." Gilani came to Dhaka on July 15 to see the progress of the FIFA tsunami-funded Football Academy in Barisal. The Pakistani thought that once the documentary was made it would help Bangladesh raise financial support from abroad. Sadi also said that the BFF in collaboration with FIFA will hold a seminar on women's football development in Bangladesh in the first week of November. Meanwhile, the women's football committee decided to hold the Women's Super Championship from the second week of August with the participation of four semi-finalists of the National Women's Championship. They are Bangladesh Ansar, Jessore DFA, Narayanganj DFA and Bangladesh VDP. The meeting also decided to play some matches of the Super Championship in some neutral venues like Rajbari, Comilla, Jamalpur and Gaibandha to motivate women to take up football, said committee chairman Sirajul Islam Bachchu. Bachchu also said that the Corporate Women's Football League would get underway in the last week of October with six to eight corporate houses likely to play in the inaugural meet. bd
