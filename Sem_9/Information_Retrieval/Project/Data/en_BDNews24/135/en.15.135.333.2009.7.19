 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The three members of Islami Chhatri Sangstha, the women's wing of Islami Chhatra Shibir, arrested earlier this month on suspicion of militant activities, submitted a bail petition to the High Court on Sunday. Primary school teacher Tania Akhter, 26, Syeda Fouzia Akhter, 18, and Jesmin Nahar, 20, also challenged the legality of their arrest in the petition. The three were arrested in Pirojpur on July 3, under Section 54 on suspicion of links to banned militant outfit Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh.

Islami Chhatra Shibir and Islami Chhatri Sangstha are backed by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, formerly being student fronts of the party. bd
