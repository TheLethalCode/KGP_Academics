 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is almost set to host the SAFF (South Asian Football Federation) Championship this December as BFF president Kazi Salahuddin was assured by the concerned authority during his Malaysia trip to join the AFC Audit committee meeting early this month. "Unofficially, I can assure you, 85 percent Bangladesh will host the SAFF Championship and I will confirm it once I get the official letter in 10 to 15 days," Salahuddin told reporters at a briefing after returning from his Malaysia and Europe tour. India was supposed to hold the regional championship in December with the participation of eight countries, but they are facing a problem on issuing the visas to Pakistan after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and the country had also earlier refused the Pakistani cricketers for the Indian Premier League. Following India's problem, the issue of shifting the SAFF Championship venue to Bangladesh had earlier been raised with the backing of the other participating nations during the AFC Congress in May. Salahuddin also declared that Bangladesh would host the SAFF Championship, but later the SAFF Committee gave India another few weeks to take a final decision. "The SAFF Congress as well as its election will be held in Dhaka in October next in the presence of AFC president Mohamed Bin Hammam and some invited football federation presidents of few countries as well as the presidents of eight SAFF members," Salahuddin said. "That time we will officially name the host nation of the SAFF Championship." The BFF president is likely to be named president of the SAFF Committee as Manilal Fernando, the vice-president of the Asian Football Confederation and FIFA development officer, made the proposal on behalf of the other seven SAFF countries during Salahuddin's l visit to Sri Lanka in June. Meanwhile, SAFF Committee president Ganesh Thapa, also the Nepal Football Association president and general secretary Sirajul Islam Bachchu, BFF executive member, have been in the helm since 2000 and could hardly manage to organise a SAFF Championship regularly. Explaining the reason behind Hamman's visit to Bangladesh in October, Salahuddin said, "The AFC is pleased with the activities of the Bangladesh Football Federation and they are very keen on how to take Bangladesh football forward. That's why Hammam will visit Bangladesh as well as meet the Prime minister." The BFF boss informed that the AFC has granted additional $4,000 per month along with previous $6,000 to run the football federation smoothly. It seems the Bangladesh Football Federation may defer the Bangabandhu Gold Cup football tournament by a few months as Indian clubs East Bengal and Mohan Bagan are not available in the proposed time of October-November. Salahuddin held talks with with All India Football Federation general secretary Alberto Colaco in Malaysia and he agreed to send both clubs in January, but not in October-November this year. "He (Colaco) agreed to send both clubs preferring January 1-15 and I could not say a word as the BFF executive committee had decided to hold the tournament in October-November," said Salahuddin adding that the executive committee would meet before the Ramadan to finalise the date. Meanwhile, the Indian professional football league will start in September. Replying to a query, Salahuddin said that other participating teams had no problem to take part in October-November and the BFF executive committee would soon sit together to take the decision on the start of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup. It is understood that the tournament is likely to be defered by a few months as the BFF is very much interested in bringing Indian sides along with the participations of local giants Abahani Limited and Mohammedan Sporting Club. The national team's commitment in the SAFF Championship in December, the SAFF Games in January and the AFC Challenge Cup finals in February may prompt the BFF to defer the Bangabandhu Gold Cup by a few month
