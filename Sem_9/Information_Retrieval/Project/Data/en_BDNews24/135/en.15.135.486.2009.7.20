 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)The cabinet on Monday approved a proposal to ease educational pre-requisites of registered primary school teachers. The Mobile Court Act 2009 and the Local Government (Upazila) Act 2009 were also approved in the 31st meeting of the cabinet, headed by the prime minister, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the meeting. The cabinet also gave the provisional go-ahead to the Bangabandhu Novo Theatre Act 2009 and the Labour Act (Amendment) 2009. Azad said, "The same educational qualifications have been imposed for teachers of private registered and government primary schools, where a degree certificate and Certificate in Education (C.Ed.) are required for male teachers, and SSC-HSC and C.Ed. certificates for female." "At present, 21,522 teachers of registered primary schools are made ineligible due to non-fulfillment of these pre-requisites. The proposal approved by the cabinet would allow those who have already been in the profession for 17-25 years, or could not sit the C.Ed. exams for some reason, to continue their jobs without submitting the C.Ed. certificate." Azad said in this regard the prime minister said, "What is the benefit in declaring them ineligible? Many became high officials, even secretaries of government ministries through their teaching." Alluding to the Mobile Court Act Azad said, "The judiciary was freed from the executive division on January 1, 2007. In this situation, the act was approved to protect the law and order situation for public interest and to prevent crimes immediately." The court was given the jurisdiction to fine and award sentences of two years. Bangabandhu Novo Theatre Regarding the Bangabandhu Novo Theatre Act 2009, Azad said, "The organisation had been operating on subsidies. With the new law it will be run by a board and a separate advisory committee will also be formed." The novo theatre, or planetarium, project began in 1997 and was completed in 2004. It now has a yearly turnover of Tk 10,157,000. The novo theatre has turned many students' interest towards science, said Azad. In reply to a question the press secretary said government is doing its best to keep control of prices of essentials and traffic jams in Ramadan days. The prime minister has already ordered to import and sell goods through TCB. In reply to a query if the reported resignation of deputy home minister Tanjim Ahmed was discussed in the cabinet, Azad answered negative. "I have seen the news as reported in the media," he said. bdnews
