 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Jul 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The prime ministers of India and Pakistan met in Egypt on Thursday in the latest round of high-level talks between the rivals that Islamabad hopes will help restart a formal peace dialogue.

Singh has said he was willing to meet Pakistan "more than half way" if it cracked down Lashkar-e-Taiba, as well as against other militant groups that launch attacks in Indian-controlled Kashmir and elsewhere in the country. A visit to India by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, starting on Friday, could encourage Singh to make a conciliatory gesture. The United States is keenly interested in the resumption of talks between the two countries to ease tensions on Pakistan's eastern border with India, so it can focus on fighting Taliban militants on its western border with Afghanistan. Peace between the two nuclear-armed Asian rivals had helped boost bilateral trade to more than $1 billion, encouraged cross-border bus and train services, and eased visa restrictions on tr
