The arrested were 'Mostafiz', Bangabandhu Hall Shibir unit president, secretary 'Jami', Zakir and activists 'Mokaddes', 'Noman', 'Rouf' and 'Mohiuddin. Sub-inspector Abdul Qayyum of Islami University Police Station said police the halls were raided at around 4:30am and two ramdas, two knives, a pipe gun and ammunition seized. Around 700 police and RAB members have been deployed across the IU campus, said Qayyum. Shamsuzzaman Tuhin, organising secretary of BCL, told bdnews24.com, "As I went to Saddam Hossain Hall on Sunday night to join a small party, armed Shibir activists swooped upon us, compelling all BCL men to take up position outside the hall." At least 12 were injured on Sunday night, witnesses said. The incident was sparked when activists of the ruling Awami Leagued-backed BCL sought to wrest control of the halls from the pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student organisation, ICS. According to a bdnews24.com correspondent on the spot, the two groups were locked in a running battle for three hours after the altercation erupted. Several rounds of gunshots were fired during that time and a small explosive device detonated, said witnesses. Vice-chancellor of the university, Prof M Alauddin, told bdnews24.com that the police had been notified of the situation. bdnews
