 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The Netherlands is yet to decide on contributing to the multi-donor trust fund for climate change adaptation in Bangladesh, says the outgoing envoy. "The Netherlands has been funding projects in water management, climate change, education and other development sectors," Bea ten Tusscher, the Dutch ambassador, told bdnews24.com after a farewell accorded to her at Sonargaon Hotel Sunday. "So, we are yet to decide on making a contribution to the trust fund." The trust fund was announced at the Bangladesh-UK climate change conference in London last September with the UK government donating 75 million at its outset. Britain is still the only country to make a contribution to the fund, though many European countries, including the Denmark and the Netherlands, agreed to donate to the fund in principle, according to the Bangladesh government. Tusscher said she was upbeat about Bangladesh's future economic development as the country performed well even amid the ongoing global economic crisis. "I am very optimistic that you will survive even in the difficult situation," she said in a farewell address. But she cautioned that the public-private partnership initiative of the present government could be difficult to implement. "The government has made some allocation for the public-private partnership. This is a good move. "But, experience shows that it is complex to implement," she said. The Dutch-Bangla Chamber of Commerce and Industry organised the farewell. Bea will leave Dhaka on July 29 ending her two-year diplomatic assignment in Bangladesh. Dutch-Bangla chamber leaders Hasan Khaled, Osma Tasser and M R A Taha also addressed the farewell gathering.
