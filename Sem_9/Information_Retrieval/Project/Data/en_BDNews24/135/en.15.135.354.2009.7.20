 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Australia will attempt to add a final twist to a consistently gripping Lord's Ashes Test against England on Monday by chasing down a world-record fourth-innings target of 522. At the close of the fourth day of the second Test on Sunday, Michael Clarke (125) and Brad Haddin (80) had added an unbroken 185 for the sixth wicket to take Australia to 313 for five. Australia need 209 with five wickets standing to break the world record of 418 for seven set by West Indies against Australia six years ago in Antigua and take a 1-0 lead in the series. Coach Tim Nielsen told a news conference on Sunday the Australians were trying to win, not draw, a match at a venue where Australia have not lost a Test since 1934. "We have never talked about saving the Test match," he said. "We like to back ourselves and we think we play our best when we are positive. "I think that people have forgotten that five or six days ago we made about 700 in Cardiff for about six wickets down. We believe in ourselves. We never lost faith." Despite Nielsen's optimism, England will still be favourites to break their 75-year-old Lord's hoodoo if the weather holds. NEW BALL Andrew Flintoff, who roared in from the Pavilion end to dismiss both Australian openers in his first 20 balls, will return after a night's rest with the second new ball in his final Lord's Test. Off-spinner Graeme Swann, who also captured two wickets on Sunday, will also have an important role to play. "I think we are going into the day very confident, we still have a very big lead," said Swann. "It's still a mountain for Australia to climb. We have got the new ball and we have got one of the quickest bowlers in the world firing downhill." Australia will take comfort from the form of Clarke, who batted beautifully for his first Test century in England and his 11th overall, while Haddin is also a high-class performer. Mitchell Johnson, who has suffered an awful match with the ball, is a dangerous striker and Nathan Hauritz and Peter Siddle showed in the first innings that they can handle a bat. Australian sides traditionally back themselves in any situation and in the profusion of one-day matches these days international sides have become used to attaining targets which look impossible on paper. "Tomorrow morning with the second new ball it's a huge half an hour, one hour of play," Nielsen said. "If we can ride through that and keep scoring we will find ourselves in a very positive position. We walk in tomorrow with a real cha
