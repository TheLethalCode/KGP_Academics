<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Jul 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A three-member UN commission arrived in Pakistan Thursday to conduct an inquiry into the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Conspiracy theories abound over who was behind the suicide gun-and-bomb attack that killed Bhutto after an election campaign rally in the city of Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon set up the commission at the request of the coalition government, led by Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), and it began its inquiry earlier this month. The previous government, headed by allies of former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf, blamed Pakistani Taliban commander and al Qaeda ally Baitullah Mehsud for Bhutto's slaying. The US Central Intelligence Agency also made Mehsud the prime suspect, but the Taliban leader denied the accusation from his redoubt in the mountains of Waziristan, a remote tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Speculation lingers that Bhutto was the victim of a plot by allies of Musharraf, who didn't want her to come to power. Preparing to return from self-imposed exile in October 2007, Bhutto wrote a letter to Musharraf, naming a handful of powerful individuals she said should be investigated if she were killed. Bhutto was mistrusted by sections of the Pakistani military and security establishment. Her father, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, was Pakistan's first popularly elected prime minister. He was overthrown and hanged following a military coup in the late 1970s, and mystery surrounds the subsequent deaths of both his sons. Bhutto's return to Pakistan, along with another exiled former premier, Nawaz Sharif, precipitated an end to almost a decade of military rule under Musharraf. Thanks to the cloak-and-dagger history of Pakistani politics, Bhutto's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, hasn't escaped suspicion in many people's minds. Despite his own unpopularity, due in part to unproven charges of corruption, Zardari led the PPP to victory in the February 2008 election and subsequently replaced Musharraf as president. Zardari has vowed to rid Pakistan of Islamist militancy, citing the sacrifice his wife made for democracy in the Muslim nation. The commission, headed by Chile's UN ambassador Heraldo Munoz, has not been empowered to launch criminal proceedings related to the assassination. "The mandate does not extend to the undertaking of a criminal investigation, which remains the responsibility of the Pakistani authorities," the UN said in a statement released Thursday. The commission is to complete its inquiry in six months and submit its report to the UN Secretary General by the end of December, who would then share the findings with the Pakistan government and would also submit it to the UN Security Cou
