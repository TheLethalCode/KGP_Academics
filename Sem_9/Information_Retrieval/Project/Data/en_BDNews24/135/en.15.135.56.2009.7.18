 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court gave Detective Branch police seven days to interrogate one of India's most wanted militants, Mufti Sheikh Obaidullah, after his arrest in Bangladesh earlier in the week. Obaidullah, sought by Indian authorities, was arrested near the Babubazaar bridge in the capital on Thursday after spending 14 years in hiding. Dhaka police chief AKM Shahidul Haq has said Obaidullah was organising militants in Bangladesh during that time, at the orders of Kashmir-based militant group 'Lashkar-e-Taiba' leader Amir Reza. Police produced Obaidullah at the chief metropolitan magistrate's court Saturday requesting ten days' remand on charges under the Passport Act. There was no lawyer for the accused present during the remand hearing. Obaidullah was seen praying in the dock throughout the hearing. The Detective Branch presented Obaidullah before the media on Friday. They said he had received advanced weapons training during the Afghanistan war in 1990-91, and had fought in that country against the Soviet army. Haq said Obaidullah had gone on to encourage 'Jihad' against rightwing Hindu groups in India and the Indian army in Kashmir, and during his 14 years underground had trained numerous militant operatives in Bangladesh . Haq said information derived from Indian mafia operative Daud Merchant and his associate Zahid Sheikh, who were arrested in Brahmanbaria in May, led to Obaidullah's arrest in Bangladesh. Inspector Ruhul Amin of Dhaka Metropolitan Police Detective Branch applied for the remand on Saturday in a case filed under the Passport Act at Kotwali Police Station. In his application Amin told the court that Obaidullah was connected with acts of sabotage in India, and was in Bangladesh to train militants. He said a further case would be filed against Obaidullah under the antiterrorism laws. bdnews24.c
