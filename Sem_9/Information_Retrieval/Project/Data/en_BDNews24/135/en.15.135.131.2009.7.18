 Bandarbans, July 18 (bdnews24.com)Local government officials in Bandarban said Saturday that increasing numbers of Rohingya refugees were entering Bangladesh from Myanmar aiming to register themselves as residents as updating of voter lists was ongoing in the area. "Joint forces arrested 36 people, including women and children, crossing illegally into Bangladesh along the border at Naikhongchhari. They were sent back," Upazila Nirbahi Officer Nawab Aslam Habib told bdnews24.com. Naikhongchhari police chief Obayedul Huq said the illegal immigrants were returned to Myanmar in three phases through the Chakdhala border post. Md Ismail, sub-inspector of Naikhongchhari Police Station, said a number of those arrested had said they were from Akiab, Budichong and Mongdu in Myanmar. UNO Habib said the group, intercepted on the border, were intending to register themselves as permanent residents in Bangladesh taking advantage of the voter list renewal programme. "Voter list updating in Naikhongchhari Upazila started on July 15," said Habib. He said refugees were also being sheltered by local people in Bandarban Sadar Upazila. "Many of them obtained fake citizenship certificates from the Union Parishad," alleged Habib. Acting on information supplied by locals, district commissioner Mizanur Rahman said authorities had seized eight fake citizenship certificates from Kuhalung Union office on July 11. Rahman told reporters that he had received information that up to Tk 40,000 had been given in bribes so Rohingyas refugees could enlist as voters in Bangladesh. Local upazila chairman Tofail Ahmed also said many refugees from Myanmar had been enlisted as voters in the area following the payment of bribes. Local MP and chairman of the Hill Tracts Development Board Bir Bahadur told a meeting with officials from Naikhongchhari that no attempt at registration on the amended voter list by foreign citizens would be tolerated. bdnews2
