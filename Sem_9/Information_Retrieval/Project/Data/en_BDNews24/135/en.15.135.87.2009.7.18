 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina called on president Zillur Rahman at Bangabhaban on Saturday to brief him on the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Egypt. The prime minister remained at Bangabhaban for an hour and a half from just after 6pm. "Prime minister briefed the president on the 15th Non-Aligned Movement summit in Sharm el Sheikh," the president's press secretary Abdul Awal Howlader told media. "She also gave him the news of her election as the vice chair of NAM's Asia Zone." Hasina also invited Zillur Rahman to a dinner arranged for former Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam, due to arrive in Dhaka on Sunday. "This is a courtesy meeting on the prime minster's return from the two-day summit," the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com earlier. Howlader also told bdnews24.com earlier that there was "no extra schedule." Television channels, amid ongoing speculations of a cabinet shuffle, had reported in the morning that new ministers and state ministers were set to take oath at Bangabhaban Saturday evening. Neither Azad nor Howlader confirmed whether the appointment or oath-taking of new ministers, at a later date, was discussed between the president and prime minister on Saturday. Hasina returned home Friday night after attending the Egypt summit, where she was elected vice chair of NAM's Asia Zone. The global economic recession, climate change, the Middle East and food security dominated the two-day summit, which was attended by heads of state and governments from over 100 NAM nations. Bilateral talks Hasina, who presided over the summit for some time on Thursday, the concluding day, had sideline meetings with a number of heads of state during the two-day summit. On Wednesday, prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh held their first bilateral talks on the summit sidelines. The first meeting between Hasina, who returned to power in January this year, and Singh, in his second stint in office, touched on India's planned Tipaimukh Dam and concerns about its impact in Bangladesh. During the meeting, Hasina expressed the hope that all contentious issues, including the dam, would be resolved through dialogue with India. Singh gave assurances to Hasina that India would not do anything that would be against Bangladesh's interests. Hasina also met with Malaysian prime minister Najib bin Tun Haji Abul Razak and Qatar's foreign minister Khalid Mohammad Al Aphiya on Thursday, whom she called on to recruit more Bangladeshi workers. 'Climate a major global challenge' In her address to the summit on Wednesday, Hasina highlighted climate change, security concerns and the global financial crisis. "I believe climate change remains as one of the most daunting global challenges of our time," she said. The prime minister said Bangladesh, as a least developed country and situated in a low-lying delta, remained deeply concerned with the impact of global warming. She said concerns of least developed countries were often bypassed in the global debate, and it was vital that greater attention was paid to them at the Copenhagen climate talks later in the year. b
