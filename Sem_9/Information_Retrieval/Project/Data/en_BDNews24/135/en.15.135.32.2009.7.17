 SINGAPORE, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bomb blasts at two hotels in Jakarta's business district killed nine people and wounded 42 others on Friday, Indonesian police said.

Sept 13, 2000 - Blast at stock exchange in Jakarta kills 15 and wounds dozens. Dec 24, 2000 - Series of Christmas Eve blasts at Jakarta churches and elsewhere in the country kill 17 people and wound about 100. At first thought by some to have political motivations, the blasts are later tied to Jemaah Islamiah.
