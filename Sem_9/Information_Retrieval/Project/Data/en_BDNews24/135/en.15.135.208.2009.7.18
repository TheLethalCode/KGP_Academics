 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com) - Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission Ziaul Huq Khondkar on Saturday warned that the regulator would come down hard on any attempts to manipulate the share market through rumour mongering. "The SEC is determined to build up a transparent, well-governed and orderly market," Khondkar told a workshop for journalists on capital market issues in the city. He said the SEC welcomed rational transactions based on market fundamentals, but tough measures would be taken against those attempting to destabilise the share market by spreading rumours. He also said recent initiatives by the government would bring many new investment opportunities in the coming days. "Mutual funds worth several hundred crores will soon enter the market, which means shares are set to be in high demand," he said. Khondkar said measures were being taken to ensure supply of shares in the market kept pace with demand. "An initiative is underway to release profitable company shares now lying with the government." Praising the role of the Bangladesh Bank, Khondkar termed the central bank's monetary policy 'investment-friendly'. "There is no cause for anxiety over the recent role of the Bangladesh Bank, rather, the good discipline it has provided in the banking sector will impact positively on the share market," he said. Raquibur Rahman, president of the Dhaka Stock Exchange and a special guest at the workshop, said the number of investors and overall liquidity in share market had risen as a result of recent government initiatives and measures taken by the SEC and DSE. "In the coming days the depth of the share market will increase. Money will be raised from the share market for projects implemented under Public-Private Partnership programmes," said Rahman. The Capital Market Journalists' Forum jointly organised the workshop with the Dhaka Stock Exchange. CMJF president Ziaur Rahman presided at the event, which was also attended by former DSE executive director Salauddin Ahmed Khan, SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed and around forty journalists. b
