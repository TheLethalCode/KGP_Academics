 Aminul Islam Khan Rana bdnews 24.com Sirajganj correspondent Sirajganj, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Navy divers investigating reasons behind two successive breaches in Sirajganj town's flood barrier Sunday reported further underwater weaknesses in the structure. "We surveyed a 600-metre by 24-metre area and uncovered three more holes, one of which has a radius of around 3-metres," dive team-leader Lt Ariful Haque told bdnews24.com. He said local WDB and district administration officials had been informed of the latest findings. WDB engineers are yet to provide an explanation for failures in the town's flood protection barrier. Abdul Latif Biswas, the fisheries and livestock minister, Saturday cast doubt on the value of the structure's 100-year guarantee, from Korean construction giant Hyundai, following the two breaches on July 10 and July 17. The failures have also rung alarm bells for the structural integrity of the Jamuna Bridge, situated just 8 kilometres away. The WDB, with assistance from the army and district administration, have undertaken remedial work on the structure.
