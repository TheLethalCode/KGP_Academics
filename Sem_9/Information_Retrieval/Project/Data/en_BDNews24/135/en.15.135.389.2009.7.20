 WASHINGTON, Jul 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defense Secretary Robert Gates said US-led forces must gain ground against insurgents in Afghanistan by next summer to avoid a public perception the war is unwinnable, the Los Angeles Times reported on Sunday. While noting that the Taliban militants would not be defeated within a year, Gates told the newspaper it was critical that the US military and its allies show they were making progress in the Asian nation. "After the Iraq (war) experience, nobody is prepared to have a long slog where it is not apparent we are making headway," Gates said in an interview. "The troops are tired.

The additional US troops will reinforce roughly 70,000 international troops already in Afghanistan. NATO leaders also have agreed to boost troop levels by 3,000 to provide security ahead of an August presidential election. US and British troops recently launched an operation across southern Afghanistan to try to recapture territory from the Taliban and improve security, but they have suffered heavy losses in the offensive, largely because the militants are using powerful roadside bombs to deadly ef
