 ST.GEORGE'S, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  West Indies pace bowler Kemar Roach took six wickets as Bangladesh were bowled out for 232 on the second day of the second Test to give the makeshift Caribbean side a narrow first innings lead on Saturday. West Indies lost opener Dale Richards during the final session but closed the day 61 runs ahead of Bangladesh with nine second innings wickets remaining.

EARLY VICTIM The 21-year-old Roach claimed an early victim in night watchman Enamul Haque Jr before fellow seamer Dave Bernard grabbed the crucial wicket of opener Tamim Iqbal, a centurion in the first innings, with a late swinging delivery that the left-hander edged to Walton. When off-spinner Ryan Austin bowled Junaed Siddique, Bangladesh were struggling on 77 for four. Raqibul Hasan's patient 44 was the best effort from a frontline Bangladesh batsman before Roach had him caught behind with the tourists 150 for six. It would have been a much bigger lead for the hosts had it not been for Mushfiqur Rahim's lively 48 from 58 balls. He too was caught behind off Roach who swept through the tail, picking up the last four wickets. With three days remaining, West Indies need to show the kind of focused Test match batting absent from their displays in the series so far. They will be disappointed to have lost Richards, lbw to Shakib Al Hasan's spin in the final ses
