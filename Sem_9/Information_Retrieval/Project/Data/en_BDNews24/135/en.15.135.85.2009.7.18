 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnes24.com)  Chairman of the Regulatory Reforms Commission Akbar Ali Khan said Saturday that a Competition Commission was vital to control rampant business "syndicates" and revitalise the economy. "Business syndicates are controlling everything now, and the government has failed to take proper measures to control them," said Khan at a programme on competition policy.
