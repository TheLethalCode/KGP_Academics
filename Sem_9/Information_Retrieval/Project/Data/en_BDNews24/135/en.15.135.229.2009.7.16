<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)A governmental committee considering the allotment of industrial plots in eight villages at Bhawal, Gazipur, has recommended a final decision in the matter be taken by the national environmental committee, headed by the prime minister. Mostafizar Rahman Fizar, the state minister for environment and forest, told reporters after the meeting that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had banned industries from setting up on privately-owned land in Bhawal to maintain the area's natural beauty. The Awami League administration in 1999 decided to approve the allotments, but it took another seven years before the move was gazetted. During this period 42 industrial plots, with limited facilities, were established in eight villages in the Bhawal area. The present government is yet to finally approve the decision due to a variety of reasons, said Fizar, who is also chairman of the executive committee that considered the matter. He said a decision had also been made at the meeting to continue river dredging and river protection initiatives in the area in line with recent High Court orders. Industries minister Dilip Barua, shipping and water transport minister Afsarul Amin and minister for land Rezaul Karim Hira also attended the meeting. The Bhawal family estate was one of the largest zamindari estate in Bengal spreading over 579 square miles (1,500 km2) and covering 2,274 villages with a population of around 500,000. bdnew
