<TITLE> Country's only wind power plant at risk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)The country's only wind generated power plant at Kutubdia in Cox's Bazar is at risk due to continual breaches of a 20 foot-high protective sea dyke, an official of the plant's operating company said Saturday. "The plant is situated on the coast and its protective embankment has been completely damaged by repeated flood-tides," Md Fazlur Rahman, managing director of Pan Asia Power Services Limited, told a press conference at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity. Rahman asked the prime minister to intervene to ensure the protective embankment is reconstructed immediately. He said the sea dyke had now almost totally failed and any sudden rise in the level of waters in the Bay could jeopardise the power plant's future. "Sea water is also entering residential areas through the damaged dyke and some adjacent agricultural land has also been affected," he said. "Nevertheless, after six severe cyclones and some damaging tornadoes the wind turbines are still running well. We are still supplying electricity for 5 to 6 hours everyday'" he said. Rahman said the local Water Development Board had repeatedly ignored requests to repair the damaged sea dyke. The Power Development Board signed a contract with Pan Asia Power in March 2007 to run the 1000 kilowatt capacity Wind Battery Hybrid Power Project. It currently supplies between 600 and 900 kilowatts of electricity a day to the local area. The project was conceived in 2006 and construction of the plant completed in 2007. It was officially commissioned in March 2008. The Kutubdia power plant is the first and largest of its type in the world, said Rahman. bd
