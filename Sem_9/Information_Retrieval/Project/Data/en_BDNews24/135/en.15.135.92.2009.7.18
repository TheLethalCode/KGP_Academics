<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  Off-spinner Mahmudullah Riyad struck twice in the space of three balls as West Indies were 107-3 at lunch on the first day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh at the National Cricket Stadium in St George's, Grenada on Friday. Travis Dowlin was batting on 12 with Floyd Reifer, yet to open his account after facing six deliveries. Stand-in-captain Shakib Al Hasan introduced Mahmudullah in the attack in the 23rd over and the third-change bowler immediately justified his captain's decision taking a smart return catch with his third delivery to send back Dale Richards after being hit for a six off the previous ball. Richards, however, played a very attacking 69 off 80 balls that included 11 boundaries and two sixes. Two balls later, Mahmudullah, who claimed a first five-wicket haul on debut in the second innings of the first Test, then picked up Ryan Hinds (2) in the same fashion with a flat delivery to reduce the hosts to 106-3 in 22.5 overs. Shakib had earlier had opener Omar Philips caught by Tamim Iqbal for 23 though Philips was dropped two balls earlier by Shahadat Hossain at long-on off the same bowler. Without injured pace spearhead Mashrafe Bin Mortaza, new-ball bowlers Shahadat Hossain and Rubel Hossain struggled against the West Indies openers and left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr was brought on the seventh over, but he made little impact conceding 33 runs in nine overs. Left-arm spinner Enamul replaced Mashrafe. The home side, still without their leading players who are on strike, brought in Ryan Hinds, a middle-order batsman and left-arm spinner, to replace spinner Nikita Miller. Bangladesh lead the series 1-0 after winning the first Test at St Vincent by 95 runs on July 13. Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Imrul Kayes, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan (capt), Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah Riyad, Enamul Haque Jr, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain. West Indies: DM Richards, OJ Phillips, TM Dowlin, RO Hinds, FL Reifer (capt), DE Bernard, CAK Walton (wk), DJG Sammy, TL Best, RA Austin, KAJ Roac
