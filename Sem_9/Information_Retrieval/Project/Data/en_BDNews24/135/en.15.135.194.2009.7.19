 Atiar Badda, Morshedur Rahman and Liakat Ali Badal bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  The northern region, following flash floods at the end of June, is now experiencing a drought, with farmers being hit during the crucial Aman crop planting season. There has been no rainfall in Nilphamari, Dinajpur and Rangpur districts in the last two to three weeks, leaving the soil parched, cracked and unsuitable for tilling or planting, while seedlings already planted or prepared for planting are withering. To deal with the situation the agriculture department has asked farmers to irrigate their lands. Although well-off farmers have good recourse to irrigation, poor farmers are struggling to water their lands. Nilphamari has seen no rain for 20 days. The low lying areas of the district went under water during flash floods and heavy rains at the beginning of July that caused serious damage to seedlings that had already been planted. Aman was targeted for 112,300 hectares of farmland in six upazilas but it is now feared that the target will remain unfulfilled. Farmer Sekandar Ali, from Dangapara in Ramnagar union of Sadar Upazila, said he had managed to plant his Aman seedlings before the drought hit but the plants were withering for lack of water. Younus Ali, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture Extension, said low lying land should not be affected even if there was no rain in the coming 15 days. But the higher lands where Aman has already been planted might be severely affected by the drought, he said. Some 46 percent of the district is high land, he said. The department was asking farmers to irrigate lands, Younus said. In Dinajpur, Subhash Chandra Roy, a farmer of Azimpur village in Biral Upazila, said he usually finished Aman plantation by the end of Asharh, the first month of the rainy season. But this year, with Sraban, the second month of the rainy season already starting, he said he could not even prepare the parched soil for planting. Dinajpur DAE deputy director Md Nazrul Islam Mandal said Aman farming was seriously delayed because of the drought. The farmers have been asked to irrigate, he said. He said farmers had started Aman plantation by operating 5,500 shallow and 130 deep tube-well irrigation pumps in 13 upazilas. He said DAE officials were working to boost Aman production after the agriculture minister in a recent meeting directed them to meet the production target at all costs. Rangpur region, comprising eight districts in the north, has an Aman planting target of 1,042,000 hectares. But DAE officials fear only 50 percent of the target may be reached as there has been no rain though seedlings are ready for planting. Shahidullah Sarker, DAE Rangpur zone additional deputy director, told bdnews24.com the situation would get worse if there was no rain within a week. He said the seedlings already prepared would not last if they were not planted. The officials had been asked to encourage the farmers of the eight districts for irrigation, Sarker said. The Rangpur meteorological office said they had recorded just 70 millimetres of rainfall in the last 15 days compared to over 300 mm in the same period last year. bdn
