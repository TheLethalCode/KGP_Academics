 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government will consider the Election Commission's request to amend the law to extend time for political parties to submit their permanent constitutions, if and when the EC makes it, local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said Thursday. The chief election commissioner earlier in the day hinted at requesting for an amendment to electoral laws, after main opposition BNP and eight other parties sought extensions, saying parties should get more time if needed. Ashraf told reporters, "We do not know anything still now on the issue." "The government will consider once the proposal comes, if it comes," he said. "But it is not the government, but parliament that makes laws," he added. Ruling Awami League earlier announced that they would hold their council on July 24, just ahead of the 25 July deadline for submitting permanent party constitutions. The constitution, approved by the council, would be submitted on July 25, said Ashraf, who is also Awami League's spokesperson. The Representation of People Order stipulates that political parties shall submit their permanent constitutions, to be approved through a democratic process such as a national council, within six months of the start of parliament. Thirty-nine political parties were registered ahead of the December elections with draft constitutions. Ashraf said Awami League was holding its council to uphold the democratic process, and added "If BNP does so too, we will welcome it." "Many are saying we are slinging mud. But there is no mudslinging here." Ashraf was speaking to media after a meeting of the AL's council preparation committee at the Awami League president's office. The committee will sit again Saturday,its next meeting to be possibly chaired by party chief and prime minister Sheikh Hasina, he said. Hasina is expected to arrive back in Dhaka on Friday night after attending the 15th NAM summit in Egypt. b
