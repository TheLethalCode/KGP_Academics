<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will watch on Wednesday what has been billed as the last total solar eclipse of this century. Bangladesh Science and Technology Museum assistant curator Sukalyan Bachhar told bdnews24.com on Monday that Bangladesh will have to wait for another 105 years to see another full solar eclipse, on June 2, 2114. The last total solar eclipse was visible on Oct 24, 1995, he said. A solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the sun and the earth, blocking out the sun from the areas in the moon's shadow. Without the sun's light, the sky remains dark and there is a spectacular halo around the moon, which makes it the most followed astronomical shows. The mid line of the solar eclipse will cross the northern region of Bangladesh and the full eclipse will last 3 minutes and 58 seconds. The meteorological directorate said the eclipse, which will start between 6:55am and 7am and end between 9am and 9:05am, and will be visible if the sky is clear. Bangladesh Astronomical Society in partnership with bdnews24.com has arranged full eclipse watching at 24 places of the country. Other organisations are also making arrangements to watch the rare show. The full eclipse will take place between 7:55 am and 8am and the range will be between 83 percent and 100 percent eclipse throughout Bangladesh. The full eclipse will be clearly visible at the north side of Dinajpur and Lalmonirhat and Panchagarh and Thakurgaon. The highest duration of the full eclipse will be 2-3 minutes in the places. Bangladesh Astronomical Society general secretary FR Sarkar told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh has not witnessed such a long eclipse before. The main line of the eclipse will cross four kms north over Panchagarh. In 1980, a full eclipse lasted 45 seconds and in 1995 one minute and 30 seconds. Other places will view the partial eclipse. Dhaka will see 93 percent eclipse, but the fullest will be visible from Panchagarh. The eclipse will travel 15,200 kms from the start to finish. The total eclipse will be visible between 200 and 258 kms from the mid line and the partial eclipse will be visible up to 2000 kms. Apart from Bangladesh the total eclipse will be visible from India, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, southern Japan and the islands of the Pacific Ocean, Sarkar said. The partial eclipse will be visible from northern China, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Mongolia, Russia and Thailand. There are 224 solar eclipses between 2001 and 2100. The total eclipse generally lasts up to seven minutes and three seconds. bd
