 NEW DELHI, Jul 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's weather office has forecast widespread rainfall in most regions in the next five days, calming fears a poor start to the monsoon would damage crops in the country where only 40 percent of the farmland is irrigated. Farm Minister Sharad Pawar said crop sowing had accelerated in the past week as rainfall increased after the worst start to the annual monsoon season in more than 80 years. In rice-growing regions, where farmers sow seeds in a nursery and shift the saplings to fields, transplantation had increased 76 percent in the past week, Pawar told reporters. "There has been substantial improvement in planting as rains have improved in the last one week," he said.

"Sowing is completed only in 33 per cent of the total 3.8 million hectares," A.K. Padhee, Orissa agriculture director, told Reuters. The India Meteorological Department said heavy rains are expected in the next two days in Gujarat, a key cotton and oilseeds producer, and many places in Madhya Pradesh where soybean is being planted. The weather office also predicted rains in parts of Jharkhand, where the local government has said some districts are drought-hit. Rainfall is expected to increase after two days, the weather office said. "Active monsoon condition is likely to continue with the likely formation of a low pressure area over northwest Bay of Bengal," it said in its outlook for July 19-21. "Fairly widespread rainfall activity is likely over west coast, central India, east and northwest India," it said. A weak start to the vital June-September monsoon rains stoked fears of crop failure, encouraging the government to ban wheat exports and prepare contingency plans. But the weather office said on Wednesday that rainfall had improved in the past two days and Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said while the slow progress of monsoons was a concern, the situation was not alar
