 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has returned home after attending the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Egypt. The special flight carrying Hasina and 49 members of her entourage landed Zia International Airport at around 11.30 pm on Friday, an immigration official at the airport told bdnews24.com. The prime minister left Dhaka for Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh on July 14 to attend the 15th NAM summit. The summit gave the prime minister a chance to meet her Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh to let him know about Bangladesh's concern over India's planned construction of the controversial Tipaimukh dam across the common river Barak. Hasina urged Singh not to implement any project that may hurt Bangladesh and sour the friendly relations between the two neighbours, according to the officials who accompanied her. The Indian prime minister told her that his country would not implement any plan that might harm the ties with Bangladesh, added the officials. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, who attended the conference of the NAM foreign ministers preceding the summit, also had talks with Indian state minister for external affairs on the sidelines of the summit. The foreign minister told Shashi Tharoor that India's claimed baseline of its sea boundary was "very aggressive" and urged New Deilhi to "rectify" the same to reach an agreement with Dhaka on sea boundary delimitation. India in May this year submitted a map of its sea boundary to the United Nations making a claim of the Bangladesh waters in the Bay of Bengal, according to foreign ministry officials. The Indian claim will make Bangladesh a sea-locked country. Bangladesh will soon lodge an official protest note to the United Nations over the Indian claim, foreign ministry sources say.
