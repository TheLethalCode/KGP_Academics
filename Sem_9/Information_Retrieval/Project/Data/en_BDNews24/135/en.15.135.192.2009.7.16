 Aminul Islam Khan Rana Sirajganj correspondent Sirajganj, July 16 (bdnews24.com)A member of the probe committee looking into the causes behind the Sirajganj embankment breach has said the Bangladesh Water Development Board does not have proper survey equipment to forecast damage. The probe committee visited the site of the breach at the flood barrier's 'Hard-Point' on Thursday. Afterwards, committee member Prof. Dr. Md Monowar Hossain, of the Bangladesh University of Science and Technology, told a local journalist, "Before hand-over by the Hyundai company in 1997, a 100-ft section of the north part of the 'Hard-Point' suddenly eroded and fell into Jamuna due to scouring holes." "The same thing has happened after 12 years," he said referring to last week's 500-foot breach of Sirajganj town's flood barrier, built by Korean construction giant Hyundai. "It is very hard to properly forecast the Jamuna's behaviour as well as scouring holes as the BWDB does not have equipment for bathymetrical (hydrographic) survey." "We came here today to identify the actual cause of the breached embankment," he added. The committee is headed by Md. Habibur Rahman Zinnah, additional director general-2 of the BWDB, with members Prof Md Monowar Hossain, Emad Uddin Ahmed, executive director of Inland Water Module (IWM) department, Jasim Uddin Ahmed, chief engineer of BWDB design department, the department's executive engineer Md Motahar Hossain and Taslimul Islam, deputy secretary of the water resources ministry. They visited the embankment area in the afternoon and talked to those affected by the erosion of the embankment, to local WDB personnel and workers. WDB's Rajshahi zone chief engineer Md. Sajedul Karim and superintendent engineer Md. Afjzal Hossain briefed the probe team about the sudden erosion of the 'Hard-Point' last Friday, which threatened Sirajganj town. The team also monitored the emergency repair work at the dam. The probe team was formed by the water resources ministry last Monday and asked to submit its findings within 10 working days. A local probe has also been launched. The three-member body is likely to submit its report to the district administration by next Monday.
