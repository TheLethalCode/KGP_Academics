<TEXT>
 Kushtia, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Clashes between the Bangladesh Chhatra League and Islami Chhatra Shibir over control of four halls in Kushtia Islamic University left at least 12 injured on Sunday night, witnesses said. The incident was sparked when activists of the BCL, the ruling party-backed student body, sought to wrest control of the halls from the ICS, a pro-Jamaat-e-Islami student organisation. According to a bdnews24.com correspondent on the spot, the two groups were still locked in a running battle at 11.30pm, two hours after the altercation erupted. Several rounds of gunshots were fired during that time and a small explosive device detonated, said witnesses. Vice-chancellor of the university, Prof M Alauddin, told bdnews24.com that the police had been notified of the situation. bdnew
