 Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh had reached 35 for one at stumps on the first day of the second and final Test against West Indies at St George's, Grenada on Friday. The Tigers lost opener Imrul Kayes in the final 10 overs of play after he put on 26 with Tamim Iqbal who was 14 not out. Nightwatchman Enamul Haque Jr was batting on five. Kayes was caught by the wicketkeeper off Darren Sammy for 14. Bangladesh lead the two-Test series 1-0 after winning the St Vincent Test by 95 runs. Earlier, West Indies were all out for 237 in their first innings. Travis Dowlin was the last wicket to fall when the West Indies number three fell five runs short of a well-deserved hundred after being caught by Tamim Iqbal off Shakib Al Hasan. Dowlin's 162-ball knock, which contained seven fours and a six, held the home side together as wickets fell at regular intervals. The second-string West Indies outfit, put into bat by stand-in skipper Shakib, at one stage had slumped to 160-7 before a stubborn eighth-wicket stand of 59 runs between Dowlin and Ryan Austin pulled the hosts towards a respectable total. Pacer Shahadat Hossain broke the partnership when he forced the lower-batsman Austin (19) back on to his stumps. Tino Best lasted just four balls before being clean bowled without scoring by left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr to leave West Indies 220-9. Kemar Roach was not out on four. Mahmudullah, Shakib and Enamul took three wickets
