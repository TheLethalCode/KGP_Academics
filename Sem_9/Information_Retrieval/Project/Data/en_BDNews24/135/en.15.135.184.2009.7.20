<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Monday halted the proceedings of the graft cases filed against former BNP MPs Mosaddek Ali Falu and M A Hashem. A two-member bench also ruled upon the government to explain why the cases involving illegal wealth acquisition and concealing the information of the same should not be scrapped. Justices Syed Md Dastgir Hossain and Md Raisuddin gave the orders on appeals for cancellation of the cases by Falu and Hashem, also the Partex Group chief. Both are now out on bail in the cases. The defendants were represented by advocate Ahsanul Karim. The Anticorruption Commission in 2007 charged them with accumulating wealth beyond known income and hiding information about the assets. bdne
