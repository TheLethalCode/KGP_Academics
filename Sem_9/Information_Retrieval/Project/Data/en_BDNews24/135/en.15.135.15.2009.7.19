<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has granted former Awami League MP Joynal Hazari bail in an illegal wealth case. "Hazari will be freed from jail after he secures bail in one more case," his lawyer Enayetullah Chowdhury told reporters Sunday. In Nov 2008, a special court sentenced Hazari, in his absence, to 10 years imprisonment and fined him Tk 500,000 for amassing wealth beyond his known sources of income and failing to provide a full account of his assets in a wealth statement to the ACC. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Feni police in Oct 2007. Hazari, facing more than one corruption case, was sent to jail on May 15 this year after he finally surrendered to authorities.
