 Natore, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Unknown attackers killed college lecturer Arifur Rahman, 35, at a Natore village on Saturday when he tried to stop them from taking his motorcycle, police said Sunday. Two of the victim's companions have since been implicated in the murder, Anwar Hossain, Barhaigram police chief, told bdnews24.com. Hossain said a group of men had stopped Arif, a lecturer of Begum Khaleda Zia College in Natore, at around 10:30pm near Ramagarhi on the Lalpur-Banparha highway as he was on his way home carrying two companions on his motorcycle. As the hijackers tried to snatch the motorcycle, the teacher resisted. The attackers stabbed and killed Arif on the spot, said Hossain. Arif's body was sent to Natore Sadar Hospital Sunday morning. The two companions, identified as Mithu, 34, and Bidyut, 35, also apparently injured were given first aid at Banparha Patwary Hospital, said the police chief. However, police later arrested them on suspicion of being involved in the killing. Hossain said Arif's uncle Lutfar Rahman filed a murder case with Barhaigram police, accusing Mithu and Bidyut. The first information report stated that the killing may have been in sequel to disputes over money transactions between the accused and the murder victim. bdne
