 SHARM EL-SHEIKH, Egypt, Jul 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India and Pakistan said on Thursday they had agreed to continue dialogue and would not to link action on fighting terrorism to that process, after their prime ministers met in Egypt. Pakistan Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also ordered senior diplomats to meet as often as needed to improve relations. Thursday's meeting in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh was the third high-level encounter between the two neighbours since last year's Mumbai attacks derailed any rapprochement. "Both prime ministers recognised that dialogue is the only way forward. Action on terrorism should not be linked to the composite dialogue process," a joint statement said after the meeting on the fringes of a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. The premiers also "affirmed their resolve to fight terrorism and to cooperate with each other to this end." Analysts said the statement gave both sides something to take home, partly by keeping open the nature of future dialogue.

Pakistan has been keen to revive a five-year-old "composite dialogue" to cover all disputes between the two. India has said Pakistan must crack down on Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group blamed for the Mumbai assault, as well as tackle other militant groups that have launched attacks elsewhere "Prime Minister Singh said that India was ready to discuss all issues with Pakistan, including all outstanding issues," the statement said. Gilani pledged Pakistan "will do everything in its power" to bring the perpetrators of Mumbai to justice, the statement said. It added that both foreign secretaries, India's Shivshankar Menon and Pakistan's Salman Bashir, "should meet as often as necessary and report to the two foreign ministers." The two senior diplomats who held two rounds of talks in Egypt this week prior to Thursday's meeting of premiers. In Islamabad, the Supreme Court adjourned for two weeks an appeal hearing by the government challenging the release of Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group. Saeed became head of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa charity, regarded as a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba.
