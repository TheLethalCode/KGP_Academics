 LONDON, July 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Rain and two obdurate left-handers frustrated England's bowlers in the afternoon session of the second Ashes Test against Australia at Lord's on Friday. At tea, Australia were 87 for two in reply to England's first innings 425 with Simon Katich (40) and Michael Hussey (37) at the crease.

Katich and Hussey batted cautiously after lunch against Anderson, who took two for 21 in his opening 10-over spell.
