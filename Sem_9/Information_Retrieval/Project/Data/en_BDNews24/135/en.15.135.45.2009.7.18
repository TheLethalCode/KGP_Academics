<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 18 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has urged India to cancel its planned Tipaimukh dam project, in the wake of talks between prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh during the NAM summit in Egypt earlier in the week. Khaleda, addressing a BNP programme on the Tipaimukh project on Saturday, praised Singh's assurance to Hasina that his country would do nothing to harm Bangladesh. She said the Indian government must, therefore, halt the proposed dam on the strength of Singh's assurance. Khaleda also said the Bangladesh government should not "bow down" to India on this matter. India assures Bangladesh Prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh held their first bilateral talks last Wednesday on the sidelines of the two-day Non-Aligned Movement summit in Sharm-el-Sheikh. The first meeting between Hasina, who returned to power in January this year, and Singh, in his second stint in office, touched on India's planned Tipaimukh Dam and concerns about its impact in Bangladesh. During the meeting, Hasina expressed the hope that all contentious issues, including the dam, would be resolved through dialogue with India. Singh gave assurances to Hasina that India would not do anything that would be against Bangladesh's interests. Meanwhile, a Bangladeshi parliamentary delegation, selected to inspect the planned Tipaimukh dam site, will depart for India on July 29. bdnew
