 Aminul Islam Khan Rana bdnews24.com Sirajganj correspondent Sirajganj, July 18 (bdnews24.com)A top government official said Saturday the current technology for bathymetrical, or hydrographic, surveys was inadequate to deal with the Jamuna, known as one of the world's most unpredictable rivers. "We have to understand the laws of nature first. The Jamuna is one of the most unpredictable rivers in the world and it will not follow our commands," said Md Wahiduzzaman, secretary of the water resources ministry. He was speaking just a day after the Sirajganj flood barrier's Hard-Point was heavily breached for a second time in just over a week. A high-level Bangladesh Water Development Board team, headed by Wahiduzzaman, visited the breached stretch of the Sirajganj Town Protection Embankment on Saturday. "The technology we have at present. for bathymetrical surveys, is not sufficient for the Jamuna river," Wahiduzzaman told reporters at the site. "Not just us, but nobody in this world has the technology for the proper assessment of such havoc caused by the Jamuna," he claimed. "We have not seen such a situation within the last ten years," he added. DWDB director general Md. Abul Kalam Azad, also at the site, said, "We cannot really say the reasons behind the sudden erosion two times within a week at the Sirajganj Embankment Hard-Point." "In the mean time a probe-team has already been formed and we will be able to disclose the reasons after their reports." The raging river opened a 500-foot breach along the embankment's Hard-Point on Friday, 2km east from Sirajganj town, causing locals to panic. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen visited the affected area Friday night and asked for a report after sending divers underwater. A team of 11 Bangladesh Navy divers searched underwater to find the reason behind the repeat breach. Lt Arirul Islam, head of the team, told reporters on Saturday that there were scouring-holes in the south part of the dyke that might threaten the rest of the embankment. On July 10, too, the rain-fed river started eating into a 600-foot stretch along the 'Hard-Point' at Shashan Goila Ghat. The 2.5 km long Sirajganj Town Flood Protection Embankment Hard-Point was constructed between 1995-1999 by Korean construction giant Hyundai with a 100-year guarantee. The government formed an investigation committee immediately after the first breach. A member of the probe committee has also said the Bangladesh Water Development Board does not have proper survey equipment to deal with breach risks. The executive engineer of Sirajganj Water Development Board's BRE (Brahmaputra Right Embankment) department has already been relieved of active duty in the wake of the first breach. Meanwhile. a 38-metre stretch of the Jamuna embankment's spurs collapsed on Friday at Sariakandi Upazila in Bogra, said WDB officials.
