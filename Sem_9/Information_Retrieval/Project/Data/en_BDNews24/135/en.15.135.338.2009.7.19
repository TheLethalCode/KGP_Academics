<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Briton Amir Khan was crowned World Boxing Association (WBA) light-welterweight champion at the age of 22 on Saturday after convincingly beating Ukraine's Andreas Kotelnik with a unanimous points decision in Manchester. Khan, who won Olympic silver at lightweight as a 17-year-old in Athens in 2004, was relentlessly on the attack all night in a performance of great confidence that relieved Kotelnik of the title in the 31-year-old's third defence.

The world title had looked some distance away when Khan's upwards progress was knocked off course last September when he was knocked out by Colombian Breidis Prescott, his only professional defeat in 21 fights, in the same ring. He restored some confidence with victory over Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera this year and, having moved up a division, has finally delivered on all the promise he showed as an amateur. "I listened to him (trainer Roach) and just listening to (Roach's Filipino multi-world champion) Manny Pacquiao, he took me to a different level," said Khan. "I took a few shots but I didn't rush.
