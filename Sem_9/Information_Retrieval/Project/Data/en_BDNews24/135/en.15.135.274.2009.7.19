<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The head of a parliamentary team that will visit the Tipaimukh dam site on July 29 has urged opposition chief Khaleda Zia to nominate two of her MPs for the 10-member team. Abdur Razzaq, also chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on water resources ministry, at a press conference on Sunday alleged that Khaleda's press conference on Saturday was "politically motivated" to mislead people about the controversial issue. Razzaq, a former water resources minister, held his own press conference to counter Khaleda's. "We have seen the pro-Indian attitude (of the BNP) while in power but an anti-Indian stance when in opposition." He said the BNP government in 1978, 2003 and 2005 did not oppose the construction of the dam at the meetings of the Joint Rivers Commission. "The so-called water expert ANH Akhter Hossain told the press conference that he did not have idea about the Tipaimukh dam. "He also said that he got the data presented at the press conference from the internet. "So, we can assume that their statement (against the dam) was based only on ideas and politically motivated. "The conference was called to mislead people," Razzaq told reporters at parliament media centre. He said the BNP's water experts present at the press conference were "politically biased". He claimed that he had minutes of the JRC meetings in 1978, 2003 and 2005. "At the JRC meetings of 2003 and 20905, they only wanted assurance from the India that it would not divert waters for irrigation. And India assured them of no withdrawal of waters from Barak river," said Razzaq. "They did not object to the construction of the dam," he said. He said the 1996-2001 Awami League government did not discuss the construction of the Tipaimukh dam at the JRC meetings. "Why should we table the issue at the meeting while India did not raise the Tipaimukh dam issue? 'Friendly relations required' Razzaq stressed the need for building friendly relations with India to resolve water-related problems. "Many people have been referring to international laws. Actually, international laws and conventions on water are mainly laws of cooperation. "Benefits come if bilateral cooperation exists. Otherwise, you face harm," said Razzaq. He made it clear the Awami League government had not yet fixed its position on the planned Tipaimukh dam over the common river Barakthe lifeline of Bangladesh's Surma and Kushiara rivers. The two rivers provides waters to hundreds of water bodies in the greater Sylhet region. Millions of people depend on the water bodies for their livelihood. Environmentalists have raised concerns over the dam, which, they say, would dry up the downstream water bodies causing ecological disaster in the greater Sylhet region. New Delhi proposed the Bangladesh government send a parliamentary team to the proposed site to allay Dhaka's concerns over the project. The parliamentary body has fixed a 10-member team, headed by Abdur Razzaq, without yet including MPs from the main opposition the BNP. They are Jatiya Party's ABM Ruhul Amin Hawlader MP, Abdur Rahman MP (AL), A K M Fazlul Haq MP (AL), ABM Anwarul Haq MP (AL), Hamidur Rahman Azad MP (Bangladesh Jaamat-e-Islami), Prof Monwar Hossain of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), Sajjad Hossain of the Bangladesh-India Joint Rivers Commission, the water resources secretary and a director general of the foreign ministry. "If the BNP nominates two MPs, we will make it a 12-member team instead of 10," said Razzaq. India says the Tipaimukh dam is a hydroelectricity project and there would be no diversion of waters. It would help both Bangladesh and India to control floods, says New Delhi. bdn
