 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)The opposition BNP on Sunday wrote to the Election Commission seeking time until January 31 to submit a permanent constitution. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said the EC would discuss the matter of extending the deadline, including amendment of electoral law, with the government. He said, at the same time, other necessary amendments to the Representation of the People Order would also be raised. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed earlier submitted the letter, signed by the party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, to the EC secretariat. The BNP has sought until Jan 25 to submit the final constitution to the Election Commission, after approval through a party council. The deadline for submission is July 25. No political party has submitted their permanent constitutions yet, but Awami League, Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami have said they were preparing to do so by the deadline. Rizvi told reporters, "We have asked for an extension up to January 31. Earlier on July 16 in a meeting with BNP representatives the chief election commissioner and two other commissioners spoke positively on the issue." "We need the time to form committees from the grassroots to national levels," said Ahmed, who was the delegation that was led by BNP vice-president MK Anwar to the meeting on July 16. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had said after the meeting with the BNP that they would ask the government to change the electoral law to give parties more time. He added that parties should get more time, if needed. Ruling Awami League spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam had said that the government will consider the Election Commission's request to amend the law, if and when the EC made it. The Awami League had decided seek a deadline extension but later declared that it would hold the national council on July 24. Officials at the Election Commission Secretariat said, of the 39 provisionally registered parties, 11 along with the BNP have already requested for the extension to hold party council and approving permanent constitution. New electoral law stipulates political parties submit their permanent constitutions by July 25 for mandatory registration with the EC. bdnew
