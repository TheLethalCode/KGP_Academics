 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Sunday that the Election Commission will consider the legal implications before deciding whether to cancel BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury's parliamentary membership. He said the final decision would be made in the next month. "He is just one of many MPs and Upazila chairmen we have received complaints about both before and after elections," said Huda. "We have many other cases to consider too." In June, the EC wrote to speaker Abdul Hamid recommending cancellation of Chowdhury's Chittagong-2 parliamentary seat for providing false information in his nomination papers prior to the December national polls. Later that month, however, Hamid told reporters that any decision regarding Chowdhury's House membership fell within the EC's purview. "We'll make a decision on this matter after thoroughly considering the legal aspects of the matter," Huda told reporters at the EC Secretariat on Monday. Chowdhury had earlier told bdnews24.com by phone from Singapore on June 16, that he had not provided any false information in his nomination affidavit regarding his educational credentials. The EC has alleged that Chowdhury, in his affidavit submitted prior to the 2008 polls, stated he had no educational credentials, which did not match information he had supplied for previous parliamentary records. The parliament secretariat had pointed the EC to Chowdhury's biographical details lodged with the parliament library. He was an MP during the second, seventh and eighth parliaments. An affidavit submitted by Chowdhury ahead of the second parliamentary elections stated he passed his SSC from St Placid's School in Chittagong, his HSC from Notre Dame College and took his degree from Punjab University. The parliamentary documents also say that Chowdhury returned to Bangladesh following his father's death, leaving his law studies incomplete at Lincoln's Inn, London. Other documentation lodged with the parliament shows he completed his matriculation from Sadiq's School in the Punjab. bdnew
