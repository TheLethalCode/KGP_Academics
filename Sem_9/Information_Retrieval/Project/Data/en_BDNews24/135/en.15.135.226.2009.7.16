 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee will investigate corruption charges in the Dhaka City Corporation under mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka on receiving them at the Nagar Bhaban. Ruling Awami League MP Monwar Hossain Chowdhury will head the all-party probe body formed by the parliamentary standing committee on local government ministry on July 1. The five-member investigating body will examine the corruption charges lodged by the people affected, Chowdhury told reporters after the sub-committee meeting on Thursday at parliament building. The military-installed caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, after the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11, 2007, set up an office, headed by an army official, at Dhaka City Corporation headquarters to receive corruption charges against the city authorities. "We have decided to set up the office as huge numbers of corruption charges have been coming in to the probe body," Chowdhury told reporters. The committee would submit its findings in three months, he said. "We will investigate the tender syndicate, the process of appointing contractors, manipulation in the use of vehicles, lease of cattle markets, appointment, posting and promotion of city corporation officials and staff during the last seven years," the probe body chief said. "We have decided to set up a small office at the city corporation building to save time on our movement, otherwise traffic jam will eat up our working hours," he said. Khoka, a BNP leader who was directly elected for a five-year term, has been the mayor since March 2002. The Election Commission is planning to hold the long overdue polls to the city corporation this December. "We have formed the sub-committee to make the city corporation free from corruption," Rahmat Ali, chairman of the standing committee, told bdnews24.com on Thursday after the meeting. The probe report will be placed before the standing committee which will make final recommendations on the corrupt practices, if proved. The main opposition BNP's Abul Khayer Bhuiyan, Jatiya Party MP A K M Mostafizur Rahman and Awami League's Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin and Ali Ahsraf Khan Khasru are the members of the probe body.
