Anisul Islam Mahmud, chairman of the parliamentary committee on expatriates welfare and overseas employment ministry, told reporters on Thursday after a meeting, that since there was no Bangladesh mission in Mauritius, the Kenyan embassy covers Mauritius as well. The recession-hit African country decided to send back home Bangladeshi workers to save locals' job in the textile sector. Some 6,000 male Bangladeshi workers, 4,000 of whom work in clothing factories, have been ordered to leave within six months, according to union leaders on the palm-fringed island of 1.3 million people. Mahmud, a former foreign minister in the Ershad administration, asked people not to be lured into paying brokers money to go to Romania. He said a quarter was spreading the word that there were job opportunities for thousands of Bangladeshi workers in the east European country. "But, that is not right," Mahmud said.
