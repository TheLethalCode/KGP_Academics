<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16, 2009 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will ask the government to change the electoral law to give parties more time to submit permanent constitution for registration, the top election official has said. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Thursday said parties should get more time, if needed. His comments came after the BNP earlier in the day sought until Jan 25 to file the final constitution. Huda told reporters after a meeting with a BNP delegation that the issue would be decided by the government whether an amendment would be made by an ordinance, during parliament's recess, or some other way. "The commission believes it takes time to bring real reforms within political parties." "Some parties are finding they are not able to finalise their constitutions by the stipulated time. The BNP has said they will apply for a time extension," said Huda. "The Election Commission will take this into consideration positively to make a decision before the deadline (next Sunday)." He was speaking to reporters after a meeting with a three-member delegation, led by BNP vice president MK Anwar. Replying to another query, he said, "Eight more political parties have already applied to seeking time extension." BNP vice chairman MK Anwar also spoke to reporters after the meeting. He said, "We don't want to hold any council just for the sake of holding it. The BNP wants to bring changes at every level. That process has already started." "We have sought six months more to amend the party in line with the registration law of the Election Commission." He also said the Election Commission had been positive and would consider the request after getting a written application. bdnews
