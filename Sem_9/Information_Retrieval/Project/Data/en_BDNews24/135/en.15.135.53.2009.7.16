<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)Real estate developers have asked the government to relieve them from the task of collecting VAT from the brick, sand and construction material businessmen. A team headed by Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh president Tanvirul Huq Probal met with finance minister A M A Muhith at his office on Thursday and sought his intervention on the issue. Muhith said, "We have heard from them but we did not decide anything. The government will make a decision after assessment." On Bangladesh Bank's letter asking banks to inform it of their investment volume in the stock market, the minister said, "The Bangladesh Bank could issue such letter to maintain financial regularity within the banks. It is their internal affairs and the ministry has nothing to say about that." Probal said every REHAB member deposited the VAT levied on them and that there were no dues. "But the National Board of Revenue has given us the responsibility to collect VAT from the brick, sand and construction material businessmen." "It put an extra pressure on REHAB. That's why REHAB informed the finance minister about its inability to collect VAT. Now the finance ministry will take care of it," Probal added. Asked about the increased flat price after the scope offered in the budget to legalise black money, he said that REHAB did not raise the flat price; it went up rather on increased construction material prices in some place. bd
