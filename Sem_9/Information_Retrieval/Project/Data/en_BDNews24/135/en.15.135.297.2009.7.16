<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 16 (bdnews24.com)The least developed countries (LDCs) like Bangladesh should "rethink the role of the State" and shift their focus to "development governance", says a United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report. It says that there is a need to in promoting economic development for LDCs. 'The LDC Report 2009: The State and Development Governance' was launched worldwide on Thursday. Private research NGO Centre for Policy Dialogue released the report in Dhaka. CPD additional director Fahmida Khatun briefed the media on the key findings of the report and where Bangladesh stood. The global economic crisis has impaired strong GDP growth of LDCs during 2002-2008, according to the study. It suggests a shift from the good governance institutional reform agenda to a good development governance to compensate. However, it would be only possible if the politicians and bureaucrats are 'developmentally-oriented', added the study. On the crucial issue of food security, the UNCTAD report suggests a raise in investments in agriculture. It urges LDC governments to take steps leading to better crop yields, more local support fro farmers, more security for farmers' rights to land and better regional links that can boost agricultural markets. UNCTAD predicts Bangladesh would come out from the LDC status in 2024. CPD's distinguished fellow Debapriya Bhattacharya however, differed. "It's possible for Bangladesh to come out by 2015, if the polices are reformed as suggested in the reports and institutional capacities are raised," he told reporters at the launch. Only two countries, Botswana and Cape Verde, have graduated from the category since its establishment in 1971. Eqautorial Guinea, Samoa and Maldives are expected come out from the status by January 2011. The document points that Bangladesh along with 6 other LDCs does not prioritise governance in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.
