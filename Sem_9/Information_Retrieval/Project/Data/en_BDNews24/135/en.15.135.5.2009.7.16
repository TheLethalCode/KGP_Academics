<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh will have to select its second venue for the 2011 ICC World Cup in two and a half months as the venue and pitch monitoring committee of the Central Organising Committee (COC) will start to inspect all the venues in October. "Only India have finalised its eight venues to host the World Cup matches while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are yet to confirm their respective three and two venues and they have to finalise it before October," said BCB senior vice-president Mahbub Anam on Thursday. Anam, the convenor of COC, said that venue and pitch monitoring committee would start inspecting all 13 venues selected for hosting 49 matches of the World Cup in the first week of October and continue to inspect in each quarter. Anam attended Tuesday's COC meeting in Mumbai and let the reporters knew about the outcomes of the meeting at a press conference at the BCB office in Mirpur. The next COC meeting would be held in Bangladesh in September, informed Anam. Meanwhile, Bangladesh Cricket Board had earlier decided that the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium (SBNS) and Narayanganj Osmani Stadium (NOS) would host Bangladesh's eight matches while the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS) would only stage the opening ceremony on Feb 18, 2011. The BCB director said that the board would select the venues in consultation with the government. The meeting with the presence of representatives from Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka was called to provide the International Cricket Council (ICC) with a recommendation as to where, within Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, the 14 matches originally allocated to Pakistan should be staged and where the tournament secretariat would be based. The ICC agreed in April that those matches could not take place in Pakistan because of the uncertainty surrounding the security situation within the country and that the tournament secretariat should not be in Lahore, as originally planned. The COC recommended that of the 49 WC matches, 29 will be played in India, 12 in Sri Lanka and eight in Bangladesh and the 14 matches originally scheduled to take place in Pakistan were redistributed with eight going to India, four to Sri Lanka and two to Bangladesh. Anam informed that the host nations would not get no match fees to host the additional 14 matches redistributed among India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, but they would be given other benefits to arrange those matches. Meanwhile, Bangladesh would host six group matches and two quarter-finals. Anam said that grouping and the fixtures of the 14-nation meet have yet to confirm and it would take place soon after the ICC revealed the latest ranking of the participants. The meeting also formed three subcommittees -- security, venue and pitch inspection and operational planning -- and asked the respective countries to form a Local Organising Committee by this month. bd
