<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)Top terror Bikash Kumar Biswas, facing a raft of murder, abduction and extortion charges, was released on bail Thursday, after serving 12 years in a Kashimpur jail, a jail official said. Kashimpur Jail-2 official Forman Ali told bdnews24.com, "Bikash was released in the evening as he secured bail in cases against him." Bikash and his brother Prokash Kumar Biswas were two of the four most wanted criminals on a list of Dhaka Metropolitan Police during the last term of the Awami League government. The two brothers led a notorious criminal network known as the 'Prokash-Bikash gang'. Bikash was arrested by DMP's Detective Branch in 1997, accused in the murder of a Chhatra League leader and a double murder in Agargaon, as well as extortion and abduction cases. Many have alleged that Bikash continued his activities, and continued to lead his crime gang based in Dhaka's Mirpur area, even while he was in jail. bdnews
