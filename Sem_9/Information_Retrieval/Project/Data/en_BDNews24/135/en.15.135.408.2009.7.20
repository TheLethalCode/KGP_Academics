 Dhaka, July 20 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre has reverted to its original name, the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, a government statement said on Monday. The conference centre was built and inaugurated during the Awami League's second term in office from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, under the BNP's subsequent administration, the then foreign ministry made the name change. Earlier, on Sunday, a parliamentary committee had recommended reverting the conference centre's name to its original in honour of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, independence leader and father of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, known as Bangabandhu. Monday's statement said the housing and public works ministry had circulated an official order regarding the name change. Situated at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital, the conference centre is one of the world's largest and was constructed with technical and financial assistance from China. It was originally intended to house the 13th summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. b
