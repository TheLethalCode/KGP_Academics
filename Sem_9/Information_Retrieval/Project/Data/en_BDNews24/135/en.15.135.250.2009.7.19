<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)  Taiwan has eased restrictions on visa applications for businessmen from Bangladesh, China's Central News Agency reported on Sunday. "After review, we have decided to ease the restrictions on business applicants from Iran, Iraq and Bangladesh," said Lo Yu-chung, director-general of Taiwan's Bureau of Consular Affairs. The relaxation is aimed at promoting Taiwan's trade and economic exchanges with Middle East and developing countries, Lo told the Taiwan-based news agency. Under the new rules, business visitors will no longer need a guarantee from a Taiwanese company and can submit their visa applications with any of Taiwan's overseas representative offices, said CNA. Taiwan began imposing strict visa restrictions from 2003 on 19 countries, including Pakistan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Iraq, Iran and Bangladesh, because the numbers of visitors from those countries who overstayed their visas or committed crimes while in Taiwan were relatively high. Under the stricter regulations, applicants had first to obtain a guarantee by a Taiwanese company and were required to file visa applications with designated Taiwan embassies or representative offices
