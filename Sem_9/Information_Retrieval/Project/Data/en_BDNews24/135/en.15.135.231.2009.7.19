<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 19 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed has suggested that the Dhaka Stock Exchange and stock market regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission submit a proposal on an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) system to quickly resolve business disputes. "I told them to submit a proposal through the ministry to launch the ADR system. The ministry will decide after having the proposal in hand," he told reporters after meeting with a team of the two organisations at his office on Sunday. SEC president Ziaul Huq Khondkar and DSE president Rakibur Rahman explained different aspects of these cases and asked for the minister's assistance. The minister said dividends cannot be declared due to conflicts among the directors of some companies, affecting the investors. Around 230 cases are still pending with the higher court. Questioned if the government could form a special bench at the High Court to resolve business disputes, Ahmed said, "The chief justice holds the jurisdiction to form a bench." "I guess he would take steps on being informed about the matter in the media," he added. State minister for law Kamrul Islam and law secretary Kazi Habibul Awwal were also present in the meeting. bd
