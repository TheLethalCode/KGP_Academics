<TITLE> Old city fire highlights risks to thousands </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 16 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of thousands of residents of old Dhaka, the most densely populated area of the city, live daily amid deadly fire risks from the teeming factories and workshops that line the streets of Lalbagh, Armanitola and Nayabazar. Most of the small industries and machine shops, crammed full of hazardous chemicals, inflammable materials, unprotected fire sources and faulty gas and electric lines, operate out of the street-level floors of residential buildings, and open straight on to crowded lanes and alleys. Unsurprisingly, at least ten major fire tragedies in old Dhaka have made the headlines in the past year. Ten people died in a blaze originating from a chemical shop on the ground floor at a house in Aga Sadek Road on the night of August 3 last year. Thirty buildings were gutted in a raging inferno that spread from a shoe factory in east Islambagh on Dec 4 last year. On Thursday, at least fifteen people were seriously injured as a factory, making plastic soles for shoes, on the ground floor of a five-storey residential building caught fire at Islambagh, in the Lalbagh area. Dilip Kumar Ghosh, deputy assistant director of the Fire Service and Civil Defence's Dhaka Southern Zone, has been working the old city area for seven years. He told bdnews24.com the risk of lethal fires has increased in that time as more and more makeshift factories set up shop in the crowded residential areas. "In the old part of the city, fire risks at Lalbagh, Armanitola, Nayabazar and Bakshibazar are the highest, and likely to be the most lethal," said Dilip. He said fire service trucks, with water, hoses, ladders and other necessary rescue equipment, have no hope of reaching fires in the narrow lanes of the old city. "The buildings in the area are tightly packed. Entry and exit ways of the houses are narrow and the ventilation system is congested." In consequences fire accidents are frequently lethal, he said. "People living above plastic factories or chemical shops, that create toxic smoke if there is a fire, are at high risk because of poor ventilation." Thursday's plastic factory fire saw dozens of residents, trying to escape the Islambagh building, passing out in their homes or on the stairs as they breathed in the lethal fumes. Rescue workers carried them to the roof of the adjacent building, as the blaze blocked the exit on the ground floor of their building. Shahin Aktar, sales representative of a medicine company, and a resident of Islambagh, told bdnews24.com most of the electric and gas connections in the area are illegal. "It raises the risk of fires." Dilip Kumar Ghosh, highlighting another problem, said requests to locals to stop setting up factories and workshops in residential buildings goes in vain. A house owner in the Lalbagh area said, "We get higher rent for letting out space for factories." "Besides, most of the people in this area are businessmen or related with business, looking for factory space." "And in most cases there is no way to rent ground floors for residential use in place of factories," he said. bdn
