 Mushtaq Ahmed bdnews24.com education affairs correspondent Dhaka, July 17 (bdnews24.com)The new education policy formulation committee is going to recommend the formation of a permanent autonomous national education commission. The recommendation has been incorporated in the Draft National Education Policy 2009, which has taken into account the Education Policy 2000 and other education commission reports including that of Kudrat-e-Khuda Education Commission. "The report will be submitted next month," said Dr Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed, co-chairman of the committee to bdnews24.com. "The education policy should be an apposite and need-based instrument as the future national human resource development plans will be guided by it," said Kazi Saleh Ahmed, former vice-chancellor of Jahangirnagar University, a few days ago. "The proposed commission will determine what changes, refurbishing and expansions our education needs at the primary, secondary and university levels," he said. None of the suggestions or policies of the nine education commissions commissioned since independence has been possible to implement to date. The permanent education commission will act as an advisory committee to the education ministry and to the University Grants Commission in implementing the national education policy. It will also help reform the education policy in tune with changes in the national and international arenas. Monitoring proper implementation of the education policy at different levels of education, presenting annual reports to the government and to the national parliament, making timely amendments to the policy and forwarding necessary suggestions will be among other responsibilities of this committee. The commission will comprise highly qualified teachers, educationists, administrators and representatives of the people who will work either full time or part time discharging their responsibilities. In addition, it will have an independent secretariat and funding sources. The Moniruzzaman Mia Education Commission 2003, formed during the 2001-2006 BNP-led coalition government, had also suggested a permanent education commission. On April 8, education minister Nurul Islam Nahid formally declared the constitution of the new policy formulation committee led by National Professor Kabir Chowdhury. The committee consists of 16 members including writer and science professor Muhammad Zafar Iqbal and Kholiquzzaman, also president of Bangladesh Economic Association . Later two other members were included. The committee has prepared the draft report after meeting through a few sessions. bdne
