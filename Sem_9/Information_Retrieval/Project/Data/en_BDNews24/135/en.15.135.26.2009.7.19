<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 19 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh government has sought financial assistance totalling $1.149 billion from donors and development partners for rehabilitation and development programmes in Aila-affected areas in southern districts. Cyclone Aila hit southern Bangladesh on May 25 this year, killing 190 people. Aila was the most damaging cyclone since Sidr, which devastated the same region when it struck on Nov 15, 2007, with an eventual death toll of 3,406. The government's call for financial support came Sunday when foreign minister Dipu Moni and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq met with representatives of 45 donor agencies, NGOs and diplomats, including US ambassador James F Moriarty and British high commissioner Stephen Evans. "The donors did not immediately promise any assistance," Abdur Razzaq told reporters after the meeting, adding that they would place the issue before the respective governments. The break-up of the $1,149 million includes $435 million for constructing cluster homes for landless people, $381 million for reconstruction of destroyed houses, $12 million for constructing new houses, $62 million for repairing flood protection embankments, $200 million for constructing more cyclone shelter centres and $3 million for supply of pure drinking water. This assistance will be needed within the next six months, said the ministers. In the meeting, the disaster management bureau also presented a strategic paper outlining a number of short, medium and long term programmes to protect vulnerable areas from future natural disaster. "We've sought financial and logistic support for the implementation of these programmes, as our country faces most losses through natural calamities," Abdur Razzaq said. Dipu Moni said Bangladesh would also place its concerns over global warming and rising sea levels at the UN climate summit in Copenhagen in December and at other forums to seek assistance in fighting the adverse environmental and developmental impacts of climate change. FAO, one of the development partners present at the meeting, said it had been continuing its work for Aila victims. FAO country chief Ad Spijkers said they were providing 50 tonnes of saline tolerant boro rice seeds (BRRI 47) among Aila affected farmers of the southern districts through the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in the coming winter season. Spijkers also mentioned that FAO was processing a Technical Cooperation Project (TCP) to be implemented through the agriculture ministry for an Aila Rehabilitation Programme to serve 15,000 households in the most affected coastal districts. bdnews
