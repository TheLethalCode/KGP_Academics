<TITLE> UK should hold troop levels in Afghanistan: general </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Jul 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain should maintain its current troops levels in Afghanistan and may need to deploy more soldiers for up to 18 months until the Afghan army can take on greater responsibility, the head of the army said on Friday. Britain has increased its troop levels to about 9,000 soldiers this year in Afghanistan to improve security ahead of a presidential election on Aug. 20. There are plans to cut that level back to 8,300 once the election is over. "It will be the right thing in the short term for us to stay at 9,000 -- down to 8,300 would be wrong militarily, I am quite clear about that, and as a member of the Chiefs of Staff Committee I couldn't sign up to that now," General Richard Dannatt told BBC radio in Afghanistan. The deaths of eight soldiers in Afghanistan in one day last week took Britain's total losses in that campaign above the 179 suffered in the Iraq invasion and occupation. That shocked the public and raised questions over whether Britain had enough soldiers on the ground and the right equipment for the job -- and even if British troops should be there at all. Prime Minister Gordon Brown says the presence in Afghanistan is vital to prevent militants linked to the Taliban and al Qaeda from exporting terrorism to the streets of Britain. Brown has also urged Afghanistan to do far more to make its troops available on the ground if a U.S.-British offensive to secure territory in the south ahead of elections is to succeed. HELICOPTER VIEWS The Labour government, trailing in opinion polls and facing a general election within a year, says it is sending more helicopters and hardier vehicles to Afghanistan and will keep troop levels under review. A powerful parliamentary committee said on Thursday that a shortage of helicopters was hurting British operations in Afghanistan, adding to pressure on the government to increase resources in the war zone. "There may well be a case for a short-term uplift. Our government will have to confront it, if asked, for about 12-18 months until the Afghan army can get the right strength out here," said Dannatt, who steps down at the end of next month. Dannatt, who plans to present a "shopping list" to government on his return to London, said the Ministry of Defence may have to reorganise its finances to make sure enough money was flowing to the Afghanistan campaign. The MoD has a budget of about 35 billion pounds ($57.4 billion) each year. "There is a strong case to say if this is so important, and there is not going to be additional money from the Treasury, then we will have to re-order -- yet again -- some of our internal priorities," he said. "And that latter point will not be welcome at the Ministry of Defence, but it's the right thing to do -- shifting between the maritime, the air, the land environment, shifting between other areas of spending. We just may have to do it." The government says spending to support the Afghan campaign has risen to over 3 billion pounds this year from 700 million pounds in 2006/2007. The funds come from a special Treasury reserve rather than the defence bu
