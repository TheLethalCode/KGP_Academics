 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com) - Opener Shahriar Nafees and middle-order bat Alok Kapali left Tuesday morning for New Delhi by a Jet Airways fight to sign deal for the breakaway Indian Cricket League (ICL). Their departure means they will not appear before the Bangladesh Cricket Board Tuesday afternoon to explain reasons for their retirement from international cricket. The board on Sunday summoned six contracted players after receiving their applications of retirement. Except Nafees and Alok, former captain Habibul Bashar, batsman Aftab Ahmed, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and all-rounder Farhad Reza sent their retirement letters to the board by courier. Unconfirmed reports say Bashar and Dhiman left on Monday for India, as well. "I'm always ready to play for the national side, but not this time," Nafees told reporters before his departure at Zia International Airport. The left-handed opener sees no problem to play in the ICL. "The ICC (International Cricket Council) has no regulation about the ICL and it is a matter of respective cricketing nations," Nafees said. "So, if the board wants they can let us play in the national team and I can only say that I'm ready to come back to the national fold if I get a recall." Nafees had earlier said he would not appear before the board for a hearing as he had not got any official letter from the board. Acknowledging that he did receive text message on his mobile from a board official, Nafees said, "SMS cannot be an official way to communicate." b
