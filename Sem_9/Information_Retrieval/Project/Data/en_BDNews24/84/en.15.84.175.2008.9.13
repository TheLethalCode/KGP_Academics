 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has conceded that it may not be possible to hold upazila elections from Oct 23, as the commission has still to hold talks with BNP and the polling regulations have yet to given the all-clear by the law ministry. "The commission does not have sufficient time in hand if the schedule is to be announced at least 40-45 days before the election date," election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com Saturday. The commission has between 40-44 days remaining from Sunday to finalise all arrangements for upazila polls according to its previously declared dates of Oct 23 and Oct 27. "We are yet to hold dialogue with BNP," Sohul Hussain pointed out. "And we are still awaiting the law ministry's final vetting of the upazila poll regulations, drafted in line with the upazila ordinance (formulated on June 30)." "We will announce our final decision in a few days," he said. The schedule was given 45 days ahead for the last upazila polls held in the country in 1990. "Sufficient time must be given for submission and scrutiny of nomination papers and for campaigning," an EC official said. "It may be a risk if any less time is given," he said. For the Aug 4 city corporation and municipality polls, the EC announced the schedule on June 20, keeping 44 days in hand. The chief election commissioner first informed BBC radio and bdnews24.com on July 21 of a tentative Oct 23 UP poll date. A month later, the Election Commission formally decided two dates, Oct 23 and Oct 27, for holding polls to around 250 upazila parishad. However, the scenario changed after the third-round electoral dialogue between the EC and political parties. During the talks, held from Sept 6-9, most parties including Awami League remained steadfast in their opposition to holding upazila polls ahead of national elections. Another major party BNP, who had boycotted its scheduled dialogue session, is now set to sit with the EC following the release of party chief Khaleda Zia. A deputy secretary of the EC Secretariat, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "The Election Commission wants to hold upazila polls under the caretaker government." "If it is not possible to hold them before national elections, however, the commission will hold them in January or February." Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told bdnews24.com Saturday: "We will take a final decision after holding talks with BNP. We are still trying to proceed in line with the electoral roadmap." bdnews
