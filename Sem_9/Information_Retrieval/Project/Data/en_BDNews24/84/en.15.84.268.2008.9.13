<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League leader Abdul Jalil said on Saturday that he would be "taking rest" as requested by party chief Sheikh Hasina. "I talked to [Sheikh Hasina] by phone Friday night. She is worried about my health and asked me to take rest," Jalil told reporters at his Gulshan home Saturday. On who would be general secretary of the party, Jalil said: "There is no more question about it. Of course Ashraf will work as general secretary." Jalil announced that he had resumed work as general secretary of the party after his release on bail on Sept 10. Acting AL chief Zillur Rahman later refuted Jalil, saying that "technically" he had not been handed back his post, and Syed Ashraful Islam was continuing as acting secretary general. Jalil said Hasina enquired about his health by phone and asked him not to worry about the party. He also informed Zillur Rahman of his conversation with Hasina. bdnews
