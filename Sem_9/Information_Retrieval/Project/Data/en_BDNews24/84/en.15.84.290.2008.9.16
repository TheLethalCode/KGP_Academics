 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com) - Petrobangla and the Power Development Board are to meet to review policy on gas supplies to power plants under process in different phases. "We have received proposals from the Power Development Board. We will sit to review them at a meeting soon," Petrobangla chairman Jalal Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Petrobangla has said it will supply gas to power plants to be set up by 2011. However, the quantity of supply to these power plants may be reduced. Petrobangla also said it would not be possible to supply gas to plants set up after 2011. The ongoing discussion between the World Bank and the PDB on a $350 million credit proposal includes setting up of two 300- megawatt power units. Though initial supply of 75 million cubic feet (mmcf) gas for the power plant had been agreed upon, later it was reduced to 30 mmcf. However, the supply of 30 mmcf would also hinge on a number of conditions. The gas supply depends on the supply pipeline from Bakhrabad Gas field to Siddhirganj and the installation of a compressor at Ashuganj. Petrobangla had earlier said it was not possible to supply gas to a number of proposed power units. They are Siddhirganj thermal power plant (210 megawatts), Shikalbaha Combined Cycle Plant (255 megawatts), Sylhet CC Plant (150 megawatts), Ghorashal Plant (225 mw), Ashuganj (450 mw) power plant, Meghnaghat-3 plant (450 mw), and Meghnaghat-2 plant (450 mw). The government plans to set up the power plants to meet the ever increasing demand for power under mid-term plan of the year 2005. The mid-term plan also includes Bibiana (450 mw) and Sirajganj (450 mw) power plants. The plants would be set up at private initiatives. Besides, a number of power plants would be set up on short-term and hiring basis. Petrobangla has said it will supply gas to these plants. The government plans to set up power plants with a total capacity of 3775 megawatts in different phases but needs 744 mmcf gas would be required. Besides, there is plans to generate 1840 mw power in the private sector that would require 315 mmcf of gas. According to Petrobangla accounts, every day about 1800 mmcf of gas is being produced in the country from 31 wells in 18 gas fields. The daily deficiency of gas is 200 mmcf. bdnews24
