 LONDON, Sept 15 (Reuters) - The interbank cost of borrowing overnight dollars shot up on Monday to its highest in nearly three months, as US bank Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing rocked financial markets. The bank-to-bank premium paid for overnight dollar funds was fixed at 3.10625 percent, according to the British Bankers Association's latest daily fixing, up nearly a full percent to hit its highest since late June in a reflection of investors' deepening concern over the banking sector. The spread of three-month dollar Libor over OIS rates expanded to 105.125 basis points, its widest since December. The gap yawned from 85.875 basis points on Friday. "There are one or two houses out there trying to lend to try and calm down speculation against their names but most banks are trying to do the obvious thing and horde liquidity," said David Keeble, head of fixed income strategy at Calyon in London. The cost of borrowing three-month dollars was little changed from Friday, while rates for euros and sterling over the same period crept up only slightly. The spread expresses the three-month premium paid over anticipated central bank rates, or Overnight Index Swap rates and is seen as a gauge of banks' willingness to lend to each other -- a wider spread is seen as an indication of decreased inclination to lend.
