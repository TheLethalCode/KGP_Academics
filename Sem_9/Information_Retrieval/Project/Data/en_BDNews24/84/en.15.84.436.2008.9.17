<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Natural calamities retarded growth and pushed inflation up in Bangladesh as businesses crumbled amid uncertainly created by a messy anti-corruption drive, the ADB said Tuesday. A key task would be to curb inflation, the bank said in its annual Asian Development Outlook for 2008. "Sustaining higher growth and reducing poverty require, among other elements, large investments in physical infrastructure, especially power and transport," it said.. "Natural disasters have worsened growth and inflation indicators, but the uncertainty created among investors by the caretaker Government's anticorruption drive has started to ease. "In macroeconomic management, the major goal is to curb inflation, which has been lifted by higher international prices and a domestic foodgrain shortfall. Dr Zahid Hossain of ADB presented the Outlook to the media at its Dhaka office Tuesday. The new resident representative for Bangladesh Paul J Heytens also attended. It was published simultaneously in different Asian countries. Dr Hossain said Bangladesh did well in fiscal year 2007-08 despite the calamities. "Still robust, GDP growth in FY2007 decelerated to 6.5%, largely reflecting agriculture's moderation from the post-flood outturn of the previous year," the ADB report said. "It was underpinned by steady expansion in manufacturing and continued buoyancy in services, on the base of rising domestic and external demand. "Rapid growth in manufacturing and foreign trade aided services. "On the demand side, private consumption was the main driver of growth, bolstered by strong remittance inflows. "At 24.3% of GDP, investment during FY2007 was marginally lower than in the immediate past, mainly due to a decline in public investment following a downsizing of the annual development program. Net exports of goods and services remained negative. bd
