 Srinagar, India, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police used teargas and batons to disperse thousands of Muslim demonstrators who took to the streets in Kashmir's main city on Friday in fresh protests against New Delhi's rule in the disputed region. "Oppressors, get out of Kashmir," shouted protesters, led by senior separatist leader Yasin Malik, in the heart of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. "Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest), we will break the chains," Malik cried before police fired teargas shells. At least 36 protesters in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley have been killed by government forces since last month, when some of the largest pro-independence rallies broke out since a revolt against New Delhi's rule in 1989. More than 1,000 people have been injured in the protests, sparked by a decision to grant land for shelters to Hindus for an annual pilgrimage to Kashmir, one of the most militarized regions in the world. Authorities deployed thousands of troops across the valley to prevent demonstrations called by the region's different separatist factions. Indian troops have been criticised by Kashmiris and international human rights groups for using excessive force to quell protests in the Himalayan region. Officials say violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants has declined significantly since India and Pakistan, who claim the region in full but rule in parts, started a slow-moving peace process in 2004. But people are still killed in shootouts and occasional explosions. Separately to the protests, Indian security forces shot dead five militants on Friday in gun battles in southern Kashmir, police said. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the strife-torn region since Muslim rebels launched a violent campaign opposing Indian rule in Kashmir twenty years ago
