 MADRID, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla survived a seven-goal thriller to beat promoted Sporting Gijon 4-3 at home and take top spot in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Frederic Kanoute got the winner as Manolo Jimenez's side made the most of Barcelona's 1-1 draw with Racing Santander and early pacesetters Atletico Madrid's 2-1 defeat by 10-man Valladolid. Atletico won their opening game 4-0 over Malaga. Sporting's Croatian striker Mate Bilic scored two goals in two first-half minutes to silence the Sanchez Pizjuan and completed his hat-trick with a penalty in the 45th. But by then Sevilla had stormed back to take the lead through Ernesto Chevanton, Kanoute and Enzo Maresca. Mali striker Kanoute claimed his second after visiting goalkeeper Sergio Sanchez fumbled in the second half to complete an impressive fightback. Sevilla are top with four points from two games.

They lost fullback Pedro Lopez to a second yellow card for a dive in the area in the 21st but Atletico failed to react. Valladolid's Vivar Dorado went down in the box at another free kick in the 28th minute and Javier Baraja put away the ensuing penalty to amke it 2-0.
