<TEXT>
 Mumbai, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rupee dropped to its lowest in nearly two years on Friday as banks bought dollars locally to sell them in the offshore market and take advantage of the price differential. At 10:50 a.m., the partially convertible rupee was at 45.71/72 per dollar, off a low of 45.80, its weakest since Oct. 11 2006. It closed at 45.56/57 on Thursday. At its low, the rupee was down nearly 14 percent so far in 2008. "The rupee continues to be bogged down by dollar demand from the offshore entities, and the other side is that there is no supply, so if the dollar-rupee goes up, nobody likes to sell," the chief dealer with a private bank said. One-month offshore non-deliverable forward contracts were quoting at 46.03/13 per dollar, 0.7 percent weaker than the onshore spot rate, indicating a bearish outlook for the rupee. Dealers said the central bank was seen selling dollars through state-run banks around 45.70 to 45.75 per dollar, but the quantum of intervention was not very large. They said they were also watching the dollar's performance against other currencies to gauge the near-term outlook for the rupee. The dollar stayed near a one-year high against the euro, amid growing fears of a slowdown in the global economy, especially outside the United States. The BSE Sensex was down nearly 2 percent, after opening 0.76 percent higher. Foreign funds have so far sold a net $7.6 billion worth of Indian stocks, after buying a record $17.4 billion in 2007
