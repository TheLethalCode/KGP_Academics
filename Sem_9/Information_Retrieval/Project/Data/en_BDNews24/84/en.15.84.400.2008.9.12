<TEXT>
 Yangon, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Detained Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has managed to wring small concessions from the ruling generals in the form of letters from her family and some international news magazines, her lawyer said on Friday. The Nobel laureate, whose refusal of new food deliveries to the Yangon villa where she is under house arrest prompted speculation of a hunger strike, had also agreed to a visit by her doctor, lawyer Kyi Win told reporters. "The authorities have agreed to let her receive family mail, read some international periodicals like Newsweek and Time and lift restrictions on the movement of her housekeeper, Khin Khin Win and daughter," he said after visiting Suu Kyi. There was no word on whether the 63-year-old, who has been under continuous house arrest for the last five years, would get a new satellite television decoder to replace an existing one that is believed to have broken. Myanmar's police chief, Brigadier General Khin Yi, denied on Sunday that Suu Kyi was on hunger strike. Her National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which won a 1990 election landslide only to be denied power by the military, said her health and safety was the sole responsibility of the junta. In all, Suu Kyi has been under house arrest for 13 of the last 19 years. Myanmar, or Burma as it used to be called, has been under military rule since 1962
