 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) Debapriya Bhattacharya, permanent representative of Bangladesh in Geneva, took over as head of UNCTAD's Trade and Development Board on Monday. He was elected unanimously to the one-year post by the 193 UN member states, said a statement from Geneva. Debapriya, who will represent the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at all UN events, is the first Bangladeshi ambassador to be elected to the post. The TDB is the highest policy making body after the quadrennial ministerial conferences of UNCTAD, a Geneva-based organ of the UN General Assembly. As TDB president, Debapriya will lead UNCTAD in implementing the instructions and guidelines provided by heads of states and governments, and ministers, at the UNCTAD conference held in Accra, Ghana earlier this year. He will also lead the inter-governmental and inter-agency dialogues on current issues of critical concern in the areas of trade and development. bdn
