<TITLE> China toxic milk victim count expected to rise </TITLE>

 Beijing,Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of Chinese infants found threatened by toxic milk powder is likely to rise as the search for victims spreads, state media reported on Tuesday, as the government faced growing public anger over the safety crisis. More than 1,200 children have been diagnosed with kidney illness after drinking adulterated milk powder produced by the Sanlu Group. Two infants have died and more than 50 are in a serious condition from kidney stones caused by a banned chemical, melamine, added to raw milk before processing in an apparent bid to fool inspectors. "Their number could rise as the search for more infants fed Sanlu milk food spreads across the country's rural areas," the China Daily reported. "...The number could rise sharply in coming days as more parents take their children for medical check-ups," it added, citing Health Minister Chen Zhu. Melamine is rich in nitrogen, an element often used to measure protein, and so can be used to disguise diluted milk. China is the world's second biggest market for baby milk powder, and Sanlu has been the top-selling company in the sector for 15 years, with 18.3 percent of sales in 2007. Sanlu dominates in poorer rural areas, where farmer and migrant workers often find milk powder is easier than breast-feeding, and sometimes believe it is also healthier. The central government has called the poisonings a "Level 1" food safety incident and formed an emergency team to grapple with the fall-out, the official Xinhua news agency reported. But public anger has grown over claims the company and officials failed to act sooner. Sanlu, 43 percent owned by New Zealand dairy giant Fonterra, last week halted production after investigators announced they had found the problem. Local Chinese officials acted last week only after the New Zealand government contacted Beijing, New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said on Monday. But according to Fonterra chief executive Andrew Ferrier, Sanlu started its own recall from suppliers from Aug. 2. In past years China has been beset by a series of domestic and international scandals about toxic and unsafe food and products. In 2004, at least 13 babies died in the eastern province of Anhui after drinking fake powder that had no nutrition. But last year, Sanlu was lauded by a Chinese state television programme, "Weekly Consumer Report", as a model of good quality. In past days, Chinese internet sites have filled with bitter criticisms claiming the broadcaster was more interested in boosting companies than protecting consumers. "Weekly Consumer Report changes from an attacker of fake and sub-standard products into their protector," said one
