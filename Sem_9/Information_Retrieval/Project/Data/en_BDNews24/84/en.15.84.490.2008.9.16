<TITLE> No pressure on Khaleda, Hasina to talk: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Tuesday denied media reports that quoted him as saying in Chittagong on Monday that Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina and BNP supreme Khaleda Zia would be pressured to sit for dialogue. "The initiative to bring the two leaders to sit and talk is part of different initiatives to resolve the problem. This initiative has a symbolic significance. There is no scope for putting pressure from our part. There is no question of creating pressure." The education and commerce adviser spoke to reporters after emerging from the education ministry. Later US ambassador in Bangladesh James F Moriarty met with him at the commerce ministry. Hossain Zillur said he had been misquoted. "When will we work if we have to reply to every body? In reality, we speak in different manner in different times. The main tone of these statements does not get properly reported in the media. The mass media will have to carry news more responsibly. I know what I said in Chittagong." "There is no pressure on the two leaders to sit across the table. Common people and political parties, all will project their own views. They will give their opinion. We will take our initiative. "There is no point creating unnecessary controversy on the issue. We are working to resolve the problem. We are working to fulfil people's aspiration and bring about a qualitative change." He was asked whether the meeting of the two former prime ministers would yield anything when they did not encourage democratic practices in their parties. "Why do we make a decision so quickly? Let's see what happens. Some changes have taken place in the country. A new mood is there. Let's see how that works." Asked whether the chief adviser would address the nation anytime soon, the adviser said, "Let him return first (from China)." Asked how he viewed BNP joint secretary general Tarique Rahman's retirement from politics, he said, "We have nothing to make of it. Many analysts are there to make assessment. "They will evaluate. We have come to work. We will continue to work," the adviser said. bdne
