 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The first-phase of the 100-day job generation scheme began on Monday for an initial period of sixty days throughout the country, the food and disaster management adviser said. "Tk 2,000 crore project has started in 480 upazilas of 64 districts," food and disaster adviser AMM Shawkat Ali said at a press conference at the Press Information Department. He said the project would benefit approximately one crore people of the country directly or indirectly with 20 lakh people registered for jobs under the project. Tk 20 crore will be spent a day on the project, he added. Each registered worker will get a card. The highest 6,56,520 cards have been allocated for Rajshahi division, the adviser said. As many as 5,42,820 cards have been allocated for Dhaka, 1,42,180 for Barisal, 3,21,680 for Chittagong, 2,19,400 for Khulna and 1,17,400 for Sylhet division. According to the government estimates, the number of extreme poor is 1.31 crore in Rajshahi, 1.09 crore in Dhaka, 64.53 lakh in Chittagong, 44 lakh in Khulna, 28.44 lakh in Barisal and 23.55 lakh in Sylhet. Some advisers and government officials had earlier said Monga-hit, haor-baor and areas prone to river erosion were designated as priority areas. A worker will get Tk 100 for a day's work, with just one person from a family eligible to participate. In addition, regardless of whether work is available, those registered as destitute between the ages of 18 and 50 will receive some payment. Those who register will get at a minimum Tk 40 per-day for the first 30 days if there is no work available and will receive Tk 50 for the remaining days. However, according to the guidelines those not showing up for work will receive no money. The adviser ruled out irregularities in allocation. "The registered people will get money for their work at the end of the day." A government official and a representative from the Food and Agricultural Organisation will monitor the scheme apart from local representatives. "They will submit a report at the end of a month a final report after the end of the first phase of the project," Shawkat Ali said. Food and disaster management secretary Molla Waheeduzzaman had earlier said the jobs planned under the project would be similar to those under the Test Relief and Food for Work projects. The first phase of the programme will run until November, with a 40-day second phase scheduled to start in March next year. The project is largely aimed at completing certain works relating to the development of the agricultural sector. Manufacturing organic manure and digging ponds as well as constructing embankments and roads will be among the critical jobs workers under the initiative will carry out. bdn
