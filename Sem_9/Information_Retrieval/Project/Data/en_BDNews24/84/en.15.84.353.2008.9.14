<TITLE> My mother needs permanent ear-aid: Joy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Permanent damage in Sheikh Hasina's left ear will compel the former prime minister to use a hearing aid for the rest of her life, her son Sajib Wazed Joy said Saturday. Joy, speaking to bdnews24.com by phone, said: "My mother's physical condition is better now. But the problem she had with her ear has no chance of improving in the future." "She will have to use a hearing aid for the rest of her life." Joy said his mother is still suffering from eye problems. Hasina's eye-condition, due to high blood pressure, worsened while she was in special jail. "It is now being treated, but for other minor complications the required surgery could not be carried out yet," he said. On when Sheikh Hasina would return home to Bangladesh, Joy said: "She's got an appointment with a doctor next week. We can say the date may be sometime after that." "She wants to return very soon, anyway" he said. Hasina was released on eight weeks' parole on June 11. The parole has been stretched twice, the latest extension being until Oct 6. The former prime minister was arrested and detained on July 16, 2007, and faces a number of graft cases against her. bdn
