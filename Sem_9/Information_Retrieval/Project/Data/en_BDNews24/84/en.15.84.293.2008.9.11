<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)Charge framing has been deferred for the fourth time against those accused of murder in connection with the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack. Lawyers of all the accused sought postponement of charge framing on Thursday, asking that trial of a separate case under the explosives act be held simultaneously. Judge Md Masdar Hossain Dhaka No 2 Speedy Trial Tribunal fixed Sept 17 for the next hearing. The judge also asked special public prosecutor Feroz Kamrul Hasan whether simultaneous trial of the murder case and explosives case was logical and legal. Hasan replied it was, and made no legal objection to the request of the defence. A total of 13 accused in the case were brought to the court from different jails under police guard in the morning. Eight other accused in the case are fugitive, one is out on bail. bdnew
