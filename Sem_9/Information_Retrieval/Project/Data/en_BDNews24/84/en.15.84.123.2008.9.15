<TITLE> Lehman to file for bankruptcy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said it plans to file for bankruptcy protection, but the Chapter 11 filing will not include its broker-dealer operations and other units, including Neuberger Berman. Lehman is looking at selling its broker-dealer operations, and is still in advanced discussions with a number of potential buyers of its investment management division. Bankruptcy represents the end of a 158-year old company that survived world wars and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management but could not survive the global credit crunch. Investors in recent weeks had grown increasingly jittery about Lehman's $46 billion of mortgages and asset-backed securities, as well as its credit rating and its ability to raise capital.
