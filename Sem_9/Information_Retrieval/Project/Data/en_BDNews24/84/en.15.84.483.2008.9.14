 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has refused to hear the bail plea of Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury in the Bijoy TV corruption case. Dr Kamal Hossain, representing Mohiuddin, said the mayor was very sick and urged the High Court vacation bench of Justice Khondker Musa Khaled and Justice Farid Ahmed to hear the bail prayer on Sunday. The bench replied: "This bench is burdened with prior cases. We are unable to take on this appeal." Kamal Hossain went to chief justice MM Ruhul Amin. Advocate Harisadhan Deb Brahman, who assisted Kamla Hossain, said the chief justice empowered a another bench of Justice Jinat Ara and Justice Syed Mohammad Ziaul Karim to hear the bail petition. He said the proceedings of the case have remained suspended in a Chittagong trial court on a stay order. The High Court may hear the bail plea on Tuesday or Wednesday, he added. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on May 27 last year, and pressed charges on Nov 22, against Mayor Mohiuddin and two others for launching the channel without prior permission of the government. bdnew
