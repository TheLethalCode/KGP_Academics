 ALBACETE, Spain, September 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European champions Spain made it two wins from two with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Armenia in World Cup qualifying Group Five on Wednesday. Joan Capdevila fired the home side in front after only seven minutes, and soon after Euro 2008 top scorer David Villa doubled the lead as Spain threatened to cut loose. Armenia, who lost their opening game 2-0 at home to Turkey on Saturday, held on until near the end when goals in quick succession from Villa again and Marcos Senna made sure of the points for the home side. Victory followed Spain's 1-0 win over Bosnia on Saturday under new coach Vicente del Bosque, who replaced Luis Aragones after their triumph at the European championship in June. "It wasn't an easy game, we had to work very hard," Capdevila told Spanish state television. "We are delighted with the results of the last two games as it was important to win these first two matches at home." After having laboured for the best part of an hour before breaking down Bosnia on Saturday, Del Bosque opted to bolster his attack by playing Daniel Guiza up front with Villa against Armenia. From the outset they took the game to the visitors, playing with greater pace and penetration than they did four days earlier. Andres Iniesta's clever pass put Capdevila behind the defence after seven minutes for the Villarreal full back to net the opener. The impressive Iniesta was instrumental in setting up the second as well when he dribbled into the area off the left flank and the ball broke for Villa to shoot low into the corner. Armenia briefly threatened with Aghvan Mkrytchyan going close on a couple of occasions before the break, but Spain held firm. Del Bosque gave Barcelona's 18-year-old striker Bojan Krkic his senior side debut in the second half and Villa hit a post after rounding the goalkeeper. But the Valencia frontman made no mistake when Xabi Alonso played him into the area 11 minutes from time, and Senna wrapped up the win with a fine 25-metre drive, three minutes late
