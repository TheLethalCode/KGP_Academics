<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cricket Australia (CA) officials will review security arrangements in India ahead of their four-test tour following a series of bombings in New Delhi on Saturday. The five bombings, in and around crowded markets and streets in the capital, killed at least 20 people and injured at least 90 more, Indian police said. The Indian Mujahideen Islamic militant group claimed responsibility for the bombings. Australia are scheduled to play a four-test series in India, starting on Oct. 9 in Bangalore. The third match is scheduled for Delhi, starting on Oct. 29. "It is standard practice to do an inspection before a tour but with this particular tragic incident overnight, we will be doing a highly intensive security assessment," CA public affairs manager Peter Young said. Indian cricket board secretary Niranjan Shah was confident the tour would go ahead as scheduled. "We will be providing tight security for both teams," he told Reuters. "The tour will go on according to schedule. We've no problems if Cricket Australia send across a security team." MONDAY TALKS CA's security manager, Reg Dickason, and operations manager Michael Brown, will talk to officials from Australia's foreign ministry, the country's High Commission in Delhi and the Indian cricket board on Monday. "That will be so we can understand what the exact circumstances and what risks, if any, that we need to be aware of relative to the Australian team and support staff," Young said. The Australian Cricketers' Association would also be involved in the review, he said, adding that no players had expressed concern about the tour to CA on Sunday. "The players are fairly well informed on the approach we take so I would imagine they would be taking it as read that we would be going though this process." Young said he expected the review would be completed by the end of the week. The team are scheduled to leave Australia next Sunday
