 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  The government is considering a cut in fuel prices following the drop in global oil price, the finance and planning adviser said Saturday. "As fuel prices have come down in the international market, we will hold a meeting to discuss a cut in domestic fuel prices," adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam told reporters on his return home at Zia International Airport. "The global price of oil had risen to $140 per barrel, when we upped prices in line with the international market in June/July. The price has now come down to $100." "At the time, the government was burdened with massive subsidies as oil prices rose." Now the situation has changed with the oil prices falling once again, he added. The government hiked fuel prices on June 30. It raised the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 55 from Tk 40 and the prices of petrol to Tk 87 up from Tk 65, and octane Tk 90 up from Tk 67. On his return from climate talks in London, Mirza Aziz said the UK-Bangladesh climate change conference was a success. "The British government has formed a fund of 75 million pounds to help Bangladesh adapt to climate change." "The Danish government has also pledged assistance." Other donor agencies, including the World Bank, have also promised climate-change adaptation funds, the adviser added. The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of environment Devashish Roy and Economic Relations Division secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan returned from London Saturday with the finance adviser. bddnews
