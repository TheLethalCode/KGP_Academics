<TITLE> Pope, in France, starts Lourdes pilgrimage </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Lourdes, France,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict began a three-day pilgrimage on Saturday at the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes in southwestern France after telling a huge crowd in Paris that the modern world had made idols of money and power. The German-born pontiff, 81, plans to say two masses and join pilgrims in processions to mark the 150th anniversary of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary to Bernadette Soubirous, an even that turned Lourdes into Catholicism's most visited shrine. At the shrine sanctuary, about 45,000 faithful waited in the cold rain for an address from Benedict, who visited a church with the font where Bernadette was baptised, and then the small room where she lived at the time of the apparitions in 1858. At mass on Saturday morning in Paris, the pope told more that 250,000 people that the modern world had turned money, possessions and power into idols as false as the gold and silver statues worshipped by the pagans of antiquity. "Has not our modern world created its own idols?" he said. "Has it not imitated, perhaps inadvertently, the pagans of antiquity, by diverting man from his true end, from the joy of living eternally with God," he said in fluent French, wearing gold, white and red vestments. Benedict, who arrived in France on Friday, celebrated the mass at Les Invalides, a complex of military buildings begun by King Louis XIV in the 17th century that houses the sarcophagus of Napoleon Bonaparte. In his homily, he pursued a theme dear to him: the need to inject lasting spiritual and religious values into a modern society often enamoured of things material and fleeting. He quoted the writings of St Paul, saying "Money is the root of all evil", and added in his own words: "Have not money, the thirst for possessions, for power and even for knowledge diverted man from his true destiny?" RESURGENT CATHOLICISM Since he arrived on Friday, the pope has been encouraging Catholics to speak out confidently in a country where "laicite", the separation of church and state that often relegates faith to the private sphere, is part of the national psyche. The once powerful French church struggles with a shortage of priests and Sunday mass attendance is below 10 percent. But religion has re-emerged as a factor in public life, especially because of the growth of Islam, and French Catholics have increasingly spoken out on social issues. "It's a very good thing that lots of young people are here because it gives a more dynamic image of the church," said Beatrice de la Bellier, at the mass with all her four children. "People always underestimate the numbers who turn out for these events but the Church in France is very strong. Benedict has a very different style from John Paul. His thoughts are more structured. He is a real theologian. The sheer numbers here show, however, that he has connected with the people," she said. In his battle to re-inject religious values into French and European public life, Benedict has an unlikely ally in French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Sarkozy, who is twice divorced and married to Italian-born singer and former supermodel Carla Bruni, has broken a political taboo by speaking openly and positively about the role of religion in society. In a speech on Friday, he said it would be "folly" for France to ignore its long history of Christian thought
