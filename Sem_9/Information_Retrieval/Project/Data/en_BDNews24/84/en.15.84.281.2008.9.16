<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission secretariat has taken a fresh initiative to enlist freed BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia as a voter. Election Commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com Tuesday morning that the EC would take steps to enlist Khaleda as a voter if she consented to it. After voter registration in the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) area started on December 1 last year, the Election Commission requested Khaleda three times to become a voter, but she refused to get registered while in confinement. Khaleda Zia was released on bail on September 11. Section 12 (ka) of the Representation of the People (Amendment) Order 1972 says that nobody can contest the Jatiya Sangsad election if he/she is not enlisted as a voter. bdnew
