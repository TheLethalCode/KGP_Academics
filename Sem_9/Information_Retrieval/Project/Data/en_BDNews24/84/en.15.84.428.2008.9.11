 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)BNP chief Khaleda Zia, freed after a year in jail, has said her party will join the electoral dialogue and general elections, while son Tarique Rahman quit his party post before flying to London Thursday night. "BNP is united and will remain united," a frail former prime minister told cheering supporters at her party headquarters in the capital's Naya Paltan Thursday afternoon. Her release Thursday morning probably paved the way for the major parties, along with rival Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, to participate in general elections slated for December. "BNP wants to be engaged in dialogue. BNP wants to take part in elections," Khaleda said. She was flanked by confidants such as Khandaker Delwar Hossain, whom she named as secretary general before her Sep 3 arrest last year replacing longstanding ally Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. "My son will take two to three years to recover. He will be away from politics until he fully recovers," Khaleda, 63, said of the ailing Tarique,42, widely criticised for abuse of power during her second prime ministerial stint. Tarique formally left the political scene behind, as he handed a note resigning his party post as senior joint secretary general to a party official, before boarding a London-bound flight, highly-placed sources said. A senior party source, who wished to remain anonymous, told bdnews24.com: "Yes, I know he left a letter of resignation." Airport security chief M Nurul Islam told bdnews24.com that he flew out by an Emirates flight at 9:50pm. Wife, daughter, a doctor and two other relatives were with him on board, as mother Khaleda Zia after an eventful day remained at her Dhaka Cantonment home. A source close to the former prime minister said she met "exclusively" with Jamaat-e-Islami leader Matiur Rahman Nizami at her home Thursday night, the meeting between the two top leaders of the four-party alliance following Khaleda's statement just hours earlier on joining dialogue and elections. The former prime minister, appearing aged and far from her previous glamorous self, stepped out Thursday morning from the special jail set up in the parliament complex, and waved to the crowd, who showered her with flower petals. Prisons DIG Shamsul Haider Siddiqui had announced at 11.30am that the BNP chief was now free to go home on bail. Thousands thronged the Sangsad Bhaban premises when she left flanked by daughter-in-law Zubaida and grand daughter Zaima. Pale but still smiling, Khaleda drove straight to her slain husband Ziaur Rahman's graveside to pay her respects. Senior BNP leaders had already arrived at the grave to greet their chief. Delwar, SQ Chowdhury, ASM Hannan Shah and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy were, among others, present. Hundreds shouted slogans as her heavily-guarded cream-coloured Pajero reached the grave complex. She then visited ailing Tarique at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, where she hinted her elder son would quit party for now, before going to the party headquarters for the first time since the Jan 11 changeover last year. "My son has been tortured  it was unjust  my two sons have been reduced to nothing," she said later at her party's Naya Paltan headquarters, breaking into tears. She left Naya Paltan at 5:20pm, reaching her Mainul Road residence minutes later amid heavy security. Tarique, her political heir apparent, who was released from detention on bail on Sep 3 after securing bail in a total of 12 cases, was blamed by many for creating a situation that led to the 1/11 declaration of emergency. Tarique remained in the hospital after the release. Known more as a wheeler-dealer than a leader, he had a reputation for using political perches to benefit himself, his family and his friends. Secretary general Delwar however told partymen at Naya Paltan that the presence of thousands at the hospital proved the popularity of Khaleda's elder son. As Delwar demanded Tarique be sent abroad for treatment, the BNP joint secretary general was busy packing in hospital for his trip to London, amid reports he had been relieved of his party post. "Tarique is flying to London on an Emirates flight to seek medical treatment," lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told reporters at around 6.50pm. Tarique's wife Zubaida, daughter Zaima, doctor Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon and two other relatives were seen accompanying him. The BNP leader's departure for the UK had been postponed the day before, his lawyer complaining that he could not leave as scheduled because of "obstructions" created by the government. BNP leader Hannan Shah told reporters that the then still-detained Khaleda wished to see her ailing son before he went. DIG Siddiqui had said authorities received all Khaleda release papers by 6:45pm Wednesday, and that she would be freed anytime on Thursday. Bail bonds for Khaleda had been submitted by lawyers to four separate courts handling the GATCO, Niko, Zia Orphanage Trust and Barapukuria coalmine cases. Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year in GATCO graft case. Coco is also abroad now undergoing medical treatment in Thailand on bail. Three more graft cases were filed later against Khaleda. She secured bail in all the cases. Chances are that the Supreme Court could still cancel the bails after hearing the appeal of the Anticorruption Commission, likely on Sept 15. But that now seems a remote possibility, given the statement from a government spokesman immediately after her release. "The government will take initiatives to get the two top leaders to sit together to help the nation overcome the current political crisis and restore sound political atmosphere," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Thursday told a briefing. "We hope they will not only respond to this move but also take initiatives on their own since the two leaders have contributed a lot to the country," he said. With Hasina already out on parole and making political speeches, Khaleda's latest overtures only made the prospects for a December general election look brighter. bdnews24.com/sm/lh/sum/pc/g
