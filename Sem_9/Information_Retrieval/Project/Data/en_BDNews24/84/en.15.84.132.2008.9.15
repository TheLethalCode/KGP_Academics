 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)The ceramics industry is eyeing $100 million in exports by 2012, the Bangladesh Ceramic Ware Manufacturers' Association chairman says. "We expect to export ceramics worth $100 m by 2012, provided the government supports us as required," Rashed Mowdud Khan told bdnews24.com in a recent interview. "The growth rate of the sector is considerable in the competitive international market," said Khan, also the chairman of Bengal Fine Ceramics. The Export Promotion Bureau statistics put the total value of exported ceramic products from the 21 Bangladeshi manufacturers at $38.33 m in the FY 2006-07, up by 28 percent from the preceding year's. According to the BCWMA figures, Bangladesh exported only $1 million worth of ceramic wares in 1991 before recording a staggering 695 percent growth in about a decade, investing nearly Tk 2,000 crore and employing some one lakh workers. Of the products, ceramic table wares are being exported to about 50 countries including the US and Canada, tiles to India, Nepal and Bhutan and sanitary wares to the Middle East, specially the UAE. The BCWMA say they sell ceramic products worth about Tk 700 crore in the domestic market and pay close to Tk 200 crore in taxes. "In another decade's time, with the government ensuring energy supply and expedited refund of the import duties paid upon execution of exports, Bangladesh's can become one of the three largest global ceramics exporters," said Mahmudur Rahman, chairman, Artisan Ceramics, an export-focused ceramics manufacturing company. "We are using the most advanced 'bone China' technology and the labour costs here are relatively less compared with the developed nations. Also, as an LDC (least developed country) member, Bangladesh enjoys tax exemptions." "Since value addition in the ceramics sector happens to be the most, the government should promote it in its efforts to assume another major export earner's magnitudes." Khan of BCWMA suggested the government should enhance the currently levied 20 percent complementary tax on imported ceramics to 65 percent to protect the Bangladeshi ceramic products, as the imported Chinese ceramics sell rather cheap here. The government put an embargo on cutting hills in 2007 through a public notification, which stopped the ceramics manufacturers from procuring raw materials from the Mymensingh hills since. "The Mymensingh clay could be used for producing tiles, but for table wares we have to import superior quality clay from India and China," Rahman said. Rahman, a former energy adviser, said the government may take steps to find deposits of superior quality clay for ceramics in the coalmine region of north Bengal. Ashek Alam, Shinepukur Ceramics marketing head, said they exported ceramics worth $17 m in the last FY and were eyeing Australia to add to their already sprawling global market. "The cheaper Chinese ceramics happen to be much inferior to our products. We are competing with India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and other major producers in the sector," Alam said optimistically. He stressed the need for expanding the infrastructural facilities including provision of customs support through the weekends, port facilities and gas supply. Harunur Rashid Khan Monno, chairman of Monno Ceramics, the second largest exporter through the last FY, said, "We are losing considerable quantities of imported raw materials because of errant gas supply and gas pressure fluctuations." The government may very well attempt training people in ceramics production skills and export the skilled manpower abroad, Rahman commented. "A number of ceramics workers have already gone abroad for better wages. The government may consider upgrading the Ceramics Institute to university, introduce ceramics as a study subject and organise required training programmes," he said. bdnews
