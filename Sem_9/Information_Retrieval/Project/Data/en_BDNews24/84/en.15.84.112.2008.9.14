<TITLE> 'The Simpson`s' wins 10th best cartoon Emmy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Los Angeles,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "The Simpsons" once again claimed U.S. television's highest honor for a prime-time cartoon on Saturday at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards, extending the show's record winning streak. It marked the 10th time that "The Simpsons," airing on the News Corp Ltd-owned Fox network for 19 seasons as the longest-running comedy series in prime time, was named best half-hour animated show. The latest accolade for the hit cartoon about a lazy, slow-witted family man named Homer Simpson came during a 3 1/2-hour presentation of the 60th annual Creative Arts Emmy Awards, mostly honoring achievements in categories like makeup, costumes, sound editing and art direction. The ceremony, which airs next week on cable TV, serves as a prelude to the higher-profile Primetime Emmys on September 21. The single most decorated program of the evening was HBO's historical mini-series "John Adams," about the second US president, which clinched eight awards. That tally accounted for half of the 16 trophies collected by HBO overall, maintaining the dominance of Time Warner Inc.'s pay cable channel in the Emmy sweepstakes. The critically acclaimed new TV drama, "Mad Men," AMC's 1960s period piece set in the world of New York's Madison Avenue advertising industry, was the second most celebrated program of the night, and the No. 1 series, with four awards. Emmy voters also embraced TV's more subversive side as they saluted a special installment of the satirical cartoon "South Park," a heavily bleeped video clip by comedian Sarah Silverman and the reality show starring edgy comic Kathy Griffin. Silverman and four co-writers shared the prize for best original music and lyrics for their profane song, "I'm F---ing Matt Damon," which became an Internet sensation after the video clip of her performance aired on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" The video also won a picture-editing award. Performed with Damon, the piece was a mock announcement to Kimmel -- then Silverman's boyfriend of five years -- that she was cheating on him with the handsome Hollywood leading man. Silverman and Kimmel broke up in July, days before the song was nominated. Accepting the award on stage, Silverman cheekily thanked "the person for whom this whole video was made, Jimmy Kimmel, who broke my heart, ooh, ooh, who'll always have a place in my heart." For a second straight year, Griffin's Bravo cable network series, "Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List," was named best reality program. "Well, well, well. Here we are again," she said on stage, clutching her trophy. "I'm not going to tell anyone to suck it. I would make love to it if I could." Griffin was alluding to her provocative acceptance speech last year in which she exalted, "Suck it, Jesus. This award is my god now" -- a comment that was cut from the pre-taped telecast and drew a rebuke from Emmy organizers. Former "Sex and the City" star Cynthia Nixon was named best guest actress in a drama for her chilling role as a mother with multiple personalities accused of killing her daughters on NBC's "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit." She was not present to accept her award. Stage veteran Glynn Turman, who originated the role of Travis in the first Broadway production of "A Raisin in the Sun," won his first Emmy with the award for best guest actor in a drama for playing the father of a psychological patient on HBO's "In Treatment." TV veteran Tim Conway claimed an Emmy for playing an old-time star on the NBC network satire "30 Rock," one of three awards that series won. And Kathryn Joosten won her second prize for her recurring role as the nosy elder neighbor Karen McCluskey on ABC's "Desperate Housewives.
