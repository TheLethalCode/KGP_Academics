<TITLE> India July industry output flags underlying strength </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's industrial output rose more than expected in July, driven by capital goods production, suggesting the economy was resilient enough to withstand another rate rise if inflation made more tightening necessary. Industrial production rose 7.1 percent in July from a year earlier, beating a forecast of 6.5 percent and pulling up from drop in pace in May and June, data showed on Friday. Industrial output is geared mostly to the domestic market, accounting for about a fifth of gross domestic product, and economists said a 21.9 percent jump in capital goods production from a year ago suggested an encouraging level of investment. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised interest rates three times in June and July as inflation moved into double digits, and economists said the mild recovery in industrial activity gave it scope to act again if inflation failed to slow sufficiently. "Given the recent trend as far as manufacturing prices inflation is concerned there is still scope for RBI to go with that one last hike in October," said Rajeev Malik, head of Indian and ASEAN economics at Macquarie Capital Securities. Bond yields fell slightly after the data with the market looking past the figures to an auction later in day. The rupee inched up to 45.7150/7250 per dollar and the main stock index trimmed losses. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lifted its key lending rate, the repo rate, to 9.0 percent at the end of July, its highest in seven years. Since then annual inflation has moderated from a high of 12.6 percent in early August to 12.1 percent by the end of that month, but some economists say it has still to peak at 13-14 percent and won't dip into single figures until early next year. The new RBI governor, D Subbarao, who took over from YV Reddy last week, signalled this week he would wait and see whether the recent inflation slowdown marked a trend. THREAT TO GROWTH? After Subbarao's comments, a Reuters poll showed economists had scaled back their expectations for higher rates, although several still did still see a quarter percentage point increase at the Oct. 24 review. But others, such as Lehman Brothers economist Sonal Varma, say there will be no more tightening from the RBI and noted that annual industrial output growth for the first four months of the fiscal year starting in April was just 5.7 percent. "The headwinds to growth have risen and we expect average IIP growth of 6.7 percent in fiscal 2008/09," Varma said. Manufacturing output rose 7.5 percent from a year earlier while consumer goods production rose 7.3 percent and consumer durables output was up 11.2 percent. Data earlier this week showed India's infrastructure sector, which accounts for 26.7 percent of industrial output, grew an annual 4.3 percent in July, up from 3.4 percent in June. The RBI's anti-inflation drive has hit demand, reflected in a slowdown in car sales, which fell 4.4 percent in August from a year ago - the second month of decline in a row. Indian authorities are keen to get prices under control relatively quickly, in particular to prevent inflation from being an election issue in national polls due by next May. But the long-term aim is to keep the economy growing fast to help lift millions out of poverty and the Reuters poll showed two economists now saw a rate cut by March. In the June quarter the economy grew an annual 7.9 percent, its slowest pace in 3- years and well below the rate of 9 percent of more clocked over the past three fiscal years
