 Faridpur, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) - Agriculture adviser CS Karim Monday claimed that there was no fertiliser crisis anywhere in the country. He said, "There is no fertiliser crisis in the country. 1.5 lakh tonnes more fertiliser than the previous quantity has been imported this year." He was speaking as the chief guest at a views' exchange meeting on flood and agricultural rehabilitation at the conference room of Faridpur deputy commissioner Monday afternoon. Chief adviser's special assistant M Tamim was the special guest at the function. The agriculture adviser said, "The government is supplying fertiliser to farmers at a subsidised rate. If the farmer had to buy fertiliser from the open market, he would have to pay Tk 50 per kg. But the government is not allowing anything that would leave the interest of the farmers unprotected." He said that after the flood, all types of rehabilitation work including in agriculture should be done in a planned way. The adviser urged all to help overcome the loss caused by the disaster through united and concerted efforts. Tamim, in charge of the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources, said, "At present 3,300 megawatts of power is being generated to meet the demand." He urged all to cooperate with the government to meet the power deficiency through adopting austerity in power consumption. He said that in many countries shops and shopping malls would remain shut after 6 pm to save electricity. Deputy Commissioner Akhteruzzaman Md Mostafa Kamal presided. Administrative officials, businessmen, NGO representatives and journalists also spoke. bdnews
