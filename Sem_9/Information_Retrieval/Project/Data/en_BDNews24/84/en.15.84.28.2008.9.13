<TITLE> Afghan governor dies in suicide blast near Kabul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kabul, Sep13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The governor of Afghanistan's Logar province was killed in a suicide attack near Kabul on Saturday, police said. Abdullah Wardak died outside his house in Paghman, some 20 km (12 miles) west of the capital. "The governor was leaving his house for the office," provincial police chief Ghulam Mustafa Mohseni said. "The suicide bomber was waiting near his residence. As the governor came out with his driver, he was targeted and killed." Mohseni had no further details. Wardak served as a commander for one of the armed factions that helped US-led troops overthrow the hardline Islamist Taliban government in late 2001. He later held ministerial office under President Hamid Karzai. He is the second governor killed by suicide bombers in recent years. Mohseni did not say who might have carried out Saturday's attack, the latest in a spiral of violence to hit the country in recent weeks. The resurgent Taliban rely largely on suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts in their insurgency against the Karzai government and the foreign troops backing it. Nearly 3,000 people have died a violent death in Afghanistan this year, the bloodiest period since the Taliban's overthrow. US-led troops ousted the Taliban after it refused to hand over al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The rising violence comes despite an increase in the number of foreign troops, currently standing at 71,000. It has prompted some Western politicians to warn that the country may be sliding back into anarchy
