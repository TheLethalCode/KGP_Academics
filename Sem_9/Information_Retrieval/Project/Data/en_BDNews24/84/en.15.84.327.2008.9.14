 Bangkok,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's acting prime minister met the heads of the police and army on Sunday to discuss the state of emergency in Bangkok, a state-run television channel said, amid speculation that emergency rule could be lifted. Acting Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat was talking to army chief Anupong Paojinda and police chief Patcharawat Wongsuwan among other senior officials, state-controlled broadcaster MCOT said, adding that a news conference was expected later. Emergency rule was imposed 12 days ago in response to violent clashes between pro and anti-government groups in which one man was killed. Tension has fallen in the capital since then, although the political crisis is far from over. The ruling coalition has yet to agree on who should replace Samak Sundaravej, forced by the courts to resign as prime minister last week. Anti-government protesters have said they will not accept anyone from the Samak's People Power Party. The army has refused to use force to evict protesters of the People's Alliance for Democracy, who have been occupying the prime minister's official compound for nearly three weeks, so emergency rule has had little real impact. Army chief Anupong has called for it to be lifted because it was causing damage to the community and economy. It has also hurt Thailand's reputation abroad and put off tourists, already worried by the violence and by the airport disruption caused by anti-government protesters
