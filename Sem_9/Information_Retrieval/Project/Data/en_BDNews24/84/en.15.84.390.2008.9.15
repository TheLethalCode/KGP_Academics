<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Citycell B. League saw the second upset in three matches when visiting Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra stunned one-time giants Muktijoddha Sangsad 3-1 in their opening match at Bangabandhu National Stadium Monday. After defending champions Abahani went 2-1 down to league trailers Rahmatganj MFS, and title contenders Mohammedan drew 1-1 against Chittagong Abahani Limited, in the first two matches, there were doubts whether Muktijoddha Sangsad could avoid the a similar fate against lowly Khulna Abahani, who finished ninth last season. The All Red outfit looked to turn the corner after taking a lead in the 41st minute, with a goal from Rokonuzzaman Khanchan, before they conceded three goals in the second half to lose to Abahani for the first time. The hero of Abahani's victory was none other than a 20-year-old striker Mehdi Hasan, who struck two goals and fed Kazi Manjurul for the third. "We adopted a defensive strategy in the first half and then played attacking football in the second half, coming out successful, as we knew Muktijoddha's strengths after playing them in the Federation Cup where we supposed to win but went a goal down," Abahani coach Sheikh Hemayet told reporters after the match. "We had only four days practice before this match and there was a lack of combination in the side," said Muktijoddha Sangsad coach Ali Asghar, who guided Khulna Abahani last season. Asghar also blamed for poor refereeing. Muktijoddha captain Firoj Mahmud Hossain Titu grumbled: "How can be motivated players without any payment." Khulna Abahani could have taken a lead in the 35th minute had its captain Khalid Saifullah not missed the target from a spot kick, as referee Mizanur Rahman awarded them a penalty shot following Bipul Chandra's professional foul on Abahani's Faisal inside the danger zone. Muktijoddha came close to a lead in the 40th minute, but Abahani defender Sikander made a goal-line save to disappoint the freedom fighters' team, which nevertheless found the back of the opponent's net in the next minute. Khanchan broke the off-side trap to drive home, to put Muktijoddha ahead four minutes from break. After the breather, the visitors levelled the margin, capitalising on a fumble by keeper Nizam Majumdar who chased down Ashiqul's one-bounce shot instead of gripping it, and Mehdi tapped the ball home from close-range to equalise the margin eight minutes into the second half. Afterwards, Muktijoddha changed the attacking line, with substitute striker Murad Khan heading a curling cross home in the 66th minute but he was ruled off-side. In the 78th minute, Mehdi, in his B. League debut, struck his second from an angular shot to make the Abahani margin 2-1 and whipped in a nice cross for Monjurul, who headed home to seal the match for Abahani four minutes from time. Mehdi, who has scored 17 goals for third division Gazirchot and 13 goals for second division Agrani Bank this season, could have made a hat-trick, but the tiny striker saw his grounder that beat the opponent keeper cleared by a Muktijoddha defender in the 90th minute. bdn
