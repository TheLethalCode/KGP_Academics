<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court refused to hear government appeals on Monday challenging High Court stay orders on two graft cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Appellate Division Chamber Judge Jainul Abedin ordered the government to file leave to appeals with a regular bench against the High Court stay orders and set Oct 13 for the hearing. The High Court stayed the proceedings of the Niko and barge-mounted power plant graft cases on Aug 27, on Hasina's petitions challenging the legality of the cases. Attorney general Salauddin Ahmed represented the government Monday, with barrister Shafique Ahmed standing for Sheikh Hasina. After the chamber judge gave his, Shafique told reporters: "As soon as any order is given in favour of Hasina the government is rushing to file appeals. They don't seem friendly at all." He said the government must first scrap all the cases filed against Sheikh Hasina before sitting with her to discuss state affairs. The High Court, meanwhile, deferred the hearing on Hasina's bail petition in an extortion case filed by Azam J Chowdhury. The HC bench of judges Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman pushed back Hasina's bail hearing in the Azam J Chowdhury extortion case by one day, after additional attorney general Mansur Habib representing the government requested more time. Hasina sought bail in the case on Sunday, as well as a stay of the case proceedings in a petition challenging the legality of the case extortion case. bdnews24.com/
