 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  A decision on whether Abdul Jalil will be reinstated as general secretary will be made after Sheikh Hasina returns home, acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman has said. Whether the former Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil will again be made the ALGS will be decided after the AL president returns home, said the AL acting president Zillur Rahman Friday while talking to Speaking to Zillur reporters at his Gulshan home on Friday, Zillur said the party was not reinstating him on 'technical grounds' since Jalil had decided to retire from politics. Asked what the 'technical grounds' meant, Zillur said, "Jalil had resigned his party general secretary's position under special circumstances. His resignation issue is yet to be finalised." "Syed Ashraful Islam was asked to assume the role of the general secretary when the former incumbent Abdul Jalil had resigned." He termed Jalil's declaration on being bailed out that he would continue to act as party general secretary 'a hasty decision'. "Jalil could very well do without making such a hasty decision." Replying to another query, he said, "Jalil had declared that he'd quit politics." Asked if Hasina knew about Jalil being made to wait for a decision on the matter until her return, Zillur replied in the positive. Asked again if Hasina herself had approved of the stance on Jalil, Zillur smiled and said, "We all have decided the matter for the time being." That Jalil went up to place wreaths before Bangabandhu's portrait all alone indicated that the decision about the general secretary's office had already been taken. On how long it might take to reinstate Jalil as the general secretary, Zillur said, "As soon as the president of the party arrived." Asked if the party might be affected adversely by the fact that in the presence of the general secretary, the joint general secretary runs the general secretary's office, the party acting president said, "Jalil will always be with us. We have not lost him." On July 2, 2007, Jalil had notified the president and the chief adviser in writing of his decision to quit politics. A couple of days after, his wife Rehana Jalil at a press conference convened at their Gulshan home handed copies of Jalil's letter to reporters. The letter said Jalil had mentioned his sickness and family obligations as reasons for retiring from active politics. "I have decided to quit politics considering my failing health and the kids," he said. "The Awami League has now lost its democratic character and turned into an autocratic party. There is no way out of the iron grip of our president, who enjoys total authority, which has ruined the party today." Reporters failed to track Jalil Thursday, he couldn't be reached over telephone. His assistant Akram Hossain conveyed to reporters through the security personnel deployed at his home that Jalil wouldn't like to meet or speak with anybody. bdn
