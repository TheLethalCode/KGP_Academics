 Jahangirnagar University, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Authorities of Jahangirnagar University have cleared head of the drama and dramatics department Md Sanwar Hossain in a sex-scandal case. The decision, announced at 7pm Saturday after a special syndicate meeting, sparked widespread student unrest on the university campus. The students started their protests when vice chancellor Muniruzzaman and other syndicate members handed waiting reporters a press release stating that they had cleared Hossain of all charges of sexual harassment against four female students due to a lack of evidence. Students once again resorted to locking the vice-chancellor and other syndicate members from 7pm-9.30pm inside the administrative building to press their demand for sacking the accused teacher. The disgruntled students also blocked the road in front of the administrative building and ransack several buses parked in the transport bay. The incident also resulted in a number of injuries when police baton-charged the students in an attempt to bring the situation under control. The meeting had started under strict police protection at 2.30 in the afternoon, with 10 out of 12 syndicate members present. Around 12 platoon police were deployed at different locations in the campus. Police initially barred students from attempting to march on the administrative building, although a number succeeded in hearing the VC read out the decision from the press release. It was at this point that the syndicate members were forced to retreat to the safety of the administrative building and were subsequently locked in. Nazmul Alam, additional police super of Dhaka told bdnews24.com: "We work according to the order of the vice-chancellor." On July 29, the university authorities held a special syndicate meeting to discuss long-standing student demands for regulations to be enforced regarding sexual harassment, as well the allegations against Mr Hossain. That meeting concluded without any decision and students laid siege to the vice chancellor and other syndicate members in the university's administrative building overnight. The following day they were released on condition that the accused teacher is suspended and regulations regarding sexual harassment implemented by Aug 5. Chhatra Union president SM Shubho, leader of the protesting students, told bdnews24.com Tuesday: "We have held a demonstration today and will announce further action later." The original allegations were made on May 3 when four female students of the university's drama department submitted a written statement accusing the drama teacher of improprieties. A three-month boycott of the class ensued as demands for the removal of the teacher went on. The JU authorities have so far formed three different committees to investigate the allegations against Sanwar Hossain. bdnews24.com/corr/d
