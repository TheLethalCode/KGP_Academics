<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Russel KC held on to their nerves on Tuesday in the Citycell B. League with a hard-fought 3-2 win over Farashganj Sporting Club at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Sheikh Russel's win means the second edition professional football league saw no upset on the fourth day after three disappointing results in the first three days. Earlier, holders Abahani Limited went 2-1 down to minnows Rahmatganj MFS, runners-up Mohammedan struck a last-gasp penalty for a 1-1 draw against Chittagong Abahani Limited and struggling giants Muktijoddha Sangsad conceded 3-1 defeat to Khulna Abahani KC. Moroccan striker Touati Youness struck two while Alfaz Ahmed netted one for Sheikh Russel. Kabir Hossain and Mohammad Yousuf reduced the margin for Farashganj SC. "I am happy after securing full three points, but not satisfied with the boys' performance," said Sheikh Russel KC coach Wazed Gazi. "The boys failed to show even 50 percent of their spirit on the pitch as four players, including Alfaz and Youness, were fasting," said Gazi. Farashganj coach Kamal Ahmed Babu was said there was problem in the backline and the strike duo was totally shaky. No-one had clear dominance in the match, but Sheikh Russel's Mobarak Hossain Bhuiyan was an instrumental as the tiny stopper often ran down the right and threatened the opposition defence with dangerous crosses. Sheikh Russel, who finished fourth in the inaugural B. League, went ahead in the fifth minute when Alfaz, being set up by Moroccan playmaker Ighir Mohammad, dodged past a defender to find the back of Farashganj net with an angled shot. But, their lead was short-lived when Johnny sliced down Farashganj striker Yousuf inside the danger zone to award Farashganj a penalty. Their captain Kabir converted the spot kick to level the margin in the 17th minute. Then, Youness came close to putting his side again ahead, but the lanky striker's left-footer went straight to goalkeeper Al Amin. After the breather, Youness played a nice one-two down the right with Mobarak, who cut the ball back from the touchline and the Moroccan striker pushed the minus home facing no resistance from the defenders. Nine minutes later, Parvez Babu released a fine low cross for Youness, who saw his soft tap denied by the keeper. Farashganj captain Kabir gave Sheikh Russel keeper Titumir Chowdhury Titu a fright with a free kick from 30 yards in the 63rd minute. Yousuf levelled the Farashganj margin in the 77th minute with a well-judged header off a Kabuye Dominic free kick before Youness sealed the match converting a penalty five minutes from time. Defender Rasel Ansari unnecessarily brought Mobarak down inside the danger zone and referee Abdul Hannan did not hesitate to award Sheikh Russel a spot kick. Farahganj came close to an equaliser in the stoppage time when a Dominic shot narrowly went over the post. b
