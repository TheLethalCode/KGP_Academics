 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)--Gano Forum expressed concern Monday over the government's recent moves toward "an understanding" with Awami League and BNP ahead of the next parliamentary polls. Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain raised questions about the government's plans to sit the two former prime ministers and party chiefs together. Dr Kamal's comments come as the government is pressing to hold a meeting between Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina with the mediation of lawyer Rafique-ul-Huq, who defends both former prime ministers in court against corruption charges. He said the government could neither hold fair polls nor establish a vibrant democracy by reaching agreements with "corrupt" people. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, in his latest briefing on the subject, told reporters Monday that the government wants to restore political faith and democratic norms by trying to get a Hasina and Khaleda to sit together. "Making arrangements for the two leaders to sit across the table is not the government's only task. But it has a symbolic significance," he said. The Gano Forum president alleged that the government's anticorruption drive had resulted in the end by appeasing the corrupt people. "The caretaker government's initiative, disclosed by its spokesperson, for an understanding (between the two) for the sake of holding elections is unacceptable," Kamal Hossain said in a press statement after a meeting of his party's standing committee at his residence. "The deals and promises on which the government has reached agreements (with Khaleda and Hasina) should be made clear to people. The negotiation process should be transparent," he said. In reply to a question, he said: "We want consensus. But we don't want an understanding for those breaking laws." bdnews2
