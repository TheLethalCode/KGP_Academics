 MANCHESTER, England, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United fans will welcome back Cristiano Ronaldo on his return from injury on Wednesday despite the winger's desire for a move in the close season, manager Alex Ferguson said. Portugal international Ronaldo, now recovered from ankle surgery, is set to face Villarreal as United begin their Champions League defence at Old Trafford. "He said he would like to go to Real Madrid (but) when I had the meeting with him that was it finished. He understood my position and the club's position and he's got on with it," Ferguson told reporters on Tuesday. "He's accepted it like a professional and there's not been one problem since. "I think they (the supporters) understand the situation. He's a young man who's been tempted by the lure of money and away, but since we gave him our decision he has accepted it well and his training has been absolutely fantastic." Ferguson added: "He's probably been one of the best patients I've ever seen. He's been in every day right through until five o'clock and he's had a real determination to get back to playing for us. He's well ahead of schedule and that's credit to him. "There are no issues at all regarding Cristiano. He's shown a fantastic maturity in the past few weeks, accepting the situation and getting on with it. There has been no pettiness and no throwing the toys out of the pram." Ronaldo's 42 goals last season under-pinned United's double-winning effort in the Champions League and English Premier League and the return of the 23-year-old winger could not be better timed for Ferguson's side following a stuttering start to the season. "Even if we had won (at Liverpool) on Saturday it would still be a lift because we are talking about a truly magnificent player. He will be involved and hopefully that's the start of him back again," said Ferguson, who suggested that Ronaldo will start the Group E game on the bench. The last time United were paired with Villarreal in the group stages of the competition they failed to qualify, twice drawing 0-0 with the Spanish side in 2005/06. New signing Dimitar Berbatov is rated doubtful for United as the Bulgarian striker has a swollen knee sustained in Saturday's defeat at Liverpool, while Ferguson said Michael Carrick sustained a cracked bone in his foot during that game and will be out for between four and six weeks
