<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  A last-gasp strike from Alamu Bukola Olaleken pulled Mohammedan Sporting Club from the brink to a 1-1 draw against Chittagong Abahani Limited in their Citycell B. League opening match Sunday. Mithun Chowdhury put Abahani ahead in the 81sth minute only for Olaleken to score from a spot kick in the dying minutes at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Mohammedan, the Federation Cup champions, were a pale shadow of their selves against the port city team, who finished 10th last season. Olaleken's shots had no direction shot and the lanky striker, the Federation Cup's topscorer, barely caused problems in the Abahahi danger zone. Two other foreign recruits Egyptian Hazem Khaled Mahmood and Nigerian Dami Emmanuel  had also a day-off in the midfield, allowing the opponents frequently to go into attack. "The boys played well, but there was a lack of concentration among the players," said Mohammedan's coach Maruful Haq. He said, "There might be problems with the system, team management or me." It was, however, learnt that trio had yet to get paid in full and were reluctant to walk out onto the pitch. Mohammedan appeared resigned to concede the game to Abahahi, who did not have any stars except three Nepalese players  striker Santosh Shahukhal, defender Lok Bandhu and goalkeeper Kiran Kumar Limbu. "We targeted at least a draw and I'm happy after securing a point against the Federation Cup champions," said coach Abul Kashem, adding that the referee could have waved away the last- minute penalty appeal. Abahani came close to taking the lead in the 11th minute when Santosh rattled the sidebar with a head off a Roy cross. A minute later, Mohammedan striker Robin, second highest scorer in Federation Cup, darted in the box to release Bukola, who ran fast instead of receiving the ball to waste a fine opportunity. Abahani goalkeeper Limbu palmed a Sharif cross away in the 25th minute while Olaleken drove meekly from a good position two minutes from the break. Abahani looked more energetic after the break as Santosh hammered a powerful curving shot that narrowly missed the target in the 65th minute before the Nepalese striker fed Mithun for the lead. Mithun shrugged off his marker Jewel Rana to smash the ball past netminder Aminul Haq to put Abahani ahead in the 81st minute. Mohammedan pressed hard for the equaliser and came close when Robin curved a shot just wide off the far post just one minute from time. The next minute, parity was restored when Robin was brought down by defender Lok Bondhu inside the box. Referee Azad Rahman did not hesitate to award Mohammedan the penalty and Olaleken gleefully made the most. b
