Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui placed the proposal on Khaleda's lifetime leadership, secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after the meeting. Khaleda called the 'urgent' meeting of the party's top policymaking body, beginning at 4.30pm, to discuss a schedule and agenda for BNP's planned dialogue with the government among other urgent issues stemming from her release, a party official had earlier told bdnews24.com. Delwar said Khaleda's meeting with four advisers and her conversation with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed by phone on Friday were high on the meeting agenda. The meeting also okayed the appointment of Delwar as secretary general of the party and approved his decisions during Khaleda's detention, he told reporters after the meeting. On dialogue with the government, Delwar said: "Date and time have not been fixed yet. We will fix them after talks with four-party alliance leaders. We will then inform the government about it."
