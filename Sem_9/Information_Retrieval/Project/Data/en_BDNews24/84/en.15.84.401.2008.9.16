 Melbourne,Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's biggest terrorism trial ended on Tuesday with a seventh Muslim man found guilty of terrorism, a day after a Muslim cleric and five followers were convicted of planning an attack in Melbourne in 2005. The trial saw 12 Muslims facing terror charges over plans to attack a grand final football match in Australia's second-largest city, Melbourne, attended by 97,000 fans. The attack, aimed at forcing Australia to withdraw troops from Iraq, did not take place. Four of the men were found not guilty and the jury could not reach a verdict on one, who may face a fresh trial. The Victoria state Supreme Court on Tuesday found Amer Haddara, 28, guilty of being a member of an unnamed terrorist organization. On Monday, Muslim cleric Abdul Benbrika, 48, was found guilty of leading and being a member of an unnamed terrorist body, while five followers were found guilty of being members of a terrorist group. Four other men were acquitted. Submissions for sentencing will be heard in November. Australia has never suffered a major peacetime attack on home soil, but more than 90 Australians were killed in bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali since 2002. Australia withdrew its 550 combat troops from Iraq in June 2008, but still has about 1,000 troops in Afghanistan
