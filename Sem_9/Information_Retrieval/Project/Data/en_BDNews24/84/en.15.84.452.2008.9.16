 Washington,Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Tuesday on a comprehensive energy package that would open most of the U.S. coastline to offshore drilling, a Democratic aide said on Monday. The package proposed by Democrats would give states the option to allow drilling between 50 and 100 miles (80 and 160 km) off their shores. Areas more than 100 miles from the coast would be completely open to oil exploration. Until recently, Democratic leaders in Congress strongly opposed lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling, saying drilling would have only a small impact on gasoline prices in the immediate future. But as gasoline prices rose to levels above $4 a gallon this summer, public opinion shifted in favor of offshore drilling. Republicans made removing the ban on drilling a key campaign issue for their party in this election year. Facing the possibility of the moratorium expiring on September 30 and the changing voter sentiments, Democrats offered support for repealing the ban as part of a larger energy package. Republicans, however, have accused Democrats of putting forward a bill that seems to promote offshore drilling, but would do little to expand domestic production. "Regrettably, if not accidentally, this bill removes the financial incentive for coastal states to team up with the federal government to break our dependence on foreign oil and bring down prices at the pump," Republican Rep. Roy Blunt of Missouri said in a column on Monday. Opponents of the bill say states will not want to open their coasts to drilling without a revenue-sharing plan. In addition, some say that only allowing drilling at least 50 miles from shore closes off a great deal of the outer continental shelf where oil may be located. Democrats counter their package would lift the moratorium on offshore drilling on 319 million acres (129 million hectares) to 404 million acres off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They added that states would be motivated to open their shores to exploration because jobs would be created and it would boost their economies
