<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The high-ups of the Bangladesh Cricket Board Monday passed a busy day meeting among themselves and with contracted cricketers following the issue of six players' plea for retirement from international as well as domestic cricket. Former captain Habibul Bashar along with opener Shahriar Nafees, middle-order Aftab Ahmed, all-rounder Farhad Hossain, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh, spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel Sunday applied for retirement from all forms of cricket, intending to play in the breakaway Indian Cricket League, though they had not cited reasons. The board officials discussed the matter with nine cricketers out of 20 contracted players  Shakib Al Hasan, Abdur Razzak, Mushfiqur Rahim, Roqibul Hassan, Mahmudullah Riad, Junaed Siddique, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Shahadat Hossain Razib and Syed Rassel, who were available. Apart from the nine, captain Mohammad Ashraful is in a leisure period in England, vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza is attending to a relative, opener Tamim Iqbal is in his home town of Chittagong and pacer Sajidul Islam is in Sri Lanka with the GP-BCB academy team. The Board made them to understand they would be able to earn a lot of money in the next three years as per the schedule and asked them to refrain from falling into the ICL trap. It was reported that Habibul Bashar would earn about Tk 1.5 crore if he signed a three-year contract with the ICL. "We have presented our schedules before the players and shown them how many one-day internationals and Tests Bangladesh will play in the next three years and also showed that each of them would be able to earn at least Tk 1.15 crore to 1.5 crore in the next three years if they played for Bangladesh," said Gazi Ashraful Hossain Lipu, the chairman of the cricket operations. Lipu also hinted that players' salary structure might be revised over time. It was learnt that the cricketers who appeared before the board assured the officials that they would not join the ICL. In another development, the board Monday called Mahbubul Karim, one of the players - who reportedly was to join the ICL and on a current tour with the GP-BCB academy team in Sri Lanka, back home. "At first, he (Karim) denied his involvement with the ICL, but later confessed following repeated queries by selector Akram Khan and academy operations manager Khaled Mahmud," said Shakil Kashem, the chairman of the BCB Game Development Committee. The former national cricketer said that Akram and Mahmud had tried to make him understand, but failed, and so they felt there was no reason to keep him with the academy team. He said that Jahurul Islam Omee would soon join the academy side in place of Karim. Apart from the above mentioned six players, retired spinner Mohammad Rafique, Alok Kapali, Nazim Uddin, Manjurul Islam, Tapash Kumar Baishya, Mohammad Sharif, Mahbubul Karim and Golam Mabud were reportedly to join the ICL, that the International Cricket Council, the game's global governing body, did not recognise.
