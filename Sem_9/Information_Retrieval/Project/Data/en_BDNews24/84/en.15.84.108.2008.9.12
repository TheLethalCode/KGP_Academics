 Bangkok, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's parliament postponed a vote on Friday for a new prime minister, expected to be sacked leader Samak Sundaravej, heading off an immediate collision with protesters hell-bent on blocking his return to office. House speaker Chai Chidchob pushed back the special House of Representatives session to Wednesday after many MPs failed to turn up, suggesting 24 hours of back-room wheeling and dealing in his six-party coalition had failed to reach a conclusion. Around 70 MPs from Samak's People Power Party (PPP) had threatened to skip the vote, saying they needed more time to choose a prime minister. "We want it to be postponed because we want more time to find someone who is acceptable to all sides," PPP MP Areepen Uttarasin told TPBS TV before the abortive session started. Samak's return to office only three days after a court found him guilty of a conflict of interest for hosting TV cooking shows would have intensified a three-month-old street campaign against him and his government. The People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), whose occupation of Samak's Government House compound is now in its third week, said they would not accept Samak or any other PPP member as prime minister. Police with shields guarded parliament, where hundreds of government supporters were gathered, raising fears of a potential clash with anti-government demonstrators camped a few kilometres away in Samak's official compound. The Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that Samak, accused by the PAD of being a puppet for ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, broke the law in hosting cooking shows on commercial television while in office. The court's ruling against 73-year-old Samak removed him from office but did not ban him from returning. The main stock index opened higher after the vote delay. The stock market has fallen around 25 percent since the PAD launched its street campaign at the end of May, triggering policy paralysis at a time of stuttering economic growth and decade-high inflation. The postponement simply puts on hold the fundamental conflict between the rural and urban poor who supported Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, and Bangkok's middle and upper classes who despise him
