 Morelia, Mexico,Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Explosions ripped through a crowd of people celebrating Mexican independence day in a western city, killing at least three revelers and wounding about 50, the Michoacan state government said. The explosions in the center of Morelia late on Monday might have been caused by grenades, El Universal daily said. Morelia is the capital of Michoacan, a state hit in recent years by drug gang violence. More than 2,700 people have been killed in Mexico this year as violence between drug gangs spins out of control despite a military crackdown. "The government condemns in the strongest terms the violent acts in the city of Morelia during independence day celebrations and will double efforts to support the state of Michoacan," President Felipe Calderon's office said in a statement.

The first explosion in Morelia went off at 11 p.m. at the height of a re-enactment of the bell-ringing, an emotional ceremony known as "El Grito" or "The Shout.
