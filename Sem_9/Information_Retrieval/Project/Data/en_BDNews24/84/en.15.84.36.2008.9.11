 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia, on the day of her release, has said her party will take part in electoral dialogue and general elections, while elder son Tarique Rahman will be removed from politics until he fully recovers from illness. "BNP wants to attend the talks. It wants to contest the polls too," Khaleda said, addressing cheering party workers at the BNP headquarters in Naya Paltan. "The four-party alliance will take part in the polls and form the next government with support of the people," the former prime minister said. Terming the 'division' within BNP as media propaganda, the former prime minister said: "I will work with all." "Those who were with the BNP when I went to jail are still with the party. I ask them to work together." "The BNP is united and will stay united in future," she said. Khaleda asked the government to create a congenial atmosphere for the elections and withdraw the state of emergency. On upazila polls, she said: "We want upazila polls. Of course, we want them. But they have to be after the parliamentary polls." Khaleda reached her Dhaka Cantonment home at around 5.20pm, after walking out on bail from special jail in the morning, having spent one year in custody facing a slew of graft charges. She went to the party headquarters after visiting son Tarique Rahman at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Tarique, her political heir apparent, was released from detention on bail on Sep 3. Quoting doctors, the former prime minister said: "It may take my son up to three years to fully recover from his illness. He will stay away from politics until he recovers completely." She alleged her two sons had tortured illegally in custody. The former prime minister had driven to her cantonment home to take iftar after visiting her slain husband's graveside. She arrived at the former president Ziaur Rahman's grave site at noon and paid her respects there. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, SQ Chowdhury, Hannan Shah and Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and other senior leaders were present. She thanked her countrymen, party leaders, workers, allies, and her lawyers, for helping release her from detention through legal process. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told those gathered at the special jail at 11.30am that the BNP chief was now free to go home. Senior BNP leaders had already arrived at the grave to greet their chief. Hundreds shouted slogans as her heavily-guarded cream-coloured Pajero reached the grave complex. Thousands also thronged the Sangsad Bhaban premises when she left the special jail flanked by daughter-in-law Zubaida Rahman and granddaughter Zaima Rahman. Siddiqui had earlier said authorities had received the documents at 6:45pm Wednesday, and she would be freed anytime Thursday. Bail bonds for former Khaleda were submitted by lawyers earlier Wednesday to four separate courts handling the GATCO, Niko, Zia Orphanage Trust and Barapukuria cases. Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year in GATCO graft case. Later, three more graft cases were filed against her. She secured bail in all the cases. bdnews24.com/sum/gma/s
