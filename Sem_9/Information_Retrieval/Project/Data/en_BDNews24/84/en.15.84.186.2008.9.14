<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said on Sunday the government has contacted barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, counsel for the Awami League and BNP chiefs standing trial on a raft of graft charges, to get them to sit across the table to discuss political issues. He said they had discussed with barrister Huq what issues the former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia could discuss. Barrister Huq, now in Singapore, had said on Sept 9 after Khaleda got bail in the last two of the four cases, that the two top leaders should sit together instead of mudslinging and offered his house as a possible venue for the meeting. Hasina, now in the United States for better treatment, has dismissed any dialogue with her arch political rival while she is on parole, acting AL president Zillur Rahman said on Friday. Khaleda, released on bail on Sept 11 after a year's detention, agreed to consider meeting Hasina at a meeting with four advisers, including Hossain Zillur, at her house on Friday night. "We have entered a new phase, where the role and responsibility of the politicians are more than ours. Now the main task lies with them," Hossain Zillur told reporters at a briefing after a meeting with communications adviser Ghulam Quader at his Secretariat office. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff was present in the meeting and the press briefing. "They will need to decide how they will go about the elections. However, we are definitely proceeding towards polls," Hossain Zillur said. "The government wants political transition alongside election. Political transition is mainly the foundation of electoral transition. So we are working to create an enabling and trustworthy environment. "They will decide how they will come forward. We want a change to political culture. So we are giving emphasis on the proposal given by the counsel for the two leaders to get them to sit across the table." Barrister Huq's initiative was very important towards the government efforts on bringing about the political transition and a change to the political culture, he said. Alongside different initiatives the civil society would have to put pressure on the two leaders to sit and talk. "A positive atmosphere has now been created in the country. Even in such situation some mud-slinging are there. We will have to come out of the culture and make positive and qualitative improvement." Replying to a question as whether initiative is being taken to bring the two leaders a cross the table during the Ramadan, the adviser said, the Ramadan is the month of self purification. At this stage we can use the message contained in the Ramadan which will bring positive result for the country, nation and the groups. Asked whether the BNP's decision on Saturday that Khaleda will lead that party for life would hinder the government's political reform process, he said, "Let the sentiments of the common people surface from society. We'll rather not make comment in a haste because we hear it has some positive sides also." On the demand for permanent release of Hasina, he said, "It is a legal matter. She will have to take initiative for that. "As far as we know, they [the Awami League] have taken initiatives. The court is independent. We don't interfere with court affairs. We are hopeful of positive results." bdne
