 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Abdul Jalil on Thursday officially resumed work as Awami League general secretary and demanded authorities unconditionally release party chief Sheikh Hasina first and hold general elections before Upazila polls. He aired the demands after offering flowers at independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's portrait in Dhanmandi at 10:30am. "Paying respects to Bangabandhu here, I resume discharging the responsibilities as the Awami League general secretary. My challenge will be to take forward the campaign for establishing democratic practices in the country," said Jalil. "I'll continue to work to pave the way for the Awami League to win the elections polls under Sheikh Hasina's leadership." It's Hasina only, who is capable of rebuilding the nation as a prosperous one, he said. He sought the people's cooperation in discharging his duties as the AL general secretary. "I'll embark immediately on the battle to free Sheikh Hasina unconditionally and facilitate her assuming the leadership of our people as soon as possible." Taking questions from reporters, he said, "I want the parliamentary polls are held first, which is also my party's verdict." Asked if they would convene a council to change the party constitution before registering with the Election Commission, he said, "If need be, we'll do that. There's no harm calling a party council, you see." Jalil was accompanied by Abdul Mannan Khan, Sahara Khatun, Yafes Osman, Khalid Mahmud and over 100 party supporters. bdn
