<TEXT>
 MADRID, September 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid sports director Predrag Mijatovic has defended the club from criticism that they failed to add top quality players in the summer transfer market. The Spanish champions were unsuccessful in their attempts to lure Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo, Valencia striker David Villa and Villarreal winger Santi Cazorla to the Bernabeu during the close season. On the final day of the transfer window, they reluctantly sold Brazil forward Robinho to Manchester City after the player insisted he wanted to leave, prompting criticism from local media that the squad was short on quality for the new campaign. "We can function very well without Cristiano Ronaldo or David Villa. The first year I was here we did well without Kaka (a player president Ramon Calderon had promised to buy) and we won two leagues without him," Mijatovic told Real Madrid television. "Real Madrid is above individual players even if they are the best in the world. "We had conversations with Manchester United and they didn't want to let Cristiano Ronaldo go. We made an offer for David Villa but did not want to pay what Valencia asked for him." Real have strengthened their squad with the signing of Netherlands midfielder Rafael van der Vaart, the recall of two former youth team players from loan spells with other Primera Liga clubs, Javi Garcia and Ruben de la Red, and Argentina defender Ezequiel Garay. 'COMPETITIVE TEAM' The 21-year-old Garay is to play on loan with Racing Santander this season. "Although it may seem like we have not signed anyone we have landed four players you can rely on," he added. "We have a squad of 24 and this is ample. We do not plan to make any signings in the winter transfer window, although you never know what may happen in football. "We have a competitive team, capable of competing at a national level and in the Champions League, and we should not be worried." Mijatovic added that Real were not concerned their power in the transfer market would wane due to the arrival of major investors in world football, such as the Abu Dhabi-based company that bought Manchester City. "I am not worried because great football players want to achieve genuine success and if they want to chose between a good contract and playing for Real Madrid, I don't think they will hesitate in their decision," Mijatovic sai
