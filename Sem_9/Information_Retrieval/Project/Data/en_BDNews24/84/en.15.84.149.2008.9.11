 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Football Federation is planning to introduce an annual salary structure for national footballers, an official said on Thursday. "We are thinking of a salary structure for initially 15 to 20 national players round the year and the players will be bracketed in category A, B and C depending on their performances," said BFF vice president and national team management committee chairman Badal Roy. Roy said they had a plan to give at least Tk 10,000 for the C category players and Tk 20,000 for the A category players, but a final decision has yet to be made. The former national footballer, however, said everything depended on how much money was available from the team sponsor. He also said they had already started communicating with some corporate houses, including a mobile phone manufacturer, who were interested in sponsoring the national team. The country's football governing body also plans to insure all national players before they leave here for Malaysia to play the Mardeka Cup, scheduled for Oct 15-25. National coach Shafiqul Islam Manik Thursday noon sat with all 30 players called into the national squad to discuss about the upcoming camp. "I let them know that they should perform well in the B. League before starting the camp on Sept 26. Being national footballers they must show positive attitude and behaviour and not do anything wrong on the pitch during the league matches," Manik told bdnews24.com. Manik said the players had agreed to join the camp during the vacation of the Eid-ul-Fitr "in greater interests of the country". The footballer-turned-coach said his intention was to conduct the camp outside Dhaka, specially at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. However, the matter would be finalised at the meeting with the national team management committee. Manik said Abahani striker Mehdi Hasan Ujjal had requested the federation to release him from the national team, citing personal reasons. b
