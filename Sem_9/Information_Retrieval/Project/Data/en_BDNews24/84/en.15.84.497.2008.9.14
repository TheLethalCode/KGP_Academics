 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Staff Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  The taskforce on the Buriganga, whose water has turned pitch black because of the dumping of millions of tonnes of human and industrial waste, will recommend a committee to oversee maintenance of the river and canals of the city. It will also ask the government to stop sand-lifting and leasing out banks of the river, taskforce chief Inam Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com in an interview on Saturday. The ex-secretary said a final report on the present condition of Buriganga river, which is the country's main waterway for trading and ferry travel, would be on the table early next month. The Water and Sewage Authority (Wasa) would be asked to set up effluent treatment plant to keep Buriganga free of pollution, he said. Illegal structures that have sprung up along its banks have narrowing the river and adding to the dirt, while ferries spill oil into its waters, where fish that had choked to death float. "Waste is one of the key reasons of Buriganga pollution. It must be stopped," the taskforce chief said. More than 60,000 cubic metres of toxic waste  textile dying, printing, washing and pharmaceuticals  enter the Dhaka canals and river system every day. Nearly four million people directly suffer the consequence of its poor water quality, according to experts. Industrial waste accounts for 60 percent of the total river pollution followed by municipal waste and improper handling of other pollutants, they say. The taskforce, formed on June 8, is also thinking it over if some waters of the Jamuna can be used to speed up the flow of Buriganga, once the lifeline of Dhaka City. He said "Some progress has been made in line with the taskforce's recommendations. Some areas of Buriganga and the canals have been freed from grabbers. Sutivola canal has been reclaimed from encroachers." "Excavation of the canal that was silted up began Thursday." The former secretary said Buriganga river has been narrowed by illegal structures. Water flow slowed as the canals almost died. "Many people don't know that there was a canal in Segunbagicha. Dholai Khal has been filled out." "There were 26 canals through the capital city of Dhaka. Many of them do not exist anymore. But they were necessary for navigability of Buriganga," Chowdhury said. He stressed mutual understanding to recover the canals as legal complexity would take much longer to settle the matter. He blamed both legal and illegal occupiers, and the government for the dying river. "Waters are terribly contaminated. Aquatic life do not exist in Buriganga. Ecosystem has been destroyed," he said. According to Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority, about 3,500 illegal establishments mushroomed along the 26-kilometre banks of Buriganga and 2,000 of them were evicted. Chowdhury said, "Rajuk does not have a detail area planning. It's unfortunate." bdnew
