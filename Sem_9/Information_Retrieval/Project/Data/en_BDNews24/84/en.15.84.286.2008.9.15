<TITLE> Govt names New Delhi bomb suspects as anger rises </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police said on Monday they were closing in on several Muslim suspects after bombs killed 21 people in New Delhi at the weekend, but anger and frustration grew over their failure to prevent recent attacks. Police identified Abdul Subhan Qureshi, a convent-educated computer expert and member of a banned Islamic students' group, as the chief suspect in the New Delhi attack, and said he was also involved in bombing Ahmedabad in July. They are also looking for a man they named as Qayamuddin, also known as Ashfaque. "We are close to cracking the case," Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said. "We have picked up some people." The Indian media did not echo the optimism of the police after bombings in four major cities killed more than 150 people in recent months. In each case, suspects were named and Muslims were rounded up, but the attacks continue. "What's changed?" asked an editorial in the Indian Express newspaper on Monday. Police are massively understaffed and under-resourced. There is no central database of militant suspects and little time for meticulous investigations. "We have not had a dedicated task force to look into the deficiencies in our counter-terrorism mechanism," said B. Raman, a former head of India's spy agency RAW. "We need a central investigation agency for counter-terrorism to build up a cadre of dedicated investigation officers." MUSLIMS ALIENATED Others say part of the problem stems from a sense of alienation among India's minority Muslims, many of whom feel government efforts to stamp out Islamist militancy often victimise the entire community. Alienation was also fuelled by communal riots in Gujarat in 2002, when around 2,500 people, mostly Muslims, were hacked and burnt to death. Little has been done to catch the culprits despite a national outcry. "Immediately after the Delhi blasts, the government has again started persecuting innocent Muslims by dragging them from their homes for questioning," Maulana Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the chief cleric of Jama Masjid, India's largest mosque, told Reuters. "Please stop this immediately across India or face the anger of Muslims in India." Experts say politicians need to understand that India's Muslim population is beginning to provide recruits for militant groups, especially after the Gujarat riots. They say politicians often skirt the issue because they want Muslim support. India's main Hindu-nationalist opposition, which accuses the centrist Congress party-led government of following a policy of appeasement, wants the reinstatement of a tough anti-terrorism law it promoted when it was in power. Indian newspapers also want strong action. "We are at war," said an editorial in the Times of India. "When the country is at war, there cannot be any half measures to hit back and contain the enemy." Congress says the earlier law was misused to harass Muslims under the previous Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Recurrent militant attacks, analysts say, could offer the opposition BJP a campaign plank for national polls due next year. "There is a mood of insecurity among people in the cities," said Mahesh Rangarajan, a political analyst. "So many incidents have happened that people might identify with what the BJP is saying. But it is too early to say how voters will react."
