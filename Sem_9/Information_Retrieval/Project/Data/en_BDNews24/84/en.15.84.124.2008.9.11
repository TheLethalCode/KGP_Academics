<TITLE> Hasina's freedom before any talks: Zillur </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman Thursday demanded unconditional release of Sheikh Hasina before the government makes any plans to sit the two leaders of the two rival political parties across the table. "If the government can solve the problem by putting the two leaders across the table, that is all to the good." "But Sheikh Hasina has to be given unconditional release. Sheikh Hasina will not sit with anybody while under confinement, not even with the president." Zillur spoke to reporters at his Gulshan home Thursday afternoon, in response to commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman's earlier statement that the caretaker government would take the initiative to bring former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia together for talks. Said Zillur: "I do not know how and why an adviser of the government said this." His reaction to Khaleda Zia's release on bail was: "Very good." "We do not believe in wilful injustice to anybody. If a person is proved guilty, they will have to be punished. But no one has the right to keep a person confined for nothing." "But Awami League leaders are still behind bars without bail. The law should be equal for all. None of these people will flee if they are given bail," he added. bdnews
