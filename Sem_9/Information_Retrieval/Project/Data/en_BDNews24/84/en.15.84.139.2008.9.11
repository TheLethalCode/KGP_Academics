 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)Tarique formally quit the political scene, leaving a note at the airport, resigning from his post as BNP senior joint secretary general, as he boarded the London-bound flight, a highly placed government source said Thursday night. Zia International Airport security chief Md Nurul Islam told bdnews24.com that he flew out by an Emirates flight at 9:50pm. Wife, daughter, a doctor and two other relatives were with him on board while mother Khaleda Zia rested at her home in the Dhaka cantonment. The elder son and political heir apparent of the former prime minister left BSMMU Hospital by ambulance shortly before 7pm, just hours after meeting his freed mother. Khaleda was released on bail from special jail Thursday morning after securing bail in four graft cases. Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman, daughter Zaima Rahman, doctor Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon and two other relatives are accompanying him to London, his lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan had earlier told bdnews24.com. BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah told reporters earlier that Khaleda wished to see her ailing son, who was expected to leave Wednesday, before he left the country. Tarique, who was arrested on March 8, last year, was released from BSMMU hospital prison cell on Sept 3, after securing bail in 12 cases. He remained under treatment at the hospital on release. His mother and younger brother Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year in GATCo graft case. Coco is now in Thailand for better medical treatment on bail. bdn
