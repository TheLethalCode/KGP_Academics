<TEXT>
 Yangon,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Army-ruled Myanmar's state media blamed unnamed "insurgents" on Saturday for bomb attacks that killed two people and wounded 10 last week. A man and woman were killed on Thursday when a bomb exploded in a video store in Kyaukkyi Township of Bago Division, about 120 miles north of the former capital, Yangon, the Kyemon newspaper said. Nine others were wounded in the blast. Separately, a villager in the same township was wounded by a bomb that exploded in a bamboo grove, the newspaper said. It said officials had accused "insurgents" of orchestrating the attacks, but gave no further details. Last week state media accused a group led by prominent rights activist Myint Aye of masterminding similar previous attacks. The military, which has ruled the former Burma since 1962, often points the finger of blame at anti-government dissident groups, comprising ethnic armed groups fighting for greater autonomy and exiled pro-democracy groups
