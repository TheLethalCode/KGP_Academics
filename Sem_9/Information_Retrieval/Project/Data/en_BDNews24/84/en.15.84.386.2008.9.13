<TITLE> Rahmatganj upset Abahani in B. League opener </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Citycell B. League started with an upset when defending champions Abahani Limited went 2-1 down to the bottomside Rahmatganj MFS in the opener at Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. Emeka Christian gave the Sky Blue outfit a lead in the 21st minute while Idris Kairye restored the Rahmatganj parity eight minutes into the second half and NCHE Francis sealed the match for the Old Dhaka outfit, who went 7-0 down against the same rivals in the second leg match of the inaugural edition last year. Abahani coach Amolesh Sen surprisingly picked up injured midfielder Mainul Islam and Pranotosh Kumar instead of Mehdi Hasan Ujjal and Abdul Hossain and it paid the Dhanmondi-based outfit a heavy price in the loss of control over the midfield throughout the game. The popular Sky Blue outfit also felt the absence of holding midfielder Arif Khan Joy and reliable defender Mohammedan Sujan with both players nursing their injuries and the title contenders seemed disorganised in both midfield and the backline, comprising Nazrul Islam, Ibnul Siraji, Samad Yussif and Wali Faisal. Abahani players seemed more relaxed on the pitch after taking a lead as they could think that they would easily demolish their minnow opponents and at the end the scenario was a contrary one. The things could have been worse for Abahani in term of goal difference as Abahani defenders could hardly guard Rahmatganj's trio-- Francis, Idris and Hirok, who often broke their defence to threaten Abahani goalkeeper Biplob Bhattacharya. "Nothing went in favour of us in the game and all three departments played poorly," said Amolesh adding the performances of the defenders were not up to mark. "It was an outcome of hard working," said Rahmatganj coach Golam Jilani adding that Abahani perhaps took them lightly and they paid the cost. Abahani, however, made the first attack in the sixth minute when striker Jahid Hasan Emily's header ricocheted off Rahmatganj goalkeeper Mohammad Ali and Emeka sent the follow-up wide to spoil a good opportunity. Emeka, the highest scorer in the inaugural B. League for Mohammedan SC, put Abahani ahead in the 21st minute as the tall striker rose high to head a Jahid Parvez Chowdhury corner past the opponent goalkeeper Mohammad Ali. Abahani striker Emily was totally unanimous in the match except his lone move in the first half when the local best striker darted in the danger zone to smash the ball straight to keeper Ali in the 30th minute. Hirok gave Abahani a scare just five minutes from break and unmarked Idris, capitalisong on a Hanif cross, headed home to level the margin for Rahmatganj eight minutes into the second half. Five minutes later, Idris fed Francis, whose grounder to the far post kissed the Abahani net though keeper Biplob tried jumping to his right to stop it. After going two goals down, the Abahani coach sent midfielders Ujjal, Abul and striker Tipu but they could not change the fortune though Ujjal got into a better position to drive wide from a close range to spoil an equaliser in the 76th minute. Abahani could have at least left the field with a draw, but substitute Tipu disappointed the Sky Blue outfit taking a poor shot inside the danger zone when a clever shot was needed to find the back of Rahmatganj net.
