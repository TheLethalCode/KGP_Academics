 ROME, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serie A champions Inter Milan came from behind to beat Catania 2-1 with 10 men at the San Siro on Saturday thanks to an own goal from Christian Terlizzi. Gianvito Plasmati headed the visitors in front against the run of play on 42 minutes but Inter levelled almost immediately when Serie A debutant Ricardo Quaresma's attempted cross took a big deflection off Giuseppe Mascara on its way into the net. The hosts got another lucky break three minutes into the second half when defender Terlizzi's header was adjudged to have gone in off the post, although it was not clear on television replays whether the ball had crossed the line. Inter's Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari had been shown a straight red card on the stroke of halftime for shoving his hand into the face of Giacomo Tedesco, who fell theatrically. Catania boss Walter Zenga was given a warm reception on his return to the San Siro, where he kept Inter's goal in Serie A for 11 years between 1983 and 1994. The win puts Inter top with four points from two games before the rest of the Serie A programme on Sunday when AC Milan visit Genoa and Juventus host Udinese. "It's three important points for us. It was a fantastic effort from the players in 10," Inter boss Jose Mourinho told Sky television. "The team is working together a lot. I think that's how you win championships. Sometimes you win 3-0 or 4-0, other times you win like today." Earlier, Fabrizio Miccoli struck twice as Palermo beat injury-hit AS Roma 3-1 at home to give new coach Davide Ballardini a winning start. Miccoli cancelled out Brazil striker Julio Baptista's eighth-minute opener with a stunning right-footed shot into the top corner from the edge of the box 12 minutes later. The forward ran on to a Fabio Simplicio through ball and chipped home in the 57th before Uruguayan Edinson Cavani sealed the win in the 73rd after another smart pass from Simplicio. Without regulars Simone Perrotta, Juan, Philippe Mexes, Mirko Vucinic and captain Francesco Totti, Roma's injury woes worsened when Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi came off before half time after suffering a knock to the back of his head. Last year's runners-up Roma, who were held 1-1 by Napoli two weeks ago, have one point from two games. Palermo have three after the 3-1 defeat at Udinese on the first day that cost former boss Stefano Colantuono his job
