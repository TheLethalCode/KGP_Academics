 PARIS, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stock index futures were mixed early on Tuesday following Monday's sharp drop, ahead of the Fed's rate decision and Goldman Sachs results, and as AIG's woes rattled markets worldwide. By 5:38 am EDT, S&P 500 futures were down 0.1 percent, Dow Jones futures were up 0.1 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.6 percent. Wall Street on Monday had its worst day since markets reopened after the September 11 attacks in 2001, on rising worries over the financial system's stability after Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy protection and insurer AIG struggled for survival. AIG, which received a $20 billion lifeline from New York state, came under renewed pressure on Tuesday as ratings agencies downgraded the insurer's debt. Shares in AIG traded in Frankfurt were down 10 percent. The stock plunged nearly 61 percent on Monday in New York and the US Federal Reserve hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to review options for the firm, a person familiar with the situation said. AIG's ratings downgrade could force it to post more collateral and nullify insurance contracts, possibly setting in motion a chain reaction that could threaten its survival. "The problems in the financial market will hit the real economy, whose prospects are already quite negative," said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, Head, Asset Allocation & Balanced Mandates at Fortis Investments, in London. The US Federal Reserve seems likely to stop short of lowering interest rates when it announces its decision on Tuesday, but could signal a willingness to do so soon as it seeks to calm financial markets. Through last week, markets had seen almost no chance of a rate cut at Tuesday's policy-setting meeting. However, Lehman's downfall and troubles at AIG raised hopes of a rate cut, with Fed fund futures on Tuesday implying as much as a 92 percent chance of a cut. Van den Heiligenberg, however, said that the Fed's decision was difficult to predict. "It's a very tight call for the Fed. We think it's going to be "no move", but if they do anything, I would guess they will go for a 50 basis-point cut to send a signal that they are ready to support the market in the current turmoil," he said. "That would trigger a relief rally on the market, but given the economic fundamentals, we think that the relief will be temporary and that stocks will drift lower again." The central bank's decision is due at 2:15 am EDT. Macroeconomic data expected on Tuesday includes consumer price inflation figures for August, which are expected to show a monthly fall of 0.1 percent, led primarily by sinking energy prices, and an annual rise of 5.5 percent. Excluding food and energy, analysts polled by Reuters expected a monthly rise of 0.2 percent, and an annual rise of 2.6 percent. Investors were also bracing for quarterly results from Goldman Sachs, expected on Tuesday, for insight on the Wall Street firm's exposure to risky assets. A sharp drop in commodity prices could also weigh on shares of energy and mining companies. Oil fell over 4 percent to a seven-month low on rising fears that the turmoil in the financial market would spread to the global economy.
