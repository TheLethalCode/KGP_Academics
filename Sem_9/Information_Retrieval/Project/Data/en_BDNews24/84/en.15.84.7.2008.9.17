 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Zahed Kuddus took over as Biman Bangladesh Airlines Ltd managing director and chief executive officer on Wednesday, a day after his appointment, Biman's public relations department said. Kuddus, a former Air Force officer and retired air commodore, went to the office around 9am. His appointment was made by the Biman's Board of Directors in a meeting chaired by the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of civil aviation and tourism ministry Mahbub Jamil on Tuesday. "We have taken steps to run Biman by a foreign airline through a partnership," Jamil told bdnews24.com. "And that airline can opt for a stake in Biman or just take responsibility for management." Jamil, however, said a new CEO was likely to be appointed if an airline took over the management. On plans to find a management partner, Jamil referred to the Thai Airways, which he said had been haemorrhaging heavily before being handed to a strategic partner. "They have done very well since then." "Air Commodore Kuddus showed his ability as a manager in the past. We hope Biman will run well under his leadership," the special assistant said. Kuddus had served as the chairman of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) from 2002 to 2005. Jamil said a chief executive may be hired from abroad once Biman goes into international partnership. Kuddus's predecessor Mohammad Abdul Momen, a serving member of the BCS, was transferred as joint secretary at the agriculture ministry on Sept 8. Biman turned into a public limited company in July last year. bdnews2
