 Patna, India,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in eastern India battling devastating floods said they would rebuild homes of flood victims and feed them with better food in camps, following frequent protests across South Asia by homeless villagers. On Friday, at least 300 villagers blocked roads and shouted slogans, demanding better food in Madhepura district of the flood-hit eastern state of Bihar, witnesses said. "Should we die now?" asked Maheshwar Bind, a protester, when police asked villagers to calm down in Madhepura. About 108 people have been killed and 300,000 homes destroyed after the Kosi river, which originates in Nepal, burst a dam last month and caused the worst floods seen in Bihar in 50 years. The floods forced nearly four million people from their homes and destroyed 100,000 ha (250,000 acres) of farmlands, an official said. Tens of thousands are living in government relief camps that aid agencies say lack adequate facilities. The state government is also setting up temporary schools at relief camps for children living there. "It's part of our effort to somehow wipe out the horrific memories of floods, deeply etched in the children's mind," said Rajesh Bhushan, the state's education director.
