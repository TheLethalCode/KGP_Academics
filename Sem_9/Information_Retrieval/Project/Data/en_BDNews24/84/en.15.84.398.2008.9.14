 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  The energy and mineral resources ministry is working on a formula to cut down on fuel prices, a senior government official said on Sunday. "We are trying to formulate a system that will enable us to adjust fuel prices in proportion to global market prices any time," energy and mineral resources secretary Mohammad Mohsin told bdnews24.com. The secretary said the ministry started work on the matter late August at the directive of chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Saturday said the government could consider a cut in fuel prices following the drop in global oil price. "We will hold a meeting to discuss a cut in domestic fuel prices," the adviser told reporters at Zia International Airport. The government hiked fuel prices on June 30. It raised the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 55 from Tk 40, of petrol to Tk 87 from Tk 65, and octane to Tk 90, up from Tk 67. The global price of oil had risen to $140 per barrel, when the government upped prices. The price has now fallen below $100. On Friday, a barrel of crude oil was traded at $ 98 on global market. Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation purchased fuel at $ 114 a barrel last month, but a barrel of refined oil cost $ 120 with the premium on it. The BPC currently has stocks of 1.5 lakh tonnes of fuel. BPC chairman Anwarul Karim told bdnews24.com that the government would not count losses if kerosene and diesel prices came down to $100 a barrel. In the last fiscal year, the government had to count close to Tk 6,500 crore in losses due to energy subsidy. bdn
