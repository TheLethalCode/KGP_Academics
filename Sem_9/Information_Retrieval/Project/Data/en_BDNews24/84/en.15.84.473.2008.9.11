 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has jailed former prime minister Khaleda Zia's nephew Shahrin Islam Tuhin for 13 years and slapped him with a fine of Tk 10 lakh for corruption. Judge Md Sirajul Islam of the Special Judge's Court-7, set up in the Sangsad Bhaban complex, gave the verdict Thursday, which said the convict would have to serve out another year behind bars if he did not clear the fine. The former lawmaker was handed down 10 years for having illegal assets and a further three years for not admitting the offence. The sentence would be effective one after another from the day Tuhin, a fugitive, is arrested or surrenders. The court also ordered authorities to confiscate his illegally accumulated property. On January 21, another court found Tuhin guilty of tax-dodge and sentenced him to eight years in prison. Anticorruption Commission assistant director Toufiqul Islam filed the case against Tuhin with Gulshan Police Station in December last year. The case charged Tuhin with not declaring in his wealth accounts statement to the ACC on hid information of wealth worth Tk 1.43 crore and earned a total of Tk 2.08 crore illegally. Tuhin was elected an MP from Nilphamari-1 constituency on BNP ticket in February 15, 1996 by-elections. bdne
