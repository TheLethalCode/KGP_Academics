 Tokyo, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi has backed Yuriko Koike in her bid to become Japan's first female leader, but an analyst said the backing of the popular politician was unlikely to lift her to victory. Outspoken former foreign minister Taro Aso is the frontrunner among five candidates seeking to replace Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, who quit suddenly last week, and Japanese media said he has enough support among ruling party lawmakers and branches to win the job. Koizumi told Koike's supporters on Friday morning that he will vote for her in the ruling party's leadership contest, an official at her campaign office said on Friday. "I heard lawmakers supporting Koike saying Koizumi told them he is supporting Koike when he met with them this morning," Fumio Shishino told Reuters. Aso, 67, has regularly topped voter polls for the job, with his public popularity an important factor as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) faces a general election that analysts say could be called in November. "Koizumi told them if Koike becomes the LDP's leader, it can play a well-matched contest" against the main opposition Democratic Party led by Ichiro Ozawa, Shishino added. Koike, a former TV announcer and defense minister, has staked out a claim as the candidate most likely to pursue market-friendly reforms pushed by the charismatic Koizumi during his 2001-2006 tenure. Yasunori Sone, a political science professor at Keio University, said Koizumi's support was unlikely to alter the momentum for an Aso victory. "She might get a few more votes ... but there is no change in the overall outlook," Sone said. A survey in the Yomiuri newspaper showed that Aso would get almost 60 percent support in a face-off with Ozawa, while Koike would get only 36 percent
