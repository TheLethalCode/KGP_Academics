 LONDON, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool duo Fernando Torres and Steven Gerrard were both unexpectedly passed fit on Friday for Saturday's Premier League game against champions Manchester United at Anfield. Gerrard has recently undergone groin surgery and, though manager Rafa Benitez said he thought his captain would make the game, the player himself said last weekend he would prefer more time to get back to full fitness. Torres pulled a hamstring in a 0-0 draw with Aston Villa two weeks ago and after missing Spain's World Cup qualifiers the striker was also expected to be out for at least another week. However, after both players trained on Friday, Benitez told the club's website (www.liverpoolfc.tv): "They are both much better. They came through a full training session this morning. "It wasn't a very hard session, but they will both be in the squad. If they are in the squad then they can play. "It's important for us to have these two players of quality who can change a game. I'm not surprised they are available because the medical staff have done a good job and the players have been working really hard with the physios to get fit." Gerrard said last week that it was vital for Liverpool to start taking points from the likes of United and Chelsea if they were to mount a serious title challenge. They have a dire recent record against United, particularly at Anfield, where they have lost five and drawn one of their last six league games against Alex Ferguson's side
