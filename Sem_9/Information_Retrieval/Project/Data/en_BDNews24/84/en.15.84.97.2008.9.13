 Chittagong, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  A ship laden with fertiliser sank in the outer-anchorage of Chittagong port early Saturday, although no casualties were reported. The shipment of 26,250 tonnes of TSP fertiliser originated in Morocco and was destined for the Bangladesh Agriculture Development Corporation. Chittagong Port radio control official Zahurul Quadir told bdnews24.com that the Bengal Bridge had unloaded approximately 500 tonnes of fertiliser from another vessel in the Alpha anchorage area at around 1am when water entered the engine room of the overloaded vessel. All the crew were rescued without injury, the official said, but the ship went underwater before they arrived at the scene. The incident did not cause any disruption in the movement of other ships in the area, said port secretary Md Farhad Uddin. bdnews
