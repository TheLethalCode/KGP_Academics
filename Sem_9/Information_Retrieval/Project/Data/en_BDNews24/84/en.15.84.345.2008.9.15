 MADRID, September 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Promoted Numancia twice took the lead before falling 4-3 to champions Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Primera Liga on Sunday. The newcomers from Soria, who beat Barcelona 1-0 on the opening day of the season, took an early lead through Juan Carlos Moreno. Jose Barkero restored their advantage just after Guti had levelled for Real. Gonzalo Higuain, Rafael van der Vaart on his league debut, and an own-goal from Domingo Cisma gave the home side what appeared to be a comfortable 4-2 halftime lead. But Bernd Schuster's side were the team hanging on at the end after Moreno's superb second-half free-kick had the visitors chasing an unlikely point in the closing stages. "It was to be expected. These games after international weeks are always the hardest," Schuster said. "When we were 4-2 up we didn't manage the game very well. We deserved to win by more but eased off too much in the second half." Earlier, Spain striker Luis Garcia snatched a late winner to give Espanyol a 1-0 away win over Recreativo Huelva and top place in the Primera Liga. Espanyol are the only side with six points from two games, after beating Valladolid 1-0 at home in their season opener. Valencia and Almeria are second and third respectively with four points each after drawing 2-2 in Almeria thanks to Spain striker David Villa's second-half equaliser. Sevilla are fourth after surviving a seven-goal thriller to beat promoted Sporting Gijon 4-3 at the Sanchez Pizjuan on Saturday. Getafe drew 0-0 at home with Real Betis, missing out on the chance to join Espanyol at the top when Juan Albin crashed a late penalty against the crossbar, and Spain winger Santi Cazorla gave Villarreal a 1-0 home win over Deportivo Coruna. SWIFT REPLY Real, who lost 2-1 at Deportivo Coruna in their season-opener, were behind after only seven minutes when Moreno was gifted a free header at a corner. Guti's long-range effort deflected off a Numancia defender to level the scores at 1-1 in the 19th, Real's 5000th goal in league competition. But Numancia's Barkero thumped a 20-metre drive into the top corner three minutes later, prompting another swift reply from the home side when Ruud Van Nistelrooy fed Higuain to level again at 2-2. Van der Vaart's snap shot beat Juan Pablo Colinas at his near post in the 34th and Cisma headed into his own net at a corner just before the break. Numancia continued to press forward. Moreno curled a superb freekick in over the wall in the 57th and Real were against the ropes when Gorka Brit just failed to get a touch on a cross at the back post, in injury tim
