 La paz/Santa cruz, Bolivia,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bolivia's leftist government declared martial law on Friday in a remote Amazon region where at least 15 people were killed in a wave of political violence sweeping the impoverished country. In a decree, the government banned protests and meetings in the far-northern Pando region and said anyone carrying weapons would be arrested. Officials said six more bodies had been found following a clash in the area on Thursday. "In Pando, it's been a real massacre," Government Minister Alfredo Rada told reporters, referring to the violence between supporters of President Evo Morales and those of four rightist provincial governors, who oppose his socialist reforms. Almost all of the dead were pro-government peasant farmers, officials say. Anti-government protesters continued to block roads in eastern areas, causing fuel and food shortages in the opposition-led city of Santa Cruz. Officials said protesters had destroyed or set fire to about 30 public buildings. The martial law decree came as Morales' government held talks with one of the opposition governors in a bid to defuse the crisis. Mario Cossio, governor of the natural gas-rich Tarija region and representing the three other rebel governors who have rejected talks, met Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera at the presidential palace in La Paz. A government spokesman said Morales had decided not to take part. "We're here because of our clear will to establish a base for a process of dialogue which will pave the way for a pact, a national agreement, a process of national reconciliation," Cossio told reporters before the meeting. Morales, who defeated a recall vote in August with 67 percent of the vote, said his administration was willing to talk with its opponents but that reaching a deal would be difficult. CHAOS Morales, a former coca farmer and Bolivia's first Indian president, has angered opponents with plans to overhaul the constitution and break up ranches to give land to peasants. The governors want greater autonomy for their regions and blame Morales for recent violence and sabotage to pipelines that has caused chaos in the natural gas industry, Bolivia's biggest source of income. Morales, a close ally of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, repeated accusations that the opposition was following orders from U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg, whom he threw out of the country earlier this week. Washington retaliated by expelling Bolivia's ambassador. The State Department, which called Morales' actions a sign of "weakness and desperation," approved the departure of nonessential staff from Bolivia. Morales says he wants a socialist transformation in Bolivia, but some of his reforms have stalled due to fierce opposition in the wealthier east, which is run by elites of mostly European descent. The escalating crisis in Bolivia has caused concern among its neighbors. Leaders of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and other countries expressed support for Morales. Honduras told a US envoy not to present his credentials as ambassador in a diplomatic snub in support of Bolivia, while Venezuela's Chavez said he would go to any length to defend Morales, implying military action. He also expelled the U.S. ambassador to Caracas. However, Bolivia's military said it would not allow any intervention and pledged restraint and respect for democracy. "To the president of Venezuela, Mr. Hugo Chavez, and to the international community, we say that the armed forces (of Bolivia) emphatically reject any foreign intervention of any kind, wherever they be from," said armed forces Commander in Chief Luis Trigo. Local media said troops had wrested control of the main airport in Pando from protesters and had opened fire, but the military declined comment. The government has sent troops to protect natural gas facilities, but protests and sabotage to valves and pipelines interrupted natural gas exports on Thursday. Supplies to both Brazil and Argentina were back near normal levels
