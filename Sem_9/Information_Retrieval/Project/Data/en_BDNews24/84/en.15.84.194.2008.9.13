 KARACHI, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan are confident the West Indies will provide some much-needed international opposition by agreeing to play two test matches in November, a senior official said on Saturday. Pakistan have struggled to find opponents after the eight-nation Champions Trophy, due to be held this month in Pakistan, was postponed after some countries refused to attend because of security concerns. "We have invited West Indies to come and play two tests immediately after the one-day series they play against us in Abu Dhabi in November," Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told Reuters. Pakistan had asked South Africa to arrange a tri-series and also approached Sri Lanka to fill in the gap created by the Champions Trophy postponement. Both countries declined. Naghmi said Pakistan was hopeful West Indies would agree to the tests and said he had also approached New Zealand about playing them later this year. Concerned about the lack of international opposition, team captain Shoaib Malik has urged the International Cricket Council (ICC) to intervene and stop Pakistan from becoming a isolated cricketing nation. Naghmi said the ICC chief executives committee has authorised chief executive Haroon Lorgat to negotiate with boards and try to come up with a new window for the Champions Trophy. "It is very difficult in today's hectic schedule to find a window when you postpone a tournament," Naghmi said
