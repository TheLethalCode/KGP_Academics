 Dhaka, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com)  Over 300 taxpayers were awarded Monday when the interim government observed the first National Income Tax Day in an effort to sensitise the public to tax issues. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed who left for China on an urgent visit was scheduled to attend the day's main event organised by the National Board of Revenue at the China-Bangladesh Friendship Conference Center. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam replaced Fakhruddin as the chief guest on the occasion. The adviser stressed on internal revenue collection for a robust economy as revenues from import duty came down due to worldwide trade liberalisation. "On the other hand, the tax administration should do their job in a efficient and transparent manner," he added. He hoped that tax reform measures the incumbent government adopted in budget for fiscal year 2007-08 would help increase tax collection. NBR awarded crests and certificates among 316 taxpayers across the country to recognise their good deeds. Three highest amount of tax payers in the last fiscal and two long-timer tax payers from each district have been awarded who will also be treated as CIPs (Commercially Important Persons) in their own districts. Samson H Choudhury of the Square Group, who was awarded as the oldest taxpayer in Rajshahi Division and Rangpur businessman Rahimuddin Miah Varosha, the highest taxpayer in the last fiscal for the same region, also spoke. According to the NBR, Varosha paid income taxes worth Tk 1.38 crore in the last fiscal while Younus Ali who paid Tk 73 lakh was the highest tax payer in Dhaka Division. Khulna's Kazi Mazharul Haque, Moshiur Rahman Choudhury from Chittagong, Jalaluddin from Sylhet and Barisal's Monirul Islam were declared as the highest taxpayers from each division. Samson H Choudhury of Rajshahi division, Saidul Islam of Dhaka Division, Neyamat Ullah of Chittagong Division, Khandakar Shakhawat Hossain of Khulna Division, Abdul Hamid Miah of Sylhet Division and Aktar-uz-Zaman of Barisal Division were awarded as long-time taxpayers. bdnews
