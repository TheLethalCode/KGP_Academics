<TITLE> Kiwi worry over Bangladesh tour </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com) - New Zealand Cricket is gravely concerned over the standard of competition it may face during its tour of Bangladesh for three one-day internationals and two Tests next month. "It will not be good for the tour if they have to play a weakened opposition, but it will also hugely hinder Bangladesh's development on the international stage " New Zealand Cricket chief executive Justin Vaughan was quoted as saying by the New Zealand Herald on Tuesday. Vaughan's anxiety came after six Bangladesh cricketers Sunday applied for retirement from international cricket, intending to play in the breakaway Indian Cricket League. The Black Caps are scheduled to arrive in Dhaka on Sept 30. Vaughan also said that it showed what a threat the ICL still posed. "The Black Caps need good cricket before tests and one-day internationals against the likes of Australia," said the CEO.
