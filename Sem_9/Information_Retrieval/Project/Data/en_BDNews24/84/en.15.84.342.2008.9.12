<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  A day after meeting mother Khaleda Zia and retiring from politics, Tarique Rahman flew into London on Friday to begin his apparent exile. He touched down at the Gatwick Airport by an Emirates flight at 2:15pm on Friday, his lawyer said. "Tarique Rahman has reached London. He's staying in a rented house in north London," his lawyer barrister Nasiruddin Asim told bdnews24.com at 2:30pm, quoting UK BNP chapter president Qamaruddin. "After the local specialists examine his health condition and review his treatment situation as scheduled, he'll be treated either at Hammersmith or King's Oak Hospital." Before leaving Dhaka on Thursday night, Tarique, standing trial on a slew of graft charges, formally quit the political scene. He left a note at the airport that read: " I, Tarique Rahman, do hereby declare that as of today, 11 September 2008 I resign the post of senior joint secretary general of the BNP and thereby, retire from active politics." On being released on bail on Thursday after a year's detention Khaleda went to Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital to meet her elder son. Khaleda also said on Thursday Tarique quit his party post before flying out for London. "My son will take two to three years to recover. He will be away from politics until he fully recovers," Khaleda said of Tarique, widely criticised for abuse of power during her second prime ministerial stint. Known more as a wheeler-dealer than a leader, he had a reputation for using political perches to benefit himself, his family and his friends. His wife Zobaida Rahman, daughter Zaima Rahman, sister-in-law Shahina Akter Khan Bindu, physician Dr Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon and Bindu's husband Shafiuzzaman accompanied him to London. Barrister Asim said Qamaruddin, local BNP general secretary Abdul Malik and international secretary A M Muhit and a large number of Bangladeshis greeted Tarique with flowers at the airport. The joint forces arrested Tarique in the early hours of March 8, 2007 from his Shaheed Mainul Road home in Dhaka Cantonment. Tarique got bail in all the 12 cases filed against him and was released from the BDMMUH prison cell on Sept 3. He stayed on at the hospital for treatment though. After Tarique's arrest, Khaleda and her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco were also arrested on Sept 3, 2007. By a government order, Coco got temporary release and is under medical treatment at a hospital in Thailand. bdnew
