 Dhaka, September 11 (bdnews24.com)Restoration of the Shutibhola canal in the city's Badda area began Thursday, said Dhaka WASA chief Raihanul Abedeen. He mentioned that 26 usurped canals have recently been restored in the city after dismantling illegal constructions. Eastern Housinga leading construction firmhad filled in Shutibhola canal in 2002 during its Aftabnagar project and built a road across the land, said the WASA managing director. "To address the waterlogging problems in the city, BIWTA, Dhaka WASA and the Bangladesh Navy together have undertaken the re-excavation of the canal, which should link the Begunbari and Shahzadpur canals," he said. "In about 15 days, the canal can be restored. This also constitutes the second stage of the circular navigation route surrounding the city," BIWTA chairman Md Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com. BIWTA chief engineer Abu Kashem told bdnews24.com, "There are about 24 kilometres of canals in the eastern zone of Dhaka if we add up the lengths of the Begunbari, Shahzadpur and Govindopur canals." "The Begunbari waters will be flowing via Shutibhola canal into the Shahzadpur canal and then into the Balu river." bdnews
