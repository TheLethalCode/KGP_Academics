 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission on Sunday filed three separate graft cases against the son and son-in-law of former caretaker government adviser Fazlul Huq, who himself stands accused of corruption. The ACC filed two cases against son Dr Afzal Hossain Raj and one against son-in- law Tarifur Rahman Prince. Sub inspector Maksudur Rahman of Ramna Police Station told bdnews24.com that ACC assistant director Md Ibrahim filed a case against Afzal for earning Tk 1.4 crore through illegal means. Ibrahim filed another case against Afzal under money laundering laws. Assistant sub inspector Kamaruzzaman of Dhanmondi Police Station said: "The case involves receiving Tk 10.61 crore in bribes in exchange for suitable postings made by his father." The case includes money laundering charges for illegal banking transactions involving Tk 9.61 crore. Sub inspector Jinat Ara of Cantonment Police Station said Md Ibrahim also filed a graft case against Huq's son-in-law Prince. A special court had earlier sentenced Prince to three years in jail for not submitting his wealth statement to the ACC. The antigraft body sent notices, at the end of last year, seeking wealth statements of Raj and Prince. The same ACC assistant director, Md Ibrahim, also filed a case against Justice Fazlul Huq with Ramna Police Station on March 13 this year on charges of amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth information. The anti-graft body pressed charges in the case on Sept 2. In the charge sheet submitted in court it was also alleged that, while he was an adviser of the immediate past caretaker government, he kept a large part of his illegal income in bank accounts in the name of his son and son-in-law. Huq secured three months bail in the case on Sept 4. Police, meanwhile, arrested three men at the end of August for allegedly receiving Tk 25 lakh in bribes from Fazlul Huq to help him evade the ACC's graft charges against him, creating a public sensation. bdnews24.co
