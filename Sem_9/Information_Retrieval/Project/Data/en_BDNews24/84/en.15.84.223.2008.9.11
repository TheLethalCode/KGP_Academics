 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government has moved to get bitter political rivals Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to sit across the table in an effort to pull the country out of political crisis, an adviser has said. "The government will take initiatives to get the two top leaders to sit together to help the nation overcome the current political crisis and restore sound political atmosphere," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Thursday told a briefing on the country's latest political situation at the communications ministry. "We hope they will not only respond to this move but also take initiatives on their own since the two leaders have contributed a lot to the country," he said. "We also hope they will continue their contributions in the future as well." Awami League chief Hasina and Khaleda who heads the BNP have taken turns to govern the country for 15 years to Oct 2006. Hasina is currently on parole and is in the United States for medical treatment. She is expected to return home in October. "The government has made headway with its efforts to further democracy by releasing Khaleda Zia," Hossain Zillur said. The former prime minister was released on bail from prison on Thursday after one year in detention on a slew of graft charges. "We have ensured the participation of all parties [ by releasing Khaleda]." On the reported 'deal' between the government and the BNP over Khaleda's release, the adviser said: "Many are viewing the agreement negatively. But the initiative for participation of all parties amounts to compromise." "The nation is looking forward to three things now  an acceptable election with the participation of all parties, a qualitative development of politics, and political and economic development after the elections." The adviser said a number of conditions of the emergency powers rules would be relaxed to allow political parties to hold council sessions. Parties need to reform their constitutions for registration with the Election Commission, a must under new electoral laws to run elections. "The political parties will have to hold councils to participate in the general elections in line with electoral laws. The government will relax conditions of emergency powers rules if necessary." Asked whether the government was making political parties to commit to any conditions, Hossain Zillur said: "We want a trustworthy environment so that all of us can work together for the country." "We want political advancement and economic development." Hossain Zillur earlier had a meeting with communications adviser Ghulam Quader and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff. bdne
