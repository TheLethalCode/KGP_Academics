<TITLE> Matsushita to offer world`s smallest advanced camera </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Matsushita said it would launch the world's smallest digital camera with interchangeable lenses, targeting female users who want a high-performance machine that does not weigh too much. Single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras, interchangeable-lens models with a mirror box inside the body to send light to image sensors, are the fastest growing and most lucrative segment of the digital camera market. But some compact camera users are reluctant to move up to SLR models because they are bulkier and heavier. Matsushita's new Lumix-range model, the DMC-G1, which is made without a mirror structure in it in order to make the body slimmer, is 27 percent smaller than its existing DMC-L10 SLR camera, and weighs 385 grams -- slightly more than a regular can of beer. The new machine will go on sale in Japan on Oct. 31. Matsushita expects a package of the camera body and a lens unit to sell for 90,000 yen ($839.5). Overseas launches are scheduled for late October and early November. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd, which changes its name to Panasonic on Oct. 1, was the world's seventh-largest digital camera maker with a 7.1 percent share in 2007, according to data from research firm IDC. In the digital SLR camera market, which is dominated by Canon Inc and Nikon Corp, its share stood at 0.5 percent last year
