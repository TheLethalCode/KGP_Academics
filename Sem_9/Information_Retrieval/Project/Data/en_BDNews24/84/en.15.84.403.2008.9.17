 LONDON, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has reacted angrily to the FA's decision on Tuesday to overturn the red card Chelsea's John Terry was shown in the Premier League game at Manchester City on Saturday. England captain Terry will now be available for Sunday's league clash against champions Manchester United at Stamford Bridge after winning his appeal against the sending off. Referee Mark Halsey dismissed Terry for serious foul play after he grabbed City striker Jo in Chelsea's 3-1 win but an independent FA regulatory commission overturned the decision. Ferguson was quoted in Wednesday's British newspapers as saying Keith Hackett, general manager of the Professional Game Match officials board, had overruled Halsey thereby saving Terry from a three-match ban starting with the United game. "As I understand it Hackett told Mark Halsey to rescind the red card and he wouldn't do it," said Ferguson. "I understand Halsey is being made to referee in the second division this weekend. I just don't understand how this could have happened. "If it had been Manchester United, Hackett would not have done this. In future, if referees are seen to make mistakes then this (demotion) is going to have to happen all the time." A PGMO spokesman said Hackett had played no part in the appeals process, adding: "All matters of discipline are an issue for the FA and them alone". The decision to show Terry a straight red seemed harsh as there were other covering defenders, though Halsey's insistence it was for serious foul play appeared to weaken Terry's case
