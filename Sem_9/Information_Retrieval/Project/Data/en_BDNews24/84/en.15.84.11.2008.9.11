 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Despite a trend that shows private commercial banks are reducing the spread or gap between lending rate and interest on deposits, foreign banks are moving in the opposite direction. Their spread is widening further, latest figures show. Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said he will sit with foreign banks in Bangladesh on this issue. In May this year, the central bank issued a circular directing private banks to reduce their spread. After further pressure, around 30 private commercial banks operating in the country have lowered their lending rates. As a result their average rate spread has come down to about 5 percentage points from around 6 points in December 2007. But foreign banks are yet to follow this trend. According to June 2008 figures of Bangladesh Bank, the average spread of 30 private banks was 5.09 percentage point. The average spread of 9 foreign banks is 8.54 percentage points. "With foreign banks, a large part of business is consumer credit. We also give loans to SMEs. Both entail more risks, which explains why the interest rate is high," says Mamun Rashid, Citibank NA country officer and managing director. "And interest on deposits is usually low in foreign banks." An analysis of data shows that among the foreign banks the highest spread is of Standard Chartered Bank. The spread of this bank is 11.27 percentage point. The rate of interest on deposit in the bank is only 3.69 per cent. The rate of interest on loan (lending rate) is 14.96 per cent. Among other foreign banks the spread of Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (HSBC) is 8.67 point, that of Citibank NA is 7.19 percentage point, State Bank of India 4.43 point, Habib Bank 4.43 point, Commercial Bank of Ceylon 5.38 point, National Bank of Pakistan 3.74 point, Woori Bank 11.29 point and Bank Al Falah Ltd 5.03 percentage point. Bangladesh Better Business Forum, led by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and established to infuse dynamism in the economy, has urged the central bank to continue its moral pressure on the banks to keep their spread below 5 percentage points by further lowering the lending rate. bdnews
