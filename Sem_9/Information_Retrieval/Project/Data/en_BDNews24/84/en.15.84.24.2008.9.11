<TITLE> Bangladesh frees ex-prime minister Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Anis Ahmed DHAKA, Sep 11 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's army-backed interim government freed former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia on bail on Thursday after a year in prison on alleged graft charges, paving the way for a credible election to restore democracy. She was arrested on Sept. 3 last year in an anti-corruption drive by the interim authority, but the High Court granted her bail on Tuesday on the last of four charges she faced. Analysts said the release of Khaleda and her rival, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who is now on parole, was important to ensure their parties took part in a parliamentary election planned for December that would be fair and peaceful. Khaleda herself confirmed the participation of her Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in the coming polls. Thousands of supporters and party officials greeted Khaleda, 63, after she left the jail and drove to the graveside of her slain husband, former president Ziaur Rahman. She then went to a city hospital to visit her ailing son and political heir Tareque Rahman, and announced he had resigned from his top party post. "Tareque has relieved himself of the post of senior joint secretary-general of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party," Khaleda said. His treatment may take three to four years, she added. He was expected to fly to Britain on Thursday night for treatment of what his doctors say is a broken spine. SON STEPS BACK "Tareque will be away from politics until he fully recovers," she said, adding that her party would take part in the December parliamentary elections. But she urged the government to end the state of emergency before the polls, her party officials said. One analyst, who asked not to be named, said Tareque's absence from the next election was part of a deal his mother had reached with the government. "But Khaleda will be a frontrunner in the election, along with Hasina, although many smaller parties had hoped to combine strength to drive them out," he said. Khaleda heads the BNP and Hasina the Awami League -- the country's two biggest political parties, which retain massive popular support, despite the fact their top leaders have been tainted by a series of corruption charges. Hossain Zillur Rahman, a member of the interim government who helped negotiate Khaleda's release, said the government would try to bring the two feuding ex-premiers together. "They should no longer have bad faith and differences. Instead, they should sit together and discuss how best they can contribute to the country's well-being," Zillur told reporters. BATTLING BEGUMS Though Hasina and Khaleda took turns in power over 15 years up to October 2006, they did not speak to each other through most of that period. They came to be known as the "Battling Begums", a reference to their honorifics as Muslim women of rank. About 170 key politicians, mostly from the BNP and Awami League, were detained in a huge anti-corruption drive after the interim administration imposed a state of emergency and cancelled a national election due in January 2007. It promised to hold a free, fair and credible election by the end of 2008 after cleansing politics of widespread corruption. But over the past two months more than 50 of the detained leaders have been freed on bail so they can contest the poll. While freeing the detainees seems at odds with the government's declared mission of making Bangladesh a clean and sustainable democracy, officials say it had no other alternative in order to induce major parties to contest the polls. "We are leaving no stones unturned to make the election fair and credible, but it is impossible without participation of the major parties," said government adviser Zillur. Fakhruddin Ahmed, head of the interim administration, said he was bound by a pledge to leave the country in the hands of an elected government in January 2009. "So we are doing whatever is possible to achieve that goal," he told officials at the weekend.
