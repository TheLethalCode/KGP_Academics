<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, September 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil were held to a goalless draw at home by 10-man Bolivia in a World Cup qualifier played in front of a half-empty stadium on Wednesday. The result will put more pressure on beleaguered coach Dunga, who was given a brief respite when his team beat Chile 3-0 away on Sunday. A hostile crowd began jeering their team after only half an hour and by the second half were cheering when Bolivia, who had Ignacio Garcia harshly sent off in the 54th minute, went forward. They also chanted "Bolivia, Bolivia" and "Goodbye Dunga." The poor attendance at the 40,000 capacity Joao Havelange stadium, one of the most modern in the country, appeared to be the result of a combination of high ticket prices and lack of interest in Dunga's team. The result left Brazil with 13 points from eight games in the 10-team South American group, four behind leaders Paraguay. Bolivia, who shipped 16 goals in losing their previous four away games, celebrated their point despite staying bottom with five. Dunga has been under huge pressure following a run of poor results plus the failure of the Olympic team, which he also coached, to do better than a bronze medal in Beijing. SAFETY FIRST Many fans resent his safety-first tactics. Although buoyed by the win in Santiago, which the media said had saved Dunga's job, Brazil were visibly disheartened when they walked out to a lukewarm, half-empty stadium. The hosts failed to muster a shot on target in the first half while Bolivia created two good chances. Ronald Garcia tested Julio Cesar with a long-range shot and Miguel Hoyos fired wide from close range when a rebound fell at his feet. Brazil appeared to be given a lifeline when Ignacio Garcia was dismissed for foot-up a challenge on Robinho after the break. Although Robinho collapsed in apparent agony, replays showed that Garcia's foot made no contact with the Brazilian striker. Unnerved by the crowd reaction, Brazil repeatedly misplaced passes or resorted to throwing themselves over in the penalty area. An uninspired performance by Ronaldinho ended when he was substituted in the 77th minute to more jeers. Brazil's best chance came in stoppage-time when a Julio Baptista header was tipped around the post by Carlos Aria
