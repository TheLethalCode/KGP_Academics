 BUENOS AIRES, September 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago's chances of another World Cup appearance were severely dented by comprehensive defeats in CONCACAF qualifiers on Wednesday. Jamaica, who became the first English-speaking Caribbean nation to qualify for the tournament in 1998, lost 2-0 to a David Suazo-inspired Honduras in San Pedro Sula.
