 MUMBAI, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Indian shares fell 3.35 percent on Monday to their lowest close in two months, as jittery investors braced for more foreign withdrawals after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection. Banks led the slide on worries about the health of the US financial sector, with Bank of America agreeing to take over Merrill Lynch in yet another sign of the mortgage crisis fallout. Top lender State Bank of India dropped 1.6 percent to 1,488.90 rupees, its lowest close in two weeks and No 2 lender ICICI Bank ended 3.8 percent down at 627.90 rupees, its worst close since July 29. Outsourcers, which earn a key part of their revenues from the US banking and financial services sector, also fell sharply on concerns about the outlook. The 30-share benchmark index fell 469.54 points to 13,531.27, its lowest close since July 17, with all but three of its components declining. "I think it is difficult to expect the Indian market to completely ignore all the forces in the world financial markets," Leslie Menkes, head of onshore private wealth management in Asia for Morgan Stanley, said. "Long-term I am very optimistic on India but it is going to be a difficult operating environment in the foreseeable future," he told reporters in Mumbai. The BSE index had fallen as much as 6.1 percent at one stage, before domestic funds scooped up shares in the last half hour to help recoup some of the losses. The benchmark is down a third this year. Global financial markets were shaken to their core after Lehman filed for protection and Merrill agreed to be taken over by Bank of America for $50 billion in stock as a deepening crisis took new, bigger victims. Traders said the gloomy global sentiment triggered worries of more foreign withdrawals that had already reached $8 billion this year, compared with record inflows of $17.4 billion in 2007. "Our sense is that volatility linked to global markets will be prevalent in the Indian market for sometime at least," said V P Chaturvedi, managing director of Tata Mutual Fund. Energy group Reliance Industries, which has the heaviest weight in the BSE index, fell 2.5 percent to 1,884.10 rupees, its lowest close in more than a year after a newspaper reported the government was planning to impose a windfall tax on oil producers. Among outsourcers, bellwether Infosys closed down 4.2 percent at 1,574.40 rupees and leader Tata Consultancy Services fell 5.7 percent to 761.80 rupees. "There are jitters because of the overall market and because of the bad news coming from US banks," said Sandeep Shenoy, strategist at PINC Research. "Banking and financial services is a very big vertical for Indian tech companies, and there are concerns that the present situation will result in sticky receivables, of money not coming in on time," he said. In the broader market, 2,271 losers swamped 365 gainers on volume of 263.6 million shares. The 50-share NSE index fell 3.7 percent to 4,072.90. Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-share index fell 0.22 percent to 9,233.21, while Colombo's All-share index .CSE slipped 0.7 percent at 2,338.33
