 Tangail, Sept 14 (bdnew24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty said Sunday that the country's two top leaders should sit together for the sake of politics and the good of the nation. If Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia sat across the table many crucial issues could be addressed, Moriarty told reporters after visiting the Kumudini complex in Mirzapur. He also said he was hopeful that elections would be held in December as scheduled. The US ambassador said his government was giving Bangladesh all assistance for holding a free, fair and credible election, and establishing more transparent and accountable governance. He said the US government has pledged $176 million in development assistance in 2008, mentioning that since 1971 the US has given Bangladesh over $5 billion in development assistance. Moriarty arrived in Mirzapur Sunday morning visiting the Kumudini Library and Museum. Later he made the rounds of different wards of the Kumudini Hospital and Kumudini Nursing School. The US ambassador praised the Kumudini Welfare Trust, the quality of service provided at the hospital, and the NGO's leadership in providing opportunities to girls in education, training and employment through its projects. USAID mission head Denise Rollins, and managing director of Kumudini Welfare Trust Rajib Prasad Saha were also present, along with additional deputy commissioner Kamala Ranjan Das and Upazila Nirbahi Officer Nizamuddin. bdnews2
