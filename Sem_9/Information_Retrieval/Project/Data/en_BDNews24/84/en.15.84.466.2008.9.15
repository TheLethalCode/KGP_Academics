 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation Monday okayed Dhaka-based Farashganj Sporting Club's home venue for the ongoing B. League at Narsingdi. It is the first time that a club has chosen its home venue for the B. League outside their own soil. "After having inspected the venue, the BFF approved Farashganj's petition to treat Narsingdi as their home venue for the ongoing B. League," said a BFF release. That means Farashganj, whose last season's home venue was the Bangabandhu National Stadium, will host 10 matches in Narsingdi. Dhaka Mohammedan SC, Dhaka Abahani Limited, Brothers Union, Sheikh Russel KC, Muktijoddha Sangsad, Arambagh KS and Rahmatganj MFS have chosen their home venue as the Bangabandhu National Stadium. The MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong is the home venue for both Chittagong Mohammedan SC and Chittagong Abahani Limited while Khulna Abahani KC has selected their own den for the home matches.
