<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bus operators started selling advance tickets from Monday for the upcoming Eid-ul-Fitr holidays, though complaints were heard on the day of not getting tickets despite queuing for hours. Ticket sellers, however, rejected complaints regarding non-availability. "We are selling many tickets," they said. At the city's College Gate counter on Mirpur Road, ticket selling started at 6am and counters announced just one hour later that no more tickets were available for departures on Sept 28, 29 and 30th morning ahead of Eid. One ticket seeker Abdur Rahman claimed that people were buying many tickets at a time, calling on authorities to see that tickets did not go to black marketers. Abdus Samad Mondol, general manager of Hanif Enterprise, said ticket selling started from dawn. As there was a particularly high demand for Sept 28, 29 and 30 tickets, they were sold off earlier. Long queues were seen at many counters of different bus services, though counter staff said they were adopting various measures for the smooth sale of tickets and against black marketing. "We have arranged a token system. If people want to collect tickets they have to collect tokens first. They will get tickets when they are called up according to their token numbers," said a bus counter official. Nevertheless, there were allegations that transport operators were maintaining their 'traditional' holiday practice of extracting extra charges. Fares of up to Tk 500 to 530 were being charged instead of Tk 400-420 for a Thakurgaon fare, Tk 270-280 instead of Tk 240 for a Bogra fare, Tk 400-420 instead of Tk 340 for Rangpur and Tk 320 instead of Tk 280 for Naogaon fares, according to ticket buyers. Bangladesh Railway begins selling advance tickets from Sept 18 for seven days, said Kamalapur Station manager Rezaul Hoque. Advance tickets for Sept 26, 27, 28, 29, 30 and Oct 1 journeys will be sold on Sept 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 respectively, he said. Launch owners' association vice president Lutfor Rahman said that advance tickets for all river routes would be sold from Sept 20. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation control room manager Ashraf Ali said the advance ticket sales for the rocket steamer would begin on Sept 20. bdnew
