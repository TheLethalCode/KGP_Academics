<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has challenged the legality of two graft cases and their proceedings against her. Hasina's lawyer barrister Shafik Ahmed filed two separate writ petitions with the High Court on Sunday against an extortion case and a case involving the purchase of MiG-29 warplanes. The former petition also seeks bail and a stay on the proceedings of the Tk 3 crore extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury. The two writ petitions were submitted to the HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman. Shafik Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the hearing on the two appeals would be held in a couple of days. The High Court on Aug 28 issued a rule nisi on the government to explain why the proceedings of the Tk 3 crore extortion case against the former prime minister should not be declared illegal. The HC has already quashed the case once, ruling on Feb 6 that the case against Hasina was illegal for being tried under emergency powers rules. The Appellate Division, on a government appeal, overturned the High Court ruling on May 8, allowing proceedings of the case to continue in trial court. The trial is now ongoing at the court of Special Sessions Judge Md Ashraf, in the Sangsad Bhaban complex, with plaintiff Azam J Chowdhury being cross examined. The businessman filed the case with Gulshan police on June 13 last year against former PM and her cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim. Later charges were also pressed against Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year and was shown arrested in the case the same day, after the case was brought under EPR. The now-defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the graft case involving the purchase of Mig 29 war planes with Tejgaon Police Station against Sheikh Hasina and four others in 2001. Charges were framed against the accused on Aug 20 this year. The accused are charged with causing losses of Tk 700 crore to the state, during Hasina's term in office, through the purchase of the eight fighter planes. A HC bench rejected a petition on Sept 6 last year filed by Hasina to scrap the case. The trial is now ongoing in the lower court. The government released Sheikh Hasina on parole for eight weeks on June 11. She is currently in the US seeking medical treatment. bdnew
