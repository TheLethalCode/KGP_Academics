<TEXT>
 BALI, September 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Patty Schnyder brushed aside Poland's Marta Domachowska with a 6-2 6-2 victory on Friday to line up a Bali Classic semi-final against Nadia Petrova. Schnyder showed more consistency in the rallies and more variety in her game, while the second-seeded Swiss left-hander also had a better serve. She sewed up victory in just 51 minutes. "The way I could start was really good," Schnyder told reporters. "I made no errors, I served really well, and even my movement got better with the match. "I think the way I played my game she doesn't really like, when she has to adjust to the balls, my speed and the height of it. So that was a big advantage for me." Schnyder will now meet Petrova after the fourth seeded Russian recovered from a poor start to beat fifth seed Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-4 6-3. Petrova failed to convert four game points in her first service game as Schiavone built a 3-0 lead. But Petrova gradually settled and turned the set around by winning 16 of 18 points to lead 5-4. Schiavone then attempted to stem the tide, but failed to capitalise on two break points as Petrova served for the first set. In the second set, Petrova broke to lead 2-1 and again for the match. "I just got mad at myself for letting the beginning of the match slip that way," said Petrova. "I gave her the 4-1 lead and then I was very strict with myself and pulled myself together and really started fighting for every single point. "After winning the first set, I felt a little bit more in charge of the game. I felt more confidence on my service games in the second set, and overall I'm quite happy with the performance
