<TITLE> Amid turmoil, Asia banks not rushing to invest in West </TITLE>

 SINGAPORE/TOKYO, Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Growth-hungry Asian banks have largely dodged the huge credit losses that pushed Lehman Brothers to bankruptcy, but will be wary about trading precious capital to buy into ailing Western banks. As US and European financial firms reel from the credit crisis, analysts and investors say many Asian banks will be cautious about global expansion and focus on their home turf, where there is still potential for growth. "Given their relative strengths, they would have opportunities (overseas), but why bother?" said Hugh Young, managing director of Aberdeen Asset Management Asia, which manages over $35 billion in assets. "There's enough to do on their doorsteps," he said. Despite a weakening US economy, Standard & Poor's said Asian banks will avert a crisis because of the region's strong economic outlook and a better credit profile of borrowers than in the United States, where higher lending to people with poor credit histories eventually sparked a housing market meltdown. But Asian banks will still have their hands full as regional, export-dependent economies cool and financial markets tumble. The global crisis will make them even more risk averse. Acquisitions in Europe and the United States by Asian banks total $4.5 billion so far this year, down 12 percent from the same period last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters. But, at the same time, Asian banks have been steadily strengthening their presence across the region. Earlier this year, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Japan's largest bank, raised its stake in Singapore's Kim Eng Holdings, and unconfirmed media reports say smaller Japanese lender Shinsei Bank is looking to expand in India. "It's good for the commercial banks to be sticking to their knitting in Asia, where there's plenty of opportunity," said Warren Blight, a banking analyst with brokerage Fox-Pitt, Kelton in Hong Kong. REGULATORY HEADACHES Regulatory difficulties and political concerns in the West about foreigners' shopping sprees were already giving some Asian bankers headaches well before credit crisis worries set in. Some Asian governments and financial officials have grown increasingly worried, too. Analysts said the anxiety shown by regulators in South Korea, where state-run Korea Development Bank recently opted not to bid for Lehman, underlines the extent of Asian concerns about the risks of buying into US financials, no matter how cheap they look. Lehman drifted toward bankruptcy soon after KDB withdrew from a potential bid -- the latest victim of a year-long credit crisis that triggered the fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan and the shock sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America for $50 billion. Several large Japanese financials considered a deal with Lehman before its collapse, but decided against the risk, a financial industry source told Reuters last week. Mitsubishi UFJ has bid $3 billion to take control of its US unit UnionBanCal Corp and analysts have said the bank is likely to use its California unit for a platform for further M&A. But, critically, Japanese bank analysts have said the most likely target would be a US commercial bank -- not an investment bank feared to be sitting on more credit losses. "It comes down to risk appetite, and at the moment there's more of what we don't know than what we do," said Jason Rogers, a credit analyst at Barclays Capital. RISK AVERSE CHINESE Politics, lack of expertise and risk aversion have held back rich Chinese financial institutions from buying into big Western acquisitions. "Chinese banks surely have the ambition to expand overseas," said Qiu Zhicheng, a banking analyst at Haitong Securities in Shanghai. "But so far, their overseas expansion has not been successful, and has drawn a lot of criticism. So the government, as well as Chinese banks, have become more cautious." China has delayed approving Ping An Insurance's planned purchase of the asset management arm of Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis. China's CITIC Securities was linked earlier this year to Lehman, which is now trying to sell off its core US broker-dealer business. "Obviously some of the banks will look at the opportunities that will come out from divestment of assets," said Harsha Basnayake, a partner at Ernst & Young, who overseas the regional M&A team in Singapore. "But most of the financial sector players would probably want to have a comprehensive understanding of the market and the risks before they can put in their balance sheets." Even in Australia, where Macquarie Group and others have pushed into the US in recent years, analysts are skeptical that banks would have the appetite to buy. "While they do have spare cash, they would have to think there was a very good opportunity before they did anything," said Angus Gluskie, portfolio manager at White Funds Management.
