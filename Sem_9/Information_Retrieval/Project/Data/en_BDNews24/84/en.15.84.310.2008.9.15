<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League on Monday said a conspiracy was underway to scuttle the year-end general elections. "Chaos is being created and a clear conspiracy is being executed so that national elections are not held," acting party president Zillur Rahman said at a discussion in the city. He did not, however, enlarge on the 'conspiracy' but added that attempts were on to rehabilitate those responsible for the pre-Jan. 11, 2007 events that had led to the emergency rule. Zillur said Hasina, facing a slew of graft charges, was innocent. Stand-in general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam urged supporters to resist the scheme . "A conspiracy was going on against the elections. Everyone must stop this conspiracy. If the elections are not held in time it would have an adverse impact on the economy and politics of the country." On government initiatives to bring Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina to the table, policymaking presidium member Tofail Ahmed said, "It is not possible for Awami League to sit with those who want to kill Sheikh Hasina." The discussion, organised by Tungipara Samity, Dhaka and held at the Supreme Court Bar Association auditorium, was organised to pressure authorities to unconditionally release party chief Sheikh Hasina, who is out on parole receiving treatment in the USA. Commenting on the government initiatives for the talks, AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said the party's central working committee would meet with Hasina at the helm to decide next course of action. "There is some motive behind comparing Sheikh Hasina to Khaleda Zia. It is part of the conspiracy to take the country in another direction." Tofail said, "We have to face the conspiracy again. It has already been proved that if a neutral election is held Awami League will win. That is why attempts are being made to make the Jatiya Sangsad election uncertain by holding Upazila elections." "The Jatiya Sangsad (parliament) election has to be held by the third week of December as per the roadmap (announced by the Election Commission). If the election is not held in time I cannot imagine what will happen." Ashraful Islam, echoing the party president's speech in New York on Sunday, said, "Flawed reasons are being cited at local and international levels to delay the election. If the election is delayed for once, no election will be held in next five years." President of the organisation Sheikh Kabir Hossain presided. Presidium member Abdur Razzak, joint general secretary Mukul Bose and the party's industry and commerce secretary Faruk Khan also spoke. bdnew
