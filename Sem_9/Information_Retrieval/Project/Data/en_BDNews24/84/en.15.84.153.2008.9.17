"Jorge Luis Pinto will not continue as coach of the Colombian national team and will be replaced by Eduardo Lara. "The federation thanks the professionalism, hard work and commitment of professor Pinto with the national team." Colombia, who last qualified for the World Cup in 1998, are sixth in the 10-team South American group with 10 points from eight games but have scored only four goals.
