<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman on Sunday said there was no practice of democracy in the BNP. "There is no vestige of democracy in the party," Zillur said at an iftar party at his Gulshan home. On the permanent leadership of Khaleda, he said: "It is would be greed for power." "Councillors of a party are there to elect a chairperson. Chairperson will not be made by any administration," he added. The AL leader said the announcement relating to Khaleda's leadership for life sounded absurd. He added that the AL would announce movement for permanent release of Sheikh Hasina 'if necessary' after her return. bdn
