<TITLE> Nepal's Maoist PM says needs China, but India crucial </TITLE>

 New Delhi, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal wants to develop relations with neighbouring China, but its "age-old" ties with India remain crucial, the Nepali Maoist prime minister said on Monday. India appeared miffed after Prime Minister Prachanda travelled to China last month for the Olympics closing ceremony, departing from a tradition which has seen incoming Nepali leaders make New Delhi their first foreign port of call. The move was seen in New Delhi as an attempt by the Maoist-led government to embrace communist China at the expense of its long-standing friendship with India. The Maoists won a historic election and came to power following a landmark peace deal signed in 2006 with the government to abolish the country's 239-year-old monarchy and declare Nepal a republic. On his first visit to India as prime minister, Prachanda said he wanted to reaffirm Nepal's commitment to "age-old ties" and the need to forge a stronger relationship with India. "I think that due to our historical, cultural and geographical relations, due to our whole tradition of inter- dependence, the relation with India is crucial and vital," Prachanda said in New Delhi. "Although we also want to develop a relation with China, but it cannot be compared right now, no questions of comparison." Addressing an India-Nepal business meeting in the capital, Prachanda said Nepal was ready to invite investments from India, particularly in the hydro-power sector. "We would like to start afresh ... big projects should be undertaken, not petty projects in the hydropower sector," Prachanda said. Kathmandu is unhappy that a trade deficit with India rose to $1.1 billion in the financial year up to mid-July 2007 from $977 million in the same period last year. Bilateral trade now exceeds $2.3 billion, but Nepal says business opportunities are there to be explored in the Himalayan nation. "India should help us realise the dream of being together and growing together ... I call upon the private sectors in both countries to work together and chart our mutually beneficial areas."
