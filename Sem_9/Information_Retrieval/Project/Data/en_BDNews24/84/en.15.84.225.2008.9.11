 LONDON, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold recovered from 11-month lows on Thursday as the dollar slipped from highs in response to US trade data, and as firm physical demand for the precious metal underpinned prices. The stronger dollar was the key factor driving gold to fresh 11-month lows, platinum to its weakest level since January 2007 and silver and palladium to multi-year lows earlier, as its recovery dented precious metals' appeal as an alternative investment. Spot gold traded at $745.70/746.90 an ounce at 1319 GMT from $752.55/754.15 in New York on Wednesday, having earlier fallen to a session low of $738.50. The precious metal slipped nearly 2 percent as the dollar reached a one-year high against the euro. However, the dollar's retreat after data showed the US trade deficit widened in July allowed gold to pull back some ground. With the effect of the strengthening dollar balancing resurgent demand for coins, bars and jewellery, the outlook for gold remains volatile, analysts said. "From a fundamental point of view I would expect (gold) prices to be stronger over the coming months due to high demand, but from a technical point of view there are reasons to believe they may go even lower," Commerzbank analyst Eugen Weinberg said. Among other precious metals, platinum and palladium also recovered after dipping dramatically in earlier trade. Platinum slipped more than 4 percent and palladium 5 percent as fears over the outlook for automotive sector demand sparked selling. Spot platinum fell to a session low of $1,126 an ounce, its weakest level since Jan 2007, before recovering to trade at $1,154.00/1,174.00 an ounce at against $1,176.00/1,196.00 late in New York on Wednesday. Spot palladium also slipped to a fresh three-year low of $212.50 an ounce, before recovering to trade at $227.00/233.00 against $224.00/232.00. The automotive sector has been suffering the effects of the recent global economic slowdown. Ford Canada said on Wednesday it is cutting another 500 jobs in Ontario as US sales continue to deteriorate. Over half of global platinum demand comes from the car industry. "Demand has come to the forefront rather than supply, which the market was all about in the first half of this year," said Mitsubishi precious metals strategist Tom Kendall. "People's attention just keeps getting drawn back to...the auto industry." UBS analyst John Reade said in a note that "unprecedented" over-the-counter liquidation in platinum, plus selling on TOCOM, NYMEX and by exchange-traded funds, has seen 2-3 million ounces of the metal sold since early July. "Contrast that with annual supply of about 8 million ounces and a forecast deficit of about 500,000 ounces, and the price move becomes more understandable," he said. Fears over demand have pushed platinum down more than 50 percent from the highs of $2,290 an ounce it hit in March this year, after news of an electricity shortage in South Africa, which produces 80 percent of global supply of the metal. Among other precious metals, spot silver slipped to $10.71/10.78 from $10.75/10.83. Earlier it touched a session low of $10.58, its weakest in nearly two years
