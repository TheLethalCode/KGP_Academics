 Kabul, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led forces killed more than 10 militants and detained two during operations in eastern Afghanistan that also targeted the network of veteran Taliban commander Jalaluddin Haqqani, the US military said on Friday. US forces have focused on Haqqani's network this week, firing missiles from drones into a house and a religious school founded by him in Pakistan's tribal region just over the border, killing 23 people, mostly his relatives. On Thursday, two members of Haqqani's team were picked up in Afghanistan's Khost province, including one suspected of coordinating roadside attacks on coalition and Afghan forces, the US military said. Haqqani, who was backed by the United States during the war against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, is considered close to Osama bin Laden. US forces also targeted a Taliban commander in Kapisa province, northeast of the capital Kabul, and in the fighting that erupted 10 militants were killed, the military said. "Coalition forces were engaged with small-arms fire from multiple groups of armed militants as they entered a compound. The force returned fire, killing the militants," the statement said. Violence has hit its worst level in Afghanistan since the Taliban's ouster in 2001. More than 2,700 people including some 1,100 civilians have been killed so far this year, aid agencies say
