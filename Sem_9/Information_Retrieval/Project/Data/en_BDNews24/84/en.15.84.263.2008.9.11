 New Delhi, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India said on Thursday it was negotiating agreements to buy nuclear technology and facilities from countries such as France and Russia, days after winning a waiver on a ban that had stopped it from accessing the global atomic market. Actual deals would be signed only after a bilateral civilian nuclear agreement between India and United States is ratified by the U.S. Congress, the foreign ministry said. The bilateral deal, which will allow India access to American nuclear fuel and technology, turns a new chapter in India's relations with the West, which imposed a ban on atomic trade with India after New Delhi tested nuclear devices three decades ago. That ban was waived by a 45-nation suppliers cartel last week, enabling India to access the global nuclear market to meet its booming economy's soaring energy needs, estimated to be worth billions of dollars. "Government is taking steps to realise commercial cooperation with foreign partners in this field," a foreign ministry statement said. "We have informed the USA about our intent to source state of the art nuclear technologies and facilities based on the provisions of the 123 Agreement from the U.S." It said the government was moving to finalise agreements with "friendly partner countries" such as France and Russia. The U.S. Congress is likely to take up the bilateral deal for an up or down vote this month. Critics say the deal undermines nuclear no-proliferation efforts. Already, Russia is building two 1,000 megawatt reactors at Kudankulam in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu as part of a deal signed in 1988. Indian officials said the two countries would begin discussions on a multi-billion dollar deal to build four more nuclear reactors in Kudankulam that has been delayed because of international restrictions against New Delhi. Russian nuclear reactors cost up to $2 billion each but India could expect to get a hefty discount on such a major deal, as Russia competes with the United States for influence in India. Officials say New Delhi is also negotiating a bilateral deal with France for nuclear energy projects billions of dollars, also being eyed by U.S. suppliers including Connecticut-based General Electric Co. and Pennsylvania-based Westinghouse Electric Co, a unit of Tokyo-based Toshiba Corp. Prospects for nuclear trade with India -- expected at about $27 billion in investment in 18-20 new nuclear power plants over the next 15 years -- has boosted the stock market value of nuclear equipment makers.
