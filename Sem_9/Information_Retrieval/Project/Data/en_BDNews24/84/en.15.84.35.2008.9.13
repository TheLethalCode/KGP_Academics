<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania's football federation gave national coach Victor Piturca a vote of confidence on Friday after his team's rocky start to World Cup qualifying. Romania were hammered 3-0 by Lithuania in their Group Seven opener last weekend and could only manage a 1-0 victory away to Faroe Islands on Wednesday. "Piturca has all our support, he's able to get the national team back on track for the match against France," federation director Ionut Lupescu told reporters with an eye on their next qualifier on Oct. 11. "Romania's chances of qualifying are alive, as Lithuania are the only team with six points from the first two group matches," Lupescu said. As for their game against the 2006 World Cup finalists in the Black sea port of Constanta, he added: "I don't see any reason for not beating France at home." The confidence vote follows Sunday's announcement by federation president Mircea Sandu that Piturca's position would be reviewed after the Faroe Islands match
