 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  The National Committee for Resisting Vested Property Act on Monday demanded the Vested Properties Return Act 2001 be amended and put into effect by December. Subrata Chowdhury, member secretary of the committee, also asked the government to publish a gazette with details of the land vested before 1974. The demands came at a discussion meeting at Sufia Kamal Bhaban auditorium in Segunbagicha. "There are many discrepancies in the act and it has failed to protect the interest of the affected people," said Subrata Chowdhury. On April 9 2001, during Awami League's term, parliament passed the Vested Properties Return Act 2001 in order to return the vested land of citizens of the country. The government had earlier formed a parliamentary sub-committee to repeal the previous Vested Property Act and restore vested properties to original owners. According to the law, vested lands or buildings occupied by the government must be returned to their original owners or their legitimate heirs if they are citizens of Bangladesh. Subrata said Bangladeshi citizens should be given the right of enjoying their family assets. In 1965, the Pakistan government promulgated the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance and the Defence of Pakistan Rules during the Indo-Pak war. Under the rules, all Indian citizens and people living in India were dubbed enemies of Pakistan and their property, termed "enemy property," was confiscated by the state. As many as 26 lakh Hindu families were affected by the rules, Subrata said. "Every warring country formulates such laws to protect the land of those fleeing for safety leaving their property behind. But the properties are returned once the war ends." Bangladeshis have yet to have vested returned. Post-independence, the Bangladesh government renamed 'enemy property' as vested property in 1974. Subrara said the gazette of the vested properties should be published on the basis of a census list made before 1974. "The Supreme Court has declared the properties, vested after 1974, illegal," he said. Workers Party of Bangladesh president Rashed Khan Menon said: "I have to hear the complaint in my constituency. The issue is related to communal attitude." Bangladesh Hindu Trustee Board trustee Jitendra Lal Duttta added: "The Hindu community is victim to discrimination in this country." bdnew
