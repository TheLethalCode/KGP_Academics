 LONDON, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Round-up of injury news ahead of this weekend's Premier League games: Owen Hargreaves, suffering tendonitis in his knee, is a major doubt for Manchester United against Liverpool at Anfield but new striker Dimitar Berbatov should make his debut. Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres have both been passed fit for the hosts. Gerrard, who has undergone surgery for a groin problem, and Torres, who had a hamstring strain, were not expected to return to action for another week. The club said on Friday they would be available for the lunchtime kickoff. Arsenal's Samir Nasri (knee) may not be fit to travel to Blackburn Rovers, while defender Mikael Silvestre is unlikely to make his debut having signed from Manchester United on Aug. 20. Aston Villa's Spanish defender Carlos Cuellar, who joined from Rangers last month and has yet to make his debut, is a doubt for Monday's match at Tottenham Hotspur. Former Chelsea and Reading midfielder Steve Sidwell is also struggling to make the squad. Blackburn defender and Dutch international Andre Ooijer strained a hamstring against Macedonia in Wednesday's World Cup qualifier and is being assessed ahead of Arsenal's visit. However Paraguay striker Roque Santa Cruz came through 90 minutes against Venezuela unscathed. Chelsea will be without Michael Essien, who ruptured an anterior cruciate knee ligament playing for Ghana against Libya in a World Cup qualifier. The injury will keep him out for at least five months. Michael Ballack is struggling with an ankle problem, but striker Didier Drogba might feature on the bench for his first appearance of the season. New Everton signing and Danish international Lars Jacobsen dislocated his shoulder against Portugal on Wednesday and could miss Sunday's trip to Stoke City. Liverpool defender and Danish international Daniel Agger played the entire match against Portugal and could be considered for Saturday's game against Manchester United. Agger has not played a Premier League game for the Anfield side since September 2007 due to injury. Manchester City defender Micah Richards is hoping to be fit for Saturday's game against Chelsea. However, winger Martin Petrov is set to miss out after jarring his knee against Midtjylland in the UEFA Cup qualifier. City will assess record signing Robinho upon his return from a 10-day stint with Brazil before deciding whether he will feature. Middlesbrough could be without Turkish international forward Tuncay Sanli, who injured his knee in the 1-1 draw with Belgium on Wednesday, and defender David Wheater, who has suspected tonsillitis
