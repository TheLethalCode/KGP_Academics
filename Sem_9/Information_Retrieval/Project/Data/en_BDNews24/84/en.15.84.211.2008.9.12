<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief Khaleda Zia met "exclusively" with Jamaat-e-Islami leader Matiur Rahman Nizami at her cantonment home Thursday night, a source close to the former prime minister said. The meeting between the two top leaders of the four-party alliance followed the former prime minister's statement hours earlier that she would join both electoral dialogue and the general elections planned for December. "BNP and the four-party combine will fight the elections together and again form the government," she told party colleagues at the Naya Paltan headquarters in the afternoon after her release from year-long detention. Both parties boycotted the latest rounds of talks with the government and the Election Commission prior to Khaleda's release on bail. The source, who refused to be named, said the Jamaat chief drove to her Mainul Road villa late evening. No other aides were known to have joined their meeting, said the source at her Mainul Road home.
