 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court Monday suspended proceedings for three months of an ACC case against former caretaker government adviser Justice Fazlul Huq, charged with earning illegal wealth. The High Court bench of Justice Mirza Hossein Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman gave the order on a writ petition submitted by Fazlul Huq challenging the validity of the case. The court also issued a rule nisi on the Anticorruption Commission and the government to show cause within four weeks as to why the filing of the case and its proceedings should not be declared without legal authority. Advocate Helaluddin Mollah, representing the petitioner, the ACC did not follow due process in filing the case and pressing charges. He said the law stipulates that three members of the commission must approve the filing of a case and submission of the chargesheet. "But in this case only one commissioner gave approval. The approval was not legal and the proceedings of the case cannot continue," argued the lawyer. ACC assistant director and investigation officer of the case Mohammad Ibrahim pressed charges against Huq on Sept 2, for illegal earnings of Tk 1.80 crore and concealing wealth-related information from the commission. Dhaka metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque issued an arrest warrant against Justice Fazlul Huq on Sept 3. The High Court granted him anticipatory bail in the case on Sept 4. bdnew
