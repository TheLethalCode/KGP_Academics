 HONG KONG, Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - U.S. equity market futures sank on Monday, pointing to a sharply lower New York open after buyout talks for Lehman Brothers faltered and a media report said insurer AIG was seeking emergency funding. S&P 500 futures fell 46.5 points, or 3.7 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were off 360 points, or 3.14 percent. One of the world's largest insurers, American International Group Inc, was asking the Federal Reserve for a bridge loan of $40 billion to shore up its depleted capital position, the New York Times reported.
