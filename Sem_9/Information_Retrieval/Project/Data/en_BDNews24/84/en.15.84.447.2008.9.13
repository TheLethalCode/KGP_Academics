 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia called an urgent meeting of her party's standing committee on Saturday, two days after her release from special jail. The meeting of the party's top policymaking body began at 4.30pm to discuss a schedule and agenda for BNP's planned dialogue with the government, among other urgent issues stemming from Khaleda's release, a party official said. "The standing committee meeting will be held Saturday afternoon at the party head office in Naya Paltan," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com Saturday morning. The number of standing committee members totals 11, including Khaleda, M Saifur Rahman, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, Abdul Matin Chowdhury, Khandaker Delwar Hossain, AR Goni, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, Moudud Ahmed, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmad, Mahbubur Rahman and M Shamsul Islam. Khandaker Mosharraf and Moudud are currently behind bars. The last standing committee meeting was controversially held amid intra-party factionalism on Oct 29 at Saifur's Gulshan home, while Khaleda was still behind bars. bdnew
