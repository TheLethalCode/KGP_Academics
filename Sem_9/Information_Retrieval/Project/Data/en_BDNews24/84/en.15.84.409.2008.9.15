<TEXT>
 Melbourne,Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Australian jury found a Muslim cleric and five of his followers guilty on Monday of planning to stage a "violent jihad" in Melbourne in 2005 to force Australian troops out of Iraq. But the jury in Australia's biggest terrorism trial acquitted four other Muslim men and was still to decide on the fate of two others after deliberating for four weeks, court officials said. The prosecutor told the Victoria state Supreme Court that the group had planned to attack a grand final football match in Australia's second-largest city, Melbourne, attended by 97,000 fans. No attack took place. Australia has never suffered a peacetime attack on home soil, but more than 90 Australians were killed in bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali since 2002. Muslim cleric Abdul Benbrika, 48, was found guilty of leading and being a member of an unnamed terrorist body, while five of his followers were found guilty of being members of a terrorist group. All 12 men were charged with being members of an unnamed terrorist organisation and planning to use explosives or weapons for an undisclosed terrorist act, with the intention of coercing a government or intimidating the public. The prosecutor said Benbrika and his followers planned a bomb attack on an Australian Football League (AFL) grand final, but security raids on the homes of some members forced the group to change its target. The judge had told jurors not to let prejudices towards Muslims cloud their judgement when deciding whether the 12 Australians were a terrorist gang which planned to use violence to force Australian troops from Iraq. Australia withdrew its 550 combat troops from Iraq in June 2008, but still has about 1,000 troops in Afghanistan
