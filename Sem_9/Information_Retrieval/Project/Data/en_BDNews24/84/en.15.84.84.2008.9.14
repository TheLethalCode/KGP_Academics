<TITLE> Petraeus to leave behind a very different Iraq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Baghdad,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When General David Petraeus took over as US military commander in Iraq in February 2007, the country was on the brink of all-out civil war. Car bombs rocked Baghdad every day -- including 42 alone during the month he assumed command. But backed by 30,000 extra US soldiers, Petraeus implemented a new counterinsurgency strategy that combined with other factors helped drag Iraq back from the abyss. Petraeus hands control of US forces in Iraq to his former deputy, Lieutenant-General Raymond Odierno, on Tuesday. He leaves behind a very different Iraq. Violence has dropped to levels not seen since early 2004 and Iraqi officials now eagerly talk about drumming up foreign investment. The wiry, scholarly looking Petraeus acknowledges he harbored dark thoughts at times during his command. "Certainly you do have moments where if you are honest with yourself in something as difficult as this has been, you occasionally wonder if it will be achievable," Petraeus told Reuters in an interview in Baghdad in late July. "But we are in a very different place now than from where we were a year, a year and a half ago." Petraeus will still be involved in Iraq policy when he takes over next month as head of the US Central Command, the headquarters that oversees operations in a swathe of countries across the Middle East and beyond, including Afghanistan. He has spent more time in Iraq than just about any other American soldier since the US-led invasion in 2003. While some critics question whether the security gains in Iraq are sustainable and have been matched by enough political progress, Petraeus was pivotal in getting violence down. Upon taking command in Iraq he moved troops off their big, fortified bases and into population centers in Baghdad where al Qaeda was wreaking havoc with car bombs and sectarian death squads were roaming the streets at will. This meant setting up small joint combat outposts throughout Baghdad and other places where US soldiers lived and fought with Iraqi troops. Petraeus also ordered a wave of aggressive operations against insurgents of all stripes. The initial stages were costly -- during the months of April-June 2007 more than 330 US troops were killed in Iraq, making it the deadliest quarter of the war. But then troop deaths began to fall rapidly as all "surge" forces deployed, increasing numbers of Sunni Arab tribal groups joined the fight against al Qaeda and Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr imposed a ceasefire on his Mehdi Army militia. GRUELLING SCHEDULE Petraeus kept up a grueling schedule. He made regular visits to the battlefield to speak to troops and to seek feedback on how the war was being fought. Arriving at a military base in volatile Diyala province last October on a trip accompanied by Reuters, Petraeus went straight into a meeting with junior officers. He wanted their views without the base commander present. That was part of Petraeus's approach, say aides: encourage the lieutenants and captains who were in the field every day to talk freely, without their immediate superiors around. Ordinary soldiers would send him emails. Petraeus also showed media savvy in Baghdad and Washington, never getting drawn into over-optimistic predictions about Iraq when statistics showed violence dropping sharply. Even now, he repeatedly says there will be no "victory dance" in Iraq. Richard Kohn, a military historian at the University of North Carolina, said Petraeus has the highest public profile and popularity of any US general in years but cautioned that could change if Iraq unraveled or he did not impress in his next job. Petraeus would face even more difficult challenges, such as the war in Afghanistan and militancy in Pakistan, when he takes on the Central Command job, Kohn said. "He's got an even more complex situation on his hands," Kohn said
