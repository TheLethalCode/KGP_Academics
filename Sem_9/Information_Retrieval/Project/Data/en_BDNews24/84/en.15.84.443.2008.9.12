 Suman Mahmud bdnews24.com Chief Political Correspondent Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com) Hafizuddin Ahmed, venturing an outright U-turn in stance 24 hours into the release of BNP chief Khaleda Zia, has announced that he accepts Khandker Delwar Hossain as secretary general. He told bdnews24.com he rang Khaleda up on Friday. "I spoke to madam Friday. She is a bit ill. She has told me that I can meet her once she gets well." Hafizuddin, who was nominated acting secretary general by the BNP's policymaking standing committee on Oct 29 last year, now thinks the standing committee's decision was wrong. "BNP was united under the leadership of Khaleda Zia and it will remain so. There is no dispute about her leadership. "That is why I and my followers have accepted the leadership of her nominated secretary general," he said at his Banani home. His latest remarks echo those of Khaleda who told party supporters Thursday that the 'division' within BNP was media propaganda. The former prime minister said: "I will work with all." "Those who were with the BNP when I had gone to jail are still with the party. I ask them to work together." "The BNP is united and will stay united in future," she said. Minutes before arrest on Sept 3 last year on graft charges, Khaleda had expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and replaced him with standing committee member Delwar. Seven out of 12 members of the standing committee met on Oct 29 night at M Saifur Rahman's and did not approve the expulsion of Bhuiyan. The meeting nominated Saifur as acting chairman and Hafizuddin acting secretary general of the beleaguered party. The move split the BNP in two, with the Delwar-led faction taking the Election Commission to court after the commission had invited Hafizuddin to the electoral dialogue in a letter addressing him as the acting secretary general. Enlarging on the Oct 29 decision, Hafizuddin said, "Saifur Rahman has already spoken about the decision. After this, the decision made on October 29 stands void." Saifur on May 7 told journalists, "Since some standing committee members who were present on the night of October 29 have filed affidavit in the court my chairmanship has ceased to be in force." Hafiz said he was elated at the release of Khaleda and heaped praise on her leadership. "Khaleda Zia is the leader of all of us. We are happy at her release. The leader's statement after her release reflected her brilliance and wisdom." "BNP is a big party. There may be differences of opinion, [which can be] resolved through discussion." On the party's reforms Hafizuddin said, "Our reform proposals have been included in the amended Representation of People Ordinance. Our leader is also for reform. Whatever reform takes place will take place under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." Hafiz also distanced himself from the reforms Bhuiyan had proposed on June 25 last year. "Mannan Bhuiyan rolled out the reforms proposal without consulting with us. The proposal relating to the party chairperson is in no way acceptable." In the 15-point package launched at a news conference, Bhuiyan had proposed curbing the powers of the party chairperson. He proposed that the chairperson would be elected for three years through direct vote of the council members and that no-one could remain chairperson for more than two terms. If the chairperson became prime minister, he/she will have to resign the chairperson's post. The provision would also apply to those who have already served two terms or more than six years as chairperson, Bhuiyan proposed. He had met with Hafizuddin and other pro-reform leaders before launching the reform proposal. Bhuiyan is also also happy about Khaleda's release. Speaking to journalists at his Gulshan NAM flat on Friday, he said, "The party will be stronger with the release of Khaleda Zia. A united BNP will participate in the next elections and win again." "I'm personally happy with the release of the leader. The people were waiting for her release. I express my gratitude to the Almighty Allah for her release." He also thinks the release has put the country one step closer to restoration of democracy. "A free and fair election will be held in December. All parties will participate in it.." bdne
