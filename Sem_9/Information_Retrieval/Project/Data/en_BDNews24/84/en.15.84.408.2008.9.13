<TITLE> Hurricane Ike menaces vulnerable Texas coast </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Houston, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Ike roared toward the Texas coast on Friday, threatening to drive a 6-metre wall of water into coastal communities and menacing Galveston and Houston, the nation's fourth largest city. In what may be the worst storm to hit Texas in nearly 50 years, Ike is expected to make landfall within hours, the National Hurricane Center said. High winds and rain lashed the coast, sending huge waves crashing against a 5-meter sea wall built to protect Galveston, a barrier island, after a hurricane in 1900 killed at least 8,000 people in the deadliest weather disaster in US history. The National Weather Service warned that people in coastal areas could "face the possibility of death" and officials said the enormous storm could flood as many as 100,000 homes and send a huge wave across 160 km of US coastline. "Our nation is facing what is by any means a potentially catastrophic hurricane," said US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, warning that the storm surge could present the gravest danger. "This certainly falls in the category of pretty much a worst case scenario," he said. Crude oil markets nervously watched to see if Ike would swamp refineries in its path that collectively process 20 percent of US fuel supplies. Some 600,000 people left coastal Texas counties under mandatory evacuation orders, but authorities were concerned that many had refused to evacuate. Some who thought they would stick it out made a last-minute exit from Galveston. "When I woke up, my bed was floating in the house," said David Daubuisson, a handyman who narrowly escaped from his home in Bayou Vista. "I just took what I could and got out." Ike was a Category 2 storm with 175 kph winds, just shy of a Category 3 hurricane on the five-step intensity scale with winds of more than 178 kph. At 10 pm CDT (0300 GMT), the storm was about 85 km south-southeast of Galveston and moving northwest at 19 kph, the center said. MASSIVE POWER OUTAGE About 13 million people in 132 counties along the Gulf coast could face hurricane and tropical storm conditions, the U.S. National Census Bureau said. Scattered blackouts were reported in communities near the coast, and utilities warned of a "massive" outage affecting millions of homes and businesses. A dawn-to-dusk curfew was imposed in evacuated areas around Houston as officials took action to prevent looting. At least 12 house fires burned on Galveston Island, where chest-high floodwaters prevented fire crews from reaching the blazes, local television reported. The Coast Guard had to rescue 65 people from rising waters on the Bolivar Peninsula, east of Galveston. U.S. crude oil futures rose 31 cents to $101.18 a barrel after dropping below $100 for the first time since early April as concerns over U.S. economic weakness outweighed storm disruption fears. Ports were closed and the Coast Guard said a 178-metre freighter with 22 people aboard was stranded without power 145 km southeast of Galveston. The hurricane's wide reach means it will pack an unusually strong punch, taking the form of a huge wave of water it is pushing ahead of it. The storm surge could push as far inland as NASA's Johnson Space Center south of Houston, said Jeff Masters, co-founder of meteorological Web site The Weather Underground. Houston airports were closed and hotels were jammed with those seeking shelter. Ike could be the third-most damaging storm in US history behind Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992, experts said. Risk Management Solutions pegged the value of insured property in the Houston area at nearly $1 trillion, including the city's port -- the nation's second busiest. The costliest storm in US history, Katrina devastated New Orleans and other parts of the Gulf Coast, killing 1,500 people and causing at least $81 billion in damage. It also damaged President George W Bush's standing and his administration was heavily criticized for its slow response to the disaster
