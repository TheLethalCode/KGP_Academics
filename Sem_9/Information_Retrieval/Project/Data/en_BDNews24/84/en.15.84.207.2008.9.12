 ROME, September 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A. Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho faces a midfield dilemma for Saturday's home game against Catania (1830) after injuries to Dejan Stankovic and Luis Jimenez left him shorthanded in the centre of the park. He could risk midfielders Patrick Vieira and Olivier Dacourt, who are coming back from injuries themselves, or use Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Zanetti, who may be fatigued by their late return from duty with the Argentine national team. New signing Ricardo Quaresma is expected to make his Serie A debut on the wing for the champions and defender Ivan Cordoba should come back from a seven-month absence after knee surgery. Francesco Totti's fitness is the biggest of a number of headaches AS Roma boss Luciano Spalletti has before Saturday's visit to Palermo (1600). The striker has shaken off an ankle knock that kept him out of the opening day draw with Napoli but pains in his knee, which was operated on in April, have put his participation in doubt. Spalletti is also without Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta because of an Achilles problem, while the Brazilian trio of goalkeeper Doni, defender Juan and forward Julio Baptista are all doubts. Mali midfielder Momo Sissoko is available for Juventus's home game against Udinese on Sunday (1830) after serving a suspension in the Turin side's 1-1 draw at Fiorentina two weeks ago. Coach Claudio Ranieri should be able to call on fit-again striker David Trezeguet, as well as midfielders Marco Marchionni and Cristiano Zanetti. Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini is recovering faster than expected from a twisted knee and is tipped to get a place on the bench. The thigh strain which striker Filippo Inzaghi suffered in a midweek friendly in Switzerland may give Andriy Shevchenko his first competitive start since returning to AC Milan when they face Genoa away on Sunday (1300). Milan are also without defender Alessandro Nesta, who has a back problem, and midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, who injured his wrist training with Italy last weekend. But Brazil playmaker Kaka said his knee is better and he expects to play, while new signing Philippe Senderos is aiming for a place in defence after a back problem sidelined him for the opening day defeat by Bologna. Genoa striker Diego Milito will be unable to play if the documentation for his transfer from Spanish second division side Real Zaragoza does not arrive in tim
