<TITLE> Genoa hand Milan second consecutive defeat </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, September 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan lost 2-0 at Genoa on Sunday for their second consecutive defeat in Serie A after losing to promoted Bologna in the opening match. Giuseppe Sculli struck in the first half and Diego Milito converted a stoppage-time penalty. The result increases the pressure on coach Carlo Ancelotti following Milan's disappointing fifth-place finish last season and an embarrassing 2-0 defeat at second-division Swiss side Lugano in a friendly on Wednesday. Juventus beat Udinese 1-0 to claim their first league win of the campaign with a goal by Brazilian striker Amauri, a close-season signing from Palermo. Champions Inter Milan beat Catania 2-1 at home and last year's runners-up AS Roma lost 3-1 at Palermo on Saturday. "Looking at the standings there's nothing to be happy about," Ancelotti told Sky television. "But we have what it takes and the time to put things right and I'm sure we will. The club is supporting me and my relationship with the players hasn't changed." Milan, fielding an attacking trio of Ballon d'Or winners Kaka, Andriy Shevchenko and Ronaldinho, made the early running, but Genoa defended well and were dangerous on the counter-attack. Sculli fired the home side in front on the half hour after Milito had chested the ball into his path. MILITO STRIKE Milan tried to fashion a response after the break but Genoa continued to pose a threat and keeper Christian Abbiati produced good saves to stop Sculli and Anthony Vanden Borre doubling their side's lead. Substitute Alexandre Pato blasted Milan's best chance of the second half at Genoa keeper Rubinho. Argentine Milito wrapped up the match with a spot kick after being tripped by Paolo Maldini on his return from Real Zaragoza to the club he played for in 2004 and 2005 in Serie B. Juventus, who were held 1-1 at Fiorentina two weeks ago, dominated the first half in Turin when Amauri hit the post with a header. Denmark midfielder Christian Poulsen rattled the crossbar with a powerful long-distance shot before Amauri sidefooted a loose ball home in the 67th minute. Lazio are the early pacemakers courtesy of a 2-0 home win over Sampdoria secured with goals by Mauro Zarate and Goran Pandev. Atalanta also have a 100 percent record from two games after Tiberio Guarente gave them a 1-0 victory at Bologna. Napoli came from behind to beat Fiorentina 2-1 thanks to second-half goals by Marek Hamsik and Christian Maggio after Adrian Mutu had put the visitors ahead four minutes before the break. The end stands of Napoli's San Paolo stadium were closed and will remain shut for the next two home games as a penalty after violence marred their opening-day visit to Roma. The game was also one of three games considered high risk which away fans were banned from, along with Genoa-Milan and Saturday's match between Inter and Catania at the San Siro
