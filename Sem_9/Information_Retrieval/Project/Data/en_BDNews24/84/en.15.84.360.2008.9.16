<TITLE> All banks to make farm loans: BB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank has made it mandatory for all local and foreign banks to distribute farming loans in a bid to ensure food security, the central bank announced Tuesday. "It is obvious from recent experience that there is no alternative in the long term to increasing investment in agriculture," BB deputy governor Nazrul Huda said at a press conference. "The central bank has accordingly taken this initiative in consultation with the government," said Huda, who is also chairman of a central bank committee to monitor distribution of agricultural credit. Huda also mentioned that the chief adviser had voiced strong support for compulsory distribution of farming loans at a recent 'dialogue' on public-private partnership for economic development. "After the abolishment of the 'directed lending' system under a financial sector amendment programme in 1990, banks began to treat farm loans as optional," said Huda. "Now it is being made compulsory for them considering the domestic and international situations." Replying to a query, Huda said the target for farm loans by banks had been set at Tk 9,400 crore in the current budget, which was 13 percent more than the last fiscal year. The central bank will not enforce fixed loan targets on individual banks. "The banks will fix their own target in accordance with their capacity," the deputy governor said. "The central bank will monitor whether their targets are rational," he added. Private banks have begun disbursing agricultural loans in recent times, but foreign banks have so far stayed clear of farm credit. The specialised government banks, Bangladesh Krishi Bank and Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank, disburse over 50 percent of farming loans. Other state-owned banks handle most of the remainder. bdnews
