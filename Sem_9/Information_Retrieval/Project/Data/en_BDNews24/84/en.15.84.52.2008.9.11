<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, September 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Teenager Theo Walcott scored a hat-trick for an inspired England to crush 10-man Croatia 4-1 in their World Cup Group Six qualifier in Zagreb on Wednesday. It was the first defeat in 36 qualifiers on home soil for the Croats since they resumed playing competitive football as an independent nation in 1994. After an evenly balanced opening 20 minutes, England scored following a mistake by Croatia defender Danijel Pranjic who, instead of clearing the ball, fired it into the back of his team mate Robert Kovac. The ball broke kindly for 19-year-old Walcott, who shot in across the keeper for his first international goal. Kovac was sent off in the 51st minute for a violent foul on Joe Cole, who suffered a gash on his head and had to be substituted. Walcott scored his second in the 59th minute with a copy of his first goal helped by Wayne Rooney. Four minutes later, Rooney got himself on the scoreboard after a great cross from Jermaine Jenas, who had come on to replace Cole. Croatia's young forward Mario Mandzukic scored in the 78th minute, his first goal for the national team. FINISHING TOUCH The finishing touch to Walcott's brilliant evening came eight minutes from time when he was again assisted by Rooney and left the helpless Croatia defence behind to slot the ball past Stipe Pletikosa. He received a noisy reception from English fans when he was substituted three minutes later, making way for David Beckham who recorded his 105th appearance for England. Walcott could not hide his exhilaration. "We took our chances today. Our team was brilliant. We showed our fans how strong we are. We have improved and we hope to keep on doing that," he told reporters. His captain said the team should not get carried away by the victory. "It was great to win three points here. We played well both individually and collectively but we have to keep our feet on the ground. There are tough matches ahead," John Terry said. England manager Fabio Capello told a news conference such a convincing victory suprised him. "I did not expect such a result, but I did expect the kind of game we put onThis is an important game for the players' self-confidence," he said. Capello said that he used the Euro 2008 games to study the Croatian team carefully. Croatia coach Slaven Bilic acknowledged England had been the better team but stressed that the qualifying campaign was still in its early stages. "It is true many perceived us as favourites before the game due to our good string of results in the last two years. However, we all know that England have fantastic players who are able to perform superbly like they did tonight," Bilic said in televised comments. Croatia beat England twice in the Euro 2008 qualifiers and local media had made them favourites to secure three in a ro
