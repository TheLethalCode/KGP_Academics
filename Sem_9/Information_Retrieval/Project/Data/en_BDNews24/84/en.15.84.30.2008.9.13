 Remittance from Malaysia soars nine fold: adviser Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)Remittance from Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia reached $92.44 million in fiscal 2007-08, soaring nearly nine fold from the previous year, said foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury on Saturday. Malaysia is also planning to recruit 1 lakh more Bangladeshi workers by the end of this year, he added. Kuala Lumpur lifted a near ten-year ban on unskilled Bangladeshi workers in October 2006, only to re-impose it in December last year. On the surge in remittance from Malaysia, the adviser said total remittance in year 2006-2007 was $11.8 million. "During 2007-2008 it rose to $92.44 million, a nearly nine fold increase." "We have come to know from informal sources that Malaysia is planning to recruit another 1 lakh Bangladeshis," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com. The move was expected "soon, maybe within this year," he added. Bangladesh was yet to be formally briefed in this regard, the adviser said. "But it is good news on both accountsfrom the standpoint of worker numbers and of remittance," Iftekhar said. Secretary for expatriate welfare and overseas employment, Abdul Matin Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Saturday that about 3,70,000 Bangladeshis went to Malaysia between bans over the last two fiscal years. A total of 4,46,000 Bangladeshis are living and working in Malaysia. bdn
