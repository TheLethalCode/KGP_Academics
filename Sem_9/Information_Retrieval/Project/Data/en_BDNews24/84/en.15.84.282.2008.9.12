 WELLINGTON, September 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Aggressive top-order batsman Jesse Ryder has recovered from a serious hand injury and been recalled to New Zealand's squad for their tour of Bangladesh. Ryder burst on to the scene in February this year against England before injuring his hand in a nightclub incident, requiring surgery that stopped him touring England in May. "I'm stoked to be given another chance," Ryder told the New Zealand Press Association. "It's been a long time coming. It was up to them (the selectors) to give me another chance and I'm just happy they did." Ryder made an immediate impression with his batting in an aggressive opening combination with wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum that blasted England off the park in the one-day series. However, the 24-year-old, who scored 196 runs in five innings at an average of 49 in the series, ran into trouble when he punched a window in a door in a Christchurch nightclub, severing tendons in his hand. He was named in the squad for the return tour of England, but had not recovered sufficiently in time to join the team. He returned to action during an emerging players tournament in Australia in July and was named on Friday for the three one-day international and two-test series in October. "The hand's fine," Ryder said. "I haven't got any problems with it at all." He said the nightclub incident had changed his attitude. "I've got a good support network around me now and we go through one day at a time in getting it all sorted," he added. Fast bowler Chris Martin, a regular fixture in the test side in recent years, has also returned to the one-day squad. Batsman Aaron Redmond, who made his international debut in England, has been named just for the test series. The teams will play three one-day internationals starting on Oct. 9. The first test begins in Chittagong on Oct. 17. "The team will have the challenge of competitive cricket in sub-continent conditions after the break enforced by the postponement of the Champions Trophy," said selector Dion Nash. Squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Grant Elliott, Daniel Flynn, Mark Gillespie (ODI only), Gareth Hopkins, Jamie How, Chris Martin, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien (tests only), Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Aaron Redmond (tests only), Jesse Ryder, Tim Southee, Scott Styris (ODI only), Ross Taylor
