 LISBON, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo received the European Golden Boot trophy at a ceremony in his native Madeira on Saturday. It took place at a hotel in the mid-Atlantic island, fulfilling Ronaldo's wish to receive the award where he was born as a tribute to his late father Diniz Aveiro. The European Footballer of the Year, who scored 31 goals in the Premier League last season to win the Golden Boot, has been sidelined since surgery on his right ankle in July. He finished the domestic campaign eight points clear of his closest rival in the race to be Europe's leading goalscorer with the results having been announced by UEFA on June 17. Spain striker Daniel Guiza was second with 27 Primera Liga goals for Real Mallorca while Klaas-Jan Huntelaar's 33 strikes earned Ajax Amsterdam's Netherlands forward third place. Benfica great Eusebio was the first Portuguese to win the Golden Boot in 1968 and 1973 followed by former Porto striker Fernando Gomes in 1983 and 1985
