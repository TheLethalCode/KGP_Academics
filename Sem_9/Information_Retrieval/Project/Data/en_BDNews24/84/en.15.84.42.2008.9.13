 MANCHESTER, England, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov will add a new dimension to the English and European champions' attack. United were hugely reliant on 42 goals from Cristiano Ronaldo last season and Ferguson believes the signing of Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur will give his side a more varied attacking threat. "I think now we have alternatives and with the possible combinations we look very strong. I think the addition of Dimitar is a big advantage for us," Ferguson told reporters. "If you look at the ages of my forward players they are all young. Dimitar takes us up a notch in terms of experience and the composure he will bring to the team. "Also his physical presence is something we've not had for a long time, probably since Teddy Sheringham or Eric Cantona, and his balance and vision are excellent . "His goal ratio is very good so he brings a lot of things to the team. I think his acquisition is a big, big step forward for Manchester United." Ferguson said he thought Berbatov, Carlos Tevez and Ronadlo were each capable of scoring 20 goals. "If Wayne (Rooney) can add into that you are talking about a fair amount of goalsdefinitely enough at the level you need to win things." United completed a protracted chase for Berbatov just minutes before the transfer window closed at the end of August and the Bulgarian international, 27, will fulfil a wish when he makes his debut against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. "My only goal was to come here. My ambitions and goals are big and I want to fulfil them at the biggest club in the world," Berbatov said. "It's the red shirt, it's the glory that when you say Manchester United people start thinking of the players that have come through and the titles Manchester United have won . "The people who know me, my closest friends, know I don't play for the money I play because I like the game and I like to entertain and I can achieve that here. "I want to win trophies and enjoy my game and I can achieve that here." Ferguson said he has a fully fit squad to choose from with Owen Hargreaves, Michael Carrick and Ryan Giggs all over injuries. Ronaldo is also expected to be in the squad but may not figure after recovering from ankle surgery
