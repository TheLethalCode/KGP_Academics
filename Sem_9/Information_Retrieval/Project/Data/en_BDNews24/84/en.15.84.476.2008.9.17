 LONDON, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United begin their defence of the Champions League on Wednesday and could welcome back Cristiano Ronaldo for the visit of Villarreal. Alex Ferguson's side have begun the season slowly and will be eager to make up for Saturday's 2-1 defeat at arch-rivals Liverpool in the Premier League. Ronaldo, who has not played since last season's Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow, is expected to return for the Group E opener after ankle surgery. Real Madrid face unfamiliar opponents in Group H when they begin their European campaign at home to BATE Borisov, the first Belarussian team to play in the Champions League. In the same group Juventus face a tough start when they welcome UEFA Cup winners Zenit St Petersburg. In Group G Arsenal visit Dynamo Kiev in their 100th Champions League match while Porto host Turkish club Fenerbahce. Bayern Munich return to the Champions League after missing out last season and face a trip to Steaua Bucharest
