 Istanbul,Sep 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A ferry carrying about 100 passengers sank near Turkey's northwest port of Bandirma overnight, killing at least one person and leaving some 30 people missing, officials said on Monday. Broadcaster NTV said two people had been killed but the report could not be independently verified. Local fishermen joined rescue operations when the roll-on roll-off ferry, loaded with 73 trucks and two cars, went down in the Sea of Marmara shortly after leaving Bandirma for Istanbul. Officials said 68 people had been rescued, 31 of whom were injured, but that strong waves and winds were hindering the search. "It looks like there are about 30 people who are missing, but this is a guess and that figure could rise or fall," said Selahattin Hatipoglu, governor of Balikesir province. Passengers do not have to buy individual tickets for ferries that transport vehicles from Bandirma, so the number of people on the vessel was difficult for officials to establish. Officials said the cause of the sinking was not immediately known, but that the ship began leaning to one side as it pulled out of the port. "The ship was rocking back and forth, to the left then to the right, then finally sunk, completely sunk," one survivor told CNNTurk television. Passengers said the ship sank in about 15 minutes and that many of those on board were asleep in their vehicles before it began to go down. The ship left Bandirma at 11.15 p.m. (6:15 EDT) on Sunday. Television pictures showed survivors being led from rescue vessels to the shore where ambulances were waiting. Five coastguard vessels and one helicopter have been sent to the area and divers were at the scene
