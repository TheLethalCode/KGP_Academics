 ROME, Sept 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fabrizio Miccoli struck twice as Palermo beat injury-hit AS Roma 3-1 at home in Serie A on Saturday to give new coach Davide Ballardini a winning start. Miccoli cancelled out Brazil striker Julio Baptista's eighth-minute opener with a stunning right-footed shot into the top corner from the edge of the box 12 minutes later. The forward ran on to a Fabio Simplicio through ball and chipped home in the 57th before Uruguayan Edinson Cavani sealed the win in the 73rd after another smart pass from Simplicio. Without regulars Simone Perrotta, Juan, Philippe Mexes, Mirko Vucinic and captain Francesco Totti, Roma's injury woes worsened when Italy midfielder Daniele De Rossi came off before half time after suffering a knock to the back of his head. Last year's runners-up Roma, who were held 1-1 by Napoli two weeks ago, have one point from two games. Palermo have three after the 3-1 defeat at Udinese on the first day that cost former boss Stefano Colantuono his job. Champions Inter Milan face Catania at home later on Saturday, while AC Milan visit Genoa and Juventus host Udinese on Sunday
