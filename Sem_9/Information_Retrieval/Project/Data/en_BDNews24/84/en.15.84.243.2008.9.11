 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)Awami League's Syed Ashraful Islam is "technically" still acting as general secretary of the party, AL acting president Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com Thursday evening. Earlier in the day, Jalil claimed he had officially resumed work as Awami League general secretary, demanding authorities unconditionally release party chief Sheikh Hasina and hold general elections before upazila polls. Jalil had met with Zillur after being released on bail on Wednesday. Zillur had told reporters at the time that, in line with the party constitution, after being released on bail Jalil was to resume in his post as Awami League general secretary. When Zillur's attention was drawn to this, he said: "Mr Abdul Jalil is our party's general secretary. But the charge of the general secretary has technically not yet been handed over to him." "Syed Ashraful Islam is still discharging the responsibilities of the party general secretary. He is the acting general secretary," said Zillur. The AL acting chief said party policy markers would hold a meeting "in four or five days", following which the post would formally be handed over to Jalil. bdnews24.
