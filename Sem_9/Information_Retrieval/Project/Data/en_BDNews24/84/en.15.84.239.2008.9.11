 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)Traffic gridlock was seen paralysing the capital following the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia from special jail on Thursday. Upon her on bail at around 11:30 am, Khaleda Zia drove straight to her husband Ziaur Rahman's grave site. After paying her respects at the late president's mausoleum, she visited her son Tarique Rahman at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. She was accompanied all along by a large retinue of BNP leaders and supporters following her vehicle in a great long motorcade. To facilitate her movements, the roads travelled by the former prime minister were kept traffic-free in advance, which meant unprecedented traffic tailbacks piled up at Bijoy Sarani, Kazi Nazrul Islam Avenue, the Farmgate area, the eastern and western flanks of Bangla Motors and around Shahbagh. As the 'VIP' avenue in front of BSMMU Hospital in Shahbagh was fully occupied by Khaleda's motorcade, traffic movement in the area virtually ceased during her visit with her son. Stretches of road from Kakoli to the Chief Adviser's Office, Sat Rasta intersection to Mohakhali junction, Gulshan Avenue, Green Road, Panthapath and their link roads remained congested into the late afternoon. bdnews24.c
