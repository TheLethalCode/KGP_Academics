 Dhaka, Sept 14 (bdnew24.com)  The chief election commissioner has said they are expecting to sit with BNP for the electoral dialogue this week and will make a decision about Upazila elections after talks with the party. "Talks with BNP may be held any time. We are waiting for BNP to contact us," ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters after a discussion at the EC secretariat, participated by Sushasoner Jonno Nagorik (Shujon), eminent personalities and mass media representatives. Replying to a question during Sunday's EC discussion, he said, "We are putting the highest emphasis on the Jatiya Sangsad elections. But Upazila elections will also be held." Asked which would be held first, he averted a direct reply. "We're very conscious about the matter. We'll do something which will be acceptable to all." The CEC and election commissioners sat with the chief adviser on Saturday and Sunday. "We talked with the chief adviser about the third round of dialogue with the political parties and [possible talks ] with BNP," said commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain. "As the chief adviser is going to China on Monday he has been apprised of the summary of the dialogue. On the basis of the discussion with him we hope that we can sit with BNP for the talks this week." BNP skipped a scheduled dialogue with the EC on Sept 7 on the grounds that party chief Khaleda Zia was still behind bars. The EC again then again invited the major political party but the CEC said they were yet to get a response. Khaleda, standing trial on a raft of graft charges, was released from prison on bail on Thursday after a year's detention. The former prime minister agreed to consider taking part in the ongoing dialogue with the government by Sunday and meeting her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina, said one of the four advisers who met her Friday night. Asked about his reaction about press reports that political parties who would not register with the EC can take part in the election, Huda said, "Political parties must register if they are to take part in the national elections." Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, who was present at the meeting, said, "The answer to all questions will be available after two to four days. Wait for that." Professor Khan Sarwar Murshid, professor Dilara Chowdhury of Jahangirnagar University, former adviser Hafizuddin Khan, Transparency International, Bangladesh executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman, Democracywatch executive director Taleya Rehman, columnist Syed Abul Moqsud, chief of Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Association advocate Salma Ali, professor Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah of election monitoring group JNIPOP, Bhorer Kagoj editor Shyamol Dutta and journalist Munni Saha participated in the discussion. Election Commissioner Sohul Hossain, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir, among others, were present. bdnew
