 ROME, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A. Portugal winger Ricardo Quaresma will make his Serie A debut for new club Inter Milan in Saturday's home game against Catania (1830 GMT), coach Jose Mourinho told a news conference on Friday. Mourinho said injuries to Dejan Stankovic and Luis Jimenez had not left him shorthanded in midfield because Esteban Cambiasso and Javier Zanetti can be used despite their late return from duty with the Argentine national team. "I've spoken to the players returning from South America on the telephone and they said they want to play," he said. France captain Patrick Vieira is aiming to return from a thigh problem and defender Ivan Cordoba should come back from a seven-month absence after knee surgery. AS Roma captain Francesco Totti will miss Saturday's visit to Palermo (1600 GMT) after suffering pain in the knee he had an operation on in April. Coach Luciano Spalletti is also without Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta (Achilles), Brazil defender Juan (thigh muscle) and France centre back Philippe Mexes (knee), while goalkeeper Doni remains a doubt even though he is included in the squad. Spalletti told a news conference that forward Julio Baptista should be available despite the effects of his journey back from Brazil's World Cup qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile. Mali midfielder Momo Sissoko is available for Juventus's home game against Udinese on Sunday (1830 GMT) after serving a suspension in the Turin side's 1-1 draw at Fiorentina two weeks ago. Coach Claudio Ranieri should be able to call on fit-again striker David Trezeguet as well as midfielders Marco Marchionni and Cristiano Zanetti. Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini is recovering faster than expected from a twisted knee and is tipped to get a place on the bench. The thigh strain which striker Filippo Inzaghi suffered in a midweek friendly in Switzerland may give Andriy Shevchenko his first competitive start since returning to AC Milan when they face Genoa away on Sunday (1300 GMT). Milan are also without defender Alessandro Nesta, who has a back problem, and midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, who injured his wrist training with Italy last weekend. But Brazil playmaker Kaka said his knee is better and he expects to play, while new signing Philippe Senderos is aiming for a place in defence after a back problem sidelined him for the opening day defeat by Bologna. Genoa striker Diego Milito will be unable to play if the documentation for his transfer from Spanish second division side Real Zaragoza does not arrive in time
