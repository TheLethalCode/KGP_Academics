 BREMEN, Germany, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta made a great start to life in the Champions League when they held wasteful Werder Bremen to a 0-0 draw in their Group B opener on Tuesday. Anorthosis, the first team from Cyprus to qualify for the Champions League, hardly created a chance in their group phase debut but clinched a point thanks to Werder's woeful finishing. Claudio Pizarro missed a series of chances in the first half and substitute Boubacar Sanogo shot wide from close range when he seemed certain to score late in the game. Brazilian midfielder Diego kept trying to conjure something up but Werder's evening was summed up when Hugo Almeida raced through late on only to blast a shot high and wide. "We kept looking for a goal until the final minute but we didn't put enough pressure on to force them into mistakes," Werder defender Per Mertesacker told Premiere TV. TOO EAGER Werder made a furious start and it was probably their eagerness that let them down. Every attack came at lightning speed, with the forwards sent hurtling into the box to try and control the ball when more careful build-up would have brought clearer openings. Pizarro headed straight at the keeper from point-blank range early in the game and several times failed to find the target from inside the box. Boubacar Sanogo came on in the second half and the Ivory Coast striker almost made the breakthrough when he smacked a shot over the bar from the edge of the box. Almeida then replaced Pizarro and wasted the best chance of all before Sanogo came desperately close to giving Werder a late winner when he headed over the bar deep in added time. Anorthosis, known as the 'Big Lady' of Cypriot football, had a couple of shots on target in the second half but Tim Wiese's goal was never in real danger. Werder's next game is away to Inter Milan, who top the group after winning 2-0 at Panathinaikos
