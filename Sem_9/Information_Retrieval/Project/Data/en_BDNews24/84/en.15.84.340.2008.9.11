 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman arrived at Zia International Airport around 7.30pm to fly for London on Thursday night, his lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com. The elder son and political heir apparent of former prime minister Khaleda Zia left Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University by ambulance shortly before 7pm, hours after meeting his freed mother. Khaleda was freed from prison Thursday morning after securing bail in four graft cases. "Tarique is flying to London on a Singapore Airlines flight to seek medical treatment. He also has a German visa. He might be taken to Germany if necessary," Khan said. Tarique's wife Zobaida Rahman, daughter Zaima Rahman, doctor Kazi Mazharul Islam Dolon and two other relatives are accompanying him. He could not leave for the UK on Wednesday, as scheduled, because of "obstructions" created by the government, his lawyer alleged. BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah told reporters earlier that Khaleda wished to see her ailing son before he left the country. Tarique, who was arrested on March 8, last year, was released from BSMMU hospital prison cell on Sept 3, after securing bail in 12 cases. But he remained in the hospital on release. His mother and younger brother Arafat Rahman Coco were arrested on Sept 3 last year in GATCo graft case. Coco is now in Thailand for better medical treatment on bail. bdnews
