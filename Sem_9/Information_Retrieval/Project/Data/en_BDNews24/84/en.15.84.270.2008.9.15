<TITLE> Maritime talks try for 'start point' on day one </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and India attempted to settle on a starting point for demarcation of sea borders in the Bay of Bengal, on day one of a three-day maritime conference. Maritime boundary talks resumed Monday after a hiatus of nearly three decades. Rear admiral BR Rao, who led the Indian delegation, told bdnews24.com: "We had a very good discussion." But the two countries failed at the outset to settle how the mid-point should be measured of the Hariabhanga River, which would be the starting point for border demarcation. "We have proposed that the middle point should be determined from the western side of the Hariabhanga," additional secretary MAK Mahmood, who headed the Bangladesh side at the three-day talks, told reporters. "But India wants to measure it from the eastern side," he said after the conclusion of the first day's talks. Mahmood said Bangladesh made its proposal as the main navigation channel of the river was on the western side. "Hopefully, India will accept the logic of our request," said Mahmood. Both Bangladesh and India must demarcate the sea borders to fully exploit marine resources of the Bay. According to UN treaties, Bangladesh will have to demarcate its maritime boundary by July 2011 while India needs to draw hers by May 2009. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have yet to fully explore oil-gas options in the Bay as the three countries have long-standing disputes over their sea boundaries. The three-day technical committee talks are meant to prepare the ground for final border agreements between Dhaka and Delhi. According to UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on Laws of Sea) 1982, Bangladesh's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) should extend for 200 nautical miles, with a further 150 nautical miles of extended continental shelf falling within its maritime boundary. bdn
