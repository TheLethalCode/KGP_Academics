 New Delhi, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The Sensex seen rising on Friday after inflation eased for a third straight week, with sentiment also boosted by mostly firmer Asian markets on reports Lehman Brothers is shopping itself to possible suitors. Oil prices fell towards $100 on Thursday, and though they have since risen back above $101, they remain well below July's record high above $147, easing some worries about inflation. "I think markets should remain good today," said Sandeep Shenoy, strategist at PINC Research. "One factor is cooling off in inflation and also international markets are positive." Annual inflation eased to 12.10 percent at Aug. 30, a third successive fall since hitting 12.63 percent on Aug. 9, and a top policy adviser said it may have peaked. Industrial output data due at noon (0630 GMT) is forecast to show a rise of 6.5 percent in July from a year earlier, higher than in recent months but still consistent with a slowing economy as high inflation and interest rates bite, a Reuters poll showed. India's 30-share main BSE index fell 2.31 percent, to 14,324.29, its lowest close since Aug. 28, on Thursday. Continuous foreign fund selling has been a worry for the market. Data showed they were net sellers of $216 million shares on Wednesday and have sold $7.6 billion so far in 2008. Asian stocks rose on Friday, with shares outside of Japan rebounding from a 23-month low as investors took comfort from reports that Lehman had put itself up for sale, suggesting a smaller risk of a Wall Street meltdown spreading to the region. At 0335 GMT, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.5 percent, while MSCI's measure of other Asian stocks gained 0.8 percent.
