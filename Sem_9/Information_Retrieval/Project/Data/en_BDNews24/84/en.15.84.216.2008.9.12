 Rajshahi, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  Authorities closed Rajshahi Medical College on Friday for one month following overnight clashes between Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists. At least 15 students were injured in the clash between the student wings of the Awami League and BNP respectively, police said. Dr Fazlur Rahman, principal of the college, told reporters they closed the college and emptied the halls to avoid further violence. The college will be open on Oct 11. Rajpara police chief Anisur Rahman said the clash erupted over the occupation of a seat in Shaheed Shah Mainul Ahsan Pingku Hall on Thursday night. Leaders of both the BCL and JCD tried to occupy the seat of room No 205, triggering a scuffle. At about 11.30pm, JCD workers vandalised the room. The BCL retaliated, sparking a fight. Police rushed to the scene at 12.30am and brought the situation under control. Authorities had earlier closed Bogra Ziaur Rahman Medical College and Barisal Sher-e-Bangla Medical College after clashes among student groups. bdnews
