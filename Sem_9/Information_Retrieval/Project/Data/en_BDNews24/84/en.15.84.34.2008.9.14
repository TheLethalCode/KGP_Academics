 Kabul,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber rammed a car into a United Nations convoy on Sunday as it drove through a market in southern Afghanistan, killing two local doctors, officials said. The attack, part of rising violence this year by the al Qaeda-backed Taliban in Afghanistan, occurred on a road in the town of Spin Boldak, on the border with Pakistan. "We have two UN staff killed, 16 people, 11 of them civilians, wounded, along with five police," Abdul Razzaq, a senior border police commander, told Reuters. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on their Web site. A UN spokesman confirmed there had been an incident in Spin Boldak involving at least one UN vehicle, but could give no word on causalities. The resurgent Taliban rely largely on suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts in their insurgency against President Hamid Karzai's government and the foreign troops backing it. Nearly 3,000 people have died violently in Afghanistan this year, the bloodiest period since the Taliban's overthrow. Late on Saturday, the militants killed seven police, including a district police chief, in Ghazni province to the southwest of Kabul. A roadside bomb killed a provincial governor the same day near Kabul. The rising violence this year comes despite an increase in the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan to 71,000, prompting some Western politicians to warn of a slide back into anarchy. The militants have expanded the depth and scope of their insurgency and enjoy safe havens in fiercely independent tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan. The US military conceded this month that it was not winning the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, adding that it would revise its strategy to hit militant bases inside Pakistan
