 Nairobi,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The African Union (AU) has hailed Zimbabwe's power-sharing deal as a "turning point" for the nation and urged the world to give it full support. A statement issued late on Friday by AU Commission chairman Jean Ping welcomed this week's accord between President Robert Mugabe and the Zimbabwean opposition. "The chairperson commends the Zimbabwean parties for arriving at this agreement which marks a turning point in the efforts aimed at promoting reconciliation, stability and fostering conditions conducive for the recovery of their country," it said. The AU praised South African President Thabo Mbeki's "skilful diplomacy and tireless efforts" as a mediator. "The chairperson urges the international community as a whole to do its utmost to support the implementation of this agreement and provide the requisite assistance to that end," the statement added. Giving first details of the deal reached on Thursday, an opposition senator said on Friday that Mugabe would keep his job and head the cabinet. Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the main opposition MDC group, would be prime minister and chair a council of ministers supervising cabinet, the senator said. Zimbabweans are desperate for an end to a political crisis that has destroyed the economy, hitting the once-prosperous country with the world's highest rate of hyper-inflation and sending millions of refugees into neighbouring countries
