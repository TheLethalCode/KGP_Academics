<TITLE> Thai ruling party wants Samak as PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bangkok, Sep 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's ruling People Power Party (PPP) on Thursday threw its weight behind leader Samak Sundaravej to return as prime minister, but it was not clear if he would accept the offer. Protesters occupying Thailand's seat of government said they would not accept anyone from the PPP as prime minister, least of all Samak, who had to step down on Tuesday after a court found him guilty of a conflict of interest. "The party voted today to have Samak as prime minister again. We sent our four representatives to inform him," Kudeb Saikrachang, a PPP spokesman, told Reuters. "If he doesn't want it, we'll find another choice." Other parties in the PPP-led coalition government have pushed for someone else who might be more able to reduce political tensions with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) occupying Government House for a third week. The Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that Samak, accused by the PAD of being a puppet for ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, broke the law in hosting cooking shows on commercial television while in office. "The main principle is that Samak, who violated the constitution many times, should not become PM again," Somsak Kosaisook, a PAD leader, told reporters at Government House, where PAD protesters have been barricaded in for more than two weeks. "No one in the PPP should become prime minister or a minister in the government," he added, suggesting the PAD action that has paralyzed government and raised fears about economic growth would continue. The court's ruling against 73-year-old Samak removed him from office but did not ban him from returning. The PPP, which nearly has an outright majority in parliament with 233 out of 480 seats, has called a special session on Friday to vote for a new prime minister. The country is being run by a caretaker cabinet under Somchai Wongsawat, a brother-in-law of Thaksin who is now in exile in London, having skipped bail along with his wife to avoid corruption charges. ARMY WANTS EMERGENCY LIFTED Army commander Anupong Paochina urged Somchai to lift a state of emergency imposed last week by Samak after a man was killed in street battles between pro- and anti-government groups. Anupong, who pointedly refused Samak's request for the army to use force to evict the PAD from Government House, argued that the emergency rule, which appears to be largely symbolic, was damaging the country's image and economy. The situation has become much calmer, although underlying political tensions remain. The protracted crisis is affecting confidence in the economy and Finance Minister Surapong Suebwonglee said on Wednesday the government's growth target would be missed as a result. It had forecast growth of between 5 and 6 percent this year. Thailand's main stock index has fallen around 25 percent since the street campaign began in late May.
