<TITLE> CWAB won't support 'rebel' cricketers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Six national cricketers, supposed to join the breakaway Indian Cricket League, are also not getting support from their union, the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB). "The reasons they gave in their retirement letters are totally childish and a lack a professional approach," former captain Aminul Islam told a press conference, organised by the CWAB at Panshi restaurant in Dhanmondi on Tuesday. "We hope they will be on the right track after realising the mistakes they have made," said Islam. Former national captain Habibul Bashar, opener Shahriar Nafees, middle-order Aftab Ahmed, all-rounder Farhad Reza, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel on Sunday applied for retirement from international as well as domestic cricket, intending to play in the ICL. Selector, former captain, and CAWB president Naimur Rahman Durjoy and CAWB general secretary Debobroto Pal were also present on the occasion. "One said that that the national coach had misbehaved with him. Nearly all of us here can say that we were also victims of misbehavior at different times by foreign coaches, but it did not make us give up the national side," said Islam indicating Habibul Bashar. Pointing out reasons for Shahriar Nafees' retirement, Islam said, "One said that he was not assured a place on the national side, but we have seen him on the national team in a few series." "We believe that no one can take a cricketer's place as granted on the national side as he has to ensure his place through performance." Asked whether the CWAB's stand against the cricketers was logical as the Federation for International Cricketers' Association was always in favour of cricketers' freedom, Naimur Rahman said, "We see the matter in the context of Bangladesh as we have a lack of resources as well as standard cricketers, and the country will suffer much if such things occur." "They should have discussed the matter with the CWAB that would take the proposal to the board," said Rahman. In a reply, Aminul said, "Comparing our situation with that of India would not be wise. We should consider the Bangladesh standards according to which the cricketers get enough money and honor."
