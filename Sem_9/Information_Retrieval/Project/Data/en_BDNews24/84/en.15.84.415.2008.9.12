 Dhaka, Sept 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee members M Saifur Rahman and Mahbubur Rahman and BNP leader Ehsanul Haque Milon met with chairperson Khaleda Zia Friday afternoon. The two leaders, known as 'reformists', went to Khaleda's Shaheed Moinul Road home at 4pm. Former state minister for education Ehsanul Haque Milon and his wife Nazmunnahar Baby went there in the evening. A BNP leader close to Khaleda told bdnews24.com, "Saifur Rahman and former army chief Mahbubur Rahman held a meeting with Khaleda for about one hour." The two leaders had earlier spoken to her and fixed time for the meeting, an assistant at the former prime minister's residence told bdnews24.com. Former finance minister Saifur and Mahbub had been supporting the reform proposals floated by former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan before and after Khaleda's arrest on Sept 3 last year. A meeting of the policymaking standing committee, held at the house of Saifur on October 29 night, nominated Saifur as acting chairman, sidelining Khaleda-nominated secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain, and Hafizuddin Ahmed as acting secretary general. However, before going abroad for treatment on May 7 Saifur told journalists, "As some standing committee members who were present on October 29 night meeting have given affidavit in the court, my acting chairmanship has lost validity." On her release on bail after a year detention on Thursday, the BNP chief said, "There is no division in BNP. I will work taking all with me." Milon and his wife went to Khaleda's house at about 7:15pm. Coming out of the house after 8pm, Milon told bdnews24.com, "We have exchanged greetings with the madam. She has expressed indignation at the incident on September 3." On Sept 3 Milon, Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal chief and former state minister Barkatullah Bulu and a former member from women's reserved seat, who are known as "pro-reform", were assaulted by BNP supporters when they had gone to visit Tarique Rahman at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital. Khaleda's lawyer advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas Friday said the former prime minister offered prayers and supplications on Friday. Her two sisters-in law (brothers' wives) and their children, other relatives met with Khaleda. bdne
