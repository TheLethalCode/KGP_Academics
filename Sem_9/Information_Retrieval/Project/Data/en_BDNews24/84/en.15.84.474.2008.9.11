 UDINE, Italy, September 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Daniele De Rossi scored twice as holders Italy beat Georgia 2-0 in their second World Cup qualifier on Wednesday to go top of Group Eight. The midfielder opened the scoring in the 16th minute with a blistering left-footed strike and sealed victory in the 89th with a diagonal shot after being picked out by Alessandro Del Piero in the box. World champions Italy have six points from two games after Saturday's 2-1 win in Cyprus, two more than Ireland, who drew 0-0 with Montenegro earlier on Wednesday. Azzurri coach Marcello Lippi said he was satisfied even though his side had not shown much spark on Wednesday or in Cyprus at the weekend, when they were lucky to return from Larnaca with a win. "We had our headlights off but we have six points," Lippi told Rai television after the match. Italy had made a confident start, stringing together some crisp passes. Luca Toni had a shout for a penalty turned down for a tug by Georgia captain Kakha Kaladze in the eight minute and forward Antonio Di Natale came close with a deflected shot after a threaded pass from Toni shortly before De Rossi's piledriver. The hosts eased up after going ahead and Georgia midfielder Levan Kenia squandered a great chance to equalize in the 26th minute, when he failed with two short-range attempts with the goal begging at the end of rapid counter-attack. SAT COMFORTABLY But otherwise the Azzurri sat comfortably on their lead until halftime. Georgia made a couple of fast breaks after the re-start before the second half slipped back into the uneventful rhythm of the first. Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon rushed off his line well to hoof the ball away from Georgia's Levan Kobiashvili's feet in a dangerous position and saved a powerful late strike by Kenia before De Rossi's second gave the home side a flattering 2-0 victory. Lippi said his side were hit by the loss of injured defenders Alessandro Gamberini and Fabio Grosso and midfielder Gennaro Gattuso and the fact that many are not fully match fit after just one weekend of Serie A action. "We've had a lot of injuries and we've got two important results. "Slowly we'll get there. (Next time) the players will have five or six games in their legs. We'll be back in a month in better shape." Italy travel to Bulgaria and host Montenegro in qualifiers next month. Defeat left Georgia bottom of the group with no points after losing 2-1 to the Irish at the weeken
