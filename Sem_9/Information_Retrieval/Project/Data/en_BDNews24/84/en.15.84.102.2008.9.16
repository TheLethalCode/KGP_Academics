 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Top leaders of the four party alliance have urged the government and the Election Commission to hold dialogue not only with BNP, but also with the component parties of the alliance to hold a meaningful and proper election. BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain spoke to reporters after a meeting of the top four party leaders, with BNP chief Khaleda Zia in the chair. Delwar said the alliance would demand lifting of the emergency and national elections ahead of all others in talks with the government and the EC. The two-hour meeting of the alliance's top brass ended around 5.30pm. Khandker Delwar told journalists: "The meeting recommended inviting the components of the alliance to the dialogue. We did not think it proper to leave the alliance partners out of the dialogue." Delwar elaborated: "BNP opted out of the Election Commission dialogue recently. Alongside Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote also did not attend. It is not proper to invite only us."
