 Moscow,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Russian Boeing-737 airliner with at least 87 people on board crashed in the Siberia region on Sunday and there were no survivors, news agencies quoted officials as saying. The plane was operated by the Aeroflot airline and was flying from Moscow to the Siberian city of Perm when it crashed in an unpopulated area as it was landing, said the agencies. Some reports put the number of passengers and crew at 87 while others said there were 88 people on board. "According to preliminary information, all of them died," the RIA news agency quoted Vladimir Markin, a spokesman for the Prosecutor-General's Office, as saying. Prosecutors are routinely involved in investigating plane crashes in Russia and there was no suggestion the aircraft had been deliberately brought down. Local media said firefighters had extinguished a blaze at the crash site. "We have found the aircraft. It came down within the city limits (in Perm) in a patch of waste ground. Initial reports are of no casualties on the ground," Interfax news agency quoted Emergencies Ministry spokeswoman Irina Andrianova as saying. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev was briefed about the crash by Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu, agencies quoted the Kremlin press service as saying
