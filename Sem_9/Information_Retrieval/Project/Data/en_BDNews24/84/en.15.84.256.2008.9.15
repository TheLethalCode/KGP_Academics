 Dhaka, Sept 15 (bdnews24.com)  Repeated military rule has played havoc with people's fate in Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina has said and called for elections right away to replace the incumbent administration. "Election is the only way to overcome the present deadlock in the country," the Awami League chief on Sunday told a gathering of the Bangladeshi community in NewYork, USA. Speaking at an iftar gathering, she said: "People have also lost faith in the present government like they did in the four-party alliance government." "National elections must be held ahead of the Upazila polls," she said and referred to consensus among all political parties on the issue. "Military rule has always centralised power in our country. A strong four-tier local government system can only decentralise power," she said. "My crime was that I told the truth ... I'll keep telling the truth," Hasina said, dismissing charges of corruption brought against her. Referring to her time as prime minister and the Vision 2020 programme, the AL chief said her party, if given the opportunity again, would see to it that the golden jubilee of Bangladesh's birth was celebrated in a befitting style in 2021. Her son Sajib Wajed Joy was among those who also spoke. bdnews24
