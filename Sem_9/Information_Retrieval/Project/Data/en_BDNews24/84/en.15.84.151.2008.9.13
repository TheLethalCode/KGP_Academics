 Kabul,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Afghan provincial governor, who was also a former cabinet minister, was among four people killed in an apparent Taliban suicide bomb attack near Kabul on Saturday, Afghan police said. Logar province governor Abdullah Wardak, who fought alongside US troops during the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001, died on a dirt road outside his home in Paghman, 20 km (12 miles) west of the capital. Police gave varying accounts of the attack. Senior Kabul police officer Ali Shah Paktiawal said Wardak was killed when a remote-controlled device was detonated next to his car. However, Logar police chief Ghulam Mustafa Mohseni said Wardak had been killed in a suicide attack. "The governor was leaving his house for the office," Mohseni told Reuters by telephone from Logar. "The suicide bomber was waiting near his residence. As the governor came out with his driver, he was targeted and killed." Mohseni had no further details. Paktiawal told Reuters that Wardak's driver and two of his body guards were also killed in the blast, which he said was the work of "Afghanistan's enemies", a term often used by officials to describe the Taliban and other militants. Wardak served as a commander for one of the armed factions that helped US-led troops overthrow the hardline Islamist Taliban government in late 2001. He was later a minister in President Hamid Karzai's government before he became governor for Logar, where the Taliban and other militants are active. He is the second provincial governor to be assassinated by suicide bombers in recent years. Attacks against politicians, police and civil servants are fairly common in Afghanistan. The resurgent Taliban rely largely on suicide attacks and roadside bomb blasts in their insurgency against the Karzai government and the foreign troops backing it. Nearly 3,000 people have died violently in Afghanistan this year, the bloodiest period since the Taliban's overthrow. Late on Friday, militants beheaded three men after accusing them of spying for the government in Ghazni province, southwest of Kabul, an official said. Also on Friday, a NATO soldier was killed by insurgents in an attack in southern Helmand province, the NATO-led alliance said. No other details were available. The Taliban have yet to comment on the latest incidents. US-led troops ousted the Taliban after it refused to hand over al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, architect of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The rising violence comes despite an increase in the number of foreign troops in Afghanistan to 71,000, prompting some Western politicians to warn that the country may be sliding back into anarchy. The militants have this year expanded the depth and scope of their insurgency and enjoy safe havens in fiercely independent tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan. The US military this week conceded it was not winning the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan, adding it would revise its strategy to hit militant bases inside Pakistan
