 Houston,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Ike crashed onto the Texas coast on Saturday, threatening to devastate towns along the Gulf of Mexico, shutting essential oil refineries and menacing Houston, the fourth-largest US city. The enormous hurricane, roughly the size of Texas itself, may be the worst storm to hit the state in nearly 50 years. Ike came ashore at the barrier island city of Galveston as a Category 2 storm at about 2:10 a.m. CDT (0710 GMT) with 175 kph winds, just 1 mile per hour shy of reaching Category 3 strength on the five-step intensity scale, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm drove a wall of water 6 metres high and sent huge waves crashing against a 5-metre sea wall built to protect the city after a hurricane in 1900 killed at least 8,000 people. The storm shut down 17 oil refineries, totaling more than a fifth of US production, endangered a freighter at sea, and destroyed a pier in Galveston. The National Weather Service warned that people in coastal areas could "face the possibility of death" and officials said the vast storm could flood as many as 100,000 homes and send a huge wave across 160 km of US coastline. "Our nation is facing what is by any means a potentially catastrophic hurricane," said US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, warning that the storm surge, which may rise to 6 metres, could present the gravest danger. More than a million Texans heeded evacuation orders and headed inland, but officials said they were worried that many people had stayed in their homes. A 19-year old Corpus Christi man was missing and presumed drowned after rough seas from Ike swept him from a jetty, local media said. Ike could be the third-most destructive storm in US history behind Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992, experts said. The costliest storm in US history, Katrina, devastated New Orleans and other parts of the Gulf Coast, killing 1,500 people and causing at least $81 billion in damage
