<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government is looking for a strategic partner to run and manage flag carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines Ltd., special assistant for civil aviation said Tuesday. "We have taken steps to run Biman by a foreign airline through a partnership," Mahbub Jamil told bdnews24.com. "And that airline can opt for a stake in Biman or just take responsibility for management." Jamil's comments came after Biman named a new managing director and CEO. A former Air Force officer, retired air commodore Zahed Kuddus, was chosen by the Biman's Board of Directors in a meeting chaired by Jamil on Tuesday. "Retired air commodore Zahed Kuddus has been appointed for two years and will take over on Wednesday," Jamil told bdnews24.com after the meeting. Jamil, however, said a new CEO was likely to be appointed if an airline took over the management. "Air Commodore Kuddus showed his ability as a manager in the past. We hope Biman will run well under his leadership," the special assistant said. Kuddus had served as the chairman of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) from 2002 to 2005. Jamil said a chief executive may be hired from abroad once Biman goes into international partnership. Kuddus's predecessor Mohammad Abdul Momen, a serving member of the BCS, was transferred as joint secretary at the agriculture ministry on Sept 8. On plans to find a management partner, Jamil referred to the Thai Airlines, which he said had been haemorrhaging heavily before being handed to a strategic partner. "They have done very well since then." bdne
