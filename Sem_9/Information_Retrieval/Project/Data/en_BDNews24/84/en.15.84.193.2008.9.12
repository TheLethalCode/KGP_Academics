<TITLE> Pope Benedict arrives on four-day France visit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Paris, Sep 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict began on Friday a four-day visit to France aimed at persuading the French that religion can contribute to modern secular societies. President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has also said he sees a positive role for faith in public life, broke with protocol and greeted the German-born pontiff as he descended from his plane at Orly airport south of the French capital. At his side was his third wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, a glamorous Italian-born singer and former supermodel. The two men were due to go directly to the president's Elysee Palace in central Paris and deliver short speeches the French will follow closely to see how far they advocate a role for religion in the public sphere. France maintains a strict separation of church and state and even mentioning one's faith used to be taboo for politicians. But religion has returned to public life in recent years and Sarkozy has taken the lead in welcoming it. On the flight from Rome, Benedict told journalists that "laicite" -- France's version of secularism -- was not incompatible with religion. "For Christians, it has always been clear that faithful religion is not political ... and politics is not a religion but a deep reality with a spiritual mission," he said in French. "The two should be open to each other." This is Benedict's first trip as pope to France, a country he knows well and whose language he speaks fluently. The pope was also due later on Friday -- two years to the day since his controversial Regensburg speech that angered Muslims -- to deliver a major address on faith and culture to an elite audience of 700 French intellectuals and artists. He will celebrate an open-air Mass in central Paris on Saturday morning before flying to the popular Catholic pilgrimage site of Lourdes in southwest France to mark the 150th anniversary of the apparitions of the Virgin Mary there
