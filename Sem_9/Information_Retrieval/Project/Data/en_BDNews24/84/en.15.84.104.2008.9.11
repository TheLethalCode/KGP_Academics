 Dhaka, Sept 11 (bdnews24.com)  Farhad Hossain struck a half-century, as the GP-BCB Academy team made a solid 441 all out against the Sri Lankan Development Squad, on the second rain-interrupted day of the first four-dayer in Dambulla Thursday. Farhad converted his overnight 15 to 54, knocking 120 balls, while tail-ender Mahbubul Alam Robin remained unbeaten on 26, as the visitors resuming on 339 for five crossed the 400-run mark, at Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket Stadium. Overnight batsman Suhrawardi Shuvo added just 14 runs to his overnight score of 15, to finish on 29, after Shamsur Rahman and Marshall Ayub hammered 125 and 78 respectively on the opening day. Prassana claimed six wickets for 127. The match was later called off due to rain just four balls into the hosts' first innings. bd
