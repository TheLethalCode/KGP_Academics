<TITLE> Hurricane Ike could be 'potential catastrophe' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Galveston, Texas,Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Massive Hurricane Ike bore down on the Texas coast on Friday with a wall of water that threatened a potential catastrophe for the United States. Waters rose rapidly as Ike moved within hours of striking low-lying areas near Houston with a possible 6-metre storm surge in what may be the worst storm to hit Texas in nearly 50 years. "Our nation is facing what is by any means a potentially catastrophic hurricane," said US Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, warning that Ike's storm surge could present the gravest danger. "This certainly falls in the category of pretty much a worst case scenario." The National Weather Service warned that people in coastal areas could "face the possibility of death" from a massive storm surge. Officials said Ike could flood as many as 100,000 homes. Crude oil markets nervously watched to see how the hurricane would affect low-lying coastal refineries in Ike's path that collectively process 20 percent of US fuel supplies. Although Ike is weaker than 2005's Hurricane Katrina, the last storm to pummel a US urban area and a major disaster, its large scope gives it more water-moving power. Ike was a Category 2 storm with 165 kph winds as it moved on a course to pass directly over Houston -- the fourth-largest city in the United States. Ike was expected to come ashore overnight, possibly as a dangerous Category 3 storm on the five-step intensity scale with winds of more than 178 kph, the National Hurricane Center said. At 5 p.m. EDT (2100 GMT) on Friday, Ike was about 220 km southeast of Galveston, the hurricane center said. It was moving west-northwest at 19 kph. WATER LEVELS ALREADY CLIMBING In Galveston, water levels had already climbed more than 2.7 metres, forecasters said. About 13 million people in 132 counties along the Gulf coast could face hurricane and tropical storm conditions, the US National Census Bureau said. Millions of coastal residents could be left without power, authorities said. US crude oil futures rose 31 cents to settle at $101.18 a barrel after dropping below $100 for the first time since early April as concerns over US economic weakness outweighed storm disruption fears. Low-lying, flood prone refineries in the region lie in Ike's path and weather forecasters at Planalytics saw "major and long-term damage likely at the major refining cities." Ports were closed and the Coast Guard said a 178-metre freighter with 22 people aboard was stranded without power 145 km southeast of Galveston. Conditions were too treacherous to attempt rescue. The storm's wide reach means that it will pack an unusually strong punch, taking the form of a huge wave of water it is pushing ahead of it. "This is a Category 5 hurricane," said Jeff Masters, co-founder of meteorological Web site The Weather Underground. "I don't care what the Category 2 rating says," he said. Category 5 storms are the most dangerous. Ike's storm surge could push as far inland as NASA's Johnson Space Center south of Houston, Masters said. LAST-MINUTE DASH About 600,000 Texas residents fled the island city of Galveston and low-lying counties under mandatory evacuation orders and authorities urged holdouts to move before Ike's winds started to make car travel dangerous. The Coast Guard had to rescue 65 people from rising waters on the the Bolivar Peninsula, located east of Galveston. Some who had thought they would stick it out instead made a last-minute exit from Galveston. The city was hit by a hurricane in 1900 that was the deadliest weather disaster in US history, with a death toll of at least 8,000. "The water got to coming over the sea wall, we were scared," said Charlotte Pines, who was fueling up an SUV filled with relatives. "It's going to be bad." Katrina swiped New Orleans and other parts of the US Gulf Coast in August 2005, killing 1,500 people. That storm was the costliest in US history, causing at least $81 billion in damage. Katrina also damaged President George W Bush's standing. He and his administration were strongly criticized for the slow federal response to the disaster
