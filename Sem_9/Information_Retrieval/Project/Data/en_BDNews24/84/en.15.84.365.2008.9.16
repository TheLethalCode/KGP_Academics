 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Tuesday refused to accept the retirement letters submitted by six National Cricketers as they did not turn out to meet the board authorities. The board also called an emergency meeting Wednesday to decide subsequent actions on the issue. Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, the Cricket Operations Manager of the board told a press conference that the letters were refused, as they were submitted 'one-sidedly, and breaching the terms and conditions of their contract'. The former national skipper said, "We waited for more than two hours for them, but they did not turn up." He added, "They submitted the letters one-sidedly and breaching the terms and conditons of their contract. They did not even say when the retirement would be effective. Moreover, they claimed to retire on personal grounds, but as no personal ground can be more important than the national cause, we did not accept the letters." Habibul Bashar, Aftab Ahmed, Shahriar Nafees, Forhad Reza and Musharraf Hossain, who all are contracted with the BCB, submitted letters to the board Sunday mentioning they want to retire. In response BCB asked them to report to the board Tuesday and explain the cause of their retirement. bdne
