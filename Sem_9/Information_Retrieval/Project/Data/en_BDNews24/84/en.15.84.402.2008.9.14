<TITLE> Hurricane Ike rakes Texas coast, Houston </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Houston,Sep 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hurricane Ike powered across the densely populated Texas coast and through Houston on Saturday, bringing ferocious winds and a wall of water that flooded hundreds of miles of coastline and paralyzed the fourth-largest US city. Ike, a massive hurricane that has idled more than a fifth of US oil production, came ashore at the barrier island city of Galveston as a strong Category 2 storm at 2:10 a.m. CDT (0710 GMT) with heavy rains and sustained 110 mph (175 kph) winds, the National Hurricane Center said. The raging storm flooded Galveston and submerged a 17-foot (5-metre) sea wall built to protect the city after a 1900 hurricane killed at least 8,000 people. More than half its 60,000 residents fled, but the fate of those who stayed to ride out the storm remained unclear. Oil refineries along the western shore of Galveston Bay as well as NASA's Johnson Space Center may have been spared the worst of the flooding. But the storm's huge size meant that it flooded parts of Louisiana, prompting a flurry of overnight rescues far from its center, authorities said. The storm could trigger $8 billion to $18 billion in insurance claims, according to an early insurance industry computer-modeled estimate of damage. Grandmother Sherry Gill spent the night in League City, Texas, roughly halfway between Galveston and Houston, despite an evacuation order, huddling with her family and listening to the wind howling over her shuttered home. "It was a night of sheer terror. I thought the roof was going to lift off," Gill said. Emergency officials along the southeast Texas coast said they were "inundated" with calls from residents who tried to ride out the storm but now needed to be rescued. One family in Bridge City had to be plucked from their attic, where they huddled to escape rising waters, said Carman Apple, a spokeswoman for joint southeast Texas emergency operations. Galveston officials said there had been no confirmed reports of casualties. While Ike was formidable, it did not bring the 20-foot (6-metre) tidal surge they had feared. President George W Bush declared that a major disaster existed in Texas, and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area affected by the storm. DAMAGE IN HOUSTON Fifty miles (80 km) inland, Ike lashed downtown Houston's skyscrapers, blowing out windows and sending debris flying through water-logged streets. About 4.5 million people around Houston and Beaumont could be without electricity for weeks, Floyd LeBlanc of CenterPoint Energy said. Roofs were ripped off houses, and rising waters, downed trees and fallen power lines left many streets impassable. There were many windows broken in the 75-story Chase Tower, the tallest building in Houston. Ike was the biggest storm to hit a US city since Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. Houston is home to 2.2 million people and with a metropolitan area of 5.6 million residents. Tom Larsen, a senior vice-president with EQECAT Inc, which helps insurers model catastrophe risk, told Reuters that from data he had seen so far, the cost of damage was likely to fall in the middle of the projected $8 billion to $18 billion range forecast by industry computer models. Ike also hammered parts of Louisiana, the state battered by Katrina, flooding whole coastal communities and forcing rescue crews out to retrieve stranded residents. An estimated 10,000 homes in Terrebonne Parish were flooded or expected to be flooded as water levels continued to rise, officials there said. About 100 elderly residents were evacuated overnight when flooding overwhelmed a nursing home in Franklin, Louisiana. Ike was downgraded to a tropical storm on forecasters' storm intensity scale at 1 p.m. CDT (1900 GMT) as it moved inland with top sustained winds near 60 mph (95 kph) and moving north. Ike's center was expected to move through eastern Texas into Arkansas on Saturday night. Forecasters warned residents of a vast area -- Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana and Michigan -- stretching all the way to the border with Canada, to prepare for heavy rains as Ike stormed northeast. "We expected a major storm and our expectations unfortunately came true," said Mark Miner, a spokesman for Texas Gov. Rick Perry. "The weather needs to clear up a little bit to see just what the devastation was." In Galveston, emergency officials were sending patrols into the flooded streets to begin assessing damage. Twenty-two percent of US fuel production capacity was down, with 14 refineries having been shut as Ike approached. Twenty-eight natural gas processing plants were also shut. Brad Penisson, a spokesman for the joint operations of southeast Texas emergency management agencies said that area's refineries appeared to have sustained little or no damage. "This is a huge storm that is causing a lot of damage, not only in Texas, but also in parts of Louisiana," Bush, a former governor of Texas, said at the White House. He said the government would monitor gas prices to prevent extraordinary price increases because of Ike
