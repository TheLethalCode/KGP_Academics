 NEW DELHI, Sep 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three people were killed in bomb blasts in New Delhi on Saturday, local television CNN-IBN said. The explosions are not thought to have been very powerful but they happened in areas crowded with evening shoppers. The exact cause of the blasts is not known but bombs are suspected. Crude explosives have been detonated in several Indian cities recently. More than 400 people have died in separate attacks since October 2005, with the cities of Ahmedabad and Jaipur among those hit. India has blamed Islamist militant groups for these previous bombings. Two of the latest blasts in Delhi are believed to have happened in the central shopping district of Connaught Place. Another blast took place in a market in the Greater Kailash area in south Delhi.
