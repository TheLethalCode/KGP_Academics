<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 16 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Tuesday granted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her cousin cabinet colleague Fazlul Karim Selim bail for three months in an extortion case filed by a top businessman. The court also stayed the proceedings of the case until Oct.19. The vacation bench of judges Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman gave the order after hearing two separate bail appeals submitted by the two accused. Barrister Shafique Ahmed attended the hearing on behalf of Hasina and Selim. Additional attorney general Mansur Habib represented the state. Hasina sought bail in the case on Sept 14, as well as a halt to the case proceedings in a petition challenging the legality of the extortion case. The court on Aug 28 asked the government to explain why the proceedings of the Tk 3 crore extortion case against the former prime minister should not be declared illegal. Earlier on January 17, the High Court deferred the case proceedings after Hasina had petitioned the court, which was stayed by the Appellate Division on Jan 24 and the proceedings resumed in the trial court. Another High Court bench on August 28 in a rule asked the government about the legality of the case proceedings. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury filed the case, which he later publicly denied, against Hasina and Selim on June 13, 2007, accusing them of accepting a Tk 3 crore bribe from him. The charge sheet in the case was submitted on July 24, 2007 implicating Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana also. The metropolitan sessions judge's court framed charges against the accused on January 13. The vacation bench of justices Haider and Rahman had pushed back Hasina's bail hearing in the case by a day to Monday after additional attorney general Mansur Habib requested more time. bdnew
