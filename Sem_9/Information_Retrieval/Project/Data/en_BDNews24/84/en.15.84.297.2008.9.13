 Dhaka, Sept 13 (bdnews24.com)  Tarique Rahman's resignation as BNP senior joint secretary general has proved his guilt, Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said Saturday. "By resigning the post Tarique Rahman has proved that he was guilty of charges against him. His resignation is a step toward driving graft and terrorism out of politics," Amu told a views exchange meeting with Jubo League at the Gulshan home of acting AL president Zillur Rahman. Meanwhile, AL was pressing forward to realise its demands, including a schedule for national elections and the release of its party chief, said Amu. "The party president was released on conditions attached by the government. We yielded to those conditions as she required urgent medical treatment at the time," he said. Claiming that the party was moving forward towards a political victory, the senior party leader said: "BNP's purging drive proves that they were responsible for the 1/11 scenario." Fellow presidium member Abdur Razzak, terming Khaleda Zia "the number one thief", added: "She has whitened thousands of crores in recent years through her son's travels abroad." Razzak asked party leaders and activists to be prepared for "movements". Jubo League urged AL policy makers to announce tough moves for the unconditional release of party president Sheikh Hasina. Acting AL president Zillur Rahman expressed solidarity with its associated organization, declaring a weeklong programme to press home the demand. "We will go for tougher moves in future," Zillur said. On Khaleda agreeing to sit with her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina, Zillur said: "Let Sheikh Hasina be freed first. She will decide then what is required." "Sheikh Hasina will not talk anybody while still in detention," he said. bdnews
