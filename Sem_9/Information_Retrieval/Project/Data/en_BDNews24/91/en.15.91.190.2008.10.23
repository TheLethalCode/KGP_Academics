 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The two major parties look on their way to being registered, as an election officials said Thursday BNP's registration would soon be finalised and AL's registration process was complete. "There is no major obstacle in BNP getting registered" said EC joint secretary and chief of the commission's scrutiny committee Nurul Islam Khan, echoing a similar statement about AL by an election commissioner the previous day. Nurul Islam Khan said the registration process for BNP would quickly be finalised after the issue of associate organisations is settled. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, representing his party, met with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Thursday noon. The EC joint secretary said: "The BNP joint secretary general has been informed of a minor linguistic point." "The point arose as the linking word 'and' was used for BNP's associate student and labour organisations." The scrutiny committee chief said the BNP leader would meet again with the commission after discussing the matter with his party. "There are no more obstacles to the registration of the main political parties. The process of awarding registration certificate will start soon," said Nurul Islam Khan. BNP secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan also told reporters after his meeting with the CEC: "The commission is satisfied on the discussion that took place. I do not think there is any more hindrance in BNP's getting registered." "I don't believe any further amendment will be necessary in the BNP constitution regarding the party's associate student, labour and professional organisations," the BNP leader said. The party applied to the Election Commission on Oct 20, the deadline for registration. Awami League applied to the EC for registration on Oct 15. The commission's scrutiny committee had also initially asked the party to clarify its position on associate organisations. On Thursday, the commission issued two advertisements on completion of the registration process of Awami League and Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters that the major parties had helped to make the registration process easier. "Awami League, BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jatiya Party will get their registration certificates soon," he said. In the advertisements, the EC said it had finalised AL's registration with a boat symbol and Samyabadi Dal with a wheel symbol. If anybody has any complaint regarding the registration of these two parties, the EC has asked them to submit it by Oct 26. EC secretariat joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan, chief of the scrutiny committee for applications, said the registration of Jatiya Party and Workers Party of Bangladesh was also at the final stage. bdnews
