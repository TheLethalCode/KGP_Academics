<TITLE> Celtic still a threat despite poor away record - Ferguson </TITLE>

 MANCHESTER, England, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Celtic will provide a stern test for European champions Manchester United on Tuesday despite their dismal away record in the competition, United manager Alex Ferguson said. Ferguson said the regional rivalry between the English and Scottish champions would ensure a pulsating Group E clash at Old Trafford. United boast a 16-match unbeaten home run in the competition while Celtic have lost 17 of their last 18 away games in the Champions League. "You can say it's a local derby. It's Scotland-England, but Scottish and English have the same mentality and both teams will have a go," Ferguson told reporters on Monday. "That's in the nature and it's in Celtic's history. They are not going to sit back. It will be an open game and it will be a good game. "We won't get carried away simply because our home record is good and Celtic's away record is bad." Two years ago Celtic gave United a major fright at Old Trafford where they took the lead before going on to lose 3-2. The Scottish Premier League leaders will be missing key attackers Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras through injury but Ferguson said United were wary of Shunsuke Nakamura's threat from set-pieces. The Japanese international scored from freekicks both at Old Trafford and in Glasgow when Celtic won 1-0 there in 2006. "We recognise Nakamura is an exceptional talent at set-pieces. I would be very surprised if we lost a goal again like that having discussed it so many times since then. There have been a few rockets given out," said Ferguson. The United manager is toying with the idea of leaving out one of his potential match-winners with Nani possibly replacing Cristiano Ronaldo in the starting line-up. Ronaldo is feeling his way back to full form and fitness following surgery on an ankle injury and Ferguson may rest the Portugal international. Patrice Evra will be absent for United with a hamstring injury, joining Paul Scholes, Owen Hargreaves and Michael Carrick on the sideline
