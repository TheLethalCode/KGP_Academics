 NEW DELHI, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An accidental explosion ripped through an illegal fireworks factory in Rajasthan, killing at least 22 people, including 10 children, just days before Diwali. Police said that another 17 people were hurt after the explosion on Wednesday in the town of Deeg. "We have news of 22 deaths at the moment, there could be one or two more deaths as some are seriously injured," R. Narsimha Rao, a police inspector general in Rajasthan, told Reuters. The blast came only days before Diwali, or festival of lights, when millions of Indians take to the streets to let off fireworks. Months before Diwali, illegal fireworks factories spring up in many parts of India and almost all of these employ children, a child rights' group said. Poor children clandestinely work at these makeshift factories, which are often in people's homes, and almost every year there are fatal accidents. Employing children in hazardous occupations such as fireworks and electric bulb manufacturing units were banned by the government in 1987. Wednesday's blast highlights how India has fared poorly in implementing the law. Police said there were many factories in the area. "We will be making some arrests very shortly in connection with the explosion," Rao told Reuters. Rescue officials were trying to remove debris from the area to check if there were more survivors. "The impact of the blast was huge and it brought down at least five houses in the area," Rao said. Other policemen said there were still thick smoke in the area, making it difficult for rescue operations. "A few witnesses have told us that the factory had stored huge consignment of crackers," an investigating officer said by telephone. "They were desperately trying to meet deadlines." Local residents joined in the rescue efforts and police said volunteers worked through the night, but were yet to clear blocks of concrete slabs and rubble that had piled up. "There could be more people trapped inside," Rao said. Swapan Mukherjee of Free the Children India said the factories often hired children as "children come cheap". "We have come across cases where they are just given a meal a day for 18-20 hours of work, others are paid one fifth of a dollar," Mukherjee said, adding there are at least 1,500 such illegal factories around each of India's major cities. In 2005, more than 30 people, mostly children died in Bihar and last year four children died in neighbouring West Bengal
