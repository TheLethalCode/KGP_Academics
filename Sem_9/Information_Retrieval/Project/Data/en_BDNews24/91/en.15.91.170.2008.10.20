 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - As many as 107 political parties applied to the Election Commission for registration by the deadline of Monday 5pm, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said. He told bdnews24.com that the parties applied in compliance with the amended electoral laws that would make the path for stable politics in the country much smoother. Scrutiny of the applications and other necessary tasks relating to the registration process would be completed by the commission by Oct 30, Sohul Hussain said. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain estimated not many more than 25 parties would be able to get registered by meeting all the conditions. The Liberal Democratic Party was the first to receive its registration certificate Monday, ahead of the December election. The party has been given an umbrella symbol for the 9th Jatiya Sangsad election. Jatiya Party was the second party to get the EC license, with a bicycle symbol. Speaking to reporters at his office, Sohul Hussain said the applications for registration, including by major parties, took the country closer to the election. Earlier in the day, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said politics based on transparency, accountability and democracy began in the country through the registration process. He said it was a big achievement for the EC.
