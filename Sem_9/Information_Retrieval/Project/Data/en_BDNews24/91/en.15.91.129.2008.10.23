 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government to take immediate measures in banning display and sale of eight foreign milk powder brands contaminated with melamine. The eight banned brands are Australia's Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, China's Yashli-1, Yashli- 2 and Sweet Baby, and New Zealand's Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. The High Court also issued a show cause notice to the government to explain within four weeks why its previous inaction over stopping their sale should not be declared illegal. The home secretary, finance secretary, commerce secretary, the National Board of Revenue chairman, Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission chairman, BSTI director general and inspector general of police have been named in the notice. The HC bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Quamrul Islam gave the order on Thursday on a public interest litigation filed by a human rights organisation and others. As many as eight litigators including 'Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh' filed the complaint. bdnew
