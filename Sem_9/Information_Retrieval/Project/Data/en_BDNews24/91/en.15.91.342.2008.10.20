 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) Prices of petrol, octane, diesel and kerosene will come down this week, finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam told bdnews24.com Monday night. "The government has been considering lowering fuel prices on a priority basis, and the prices will come down within this week," the adviser said, speaking after a programme on 'The global economy and us', organised by FBCCI and private television channel NTV at the Sonargaon Hotel. "The decision comes in line with the falling prices of oil on the international market," said Mirza Aziz. When asked by how much prices would fall, Mirza Aziz said: "That cannot be said at the present time. It will be announced on the day." The issue of high fuel prices was earlier addressed at the programme by business leaders, who asked when domestic prices would fall in line with international oil prices. The government hiked fuel prices on June 30. It raised the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 55 from Tk 40, of petrol to Tk 87 from Tk 65, and octane to Tk 90, up from Tk 67. Special assistant to the chief adviser for energy and mineral resources M Tamim said on Oct 8 fuel prices would be reduced within a month. bdne
