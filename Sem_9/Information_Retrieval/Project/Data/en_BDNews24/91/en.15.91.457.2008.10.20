<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Participants were downcast about lack of in-depth coverage of corruption in the media at the annual investigative journalism awards, sponsored by Transparency International Bangladesh, on Monday. Speaking as chief guest, Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said investigative journalism was yet to gain strength in Bangladesh. "There have been no reports such as the Tehelka case in our neighbouring country. It takes courage to photograph a person taking money," he said. The ACC chairman awarded certificates and cheques for Tk 60,000 to each of six winners at the Jatiya Press Club auditorium. Abu Sufian, Sharmin Rinvi, Mozammel Shishir and Shovon Aref, all reporters for the private television channel Bangla Vision, claimed four out of six prizes at the Investigative Journalism Awards 2008. Prothom Alo's Sharifuzzaman Pintu and Anwar Sadat Imran of the daily Progotir Alo, a Tangail-based newspaper, received the two other awards. "Corruption among the owners of media outlets is one of the main hindrances to investigative journalism in Bangladesh," Monjurul Ahsan Bulbul, executive editor of the daily Sangbad, said at a seminar following the award giving ceremony. Bulbul said there was an unhealthy trend in the Bangladesh for corruption within the media to go unpublished. The Sangbad executive editor went on to say media houses were unable to report on corrupt practices by mobile phone operators for fear of losing extremely lucrative advertising revenue. "No major newspaper published any news items on tax evasion by the mobile phone companies," said Bulbul. TIB official M Hafizuddin Khan said he feared those who had been involved in corrupt practises in the country were now likely to evade punishment. "I don't think anything will happen to those responsible for corruption. Despite that, I still say we will be successful in the anticorruption drive," said Hafizuddin. bdnews24.
