 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)Senior Awami League leaders have upped their ante as they press for party chief Sheikh Hasina's unconditional release and participation in the Dec 18 polls. "The government will have to make clear announcement that Sheikh Hasina can participate in the election," former reformist Amir Hossain Amu said Friday. "Our campaign will continue till this announcement comes," said Amu, one of the four presidium members who spoke at a programme at Supreme Court Bar Auditorium. "She (Sheikh Hasina) will give nominations and participate in the electioneering. After the election she will lead the country," said Suranjit Sengupta, another presidium member. "The leader (Sheikh Hasina) will return home in the first week of next month. She was the leader of our party and will remain so. She will be the next prime minister," said Abdur Razzak. Razzak warned that people would not accept any conspiracy to foil the Dec 18 elections. Amu was the chief at the programme. "Conspiracy is still on so that Sheikh Hasina cannot participate in the election," said Amu. "In the dialogue with the government (on Thursday), our main demand was unconditional release of Sheikh Hasina and our participation in the election under her leadership." A fourth presidium member had a different way of pressing home the demand. "In the dialogue we demanded release of our leader and withdrawal of cases against her," said Tofail Ahmed. "Our leader will participate in the election. So we did not demand that she be allowed to participate in the election. "We have started campaigning under her guidance (God willing) We will win the election under her leadership. She will become prime minister and serve the people." On Upazila election, Tofail said: "During yesterday's (Thursday) three-hour dialogue we spent one hour discussing Upazila election. We told them that the upazila election may threaten the national election." Suranjit Sengupta said: "I have no doubt that my leader will get released. She will return home as a free person."
