<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will play a key role in managing global climate funds and be a major recipient of such money, the finance adviser said Monday. On return from Washington where he attended meetings with multilateral donors, A B Mirza Azizul Islam said the World Bank was setting up a Strategic Climate Fund. "Two committees namely, Trust Fund Committee for Strategic Climate Fund, the policy setting wing, and a sub committee to decide on the pilot activities have been formed to operate the funds activities," he said. Bangladesh is the only country elected to both the committees, the adviser told reporters at the airport. The adviser referred to the WB commitment to lend Bangladesh US$ 1.34 billion during the current fiscal year, and said: "This would be the largest ever World Bank commitment to Bangladesh." In six months to Dec this year, Dhaka will receive nearly a billion dollars to spend on projects such power plant and food security. "Bangladesh has been assured of $ 958.8 million in financial assistance which would be spent on food crisis response, Siddhirganj Peaking Power Plant, emergency cyclone recovery and Dhaka water supply-sanitation project," according to the adviser. "All the ground works for the projects have been done," he said. The rest $381.2 million WB support would be spent on projects during the six months to June next year. Replying to queries, he attributed the good donors' response to various reform measures implemented by the current government. Mirza Aziz, replying to questions, said a prolonged recession would have an adverse impact on the inflow of bilateral funds. On the Bangladesh Bank's credit outflow monitoring activities, Mirza Aziz said the move was not spurred by the global financial crisis. "That is because some unproductive sectors had witnessed unusual growth recently." On possibilities of reducing fuel prices, Mirza Aziz said the government was "actively considering" it as prices in the global market came down.
