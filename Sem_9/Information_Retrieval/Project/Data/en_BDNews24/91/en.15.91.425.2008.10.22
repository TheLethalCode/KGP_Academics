 MUMBAI, Wed Oct 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters in northern and eastern India set alight trains, blocked roads and damaged the home of the head of a Tata Motors factory on Wednesday, in retaliation for attacks on migrants in western India. The migration of thousands of workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar into India's booming financial capital Mumbai has sparked a violent backlash, with local resentment fuelled by ambitious politicians. That in turn has provoked tit-for-tat violence in northern and eastern India, a sign of the strains that inequality is placing on society as parts of the country's economy booms. In Mumbai on Tuesday, regional politician Raj Thackeray, head of the small but vocal Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), was arrested on charges of rioting and provoking attacks on migrant workers. That arrest sparked violent protests from supporters in Mumbai, and opponents mostly in Bihar. On Wednesday, residents of Mumbai returned to work, and schools and shops were open. But there was violence in Kalyan town, also in Maharashtra, where Thackeray, the nephew of Hindu nationalist leader Bal Thackeray, was held overnight in jail. A curfew was imposed and police beat back slogan-shouting protesters with batons as Thackeray was brought to Kalyan court to face multiple charges. "By and large the situation is normal, except for some stray incidents of stone-throwing," a police spokesman said. Violence flared again in the poor north and east of India. In Bihar, gangs of young men protesting against the MNS-inspired violence torched coaches of a train, vandalised train stations and disrupted rail and road traffic. "The situation is very tense ... we are facing a lot of trouble running the trains on time," a senior railway official in capital city Patna said. In neighbouring Jharkhand, a mob damaged the home of the head of a Tata Motors factory, also based in Mumbai, while in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Mayawati demanded MNS be banned, echoing calls by other legislators in parliament. Mayawati, chief of Bahujan Samaj Party, warned of a backlash against Maharashtrians in Uttar Pradesh and other states. "There are many people from Maharashtra in other states who could be at the receiving end for none of their fault," she said. Supporters of MNS, which is fuelling anti-immigrant rhetoric ahead of national and local elections due next year, had attacked north Indian railway job aspirants in Mumbai on Sunday, prompting calls for Thackeray's arrest and for the party to be banned. MNS has previously also attacked migrant taxi drivers in Mumbai, a city where less than half its 17 million residents are from the state. The Indian Express newspaper said it was not clear if Raj Thackeray would carry much weight in the elections. "(But) with his arrest and its aftermath, he is certain to keep the spotlight and set the discourse.
