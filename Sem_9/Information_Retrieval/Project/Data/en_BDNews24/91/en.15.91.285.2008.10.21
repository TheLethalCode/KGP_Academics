 New Delhi, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex rose more than 4 percent on Tuesday, buoyed by gains in international markets and on hopes that a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rate cut would mean cheaper loans for corporates. Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and Infosys Technologies were leading the gains. These three stocks account for nearly 30 percent of the main index. "We are going from a phase of absolute uncertainty to a phase which is looking little better," said Gajendra Nagpal, CEO at Unicon Financial. "The build-up has to be slow after the scare, but I expect by January we will touch 12,000 or so," he said. At 12:01 p.m., the benchmark 30-share BSE index was up 4.25 percent, or 434.33 points, at 10,657.42, with 28 components rising. It had risen 2.5 percent on Monday, snapping a three-day losing streak. Tuesday's gains trimmed its losses this year to 47.5 percent. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Monday that India must brace for slower economic growth because of the global market turmoil, but the country's banks were safe and there was no need to fear any collapse. The central bank cut its repo rate for the first time in 4- years by 100 basis points on Monday to 8.0 percent, to shore up markets and the economy against the global crisis, and traders expected this to be translated into lower interest rates. Reliance Industries was up 6.9 percent at 1,412.90 rupees, still down 51 percent this year. Top private sector bank ICICI Bank, whose stock has been battered on concerns of its exposure to the financial crisis, gained 8.4 percent to 445.50 rupees. The stock is still down more than 64 percent this year. State Bank of India added 2.2 percent and the bank index rose 3.5 percent. Outsourcers extended gains on improving sentiment in the United States, their biggest market. Infosys was up 5.2 percent at 1,365.80 rupees, and larger rival Tata Consultancy added 6.0 percent to 527 rupees. In the broader market, 1,503 gainers were ahead of 715 losers on volume of 98 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was up 3.38 percent at 3,228.50. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Shares in No. 5 mobile operator Idea Cellular fell 11.2 percent to 54.90 rupees after it reported a 35 percent fall in quarterly net profit on network expansion costs. Shares in Jaiprakash Associates Ltd jumped 12.7 percent to 76.30 rupees after its quarterly net profit nearly doubled to 2.03 billion rupees. The firm also approved a rights issue to raise 18 billion rupees. Sun TV Network rose 5.5 percent to 175.85 rupees after it said its board would meet on Oct. 30 to consider a share buyback.
