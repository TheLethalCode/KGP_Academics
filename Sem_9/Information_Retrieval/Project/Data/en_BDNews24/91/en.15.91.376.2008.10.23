 KATHMANDU, Thu Oct 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's ousted King Gyanendra and his relatives must pay huge unpaid electricity bills within 15 days or lose the power supply to their homes, the Himalayan nation's state utility said on Thursday. Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) said unpaid bills for electricity supplied to 22 palaces and bungalows earlier owned by Gyanendra and his relatives amounted to $1.14 million since 2006, when protests forced him to end a brief period of absolute rule. A special assembly dominated by the Maoist former rebels abolished the monarchy in May and turned the country into a republic. The company did not say exactly how much the king owed, since the government has nationalised at least seven of those palaces including the main Narayanhiti palace in the heart of Kathmandu, which Gyanendra left in June. But Gyanendra and his relatives still own many bungalows and palaces in Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal that have not paid their power bills, the company said. "We have given him 15 days to clear the bills," senior NEA official Deepak Prasad Upadhyay said. "If this is not done we'll cut off the power supply." There was no immediate comment from the former king who has been living low in a former hunting lodge outside Kathmandu since leaving the main palace
