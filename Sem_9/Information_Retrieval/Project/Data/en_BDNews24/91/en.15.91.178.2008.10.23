 BRUSSELS, Thu Oct 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Parliament, in a move certain to rile Beijing, on Thursday awarded its top human rights prize to Chinese dissident Hu Jia, who was jailed for subversion after testifying to the EU assembly last year. Announcing the award of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, European Parliament President Hans-Gert Poettering called Hu "one of the real defenders of human rights in the People's Republic of China". "By awarding the Sakharov Prize to Hu Jia, the European Parliament is sending out a signal of clear support to all those who defend human rights in China," Poettering told the assembly. The announcement came a day before EU leaders were due to meet Chinese counterparts at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) summit in Beijing. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said before the award that giving Hu the prize would be "an interference in both China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty". "We are opposed to interfering in the affairs of other countries, using the excuse of human rights. What kind of person Hu Jia is, I think, is known to all. He is a criminal convicted by China's courts on charges of inciting subversion," Qin said. Starting with advocacy for rural AIDS sufferers, Hu emerged as one of China's most vocal advocates of democratic rights, religious freedom and of self-determination for Tibet, which was shaken by protests and a security crackdown earlier this year. He was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison in China in April. Hu, 35, had already spent many months under house arrest with his wife and child. JAILED AFTER TESTIMONY He was arrested and charged with "inciting subversion of state power" following his testimony on human rights in China via conference call to the European Parliament's Human Rights Subcommittee on Nov. 26 last year. Hu's jailing drew condemnation from Washington, across Europe and from human rights advocates. His wife Zeng Jingyan was delighted by the news of the award when told of it by Reuters in Beijing. "At last some good news," she said. "Hu Jia would be very happy if he knew." She visited her husband on Wednesday evening. He had been transferred on Oct. 10 to a "model jail" in Beijing from a prison in the port city of Tianjin. Poettering said Hu was sick with cirrhosis of the liver and added: "As far as we know he is not being allowed proper medical care." A source who met Hu in September said his health was poor and he had been placed in solitary confinement in chains at least once. As a devout Buddhist, he was sticking to a strict vegetarian diet, which caused him nutritional problems in prison, the source said. Other prisoners were not allowed to lend Hu reading material. His letters to his family were read by prison officials who demanded that he rewrote them if they did not like the contents, the source added. The annual EU prize is named after Soviet rights activist and dissident Andrei Sakharov and was first awarded in 1988. It was given last year to Sudanese human rights lawyer Salih Mahmoud Osman. Previous recipients include Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi. The formal award ceremony for the prize, which includes a cheque for 50,000 euros ($64,280), will take place on Dec. 17 in Strasbourg, France
