 MADRID, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo on Friday gave his backing to coach Javier Aguirre, who has been criticised in the local media after three consecutive Primera Liga defeats. The club, 10 points adrift of leaders Valencia after seven games following defeats to Sevilla, Barcelona and city rivals Real Madrid, visit third-placed Villarreal this weekend. "I can guarantee that the coach will continue whatever happens at Villarreal on Sunday," Cerezo told reporters. "I hope that the change the team showed against Liverpool continues and that they play a good game and win. "We want to be among the top three in the league. Losing to Villarreal would be a big blow because it would mean we are losing ground on the leading sides. But it is only the eighth round of matches and there are many games still to play." Atletico came from behind to grab a 1-1 home draw against Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday and continue to share the leadership of Group D with them, level on seven points. They are eighth in the Primera Liga. Former Mexico and Osasuna boss Aguirre has been at Atletico since 2006
