 MOSCOW, Fri Oct 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia accused Washington on Friday of breaking international law and undermining cooperation on Iran's nuclear programme after it imposed sanctions on companies accused of passing sensitive technology to Tehran. The US State Department said on an official website it had imposed sanctions on firms in China and Russia for alleged sales of sensitive technology that could help Iran, North Korea and Syria develop weapons of mass destruction or missile systems. "These new sanctions were introduced without any international legal foundation whatsoever," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. "We will take this into account in our affairs, in our relations with the United States," he was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. He also said the US move would undermine Russian cooperation over Iran's nuclear programme, which Washington suspects is aimed at making a nuclear bomb. "If it seemed to someone in Washington that in this way the USA can make Russia more compliant in accepting American ways of resolving the Iranian nuclear problem, then they are mistaken," Lavrov said. Tehran says its nuclear programme is for civilian purposes only. Russia has given limited backing to UN sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, but says there is no evidence Iran is seeking nuclear weapons. A document published on the US Federal Register www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/ (page 63226) said the sanctions would be effective from Oct 23. It was first reported by Russian news agencies. A State Department spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Under the sanctions, which usually last two years, no US government agency may enter into any agreement with the organisations named. Sanctions were imposed on 13 organisations, including China Xinshidai Company, China Shipbuilding and Offshore International Corporation, Huazhong CNC as well as Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport and the Venezuelan Military Industries Company. The United States imposed sanctions in 2006 on Rosoboronexport, now a unit of Russian industrial group Russian Technologies, provoking sharp criticism from Moscow. Russian Technologies is headed by Sergei Chemezov, a close ally of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Russian Technologies also has stakes in AvtoVAZ, Russia's top carmaker, and VSMPO-Avisma, the world's largest titanium producer. A spokesman for Rosoboronexport said on Russian television the State Department's measures were "a case of unscrupulous competition," by the United States and that the firm worked in line with all international agreements on arms control
