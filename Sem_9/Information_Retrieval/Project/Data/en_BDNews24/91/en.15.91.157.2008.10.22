 ISTANBUL, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal stormed to a 5-2 victory over Fenerbahce in a pulsating Champions League match on Tuesday which put the London side in a strong position at the top of Group G. Emmanuel Adebayor fired the Gunners ahead after 10 minutes, slotting the ball calmly past Fenerbahce goalkeeper Volkan Demirel after Cesc Fabregas picked him out with a pass which cut through the home defence. Fabregas repeated the feat a minute later, this time finding Theo Walcott, who skipped over Demirel to score from a narrow angle.

Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger paid tribute to his players after the game. "We came her and tried to dictate the game in a very heated atmpshere. I'm very proud of that," he told a news conference.
