<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government may relax the state of emergency early next month, to coincide with the arrival of a European Commission delegation, said an adviser Tuesday. "The chief adviser in his address has assured that the state of emergency will be relaxed to hold a free, fair and credible election," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters following a meeting with the EC mission head in Bangladesh at the foreign ministry. A 10-member core assessment team of the EC will arrive on Nov 6 to study the pre-election political situation. "It is assumed the government may well make the announcement on relaxing the emergency during that period," Iftekhar said. Said EC mission head Stefan Frowein after the meeting: "I have talked to the adviser on the polls observation mission. The information continues to be that there will be relaxation or lifting (of the state of emergency) as soon as possible and we will see some announcements from the government very soon." Frowein said the EC's 10-member core group would arrive on Nov 6 for two days, and a 12-member longer-term assessment team would arrive a week later. Their assessment report will recommend whether a EU polls observation mission should be sent to Bangladesh to monitor the next general elections under a state of emergency. The European Union does not 'in principle' send observers to monitor polls under a state of emergency. The decision to send a full-fledged EU polls observation mission depends upon the EC's external affairs commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner. The foreign adviser met the commissioner on Sept 22 in New York to convince her to send a polls observation mission. She told the adviser the government must define the relaxation of the state of emergency and restore certain civil and political rights. bnd
