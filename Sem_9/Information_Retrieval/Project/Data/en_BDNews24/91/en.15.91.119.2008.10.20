 Karachi, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England have offered to stage some of Pakistan's international matches if foreign teams continue to be anxious about the security situation there, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Monday. "I had some positive discussions with Giles Clarke during the International Cricket Council (ICC) meeting in Dubai last week. And he said when we can play our matches offshore why not in England?" Butt said. Pakistan were due to host an Australia test tour and the Champions Trophy this year but both were cancelled over security fears. Butt said the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) could find slots in the summer to host Pakistan's matches against any team. "They are offering us good terms and conditions. They are willing to share 50 percent of revenues from ticket sales and media sales. "He feels the large Asian community in the United Kingdom will welcome Pakistan's matches in places like Manchester, Leeds," Butt added. He said the PCB would give serious consideration to the ECB proposal as the national team needed to play more international cricket to generate revenues for the board. Butt also said that the ECB had proposed Pakistan play a series of three tests, five one-day internationals and Twenty/20 games against them in 2010 and 2011 in England. "These matches are outside the future tour programme and not on a reciprocal basis and we will negotiate them," he said. He said no formal agreement had been signed with the Dubai sports city. It was reported in September that Pakistan signed a three-year, $9 million agreement to play one-day internationals and Twenty/20 matches in Dubai from next year. "I don't know what my predecessors have been saying in the media but all this is a verbal agreement. I have held fresh talks with the Dubai sports city whose stadiums would be inaugurated soon," Butt said. "We are interested in this deal but we have to look at the amount. India is also interested in playing there. They feel if both of us play at the same time the amount paid to us should be doubled," Butt sai
