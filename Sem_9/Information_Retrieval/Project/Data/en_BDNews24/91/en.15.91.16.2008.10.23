 BRUSSELS, Thu Oct 23, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European parliament leaders will bring forward a vote on steps to combat climate change to try and gain influence in a power struggle with member states, parliament sources said on Thursday. The parliament, which has so far taken a strong line on protecting the environment, wants to regain influence on EU plans to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by a fifth by 2020. Some EU leaders fear ambitious climate plans will add to the cost burden for industries already struggling with falling orders and looming recession. Thursday's move was a reaction to last week's decision by European leaders to take all crucial decisions on the climate package at a summit on December 11 and 12. "The European Parliament vote on December 3 and 4 will lead to a formal European Parliament position, which will carry more weight just ahead of the summit," said one parliament source. Italy and a group of East European states led by Poland are fighting hard for concessions for industry and power generators which will be hardest hit by higher charges on carbon emissions, under the proposed climate measures. Parliamentarians said that by agreeing to take all decisions at the December summit, leaders last week had reduced the influence of parliament, which should have equal weight in all decisions but has yet to adopt a formal, common position. It will achieve that position by taking a full parliament vote on December 3 and 4, pre-empting the EU leaders meeting, instead of voting after the summit as previously planned
