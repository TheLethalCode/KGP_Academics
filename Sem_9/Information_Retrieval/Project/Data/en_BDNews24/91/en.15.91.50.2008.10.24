<TITLE> Tigers looking to strike back </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh say they are fighting fit after Chittagong and looking to strike back against visitors New Zealand in the second and final Test on Saturday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. "We want to carry the momentum of the Chittagong Test on to the Dhaka Test. We fought throughout five days, up to the last moment on the fifth day of the first Test, and we are looking to translate that performance into the second Test," Tigers captain Mohammad Ashraful told a pre-match briefing in Mirpur on Friday. New Zealand were 1-0 ahead in the Test series, after stealing the first match by three wickets against Bangladesh and achieving a new away chase record of 317. "We are focused on batting for the full eight sessions and I think we will go nearer to a win with as many sessions as we can bat," said the youngest test centurion. The Bangladesh skipper said he was relying on the top-order to achieve this and was looking for the Tigers top four batsmen, including himself, to put some runs on the board. The 24-year old hopes to overcome his own off-form to play well in the final match. "The top-order batsmen, especially the top four, failed to justify themselves in Chittagong and I would love to see them pile on the runs in the second match. If they can provide a good start, then it would make other batsmen's task easier," said Ashraful, who scored two and nought in the first Test batting at number three. The toss might be a vital one with a depression in the Bay of Bengal and consequent cloud and drizzle forecast over the next few days. "The wicket seemed dry on Thursday, but today (Friday) it seems wet under the cloudy and rainy weather," said Ashraful, adding that they would pick the playing eleven before the match and might include one additional seamer if conditions remained unchanged. The Tigers have kept the same 12 as were declared for the Chittagong Test, keeping pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin out of the squad. The top-order batsman was also looking for improvement in all three departments. "We batted well in the first innings in Chittagong, but we should have put a few more runs on the board. Shakib (Al Hasan), Mehrab (Hossain), Mushfiqur (Rahman) should have converted their fifties into hundreds. In the second Test, we are now focusing on individual performance along with team performance." The Bangladesh captain said that he was mulling ways to prevent another batting and bowling spree from his counterpart Daniel Vettori. Vettori was the main architect in the Black Caps' triumph, with his nine-wicket haul and two significant knocks of 76 in the second innings and an unbeaten 55 in the first innings. The New Zealand skipper was concerned with his own team's performance ahead of the second Test, rather than Bangladesh's. "I am not too worried about how they are going to comeback. We have got our own game to worry about, we have got to improve on our first Test match performance, so this is where our concentration lies," said Vettori. The Kiwis will miss the play of injured all-rounder Jacob Oram, with Grant Eliot likely to replace Oram in the final Test. "He (Oram) is probably our most important player, I think, being our third seamer and one of our best batsman. So whenever he is out of the side, it makes it more difficult ... anytime you lose a player of Jacob's calibre it takes something out of your side," said the left-arm spinner. The New Zealand team cancelled their scheduled Friday practice due to drizzle and left the stadium just half an hour after their arrival. b
