 MOHALI, India, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India paceman Zaheer Khan was fined 80 percent of his match fee after being found guilty of a code of conduct breach following the second test win over Australia on Tuesday. Khan, summoned for a disciplinary hearing by International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee Chris Broad after the game, pleaded guilty to a level two charge under the code of conduct rules, a statement from the governing body said. Khan appeared to say something to opener Matthew Hayden following the batsman's dismissal before tea on Monday's fourth day. India won by 320 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. "Clearly, this sort of behaviour is not acceptable at any level of cricket - it showed a lack of respect for the player who had been dismissed," Broad said in the statement. "Respect for the opposition was something that we talked about in the pre-series meeting I had with both captains and so it was disappointing that Zaheer behaved in this way. "However, in considering the penalty, I took into account the fact that Zaheer had a good disciplinary record. He also pleaded guilty at the first opportunity and was very apologetic while also promising not to repeat the offence." The bowler, fielding in the deep, ran towards Hayden as he made his way back to the pavilion before turning towards his celebrating team mates. Hayden gestured at the umpire before walking off. Players from both sides were involved in verbal exchanges during the match and the umpires stepped in more than once, including on the final morning. Khan also exchanged words with Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin during the drawn first test in Bangalore while making a crucial fifty as the hosts salvaged a draw. The penalty for a level two offence ranges between 50 and 100 per cent fine of the player's match fee and/or a maximum ban of one Test match or two ODIs. Players have the right to appeal the decisio
