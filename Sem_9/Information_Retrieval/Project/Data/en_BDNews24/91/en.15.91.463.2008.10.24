 ROME, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A (all times GMT). Captain Francesco Totti is bemused by AS Roma's poor form but hopes their recent woes will come to an end on Sunday at second-placed Udinese (1400). Last year's Serie A runners-up have collected just seven points in their first seven games. "We don't know the reasons, things are going like this at the moment," Totti was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. "Let's hope this crisis ends Sunday against Udinese." Roma will be without defender Philippe Mexes (suspended) and injured midfielder Alberto Aquilani (thigh), who could be out for a month, according to media reports. AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was pleased with their 3-1 win at Heerenveen in the UEFA Cup on Thursday as the side continue their good run. There is also growing excitement at David Beckham's possible short-term loan from Los Angeles Galaxy. "The team is improving. We are better balanced and more concentrated," Ancelotti, whose side visit Atalanta in Bergamo on Sunday, told reporters. "The news about Beckham is pleasing. He's a serious lad, a professional and these are all positive signals." Champions Inter Milan are relieved after tests showed the muscle strain Esteban Cambiasso suffered in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Anorthosis Famagusta is not serious, but the Argentina midfielder is still expected to miss the leaders' game against Genoa on Sunday. Juventus are short of central midfielders for Saturday's derby against Torino (1830), with Claudio Marchisio and Christian Poulsen recently joining an injury list that also includes goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and striker David Trezeguet. Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi is battling to come back a leg muscle problem to help Juve end a run of two consecutive league defeats. Alex Calderoni is expected to play in goal for struggling Torino, who have lost their last three games, after first-choice keeper Matteo Sereni suffered an ankle injury in training on Wednesday. Defender Francesco Pratali is suspended while playmaker Eugenio Corini is an injury doubt. Tommaso Rocchi is likely to miss fifth-placed Lazio's home game against Napoli, who are on 14 points and share second place with Udinese and Catania, on Sunday (1300) after the striker took a knock to his thigh in a training match
