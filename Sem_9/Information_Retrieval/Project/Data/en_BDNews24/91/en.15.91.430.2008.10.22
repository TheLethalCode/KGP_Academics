 DUBAI, Wed Oct 22,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The al Qaeda linked group Islamic State in Iraq confirmed the killing of one its leading members in an Internet audio tape posted on Wednesday. The US military had described the militant as ISI's second-in-command and said he was killed in a raid in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on October 15. "God has honored him with martyrdom so he told his soldiers 'here I am your leader I fight then I blow up my explosive belt in defense of my religion'," Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, the leader of ISI, said of the militant identified by the alias Abu Qaswara al-Maghrebi, who had Swedish citizenship. "Those who loved the martyr ... should kill an infidel to avenge (our) brother and those, be it an apostate or an occupier," Baghdadi said in the statement posted on a website that carries statements by militant groups, including al Qaeda. The Swedish Foreign Ministry this month said it had been informed that a Swedish citizen had been killed in Iraq by US forces. Baghdadi said Maghrebi, whose alias suggests he was a Moroccan national, had "thrown his Swedish passport in the trash bin" and joined the group's fight against US-led forces and those of the Iraqi Shi'ite-led government. Maghrebi was married to a European woman and had five children who he had not seen for three years, Baghdadi said, adding he had fought in Afghanistan before leading the militant group in the northern region of Iraq. Baghdadi did not refer to Maghrebi as his second in command. Baghdadi did not give details about the operation in which Maghrebi was killed or say when it happened
