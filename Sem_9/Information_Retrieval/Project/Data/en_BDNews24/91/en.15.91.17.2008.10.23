<TITLE> Rupee, shares punished; markets look to RBI </TITLE>

 MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Thu Oct 23, (bdnws24.com/Reuters) - The rupee fell to a record low and shares ended at their weakest in more than two years on Thursday as a global rout of equities washed through India's markets. All eyes were on Friday's monetary policy review, and ahead of it the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pledged to respond swiftly and pre-emptively to preserve financial and price stability. The central bank slashed its key lending rate by 100 basis points to 8.0 percent this week, joining central banks across the world this month in easing policy to combat slowing growth, and a Reuters poll showed few market watchers expected another cut as soon as Friday. India's shares and rupee have suffered from the global turmoil as foreign funds have fled emerging markets, and the interbank lending market seized up briefly earlier this month. "The Reserve Bank is closely monitoring developments in the global as well as domestic financial markets and stands ready to take such pre-emptive action as may be necessary to contain excess volatility in the domestic financial markets," it said. Monday's rate cut was an about-face for the RBI, which until July was raising interest rates to combat double-digit inflation but in the past month has pumped billions of dollars worth of funds into the banking system to ease the liquidity squeeze stemming from the global financial crisis. Annual inflation is now declining and data on Thursday showed the country's most widely watched price gauge, wholesale price inflation, slowed to an annual 11.07 percent at Oct. 11 from a peak of 12.9 percent in August. Economic Affairs Secretary Ashok Chawla said the government expected inflation at 9.5-10 percent by the end of 2008. And Oil Minister Murli Deora offered the prospect of a possible cut in government-set fuel prices soon, to ease the burden on consumers ahead of key state elections. U.S. crude oil has fallen to about $67 a barrel from a record above $147 in July, putting pressure on India to cut the price of fuels still controlled by the government. Politicians urged the government for a cut to help ordinary Indians, just as it helped ailing airlines by giving them time to pay jet fuel dues in instalments. Deora said he was watching crude and would decide in a week if state-set prices should fall. SHARES, RUPEE PUMMELLED In the share market, the benchmark index dropped 4 percent to its lowest close since June 2006 as Asian stocks hit a four-year low for a second day on growing fears that a global downturn would depress corporate earnings further. "Valuations are attractive, but still people are not committing enough funds," said Neeraj Dewan, director at Quantum Securities. "There are views that our growth will slow down in the short term, though medium term would be ok, but people are more concerned about the short term." A central bank survey of economic forecasters showed they expected economic growth to slow to 7.7 percent in 2008/09, below an average expansion of 8.8 percent in the past five years. Shares of banks, companies involved in metal and software exports were hardest hit. The key index has fallen by more than half this year, with foreigners selling a net $12.2 billion, compared with 2007's record net inflow of $17.4 billion. The finance minister said the stock market regulator had asked foreign institutional investors not to lend Indian shares to offshore entities in a bid to ease selling pressure. The partially convertible rupee fell to a record low of 49.85 per dollar before heavy central bank intervention pulled it back to 49.81/82, and it closed down 1 percent on the day. On Wednesday, the central bank raised the cap on overseas debt of domestic firms to $500 million from $100 million to try to encourage inflows to support the rupee. Government bond yields, which move inversely to prices, eased towards eight-month lows, with the 10-year yield down 4 basis points at 7.56 percent as expectations grew the central bank would take more liquidity measures on Friday
