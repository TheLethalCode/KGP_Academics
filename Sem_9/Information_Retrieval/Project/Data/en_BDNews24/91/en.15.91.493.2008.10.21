<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Wednesday for a full hearing on the writ petition challenging the legality of a gazette on re-demarcation of Jatiya Sangsad constituencies. A High Court bench hearing the Election Commission's appeal against a stay order on the gazette on Tuesday fixed the date for hearing of the main writ petition. In the hearing the EC's lawyer, Mahmudul Islam said: "The Election Commission can not publish the final voter list on the basis of the parliamentary seats as there is High Court stay order on the gazette regarding the constituency re-demarcation." "The High Court order staying effectiveness of the gazette needs to be cancelled." The lawyer pointed out that the election schedule has to be declared at least 42 to 45 days ahead of the time, but the High Court stay order is effective up to Nov 6. "The voter list cannot be finalised until the High Court order stays in force. The schedule also cannot be declared." Mahmudul claimed, as per article 125 of the constitution, any order regarding delimitation of parliamentary constituencies cannot be challenged in any court. The court said the priority was to settle the original petition against re-demarcation, and therefore fixed Wednesday for hearing of three separate petitions filed by Abdul Mannan, ABM Nurul Islam and Arifur Rahman simultaneously, against the gazette. Counsel for the petitioners, senior advocate TH Khan told bdnews24.com: " The hearing on the Election Commission's appeal to quash the High Court stay order is no more necessary now." "The hearing on the main writ petition will be held. The court will settle the matter." The gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary seats was issued on July 10, redrawing boundaries of 133 of the constituencies. The High Court stayed the effectiveness of the gazette on Aug 7, on a writ petition challenging the legality of the gazette. The EC filed a counter petition with the upper against the stay order. b
