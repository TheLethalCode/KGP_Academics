<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com) BNP will not take part in any polls without its chairperson Khaleda Zia leading its election march, said secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain Friday to reporters at his NAM apartment. At the same time, Delwar urged the government to meet their seven-point demands including full withdrawal of emergency immediately. "Deshnetree Khaleda Zia's participation in the polls must be ensured, or BNP will boycott the elections," the BNP secretary general warned. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, however, said Thursday night after the second round of government-BNP dialogue that the issue of Khaleda Zia's presence in Bangladesh politics was "decided" and the remainder of the unfinished business would be done through the legal process. On lifting emergency, Delwar said, "We want emergency to be lifted once and for all, not in phases. BNP will participate in the polls if the government accepts our demands pressed during the dialogue." Delwar said many candidates would be facing various hurdles in electioneering unless the emergency laws were revoked. The first round of government-BNP talks was held on October 14, when the party had raised its seven-point demands including dropping all charges against all political leaders and retrieving the RPO. bd
