 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  A three-member Local Government Commission has been formed, to be headed by former secretary Fayzur Razzak, a Bangabhaban official said Wednesday. Md Sirajul Islam, secretary to the president's office, told bdnews24.com that the president had signed the documents relating to the appointment of the commission's chairman and members. The appointments will be effective for three years. The two other members are former secretary Hedayetul Islam Chowdhury and Chittagong University's Dr Tofail Ahmed, who teaches public administration. The president approved the Local Government Commission Ordinance 2008 on May 13. The caretaker government formed a committee last year, led by former secretary AMM Shawkat Ali, in a bid to strengthen local government bodies. The committee submitted a report in November last year with a recommendation to form a local government commission. It also submitted a draft of the ordinance. The commission aims among other things to shore up the local judicial system. Village courts, set up under the Gram Adalat Act 2006, and local arbitration councils, established under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961, are expected to be strengthened and see qualitative changes through the setting up of the commission. bdnews
