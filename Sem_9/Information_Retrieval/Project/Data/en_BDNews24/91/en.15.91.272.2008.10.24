 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) president Oli Ahmed on Friday doubted the general elections on schedule a day after the commerce adviser said the country was getting on the "electoral highway". "Well, Bangladesh has hit the highway, but it is the world's most bumpy one; so there is no certainty that the country would eventually reach the destination," Oli said to supporters at the party's Mogbazar office in the city. He said the people have had more than their fair share of sermons from the advisers and advised the government to instead focus on organising the polls at hand. The LDP chief also asked for proper security of all political leaders during the elections. People are apprehensive as the corruption suspects are rejoicing on the some advisers' speeches, Oli observed. Oli called on the party leaders and activists to prepare for the national ballot set for Dec. 18. LDP secretary general Jahanara Begum, presidium members Redwan Ahammad, Abdul Karim Abbasi, among others, were present. bd
