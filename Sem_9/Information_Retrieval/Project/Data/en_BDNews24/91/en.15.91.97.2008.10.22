 Dhaka, Oct 21(bdnews24.com) Bangladesh will get $165 million in loans from ADB for energy and infrastructure projects, the Manila-based lender said Tuesday. Large infrastructure projects will receive US$82 million, while US$50 million will be spent on renewable energy projects primarily in rural, semi urban areas, an ADB statement said. Another US$33 million will go to renewable energy, such as solar home systems and bio mass installations though a microfinance based, direct sales programme, the bank said. The money will support the PPIDF or Public-Private Rural Infrastructure Development Facility, which "seeks to catalyse private sector investments of up to US$600 million, mostly in energy". The ADB said the funding could add "at least 900 megawatts of power generation capacity" in Bangladesh and provide electricity to about 100,000 more households through the renewable energy programme. The outgoing ERD secretary, Md. Aminul Islam Bhuiyan, who will soon move to Manila to take over as alternate executive director at ADB, and Paul J. Heytens, country director for Bangladesh, signed the deal Tuesday. "The facility will improve the infrastructure sector in Bangladesh through increased private sector participation, thereby promoting economic growth and reducing poverty," said Paul J Heyten. "Private sector participation can potentially speed up the pace of infra structure development, expand excess, and deliver efficient services," he said. A $500,000 technical assistance grant will also be provided for capacity building to support project implementation. The ADB statement said public investment in infrastructure had remained stagnant in recent years at 6-7% of Gross Development Product (GDP).
