 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)--In the second such agreement of its kind, the Bangladesh Bank and the central bank of Nepal Tuesday agreed to exchange certain information in a bid to prevent money laundering and other criminal activities. "Under the agreement the central banks of the two countries will exchange information about money laundering," BB executive director Abul Kashem told reporters after signing the agreement at the bank's head office in Motijheel. Kashem, also chief of the Financial Intelligence Unit, added that similar agreements were likely to be signed with other central banks at some point in the future. Another bank official, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com that these types of agreement are now relatively common, with one of their main aims being to restrict the financing of terrorist activities. The BB has already signed a similar agreement with Malaysia's central bank. The Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Dharmaraj Sapkota on behalf of the central bank of Nepal. bdnew
