 Tokyo, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters ) - It has long been accepted that talking to plants can help them flourish, but have you ever wondered what they'd say in response? Well a plant in Japan has its own blog that may help you understand. "Midori-san", a 40 cm potted plant on a cafe counter in Kamakura, near Tokyo, blogs every day with the help of a sensor that measures electric signals and a computer algorithm that translates them into Japanese. The plant, a hoya kerrii, is commonly called a "sweetheart plant" because of it leaf shape. "We were initially interested in what plants are feeling and what they are reacting to where we can't see," said Satoshi Kuribayashi, a researcher involved in the project at Japan's Keio University. The strength of electronic signals on the surface of Midori-san's heart-shaped green leaves, which react to light and human touch, are measured by a sensor attached to the plant, and this data is sent to a computer in the cafe. The computer uses an algorithm to translate the signal data, as well as other factors -- including weather and temperature -- to translate them into words, which are automatically posted on Midori-san's blog "Today was a sunny day and I was able to sunbathe a lot... I had quite a bit of fun today," Midori-san, whose name means "green" in Japanese, posted on Oct 16. The latest entry reads: "It was cloudy today. It was a cold day." Kuribayashi said he hopes that in the future, the blog will reflect even more accurately of Midori-san's feelings. Blogging with computers and mobile phones is popular in Japan, which had the greatest number of blog posts by language at 37 percent, followed by English and Chinese posts, a study from blog search engine Technocrati in 2007 showed. A recent study by the Universities of Oxford and Oviedo found that Japan has the best performing broadband Internet connections in the world
