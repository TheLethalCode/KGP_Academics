<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Some 33 out of 41 Chittagong City Corporation councillors have demanded that the government remove all obstacles for bailed mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury's return to office. The councillors, in a Thursday press conference at the CCC auditorium, alleged that the mayor was being barred from his post by negative forces of the law and local government ministries. Councillor MA Naser, reading a statement, claimed although the mayor was released on bail to seek medical treatment, the bail order did not prevent him from resuming office as mayor. They rejected a law ministry circular issued Wednesday barring Mohiuddin from resuming office while on bail, calling it "improper". Naser said if the government's circulars were not withdrawn the councillors would take legal steps. Mohiuddin had appealed against an earlier local government ministry circular barring him from taking up his duties. A second circular issued Wednesday, this time by the law ministry, clarified that Mohiuddin cannot return as mayor while on bail. The councillors also claim that due to the acting mayor's inability to properly discharge his duties, the development index of the city had nosedived in the 19 months since the arrest of mayor Mohiuddin. bdnew
