 LONDON, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pressure is mounting on coach Claudio Ranieri as his stumbling Juventus side host nine-times European champions Real Madrid in Turin in the standout clash of Tuesday's Champions League ties.

Two consecutive Serie A defeats have left Juventus stuck in mid-table and they are not helped by the absence of striker David Trezeguet and keeper Gianluigi Buffon with injuries. Elsewhere on Tuesday, defending champions Manchester United and Celtic meet at Old Trafford in Group E with the Scottish side looking to end a demoralising away run in the Champions League that reads 17 defeats and one draw in 18 trips. The top two meet in Group F when Bayern Munich host Fiorentina. Bayern hope to have Italian striker Luca Toni fit after suffering a rib injury.
