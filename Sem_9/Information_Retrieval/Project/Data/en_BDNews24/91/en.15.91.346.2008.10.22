<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Celtic manager Gordon Strachan described Manchester United as the best team he had seen in Europe after they outclassed his side 3-0 at Old Trafford on Tuesday. Celtic were overwhelmed in their Group E encounter and Strachan said United were warm favourites to successfully retain their Champions League title. "In the past couple of years we have played some terrific sides but I think that's the best," Strachan told reporters. "It was one of the best performances I have come across watching European football. It will take some team to beat them, that's for sure. "Wayne Rooney was unplayable. When you see players like that you have to say he's a world-class player, backed up by a couple of other world-class players and six or seven international players." Celtic lost to two goals from Dimitar Berbatov and one from Rooney and even though Berbatov's goals were scored from off-side positions, Strachan did not use that as an excuse. "You need a decision and to get two like that was a blow," he said. "But I am not going to sit here and scream about them. I know when I am well beaten and so does my team. "I am just pleased that we showed enough guts to stay in there and it wasn't a rout and we got beat by seven. Roma got beat by seven here." The defeat left Celtic on one point after three matches, six behind United and Spanish side Villarreal. Strachan must now lift his team to face United again in two weeks' time when they may need something from the game to keep alive their hopes of finishing third in the group to qualify for the Uefa Cup. "It's going to be very hard but we have to put on a performance to reward our fans and try and give Man United a game and show them we are better than that
