 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Seven people were served legal notice recently to cancel the results of the Aug 28 election of the Bangladesh Hockey Federation (BHF) by Thursday Oct 23. Advocate Nasrin Ferdaus on behalf of Sultan Uddin Ahmed, a BHF councillor from Uttara Hockey Club, served the notice on Oct 20 to seven people demanding justice on the matter of the BHF election. The notices were served to: the BHF president, BHF general secretary, the BHF ex-general secretary Shamsul Bari, the secretary of the Youth and Sports Ministry, the deputy director of Dhaka division and returning officer, the election commissioner and the secretary of the National Sports Council. The notice said the Bangladesh Hockey Federation has adopted "a so-called amendment of its original constitution without placing it before the annual general meeting as per the provision of law, norms and practice in this regard". It also added that the amendments were never brought to the notice of the councillors as per law and practice before the elections held on 28/08/2008 and 28/12/2005. It also raised questions about the councillorships of Shamsul Bari, retired commodore Shahjahan Sarkar and Mir Mohammad Monowar. The notice asked the seven to cancel the latest election results, as well as dissolve the executive body by Oct 23, in order to pave the way for holding a flawless and fair election, otherwise they would go to court.
