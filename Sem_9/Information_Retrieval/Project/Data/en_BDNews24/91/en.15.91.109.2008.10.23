 Miranshah, Pakistan, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected US drone fired a missile into a Pakistani village early on Thursday, killing four tribesmen, residents said, the latest strike aimed at a stronghold of a veteran Taliban commander. The strike targeted a village in the North Waziristan tribal region near the Afghan border where Jalaluddin Haqqani, an old friend of Osama bin Laden, had established a madrasa or religious school. Haqqani's extended family used to live there. "A large number of militants are rushing toward the area in vehicles," a Reuters witness said by telephone from Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan. Zardad Khan, a villager, later said four people were killed and three wounded in the attack. "They were all local people." Twenty-three people, mostly relatives of Haqqani, were killed in a similar attack on the same village in September. U.S. forces, frustrated over growing cross-border militant attacks from the Pakistani side, have carried out around a dozen missile strikes and a commando raid in Pakistani tribal areas since the start of September. A large number of militants have been killed in these attacks but no senior al Qaeda or Taliban commander is reported to have died so far. One of the sons of Haqqani had told Reuters that the elderly commander was in Afghanistan when the village was hit in September. Haqqani is a veteran of the US-backed Afghan war against the Soviet invasion in the 1970s and 1980s and his extended family had been living in North Waziristan since then. Haqqani's links with bin Laden go back to the late 1980s. Taliban sources say he is in ill-health and his son, Sirajuddin, has been leading the Haqqani group
