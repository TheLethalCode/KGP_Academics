"Respect and loyalty are the least you can expect as an experienced national team player," added Ballack, who said he hoped Frings would decide to prolong his international career. Loew criticised Ballack for speaking out in the media but said his comments would not change their relationship. "I'm completely surprised," Loew was quoted as saying by German media. "That he should use such a critical tone in the media puzzles and disappoints me." He added: "As captain, he is an important partner for me and this will not change anything."
