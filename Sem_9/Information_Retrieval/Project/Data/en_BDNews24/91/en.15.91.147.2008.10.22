<TITLE> EC questions Jamaat constitution </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has found some articles of Jamaat-e-Islami's new constitution questionable, an EC official said on Wednesday. "If the party fails to give an explanation, it may need to move to amend the constitution further," EC joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com. The EC committee, tasked with scrutiny of the parties' applications for registration, has sought clarification on the articles from the party. Khan, head of the EC's scrutiny committee, said: "There are some wordings in the constitution which we would like further clarification on." He said there would be no problem for Jamaat to register if it could give a proper explanation. Other officials of the scrutiny committee said they believed the spirit of the Jamaat constitution denied the sovereignty of parliament. It contains a clause that is against the principle of democratic rule in the country, they said. Jamaat's law affairs secretary Jasim Uddin Sarkar told reporters, after a meeting with EC officials, that the party's central committee would discuss these matters and meet again with the scrutiny committee. Jamaat's assistant secretary general M Kamaruzzaman had said on Oct 20, when the party submitted its registration papers, that necessary changes were made in line with the new RPO to the party's constitution recognising the constitution of the country, the liberation war and its sovereignty. The party has also changed its name for registration, to Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami instead of Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh. bdnews
