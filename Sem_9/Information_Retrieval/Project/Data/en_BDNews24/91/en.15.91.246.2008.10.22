<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka trial court Wednesday ordered that copies of the High Court stay order on the Barapukuria coalmine graft case be presented in the court on Oct 29, after defense lawyers called for trial proceedings to be suspended. A HC bench of justices Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Farid Ahmed stayed proceedings for three months on Oct 16, in the case filed against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and others. As the special court sat Wednesday, Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokon said: "The High Court has stayed the case for three months, hence our prayer for deferring the trial of the case." Opposing the motion, state counsel advocate Mosharraf Hossain Kajol said: "The High Court has stayed case proceedings against only one accused, Khaleda Zia. The trial of the case may continue unhindered against other accused." Pointing out that another accused in this case, Jamaat-e-Islami ameer Motiur Rahman Nizami, had not sought bail in the case, Kajol said: "Let the court issue a warrant of arrest against him." Judge AK Roy of Special Judge's Court-2, on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, said the court could not give any decision without seeing a copy of the stay order. The judge set Oct 29 for presenting a copy of the High Court's order. Barrister Abdur Razzaque, lawyer for another accused, asked the court to cancel an arrest warrant against his client Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Md Mojaheed. "The High Court has ordered authorities not to arrest or harass my client for two weeks. The arrest warrant issued against him should, therefore, be cancelled or revoked," the lawyer said. The judge replied that the all the day's motions would be heard after the court received the copy of the High Court order. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of incurring losses of Tk 158.71 core to the state due to an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). ACC deputy director Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges on Oct 5 against 16 people, including the BNP chairperson. Khaleda appealed to the High Court on Oct 12, seeking cancellation of the case. Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, whom Khaleda fired as BNP secretary general for his alleged links to the current government, is among the accused. He appeared briefly in court on Wednesday morning. bdnews24.
