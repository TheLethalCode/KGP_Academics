 Dhaka, October 20 (bdnews24.com)Two days after knitwear exporters alleged government inaction, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Monday sought to calm industry leaders and solicited strategies from them to protect Bangladesh's exports from the global financial crisis. "Please sit together, discuss all details and strike upon the appropriate strategy," the chief adviser told them at the launch of the 'Knitwear Exposition 2008' at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel Monday morning, "Our main customersthe US and Europeare now suffering a bad financial depression, which might deter them from buying our merchandise." "We must act fast and determine ways to avert any negative trends that might befall our RMG industry," said Fakhruddin, addressing the annual expo of readymade knitwear, hosted by the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters' Association (BKMEA). Just two days ago, the leading exporters' group blasted the government for taking "no initiative" to face the likely crisis that could stem from the current global economic recession. "Though we, the exporters, are very much worried, no preparation to face the crisis is visible," BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said Saturday. Hoque warned of "inevitable crisis" for Bangladesh if the ongoing global recession deepened. The CA clearly responded to the industry concerns and sought to assure all of the caretaker government's full cooperation in this regard. "We have to look for new markets too while adopting measures to cope with the changing scenarios," the CA said. "You will have to play the vanguards in finding new buyers," he said. "Our export earnings depend heavily on RMG sales and I concede the situation may be precarious," Fakhruddin said. The CA urged business leaders to assist in "diversification of our exportable commodities" and finding new markets for the products. Calling upon the RMG leaders to spend more on human resource, Fakhruddin said, "This sector has not invested adequately for raising any skilled work force, though considerable investments have been made for developing infrastructures, including equipment upgrading. "The investors in the RMG sector must now raise appropriate training facilities for churning out skilled workers." Urging both government and private partners in the sector to forge partnership to train workers, he assured them: "The government will take necessary steps in this regard." Labour and employment adviser Anwarul Iqbal, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque also spoke on the occasion. bdnews24.c
