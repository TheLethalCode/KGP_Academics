<TEXT>
 ROME, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A (all times GMT): Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi has lost his battle to regain full fitness from a leg muscle problem and will not be available to help Juventus end a run of two league defeats in Saturday's derby against Torino (1830), the club said on their website (www.juventus.com). Coach Claudio Ranieri was already short of midfielders, with Claudio Marchisio and Christian Poulsen recently joining an injury list that also includes goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and striker David Trezeguet. The situation may prompt Ranieri to switch Pavel Nedved from the wing to the centre of midfield and use Hasan Salihamidzic out wide, the solution he went for when Marchisio came off in Tuesday's 2-1 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League. Alex Calderoni is expected to play in goal for struggling Torino, who have lost their last three games, after first-choice keeper Matteo Sereni suffered an ankle injury in training on Wednesday. Defender Francesco Pratali is suspended while playmaker Eugenio Corini is an injury doubt. Captain Francesco Totti is bemused by AS Roma's poor form but hopes their recent woes will end on Sunday at second-placed Udinese (1400). Last year's Serie A runners-up have collected just seven points in their first seven games. "We don't know the reasons, things are going like this at the moment," Totti was quoted as saying by La Gazzetta dello Sport. "Let's hope this crisis ends on Sunday against Udinese." Roma will be without defender Philippe Mexes (suspended) and injured midfielder Alberto Aquilani (thigh), who could be out for a month, according to media reports. AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was pleased with their 3-1 win at Heerenveen in the UEFA Cup on Thursday as the side continued their good run. There is also growing excitement at David Beckham's possible short-term loan from Los Angeles Galaxy. "The team is improving. We are better balanced and more concentrated," Ancelotti, whose side visit Atalanta in Bergamo on Sunday (1400), told reporters. "The news about Beckham is pleasing. He's a serious lad, a professional and these are all positive signals." Champions Inter Milan are relieved after tests showed that the muscle strain Esteban Cambiasso suffered in Wednesday's 1-0 win over Anorthosis Famagusta was not serious, but the Argentina midfielder is still expected to miss the leaders' game against Genoa on Sunday (1400). Tommaso Rocchi is likely to miss fifth-placed Lazio's home game against Napoli, who are on 14 points and share second place with Udinese and Catania, on Sunday (1400) after the striker took a knock to his thigh in a training match
