<TITLE> Vettori stole the match: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  After ruining one of their best chances to win a Test match against a major cricket nation, Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful said New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori made all the difference in stealing the match from them. "We played good cricket in all five days and had a very good chance winning this match, but Vettori made all the difference as he batted well and also bowled well," Ashraful told reporters at a post-match briefing at the Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium on Tuesday. Vettori followed his nine-wicket haul and unbeaten 55 in the first innings to strike a captain-knock 76 in the second innings to steer New Zealand home after Bangladesh set them to chase a record target of 317. New Zealand thrashed Bangladesh by three wickets in the first of the two-match Test series opener in Chittagong, marking the first time the Black Caps had won a match outside their home ground chasing over 200 runs. While the Kiwis captain kept a cool head to steal the host's momentum, Bangladesh skipper Ashraful frustrated all making only two and nought in two innings. "It is always good when the captain performs. I tried my best but wasn't successful," said Ashraful. The youngest Test centurion felt the match was no longer in Bangladesh's grasp after the tea break. "We didn't give up and thought a couple of wickets in an over could yet get us back, but I felt the match was heading their way at tea." Coach Jamie Siddons explained why his side failed to pull off the win. "I think on a day like today we needed the 50-50 decisions to go our way. It wasn't plumb leg-before decisions or anything, but you need these decisions to go your way. "There wasn't anything in the wicket for the fast bowlers either. We bowled well and we didn't drop our catches but the opportunities we did have were turned down most of the time." New Zealand captain Vettori was very pleased with the way they chased down against Bangladesh. "I think it is always important for the captain to set standards so it was pleasing for me to have made a contribution with the bat and ball, and I am pretty pleased with the effort in chasing 317 against Bangladesh who I thought had the momentum. "Shakib (Al Hasan) and (Abdur) Razzak bowled exceptionally well throughout the Test so it was not an easy challenge, and throughout the history of New Zealand cricket we have never chased that well outside our country. "So it was really pleasing and we knew that other teams have come here and struggled. We are happy to take this one and hopefully we'll take some momentum into the second match in Dhaka," said Vettori. bdn
