<TITLE> Power output falls due to gas shortages </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)Gas supply shortages have put the brakes on power production, making load management all the more difficult throughout the country. According to the power division, plants in Chittagong region alone have lost more than 400 megawatts in generation capacity, thanks to poor gas supply and falls in water level. The national figure for the fall in power generation is 665 MW, officials say. "Our only problem is (poor) gas supply," power secretary Dr M Fauzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "Production has fallen in Sangu (gas field), resulting in a fall in production in Chittagong." The power division says the output from Raozan power plant in Chittagong alone has gone down by 270 MW due to gas crisis. With an installed production capacity of 420 MW, the plant is now capable of generating 360 MW, but giving only 90 due to gas crisis. If the generation comes down to 70 MW the whole plant would have to be shut down, the officials warn. "Bakhrabad Gas could not update us on gas production until Tuesday. If this situation continues, already acute power shortage will get worse," said Jyotish Chandra Biswash, PDB chief engineer for Chittagong. Lack of gas supply has already stopped power generation at Shikolbaha plant, which has a capacity of 50 MW. Energy secretary Mohammad Mohsin Tuesday admitted the failure. "We are trying, but it's true we are failing," the secretary told bdnews24.com. Meanwhile, Bangladesh's only hydro-electric plant at Kaptai has to keep shut during daytime due to low water level. The water level in Kaptai Lake has come down to 87 feet, well below the fully operational level of at least 108 to 109 feet. According to Petrobangla, Sangu, the only offshore gas field, is now producing, on an average, 33 to 44 million cubic feet (mmcf). Its capacity is 60 mmcf. Petrobangla said technical faults with one of the wells have forced a low output. Power Development Board (PDB) Tuesday estimated the possible highest production at 3643 megawatt and putting the shortfall at 671 MW. On Monday, the shortfall was 604 MW throughout the country. "More or less, all areas of Dhaka zone suffered power failures," said one official at Dhaka Power Distribution Company control room. At noon Tuesday, the shortfall was 162 MW. The total supply for the zone was 1400 MW. In Chittagong, repeated pledges from chief adviser and other advisers have not worked. On Aug 13, Fakhruddin Ahmed pledged to boost gas supply in the port city before the last Eid (Oct 2). Later, in September, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman announced supply of an extra 20 million cubic feet gas for the region. The commerce adviser said 10 mcf gas would be supplied from Bangura gas field in Comilla and the rest 10 mcf would come from national grid. As the Bangura gas field started production, Md Khan Ashraf, the BGSL head of marketing, gave a different picture. "We've got just seven mmcf gas from Bangura. That too is already finished." On the other hand, the rest 10 mcf gas from national grid is yet to be available. Businesses are paying the price. "Investors are getting frustrated over the government failure to supply gas," said Chittagong chamber president Saifuzzaman Chowdhury. bdnews24.com
