 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Wednesday deferred witness deposition in the MiG-29 case till Jan 7. The court framed charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and six others in the case on Aug 20. Dhaka divisional special judge Golam Mortuza Mojumdar gave the order Wednesday in the special courtroom sited within the Sangsad Bhaban complex. As the court sat Wednesday morning, lawyers of three of the accusedformer defence secretary Syed Yusuf Hossain, former defence joint secretary Mohammad Hossain Sherniabat and retired air commodore Mirza Akhtar Marufrequested more time. The lawyers asked the trial court to postpone the trial for four months, as case proceedings have already been stayed against Sheikh Hasina, and two co-accused former air force chief retired Air Vice Marshal Jamaluddin Ahmed and Unique Group proprietor Noor Ali. The court adjourned proceedings to Jan 7. Advocate Sahara Khatun represented the absent former prime minster in court. The now defunct anticorruption bureau filed the case on Dec 11, 2001. Seven, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, were accused of incurring state losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore through the purchase of eight MiG-29 combat planes. Charges were pressed against the seven on Jan 29, 2003, though the case later remained suspended for years as Hasina petitioned the High Court to quash the charges. Former army chief Mustafizur, the seventh accused, died on Aug 3 this year. Hasina, who is currently in the US seeking medical treatment on a temporary release order from the government, was exempted from personal appearance in the case in June. bdnews24.
