<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The Election Commission will not register any banned organisation in the guise of a new political entity, said a top election official on Tuesday. "We will not register a party that is based on the ideals of a banned party," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters. The newly floated Islamic Democratic Party (IDP), with members from the banned organisation Harkatul Jihad Al Islamic(Huji), applied to the election commission for registration on Monday. Replying to a question, Sakhawat said: "The commission will not do anything outside the legal system of the country." "But there is one problem: though a party is banned, its members cannot be restrained." On registration of the new party, he said: "The scrutiny committee will review the party constitution and papers for registration. After that, the Election Commisison will make the decision on registration," said the commissioner. "Field officials have been instructed to enquire about offices of parties where necessary." One hundred and seven parties applied to the EC for registration up to Monday's deadline. The EC has said it will complete the work of registration by Oct 30. "Established parties should have no trouble fulfilling the conditions for registartion, but new parties are under special scrutiny," said Sakhawat. "Their constitutions are being carefully studied." On the major parties heading for the election, he said: "There is no alternative to election for transition to democracy." Asked whether the two mainstream parties, Awami League and BNP, face any obstacles in getting registered, Sakhawat replied: "I will not be able to say at this moment. The scrutiny committee is looking into their applications." "If any small amendments are called for, the scrutiny committee will be in touch with them." He also hoped that the case on the re-demarcation of constituencies will be resolved by the end of the week. "The major problem facing the EC now is the legal wrangle over the redrawing of the constituencies." The gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary seats was issued on July 10, redrawing boundaries of 133 of the constituencies. The High Court stayed the effectiveness of the gazette on Aug 7, on a writ petition challenging the legality of the gazette. The petition and a counter-appeal by the EC have remained hanging in the upper court for two months. On whether the cases would delay the announcement of the election schedule by Nov 2, Sakhawat said: "We hope this issue of national importance will be heard soon. If the EC lawyers secure any verdict, we will take a quick decision and schedules will be announced on time". bdnews
