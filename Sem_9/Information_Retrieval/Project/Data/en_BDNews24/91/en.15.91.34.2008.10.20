<TEXT>
 New York, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  A first of its kind three-day Made in Bangladesh expo ended in New York Sunday, with participants disappointed at the poor response from foreign buyers. Fashion and textile houses taking part in the fair said interest from Bangladeshi expatriates was encouraging, although foreign buyers had been thin on the ground. "The buyers were mostly Bangladeshis. Only two Sri Lankan buyers visited our stall looking for information about our products," said Azima Rahman, the owner of Anzam Fashion. Over 30 Bangladeshi stalls made up the fair, with women and children's clothing attracting the most interest. The government's Export Promotion Bureau of Bangladesh stall remained virtually unvisited throughout the fair, said fellow stall owners. Bangladeshi private satellite station, Channel I, was the official sponsor of the event. Meanwhile, in Dhaka the annual three-day Rehab Housing Fair got underway Saturday at the Hotel Hilton. The event has been well attended, although organisers complain that sales have remained slow. A representative of the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh (Rehab) said that sales usually pick up on the last day of the fair. Alamgir Hossain, who attended the fair looking for new accommodation, said: "They are selling flats that went for Tk 45 lakh last year for Tk 85 lakh. I will not be buying this year." bdnews2
