 MADRID, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English opposition stands between AS Roma and Atletico Madrid and the two teams' hopes of erasing the memory of painful weekend league defeats when they return to Champions League action on Wednesday. Roma, who visit Chelsea, were thumped 4-0 at home by Inter Milan on Sunday, putting coach Luciano Spalletti's job on the line as they struggle to get their season off the ground. The Italian side are third in Group A after being upset in their opening, home game last month by newcomers CFR Cluj, who visit Girondins Bordeaux. Atletico face Liverpool after falling 2-1 at home to bitter city rivals Real Madrid on Saturday, a third consecutive league defeat, and coach Javier Aguirre could ease the pressure with an immediate reaction by his team at the Calderon. A win for either side would put them in a strong position in Group D with both having won their first two matches against PSV Eindhoven and Olympique Marseille. In Group B, Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan host surprise joint leaders Anorthosis Famagusta, while Werder Bremen visit winless Panathinaikos. In Group C, leaders Barcelona travel to bottom side Basel and Sporting Lisbon are away to Shakhtar Donets
