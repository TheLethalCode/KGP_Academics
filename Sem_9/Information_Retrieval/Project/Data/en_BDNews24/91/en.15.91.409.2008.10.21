 MUMBAI, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India were hopeful that skipper Anil Kumble would recover from a shoulder injury and named him in the squad on Monday for the final two tests against Australia. Leg-spinner Kumble missed the second test which concludes on Tuesday with the hosts on the verge of a big victory under the captaincy of Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Kumble's replacement Amit Mishra took five wickets on his debut in the match at Mohali where the tourists were 141 for five at stumps on day four after India set an improbable 516-run fourth innings victory target. The third test will be played at New Delhi from Oct 29 with the last match at Nagpur from Nov 6. These will also be former skipper Saurav Ganguly's last two tests after the left-hander announced at the start of the four-match series that he will retire at the end of it. The opening test ended in a draw at Bangalore. Squad: Anil Kumble (captain), Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Vangipurappu Laxman, Saurav Ganguly, Subramaniam Badrinath, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (wicketkeeper), Zaheer Khan, Munaf Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Rudra Pratap Singh, Ishant Sharma, Amit Mishr
