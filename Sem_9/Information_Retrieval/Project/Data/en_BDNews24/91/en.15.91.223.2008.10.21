 Dhaka, October 21 (bdnews24.com)-- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday called on the country's artists and cultural ambassadors to redouble their efforts to showcase the "glorious heritage of the East" in the face of increasing globalisation. "In these times of crunching competition and globalisation, human values and our rich legacy are facing a tough challenge," said Fakhruddin at the opening ceremony of the 13th Asian Fine Arts Biennale at the Osmani Auditorium. "Greater awareness is required so our culture may flourish and face its challenges," the CA said. The chief adviser stressed great art cannot be created in a cultural vacuum: "Windows should remain open so we can acquaint ourselves with developments in contemporary art." "We can then be enlightened, while others may appreciate our works and also benefit from them," he said. Fakhruddin said he hoped the exhibition would bring the participating nations into closer cultural dialogue, and promote mutual understanding among the people of Asia, Africa and the Pacific. The month-long exhibition will be held at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium, the National Museum and Shilpakala Academy. Nearly 200 Bangladeshi artists have contributed 234 pieces of art, while around 100 foreign artists have contributed a similar number. The exhibition will be open from 11am to 7pm every weekday, and 3pm to 8pm on Fridays, till Nov 19. bdnews24.com
