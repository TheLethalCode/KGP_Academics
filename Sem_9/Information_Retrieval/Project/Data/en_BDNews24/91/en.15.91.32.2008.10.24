 COLOMBO, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka have called up uncapped all-rounder Angelo Mathews for their tour of Zimbabwe in November. The 21-year-old was selected after a series of impressive performances with the 'A team' and will compete for a place in a new-look middle order after the selectors omitted Tillakaratne Dilshan and Chamara Silva. Veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya has been rested to make room for Upul Tharanga, who will open the batting with Mahela Udawatte having returned to form recently. Seamer Chaminda Vaas asked the selectors to be rested so that he could build up his fitness over the next two months ahead of a busy year of international cricket in 2009. Dammika Prasad was selected as his replacement. Wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara has been selected subject to him recovering fully from a recent finger operation. Sri Lanka are scheduled to play five ODIs against Zimbabwe in a tour starting on Nov. 10. Squad: Mahela Jayawardene (capt), Kumar Sangakkara (wk), Upul Tharanga, Mahela Udawatte, Chamara Kapugedera, Jehan Mubarak, Thilina Kandamby, Angelo Mathews, Farveez Maharoof, Thilan Thushara, Dammika Prasad, Dilhara Fernando, Nuwan Kulasekera, Muthiah Muralitharan, Ajantha Mendis
