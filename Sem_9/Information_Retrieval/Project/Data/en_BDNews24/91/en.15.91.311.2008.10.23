<TITLE> Atletico breathe sigh of relief after low key draw </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MADRID, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The game and the atmosphere did not live up to its billing but there was relief all round at Atletico Madrid after they earned a 1-1 draw at home to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday. The Primera Liga side came into the match having suffered three consecutive league defeats, the last at home to city rivals Real Madrid on Saturday, and with their coach Javier Aguirre starting to feel the heat. A timid opening period from Atletico gifted Liverpool complete dominance and Robbie Keane's 14th-minute opener. They improved after the break with the introduction of talismanic striker Sergio Agureo, and Simao Sabrosa grabbed the equaliser seven minutes from time. "It was important not to lose at home again," said Aguirre. "We'll have to see if this point is good for us in the future." Portuguese goalscorer Simao added: "Getting a draw is a good result because it comes after some games that weren't so good. This is going to give us confidence." The Madrid club were very much in the spotlight after the problems that marred their last Champions League home game  the 2-1 win against Olympique Marseille. On Oct 1, local police clashed with Marseille supporters in the stadium, and there were accusations of racist abuse from the Atletico fans directed at visiting players. Last week UEFA punished them with a two-match stadium ban, ordering them to play at a venue 300 km away from the capital, which was temporarily lifted for Wednesday's encounter after Liverpool complained that fans had already made travel arrangements. Spanish media reported a stronger police presence than at the Marseille match, but there was none of the tension that characterised the previous encounter. Although the Champions League anthem was whistled when the teams walked out, with some home fans turning their backs, there was little sign of animosity between the two groups of fans inside or outside the Calderon. Atletico president Enrique Cerezo told Canal Plus television afterwards: "There have not been any incidents because both sets of fans have behaved very well." Atletico and Liverpool continue to top Group D with seven points from three games. Atletico visit third-placed Villarreal in the Primera Liga on Sunday
