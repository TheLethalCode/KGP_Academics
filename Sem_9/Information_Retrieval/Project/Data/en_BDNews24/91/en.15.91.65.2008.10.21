<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League has called for the December elections to be held under the previous constituency boundaries if the re-demarcation issue is not settled in the upper court within a week. "There is less than two months left before the election, and the candidates do not yet know to which constituency they belong," AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after a meeting of the party presidium Tuesday evening. "Instead of killing more time over this issue, the re-demarcation cases have to be settled in the next one week. Otherwise the election has to be held keeping the old boundaries." He urged the Election Commission to see to it so that the issue does not become an obstacle to elections. Ashraf said the presidium meeting discussed which issues would be raised in the dialogue session with the government on Thursday. The talks are scheduled to start at 2.30pm on the day, said the party leader, adding that the invitation to the dialogue signed by the secretary to the chief adviser reached him Tuesday evening. He requested the government to be open to talks on any issue. He welcomed adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman's saying that the door of dialogue would remain open till the day before the election. AL would maintain its demands for unconditional release of party chief Sheikh Hasina, withdrawal of all cases against her and lifting of the state of emergency, Ashraf said. "Awami League will not participate in the election without Sheikh Hasina and such an election will not be acceptable." He hoped that if the government wanted a fair election it would not create any obstacle Hasina's contesting the polls. Expressing concern over her safety, he demanded the government ensure high security on Hasina's return. Ashraf also said "double standards" were applied to Chittagong mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury, who was not allowed to take up his official duties after being recently released on bail. He demanded that Mohiuddin be immediately allowed to resume his charge as mayor. Replying to a question on the change of name by Jamaat-e-Islami, and its recognition on the liberation war in its constitution, Ashraf said: "What's in a name. See what change comes in their activities." bdnew
