<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)The proposed Local Government Commission is expected to be running by the end of the month, the local government adviser said on Tuesday. "The commission will hopefully begin functioning from November 1st", Anwarul Iqbal told reporters at the local government ministry. "After vetting and approval by a secretaries' committee, a proposal for appointing the LGC chair and members has been forwarded to the president's office, through the chief adviser, for ultimate endorsement," said the local government adviser. "The issue of pay and allowances to be paid to the LGC chairman, members, officials and employees has also been settled after consultation with the finance ministry," he said. The Local Government Ordinance 2008 was passed in May, in a bid to shore up the local judicial system and deliver justice to people's doorsteps. Village courts, set up under the Gram Adalat Act 2006, and local arbitration councils, established under the Muslim Family Law Ordinance 1961, are expected to be strengthened and see qualitative changes through the setting up of the commission. bdnews
