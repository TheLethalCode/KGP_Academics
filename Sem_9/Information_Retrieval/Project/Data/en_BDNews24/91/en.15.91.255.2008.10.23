 BAGHDAD, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomb struck the convoy of Iraq's minister of labor on Thursday morning, killing nine people and wounding 10, police said. A spokesman for the ministry said the minister was unhurt. A Reuters television cameraman in the vicinity filmed the blast, but said an Iraqi soldier confiscated his videotape. The cameraman, about 150 meters (yards) away at the time of the explosion, saw a car slam into a convoy of six or seven four-wheel-drive vehicles and explode in a ball of flame near Tahrir square in central Baghdad. Police and bodyguards in the convoy opened fire after the blast. Several vehicles crashed and others sped away as chaos ensued
