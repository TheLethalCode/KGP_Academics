 LONDON, Oct 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news before the weekend's Premier League fixtures: Wayne Rooney will be looking to score the 100th club goal of his career when Manchester United visit his former club Everton on Saturday. Dimitar Berbatov has recovered from a minor hip injury sustained in United's Champions League win over Celtic on Tuesday while Cristiano Ronaldo is also fit after being taken off in that game with a blow to the knee. Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra return to the squad after missing the Celtic game through injury. Leaders Chelsea look to extend their unbeaten league run at home to 87 matches on Sunday when they host Liverpool who are behind Chelsea only on goal difference. Liverpool will again be without Fernando Torres, who has a hamstring injury, but they hope Robbie Keane will have recovered from a slight groin strain. Chelsea should have defender Ricardo Carvalho back in the centre of defence after he returned to action against Roma in midweek from a one-month injury lay-off. Defenders William Gallas and Kolo Toure are both available for Arsenal's London derby at West Ham United on Sunday. Toure has recovered from a shoulder injury while Gallas is fit after a hamstring strain kept him out of the Champions League win at Fenerbahce in midweek. Bacary Sagna (knee) is unlikely to play a part. Paraguayan Roque Santa Cruz is struggling to be fit for Blackburn Rovers' match against Middlesbrough on Saturday. The striker is still troubled by a hamstring injury. Rovers are also checking on the fitness of Christopher Samba who hurt himself when he collided with a post at Bolton last week. Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate could make several changes from the side thrashed 5-0 at home by Chelsea last week. Captain Emanuel Pogatetz is available after a three-match ban while striker Tuncay, Julio Arca and Justin Hoyte are all back in contention for a starting place. Third-placed Hull City have a virtual full-strength squad for their trip to West Bromwich Albion. "The body count we've got at the moment is frightening," manager Phil Brown told the club's website (www.hullcityafc.premiumtv.co.uk) Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor is a major doubt for his club's trip to Wigan Athletic on Sunday after being injured in the final minute of the UEFA Cup win against Ajax on Thursday. Agbonlahor is nursing cuts to both knees. Manchester City could be without defender Micah Richards for the home match against Stoke City on Sunday. Richards was taken off against Newcastle on Monday with an ankle injury and according to manager Mark Hughes it is still swollen. City are also without suspended Pablo Zabaleta and striker Darius Vassell is doubtful. Trinidad & Tobago striker Kenwyne Jones is in line for a return for Sunderland against north east rivals Newcastle United on Saturday. Jones has been out of action for nearly five months with a knee injury but played for the reserves in midweek. Newcastle are still without Michael Owen who has a groin strain
