 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka Monday showered lavish praises on his party chief Khaleda Zia and said the Dhaka city BNP will see a new committee soon. "It was Khaleda Zia who restored parliamentary democracy," said Khoka, president of the previous committee that Khandakar Delwar Hossain dissolved last June. "Chairperson Khaleda Zia will form the new committee soon in consultation with senior leaders as she has realised that the activities of the party came to a standstill in the capital," he told reporters at the Press Club. Khoka, branded as a "reformist" and known as the first voice to speak against party chief when the post 1/11 government began purging politicians, met Khaleda Zia twice after she came out of jail on Sept 11. The BNP chief was in detention when Delwar dissolved the Khoka-led Dhaka city committee. Abdus Salam, a deputy mayor when Gen Ershad ruled Bangladesh, was the general secretary of the committee. Khoka attended a meeting marking the seventh death anniversary of party vice president Afsar Uddin Siddiqui. "There is no democracy in the country now. An irregular government is running the country," Khoka said at the meeting. "People's sufferings have become acute because an unelected government has been in power for such a long time. "There is no alternative to election now." To restore democracy, he said, all political parties have to unite and bury "all mistrust and misunderstandings". "The main challenge for the parties is to restore democracy through election. Otherwise, the fate of the people will not change."
