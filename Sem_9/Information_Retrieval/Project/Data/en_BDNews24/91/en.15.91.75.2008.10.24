<TITLE> Oram loss a big blow, says Vettori </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The loss of injured all-rounder Jacob Oram will be keenly felt by New Zealand in the second test against Bangladesh, said skipper Daniel Vettori. Oram will fly home to undergo medical tests after persistent back injury ruled him out of the test, which starts in Dhaka on Saturday. "He is probably our most important player because of the role he offers being our third seamer and one of our best batsmen," Vettori said at a news conference on Friday. "Fortunately we do have good replacement in Grant Elliot. Obviously he hasn't got the experience of Jacob, (but) we still think he can come and do a pretty good job." Elliot stood in for Oram when he made his test debut against England in March. Oram suffered back pain while bowling on Sunday in the first test and was rested before Bangladesh were all-out for 242 in the second innings. New Zealand lead the series 1-0 after their three-wicket win in Chittagong on Tuesday
