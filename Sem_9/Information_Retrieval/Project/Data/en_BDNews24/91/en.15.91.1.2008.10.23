<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission asked Bangladesh Jatiya Party to reapply for registration as the party's previous application failed to prove fit. In an advertisement on Thursday, the EC asked the party to apply by Oct 26. In its application, the BNP ally said it won one constituency in the 2001 national polls. But the commission during its scrutiny process found that the BJP's candidate Naziur Rahman Manjur contested the polls with the paddy sheaf symbol of BNP. The EC in its advertisement said there was no scope to register BJP as a political party on the basis of that seat. The commission also issued two advertisements on completion of the registration process of Awami League and Bangladesh Samyabadi Dal. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters that the major parties had helped to make the registration process easier. "Awami League, BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Jatiya Party will get their registration certificates soon," he said. In the advertisements, the EC said it had finalised AL's registration with a boat symbol and Samyabadi Dal with a wheel symbol. If anybody has any complaint regarding the registration of these two parties, the EC has asked them to submit it by Oct 26. EC secretariat joint secretary Nurul Islam Khan, chief of the scrutiny committee for applications, said the registration of Jatiya Party and Workers Party of Bangladesh was also at the final stage. bdnews
