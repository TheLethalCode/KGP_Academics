<TEXT>
 Bangalore, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex is expected to extend losses to a third consecutive session on Friday after another sharp sell-off in Asian markets, with investors looking to the Reserve Bank of India's policy review for some comfort. The main BSE share index, among the worst performers in Asia this year, fell 3.92 percent to 9,771.70 on Thursday, its lowest close since June 15, 2006. Most valuable firm Reliance Industries topped forecasts with a 7.4 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by stronger than expected refining margins, and said new projects would start to deliver in coming quarters. "We will make a new low today as well because the Asian markets are really very bad," said independent consultant S.P. Tulsian. "Although not much is expected from the policy review, but hopefully it will give a sense of how difficult things are." A Reuters poll of analysts found the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was expected to hold key rates unchanged at Friday morning's review, although it may offer further explanation for the drastic easings of the past two weeks. Asian stocks fell on Friday as the global economic slowdown slashed earnings prospects for an array of companies, forcing investors to look to safer government bonds. At 0346 GMT, Japan's Nikkei was down 7.1 percent, Seoul was 6.6 percent lower and MSCI's measure of other Asia-Pacific stocks had fallen 4.6 percent. Nifty stock index futures traded in Singapore were down 3.8 percent, indicating a sharply lower open for local markets. The benchmark BSE index has lost 52 percent in 2008, with selling by foreigners a key factor in the fall. Foreign funds have sold a net $12.2 billion of shares in 2008, after buying a record $17.4 billion last year. STOCKS TO WATCH Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Steel, Hindustan Unilever, ITC, NTPC, Bharat Heavy Electricals are among companies reporting quarterly results. Alok Industries, after the textiles firm said its board would meet Oct 27 to consider a rights issue of shares.
