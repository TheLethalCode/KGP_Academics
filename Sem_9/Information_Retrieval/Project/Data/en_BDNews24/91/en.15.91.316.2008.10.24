 Sumon K Chakrabarti New Delhi, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Art labels, Europe's fad on wine bottles, have come to the sub-continent with the first-ever Bengali artist, from Kolkata, being commissioned for this exclusive art form. Sanjoy Ghosh has joined the ranks of Warhol, Picasso and Dali, who have adorned wine bottles with their artworks since 1945. Ghosh's art labels will adorn Vin'Opera's Italian Montalcinos, Barbera and Amarone Wines, each with a distinct label designed by Ghosh. Significantly, the Italian wine company has commissioned the artist to design labels of their bottles of newly brewed wines based on his actual paintings, which were also unveiled at an opening show in New Delhi. "I am yet to come to terms with the fact that my name is mentioned in the same paragraph with the legends like Picasso, Dali, Chagall. This seems so unreal, I don't know whether I will be able to believe this ever, at least not before my work is appreciated by the art connoisseurs of this continent," says Ghosh. Curator Meera Kakar, who brought art labels to India, feels that it is just the beginning, though. She is already talking about taking this international passion further than the drawing rooms of India, into the sub-continent. Critics feel that Ghosh has a unique vision of the world, he sees links where the others don't. "He has created something where before there was nothing  his art of the wine label will be connected to and energised by the wine inside the bottle," says Raj Kamal Jha, novelist and editor of an Indian newspaper. "His art labels will be more than a pretty label. It will be a coalescence of the arts, showcasing the artistry of the grower, the wine maker and the fine artist," he says. Ghosh is also considered to be a maverick, who had lost the use of his hands and feet to polio when he was five. Two years later he recovered only to find that his right arm was paralysed for ever. Disability was never a distraction though, because his works have been consistently described by critics as poignant and sensitive, reminiscent of greats like Ram Kinkar Baij and Gopal Ghosh, who hailed from Bengal. "His paintings are haunted by space, emotional and physical," says Kakar. France's famous vineyard Chateau Mouton Rothschild is the pioneer of art labels. In 1924, the Label became a trademark, the proof of origin, the guarantee of quality and the signature of the vineyard. The famous poster designer Jean Carlu was commissioned by Chateau Mouton Rothschild to design the label for its 1924 vintage. Today, the label remains one of the greatest examples of Cubist influence in commercial art. With the liberation of France, to celebrate the return of peace and to mark a new beginning, Baron Phillipe conceived the idea of dedicating the Vintage 1945 to the Year of Victory. He commissioned a young painter, Phillipe Jllian, to produce a graphic design based on the 'V' sign made famous by Winston Churchill during the war. And from 1946, a contemporary artist was commissioned every year to create an original work to illustrate the label. bd
