 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) - With all sides wanting to reach consensus on pressing pre-election issues, the government is set to sit again in dialogue with BNP and Awami League on Thursday. The chief adviser is set to sit with the Awami League at 2.30pm. The BNP dialogue will be held at 6.30pm, adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters Wednesday following a two-hour meeting with BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at her Dhaka Cantonment home. Five caretaker government advisers met with former prime minister Khaleda Zia at her private residence on Wednesday, from 7.30pm. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain and joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan were also present at the meeting. The government's previous talks with BNP took place on Oct 14, finally rounding off the 'first-round' of dialogue with political that began in May. Both sides, BNP and the government, conceded their last dialogue had ended inconclusively. Awami League, meanwhile, has said the party needed to address both pre- and post-election issues in a second round dialogue. Adviser Hossain Zillur had announced Monday that the government would hold another round of talks with Awami League and BNP by Oct 23 (Thursday). "We're not being 'bureaucratic', we are only trying to progress systematically, by holding consultations, towards a free and fair election, fulfilling people's hopes for quality democracy," the adviser had said. He said the dialogues with AL and BNP would be centred around the election environment and qualitative upliftment of the country's politics. bdnew
