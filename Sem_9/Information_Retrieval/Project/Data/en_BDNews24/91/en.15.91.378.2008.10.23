 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)US oil company Chevron will start fresh oil and gas explorations in the south of Bangladesh from next year, a special aide has said. At present 35 percent of gas production in the country comes from gas fields run by the global oil giant. The company will begin its new explorations in the southern Block No 7, M Tamim the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of energy and mineral resources, told bdnews24.com Thursday. Energy officials said Chevron had earlier carried out survey work in the block. It is now ready to conduct two-dimensional seismic surveys. Chevron presented a report on Thursday to the energy ministry on their proposed activities and conditions of two of its operational gas fields, Tamim said. The company had been asked to provide more information on the state of the Bibiana and Jalalabad gas fields. Chevron currently extracts gas from Bibiana, Jalalabad and Moulvibazar gas fieldson average 50 million cubic feet (mmcf) from Bibiana every day, 167 mmcf from Jalalabad and 73 mmcf from Moulvibazar. Areas of Barisal, Patuakhali, Jhalkathi, Barguna and Perojpur districts fall under Block No 7. Chevron completed an initial seismic survey for oil and gas exploration in this coastal block in 2006, having signed a production sharing contract with Petrobangla in 2000. Chevron has so far invested more than $900 million for oil and gas exploration in Bangladesh, of which $100 million was spent in 2007. bdnews
