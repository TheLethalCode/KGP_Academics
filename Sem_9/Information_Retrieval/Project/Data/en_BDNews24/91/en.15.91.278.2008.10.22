Eight hospitals in Tokyo refused to take in the 36-year-old woman earlier this month, citing reasons such as not having enough doctors, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said on Wednesday. An hour later, one hospital agreed to take her and carried out a Caesarean section and an operation on her brain. But the woman died three days later, Tokyo said. "This is a big problem," Chief Cabinet Secretary Takeo Kawamura told a news conference. "We need to know why this happened, find out the reasons, and take the necessary steps to prevent it from happening again," he said.
