<TEXT>
 VILLARREAL, Spain, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Substitute Joseba Llorente came off the bench to score a hat-trick and help Villarreal see off the stubborn challenge of Aab Aalborg 6-3 in Champions League Group E on Tuesday. The Danes started brightly and struck first when Marek Saganowski headed their first goal of the competition. The home side reacted well with Giuseppe Rossi and then Joan Capdevila netting within five minutes of each other, but the sides went in 2-2 at halftime after Thomas Enevoldsen levelled. Llorente came on for the second half and scored twice in three minutes to put the 2006 semi-finalists in command, but Andreas Johansson pulled one back, and it required late goals from Robert Pires and Llorente again to seal the victory.ADVERTISEMENT "We suffered a lot. These games against supposedly inferior sides are always tough," Llorente told Canal Plus television. "We didn't play well in the first half but were much improved in the second." Villarreal did not settle early on as the Danish champions hustled them and disrupted their rhythm. The visitors took full advantage in the 19th minute when Anders Due's cross found Saganowski arriving completely unmarked to power a diving header past Diego Lopez. Last season's Primera Liga runners up responded when Angel Lopez broke down the right and crossed for Italian striker Rossi, whose first-time shot deflected off a defender and over Karim Zaza. Almost immediately Villarreal were in front when Spain left back Capdevila, using his less-favoured right foot, volleyed a superb shot in off the far post from the edge of the area. But again Villarreal's defence was found wanting as Aalborg carved them open with a flowing move in the 36th. Saganowski laid off a long ball for Danish Under 21 international Enevoldsen who raced through to calmly lift the ball over the advancing Lopez. Villarreal coach Manuel Pellegrini had cut an agitated figure on the touchline but shuffled his side well after the break as they stepped up a gear. The introduction of Llorente and then Frenchman Pires proved decisive. In the 67th minute Marcos Senna's long-distance effort was spilled by Zaza and Llorente pounced to score. Soon after Pires broke clear and squared for Llorente to tap in, only for Aalborg to pull another goal back in the 77th. Johansson rose to head a freekick in at the nearpost. exposing the home side's weakness in the air again. Pires grabbed the fifth in the 79th heading in from close range after Zaza had parried Santi Cazorla's shot, and Llorente completed his hat-trick five minutes later volleying home from Capdevila's cross. "Although we conceded more goals than usual, we showed we could turn it round. Overall I was pleased with our reaction in attack," said Pellegrini. "It's a big step forward for us towards qualifying." The Spanish club are on seven points in Group E, second on goal difference behind Manchester Unite
