 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Police detained a murder suspect in Segunbagicha Thursday after he was caught carrying the severed head of a woman and hollering wildly in the street. Shabagh police chief Rezaul Islam told bdnews24.com the suspect, Amin, may be deranged. "It cannot be substantiated before the investigation is through. We need to quiz him." Islam said: "Amin's mother, Rokeya rents a three-room flat on the second floor of a house situated in Segunbagicha and let out one room to a woman named Tuli about two months back." "Amin, who had quarrelled with his wife and not returned home for two, three days, turned up around 8am Thursday morning looking for his wife. He was carrying a bonti (sharp-edged kitchen appliance)," said the policeman. "Failing to find his wife, the enraged Amin entered Tuli's room as she was breakfasting and severed her head with a blow of the bonti ." Rokeya was also injured as she tried to stop her son, the police chief said. Holding Tuli's head, Amin emerged onto the street, yelling: "I've killed my wife, I've killed my wife." Locals immediately informed the police, who arrived to arrest him. Amin started up a betel leaf shop, after returning to Bangladesh about a year ago from labouring abroad, said locals. But his shop has been shut for months, they said. His mother Rokeya cooks and supplies meals to offices. bdnews24.com/
