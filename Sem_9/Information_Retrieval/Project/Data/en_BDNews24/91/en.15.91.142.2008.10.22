 TURIN, Italy, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Juventus can reignite their season thanks to Tuesday's 2-1 win over Real Madrid in the Champions League, captain Alessandro Del Piero has said.

"We hope this is the first step towards further wins," Del Piero told reporters. "I am really happy because they allowed us to play a certain type of game in a difficult moment for the team.

The 33-year-old, the only Juve starter who played against Real the last time they met in the Champions League in 2005, opened the scoring with a superb strike on five minutes before Amauri extended the home side's lead just after halftime. Ruud van Nistelrooy headed in for the visitors midway through the second period but generally the Spanish champions were well below par. Coach Bernd Schuster was not overly alarmed and targeted their next European match at home to Juve on Nov. 5. "The most important thing is that Real finish top of the group," he said. Juve, back in the Champions League for the first time since their Serie A demotion in 2006 for match-fixing, top the group on seven points from three games with Real one point behind.
