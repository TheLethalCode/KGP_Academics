 MOHALI, India, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's Harbhajan Singh struck twice in his first over to derail Australia's hopes of saving the second test on Monday, the off spinner reducing the tourists to 50 for two at tea on the fourth day. Introduced in the last over before the interval, Harbhajan removed opener Matthew Hayden (29) leg before with his second delivery and fellow left-hander Simon Katich (20) four balls later. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting was on one at the interval and he will be joined by Michael Hussey when play resumes with the tourists looking unlikely to get anywhere near the 516 runs India set them for victory. Despite the daunting task ahead of them, Australia's openers started positively and hit a flurry of boundaries until Harbhajan trapped Hayden in front with a delivery that pitched on off-stump and held its line. Katich then cut uppishly and Sachin Tendulkar took a superb diving catch at backward point. India set Australia the massive target after they declared their second innings closed midway through the afternoon session. Led by opener Gautam Gambhir's 104, India raced to 314-3 before stand-in skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni opted to end the innings one hour after lunch. LITTLE SUCCESS Indian bowlers, who helped forge a 201-run first innings lead after dismissing Australia for 268, have four-more sessions to try and seize a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. Dhoni, who shuffled the batting order to keep the scoreboard moving, scored a breezy 68 not out after making 92 in the first innings. Australia's bowlers toiled with little success on a dry and slow Mohali pitch where India scored 130 runs from 26 overs in the first session. Left-hander Gambhir, who made his second test century, and fellow Delhi batsman Virender Sehwag piled on 182 runs for the opening wicket after India had resumed on their overnight 100-0. Sehwag was dismissed for 90, edging paceman Peter Siddle to wicketkeeper Brad Haddin to miss out on a 16th test hundred on his 30th birthday. The aggressive opener, who survived a caught behind appeal on 88, hit eight fours from 122 balls in three hours. Gambhir hit seven fours and one six facing 138 balls as both openers fell before lunch chasing quick runs. Australian skipper Ricky Ponting spread out the field but could not really stem the flow of runs. Brett Lee, who has been below his best in the series and needed two stitches on an injury to his right hand, removed Saurav Ganguly for 27 in his only spell of the day. On Sunday, all rounder Shane Watson (78) and Mike Hussey (54) helped Australia score 268 as leg spinner Amit Mishra claimed 5-71 on debut to help India take a 201-run first innings lea
