<TITLE> Indonesia court rejects Bali bombers appeal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Indonesian court rejected on Tuesday an appeal by three Islamic militants on death row for the 2002 Bali bombings challenging the country's method of executing convicts by firing squad. The three men -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi and Mukhlas, also known as Ali Ghufron -- lodged the legal challenge in August, saying execution by firing squad was inhumane. The head of the constitutional court in Jakarta rejected their appeal, saying there is no method of execution that is painless. "The pain death convicts endure is a logical consequence inherent in a death process ... so it is not categorized as torture," said Constitutional Court chief Mohammad Mahfud. The lawyers of the bombers had argued that beheading, their clients' preferred way of execution, or lethal injection were less painful. Attorney General Hendarman Supandji has said he will announce the execution time for the three on Friday, a move seen as breaking tradition because in the past the government has never announced dates of execution. A Bali court initially sentenced the three men to death in 2003, but their lawyers have used a number of legal avenues that have delayed the executions. Some critics say their execution would cause just a minor ripple in the most populous Muslim country, but others say there is a growing fear of a hardline backlash because of the execution. b
