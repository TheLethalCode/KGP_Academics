 ROME, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Injury-hit Juventus are hoping Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi can recover from a leg muscle problem to help them build on their Champions League win over Real Madrid in Saturday's derby against Torino (1830 GMT). The 2-1 triumph on Tuesday ended a five-match winless run for Juventus, who are seven points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan in 12th place, and gave under-fire coach Claudio Ranieri some breathing room. However, the heat will be straight back on if Juve suffer a third consecutive league defeat this weekend and fitness problems are complicating his bid to turn things around. Claudio Marchisio will be out for almost four weeks after hurting his ankle against the Spanish champions. The midfielder joins a long injury list that includes goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, striker David Trezeguet and midfielder Christian Poulsen. Camoranesi, who has been out since a 2-1 defeat to Palermo at the start of the month, trained with his team mates on Wednesday and might be fit the Torino match, the club said on their website (www.juventus.com). PRESSURE The pressure is also on Ranieri's counterpart Gianni De Biasi as Torino have lost their last three games and have not tasted victory since beating Lecce 3-0 on the opening day. Former Italy boss Roberto Donadoni will be among the candidates to replace De Biasi if the poor form continues, according to media reports. Torino will be without first-choice goalkeeper Matteo Sereni, who suffered an ankle knock in training on Wednesday, and suspended defender Francesco Pratali. Champions Inter entertain Genoa in fine fettle after thrashing last-year's runners-up AS Roma 4-0 last weekend and beating Cypriots Anorthosis Famagusta on Wednesday to go clear at the top of Champions League Group B. AC Milan, who are three points behind Inter in sixth, visit Atalanta in Bergamo amid growing excitement at David Beckham's possible loan move from Los Angeles Galaxy. Struggling Roma, nine points off the pace in 14th, face a tough trip to Udinese, who have 14 points from seven games. Udinese share second place with Napoli, who visit Lazio, and Catania, who take on Siena on Saturday (1600)
