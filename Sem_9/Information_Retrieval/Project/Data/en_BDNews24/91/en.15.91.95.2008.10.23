<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex fell to its lowest since June 2006 on Thursday as a global rout of equities raised worries of further foreign investor selling, before some bargain hunting helped the market regain some composure. Leading private sector firm Reliance Industries, which reports quarterly results after market hours, was down 3.9 percent at 1,264.70, having earlier fallen as much as 6.4 percent to its lowest since Dec. 2006. The company is forecast to report a modest 2.2 percent rise in net profit on slimmer refining margins. Asian stocks dropped to a four-year low for a second day on Thursday, with exporters especially hard hit, on growing fears that a severe global downturn would depress corporate earnings further. Emerging markets were hit the hardest. "We have been breaching lows every day, so there is no conviction. There have been bargain days when we have suggested our clients to buy, but there has to be many occasions like that" said Neeraj Dewan, director at Quantum Securities in New Delhi. "Valuations are attractive, still people are not committing enough funds. There are views that our growth will slow down in the short term, though medium term would be ok, but people are more concerned about the short term." The 30-share BSE index opened down 4.8 percent and fell as far as 9,682.40, but by 10:59 a.m. had pared its losses to be down 2.07 percent 9,959.83. The index is down by more than half in 2008, with foreigners selling a net of $12.2 billion in stocks so far this year, largely reversing 2007's record net buying of $17.4 billion. Banking stocks were battered again with ICICI falling nearly 6 percent. State Bank of India was down 1.8 percent and HDFC Bank lost 2.8 percent. Metal stocks extended falls on falling prices and concerns that a global recession would slacken demand. Tata Steel, the world's sixth-larget steel maker, was down 7.5 percent and aluminium maker Hindalco fell 8.2 percent. Both are trading at multi-year lows. Software exporters fell after sector leader Tata Consultancy and No. 3 Wipro both missed quarterly profit expectations and joined their rivals in giving cautious outlooks. TCS fell 2 percent, while Wipro was down 2.5 percent. In the broader market, losers outpaced gainers almost 4:1 on volume of 43.2 million shares. The 50-share NSE index was down 2.13 percent at 2,999.75. STOCKS ON THE MOVE State-run power equipment maker Bharat Heavy Electricals was up 1.9 percent at 1,160.20 rupees. The company said on Thursday it had won a $295 million contract from state-run NTPC Ltd. No. 5 mobile operator Idea Cellular extended losses to a third day after disappointing quarterly results. The stock was down 9 percent at 43.25 rupees and has fallen almost 69 percent in 2008.
