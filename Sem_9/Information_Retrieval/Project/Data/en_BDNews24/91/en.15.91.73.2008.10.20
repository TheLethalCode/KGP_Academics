 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh Railway has said they are keen to resurrect long dormant plans to link Barisal to the national rail network. BR initially sought to connect the divisional headquarter to the railway in the 1970s, although the partially implemented project was finally dropped in the 1990s due to a lack of political will. According to a recent BR assessment, the 110 kilometre project connecting Panchuria in Rajbari with Barisal would cost around Tk 550 crore. The proposed line would link-up to the existing network at Panchuria, passing through Faridpur and Pukuria, before terminating in Barisal city. "A few months ago we finished an assessment on a project to connect Barisal with the railway network," BR director general Md Belayet Hossain told bdnews24.com Sunday. Hossain said he will now send the proposal to the planning commission via the ministry of communications to decide the fate of the project. According to the draft of the study, Tk 87.5 crore will be required to restore 25-kilometres of the abandoned Panchuria-Faridpur line. The government will also have to spend around Tk 100 crore to revive 25-kilometres of unused rail track between Faridpur and Pukuria. BR will require a further Tk 360 crore to construct 60-kilometres of new line from Pukuria to Barisal, the assessment said. "We will have to carry out another feasibility study on the project as land use patterns in the area have changed," TA Chowdhury, an additional director general of BR told bdnews24.com. "The project will take at least five years to complete," he added. In 1978 the government of the day handed over land for the Faridpur-Talma section of the line to BR, as a preliminary move to bring Barisal under the railway network. Then, in 1980, the Talma-Pukuria rail link was completed. Work was also started on the Pukuria-Bhanga line, although the government pulled the plug on the Faridpur-Pukuria service in 1990. Finally, in 1993-94, the government ordered BR to remove all rail track and bridge girders on the Fairdpur-Pukuria line. bdn
