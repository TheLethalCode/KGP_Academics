 ROME, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo backed himself to win the 2008 Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards after inspiring Manchester United to the Champions League and Premier League double last season. "Sincerely, yes I'm confident," the Portugal winger and favourite to win the honour said in an interview in Friday's La Gazzetta dello Sport. "If you assess what I did over the course of the season, I think I did more than everyone. What else should I have done to win the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA award." The 23-year-old, who scored 42 goals for United in their double season, described his "torture" at having to play through an ankle injury before having surgery after Euro 2008. "At times it was like having a knife in my ankle," said the holder of Europe's Golden Boot award. "I gritted my teeth. I don't regret it. It was worth it. It was torture, also psychologically." Ronaldo is on a 30-man shortlist for the 2008 Ballon d'Or, formerly known as the European Footballer of the Year award, and faces competition from the likes of Liverpool striker Fernando Torres and United team mate Wayne Rooney. The prize will be awarded on Dec. 2 by 96 journalists from all over the world following a poll organised by French magazine France Football
