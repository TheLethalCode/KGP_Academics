 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)Upazila polls date aside, the government and the BNP have reached "agreement" on all other points raised by the former ruling party, both sides said Thursday after a second round of talks. Both BNP secretary general Khandoker Delwar Hossain and adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, who spoke in a joint briefing after more than two hours of dialogue, sounded upbeat about its outcome. "There was agreement on six of the BNP's seven demands. There will be more talks on deferring the upazila polls date," the adviser said. "The government has accepted in principle six of our demands. They will discuss the upazila date again," said Delwar. "We hope the government will live up to its promises. We have noted a positive government attitude." The talks, at the office of the chief adviser who led the government side along with five other advisers, began at 6:30pm and ended at 8.45pm. "Withdrawal of emergency, re-demarcation of constituencies, and prevention of abuse of power in the conduct of elections, are issues that we think need to be dealt with urgently," said Hossain Zillur. He said EPR rules will be relaxed in phases as early as possible. "Emergency is not a matter the government is inflexible about. This issue is being looked into as a priority to create an atmosphere for polls. "One of the BNP demandsdemarcationis being disposed of in the court. "We are working towards a solution so that there is not obstruction to (holding polls on) Dec 18." Hossain Zillur also mentioned that the government had decided to accord the highest state security to Khaleda Zia, along with Sheikh Hasina, during the election period. Delwar repeated the BNP demand that emergency be withdrawn fully ahead of polls. "BNP is all for participating in elections. But that election has to be free, neutral and fair. "In order to achieve that, our seven demands must be met." On May 30 and Nov 7 being restored as national days, the adviser said: "A solution can be reached through discussions between the two big parties." A key four-party demand in dialogue has been to restore May 30, the day BNP founder General Ziaur Rahman was killed in 1981, as a public holiday and national mourning day. They also insist that "the historic 7th of November", observed by BNP and allies as 'National Solidarity Day', be declared such for the nation. Delwar led a strong BNP delegation of standing committee members, vice presidents and joint secretary generals. The government's previous talks with BNP took place on Oct 14, ending the 'first-round' of dialogues with political parties that began in May. Both sides, BNP and the government conceded their previous dialogue had ended inconclusively. BNP's seven-point charter included unconditional release of party chief Khaleda Zia and other leaders, lifting of emergency, deferring upazila polls, amending electoral laws, holding polls under previous demarcated constituencies and an election friendly environment. bdnews24.com
