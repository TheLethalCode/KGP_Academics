<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  A captain-knock fifty from Daniel Vettori powered New Zealand to a historic three-wicket win over Bangladesh in the two-match Test series opener in Chittagong on Tuesday. The visitors, chasing a winning target of 317, reached home on the fifth and final day to take a 1-0 lead in the series with the second and final match to be held from Oct 25 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka. Man of the match Vettori followed his nine-wicket haul along with first innings 55 not out to strike 76 in the second innings to steer New Zealand home at the Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. With the triumph, the Kiwis set a history outside their home ground to win a match chasing over 300 runs though they had earlier never overhauled over 200 runs on foreign soil. Their last such win was against Australia in Perth in 1985-86 when they chased down 164 runs. Besides, the visitors broke their previous fourth innings best of 177 against Pakistan. Bangladesh have only one Test win against Zimbabwe in 53 matches. The scoreboard might have told the match was close, but the fact that New Zealand were always upper hand throughout the day after opener Aaron Redmond struck his maiden Test half century on the fourth day Monday to keep the visitors in match. New Zealand, having resumed the day on 145 for two, added required 172 runs for the loss of five wickets to finish on 317 for seven as Vettori, who came in as nightwatchman and remained unbeaten on nought, played a sensible innings to lead from the fort after the falls of Redmond and Ross Talyor. Vettor, who was promoted to bat at number four from eight following his first innings 55 not out, gradually took the momentum away from the hosts as he took 38 singles in his 214-ball knock. Bangladesh picked up two quick wickets Vettori and Daniel Flynn after the tea break, but it was too later for the visitors as New Zealand by then were just in sight of win. Vettori fell to left-arm spinner Razzak with the Black Caps needing just 19 runs while Flynn was caught by Nayeem Islam off Shakib Al Hasan for 49 off 126, leaving the score on level, and Kyle Mills hit the winning run to relief the Kiwis. The Kiwi skipper put on 82 runs for the sixth wicket with Flynn before adding 40 runs for the third wicket with overnight Redmond, who scored a 237-ball 79 runs. The Kiwis lost two wickets Aaron and Ross Taylor (9) in the first session and in the next session lost Brendon McCullum (2), but it didn't hold them back from scoring runs on the mysterious behaved-pitch. The match virtually slipped from Bangladesh's grip on the fourth day when Redmond, Jamie How and Jesse Ryder defied the Bangladeshi bowlers to take New Zealand comparatively to a safe position before the fourth day's close. Razzak grabbed three for 93 while Shakib took two for 80 in the second innings to finish nine for 126 in the match. bd
