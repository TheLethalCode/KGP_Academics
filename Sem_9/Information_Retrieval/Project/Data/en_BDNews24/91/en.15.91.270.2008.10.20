 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - The Anticorruption Commission has discovered extensive corruption in the works of Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited Khulna region, the top antigraft official said on Monday. ACC director general (administration) colonel Hanif Iqbal said in a regular briefing that misappropriation of money in recent years, by the then state-run BTTB, had been discovered mainly involving fake job and recruitment orders on public works. In one incident, 122 workers were shown employed to set up a single toilet pan, he said. Concerned officials drew wages for 122 workers during the work. Iqbal cited another instance in which the telecoms department showed a voucher for 100 workers' wages for repairs of electricity lines, though no work was done. The antigraft boss mentioned that the ACC sent a list of 116 people convicted in 100 cases filed by the commission to the national coordination committee on serious crimes. bd
