 TOKYO, Wed Oct 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan and India agreed on Wednesday to expand defence cooperation but said the move, along with a push to boost economic ties, was not aimed at counterbalancing China. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on a three-day visit to Tokyo, also said he hoped to strengthen cooperation in nuclear energy with Japan after his country signed a civil nuclear technology deal with the United States earlier this month. "Economic partnership and security cooperation between India and Japan are not at the cost of any third country, least upon China," Singh told a joint news conference with his Japanese counterpart, Taro Aso. "I sincerely believe that there is no competition between India and China. The world offers enormous hope for both our countries to realise their development ambitions." In a joint statement, both sides agreed on a framework to strengthen security ties, with cooperation to include exchanging information on regional affairs, fighting terrorism and managing disasters. Specific measures would be worked out at an early date. India and Japan carried out military exercises last year along with Australia and the United States, and Tokyo has been eager to boost diplomatic ties with democracies in the region in a move some analysts see as aiming to isolate China. Japan signed a ground-breaking defence pact with Australia last year, the first such agreement with a country other than the United States. But India has resisted being drawn into any strategies to contain China, while Aso, although known as a nationalist, has also tried to warm long-chilled relations with Beijing, stressing economic ties. "This is not aimed at, or meant to target China," Aso told the news conference on the security framework with India. TRADE DEAL Both leaders said business ties were key for Japan and India, but an expected trade deal was put on hold, with talks since January 2007 bogged down by issues such as tariffs on Japanese car parts and tough checks on Indian pharmaceutical goods. Both said they hoped for an early agreement, however, with a deal to include a free trade accord between Asia's biggest and third-biggest economies. "This will broaden our trade basket and enhance reciprocal investments," Singh told an earlier gathering of business leaders from both countries. Trade and investment between the two economies have been unspectacular as Japanese companies have focused on China and Southeast Asia. Bilateral trade in 2007 was about $12 billion, not much more than 4 percent of Japan's trade with China, but both sides are aiming to raise the figure to $20 billion by 2010. Japanese companies have also been keen for a slice of India's nuclear energy market, estimated to be worth around $27 billion over the next 15 years after India and the United States signed a civil nuclear technology deal. But on any possible civil nuclear cooperation with Japan, Aso said only that Japan wanted India to continue a moratorium on nuclear tests. "I do recognise the sensitivity of this issue in Japan and therefore, I mentioned to ... the prime minister that we will move at a pace at which the Japanese government and people are comfortable with," Singh told the joint news conference. Critics in Japan, the only country to suffer an atomic bombing, have argued that the India-US deal undermines efforts to stem nuclear proliferation by allowing India to pursue nuclear energy use despite its refusal to sign non-proliferation pacts
