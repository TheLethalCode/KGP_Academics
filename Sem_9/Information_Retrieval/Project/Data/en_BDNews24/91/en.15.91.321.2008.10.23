 Dhaka, October 23 (bdnews24.com)A three-hour second round dialogue between the government and Awami League ended at the Chief Adviser's Office Thursday at 5:30 pm, a senior official told bdnews24.com. The government team, led by the chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, included communication adviser Ghulam Quader, law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, education and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman and foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. The AL delegation, headed by its acting president Zillur Rahman, included presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, TofailAhmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and acting secretary general Syed Ashraful Islam. Ashraful told reporters earlier in the week that this round of the dialogue will focus on lifting emergency, Sheikh Hasina's permanent release, shifting upazila polls, sticking to the declared election dates and creating a proper election environment. AL had its first round of talks with the government on July 3, when it raised Hasina's permanent release, cancelling all cases filed against the former prime minister and other leaders and lifting emergency. Prior to the first round of dialogue, the government held two rounds of pre-dialogue talks with AL and other political parties. On June 11, after Hasina's temporary release from special jail, four advisers met her at her Sudha Sadan residence while the chief adviser spoke by phone during the meeting. The government is also set to sit in dialogue with BNP Thursday at 6.30pm in the second round of talks. The government began its first-round dialogue with 18 political parties in May. bdnews24.com/e
