 MUMBAI, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police in the western Indian state of Maharashtra have arrested the head of a local right-wing party after attacks on north Indian migrants, sparking protests around the state capital Mumbai. Raj Thackeray, who heads the small but vocal Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), was arrested earlier Tuesday in Ratnagiri, a police spokesman said, and was being brought to Mumbai, India's financial hub. MNS supporters had attacked north Indian railway job aspirants in the city Sunday. They want more jobs for locals in the state, and have protested the presence of north Indian migrants who come to the state in search of work. Thackeray's supporters were following the police convoy to Mumbai, TV channels reported. There were also reports of attacks on taxis in Mumbai and at toll booths in the suburbs, and a heavy police presence on the streets and in train stations. The police spokesman said everything was "under control." There have been growing calls for checking MNS, which has previously attacked migrant taxi drivers as well as workers in construction and manufacturing sites in the state, driving many away and causing delays to projects. Thackeray, who was briefly arrested in February for inciting violence against migrant workers, formed MNS in 2005 after splitting from Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party headed by his uncle, the controversial Bal Thackeray. Shiv Sena, best-known for its anti-immigrant rhetoric, believes Mumbai belongs to the Hindu Marathi community, but it has been less millitant recently than the MNS. Recently, MNS was reprimanded by a city court for forcing shops to display signs in the local Marathi language. Monday, the state parliament was adjourned after noisy protests by members calling for the arrest of Thackeray. Maharashtra has long been a magnet for migrants from other states, including Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two of India's poorest states. Less than half of Mumbai's 17 million residents are from the state
