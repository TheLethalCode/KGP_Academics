 MADRID, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Simao Sabrosa scored a late equaliser to cancel out Robbie Keane's first-half strike as Atletico Madrid and Liverpool shared an entertaining 1-1 draw in their Champions League Group D match on Wednesday. Liverpool dominated the early stages and Keane gave them the lead on 14 minutes when he ran on to Steven Gerrard's sidefooted through ball and slotted calmly past Leo Franco advancing from the Atletico goal. The Liverpool striker, who looked offside for the goal on television replays, should have scored again shortly after, but only managed minimal contact on Gerrard's fine cross from the right after a swift Liverpool break. With playmaker Sergio Aguero on the bench in the first period, Atletico were short of ideas and were hampered by a solid Liverpool midfield marshalled by Gerrard, Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano.

TV replays suggested it should have counted. LOST POINTS Atletico eventually found an equaliser in the 83rd minute. Forlan's pass found Simao in space inside the box and this time his powerful strike beat Reina low to his left. With three matches played, Liverpool and Atletico remain in control of the group on seven points each, PSV Eindhoven have three and Olympique Marseille none. Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez said his side had controlled the match in the first half but had let things slip for periods of the second. "If you had said before the game that we would have seven points after three matches I would have said good," Madrid native Benitez said at a news conference. "But after we were leading after 83 minutes I would say we lost two points," he added. His counterpart at Atletico, Javier Aguirre, has been under pressure after three straight losses in the Primera Liga and said he hoped the draw would give his side a boost. "In the second half we were much more mobile and were able to create more chances," he said at a news conference. "It was important not to lose at home again
