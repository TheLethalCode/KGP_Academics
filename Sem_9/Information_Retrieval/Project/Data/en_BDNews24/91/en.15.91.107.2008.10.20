<TITLE> Redmond keeps Kiwis in match </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  A maiden fifty from Aaron Redmond kept New Zealand in the running at the close of the fourth-day of the two-match Test series opener against Bangladesh in Chittagong on Monday. New Zealand trailed by 172 runs to make 145 for two in 64 overs at stumps in the second innings, after the hosts set them a target of 317 in five sessions. Opener Redmond was on an unbeaten 62, with skipper Daniel Vettori yet to open his account when the bails were drawn for day-4 at the Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. The dismissal of Jesse Ryder just before the close put the match in the balance, with the hosts requiring eight wickets and New Zealand needing 172 runs to win on the final day. If the Kiwis succeed in their mission it would mark their first win in a match outside New Zealand while chasing over 200 runs. The Black Caps last such win was against Australia in Perth in 1985-86, when they chased down 164 runs. New Zealand's fourth innings best in the sub-continent currently stands at 177 all-out against Pakistan in 1990, when they lost the match by 66 runs, this time they are set to break their sub-continental best requiring just 33 runs. It was not that the Bangladeshi bowlers struggled to find their lines and lengths that allowed the visitors to capitalise. Rather the visitors' batsmen kept their nerve, and were willing to wait for loose balls and punished those that came their way. Redmond, playing his fourth Test, kept a cool head, putting on 55 runs for the opening wicket with Jamie How, who made a 82-ball 36, smashing one six and five fours. Abdur Razzak knocked Jamie How's off stump to give Bangladesh their first breakthrough. However, Redmond and Ryder, who played each ball on merit, frustrated the home side, putting on 90 runs for the second wicket before the debutant Ryder was run-out by a Mashrafee Bin Mortaza direct throw from the thirdman area just before the close. The 29-year-old Redmond struck pacer Shahadat Hossain for two successive fours to bring up his maiden Test fifty off 135 balls, striking eight boundaries in his 192-ball knock. The Tigers, having earlier resumed the day on 184 for eight, added another 58 runs to finish on 242 in the second innings. This marked the fifth time Bangladesh surpassed 200 runs in both innings, previously achieving the feat against Pakistan, England, Australia and Sri Lanka. Overnight batsmen Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Abdur Razzak put on a quick 40 for the eighth wicket, before Razzak was caught by Ross Taylor off Iain O'Brien for a 45-ball 18. Mashrafee then added another 22 runs for the last wicket with Shahadat Hossain, who remained unbeaten on nought off 17 balls as Mashrafee was stumped by Brendon McCullum off Aaron Redmond. Mashrafee hammered seven fours in his 87-ball 44 innings. New Zealand were all out for 171 in the first innings in reply to the Tigers' first innings total of 245. bdnews24.
