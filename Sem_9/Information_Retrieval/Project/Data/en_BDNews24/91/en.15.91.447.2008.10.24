<TITLE> Coalition talks flop, push Israel toward election </TITLE>

 JERUSALEM, Fri Oct 24, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel stepped closer to an early election on Friday when a Jewish religious party refused to join a new coalition under Tzipi Livni, the designated successor to scandal-hit outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. Unless reversed, the decision of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, a linchpin of successive governments, could kill off already dwindling hopes of a peace deal with Palestinians this year by leaving Israel under caretaker leadership for months. Olmert, who resigned last month over corruption inquiries, formally remains premier but lacks support to sign the kind of historic pact with the Palestinians that President George W Bush said he wanted before he leaves the White House in January. Polls indicate the right-wing opposition, which has condemned Olmert's peace moves, would win an early parliamentary election. The next scheduled ballot is not until 2010. Shas, which has also made higher welfare payments for its poor constituents a key demand in coalition negotiations, said its opposition to any partition of Jerusalem between Israel and a new Palestinian state could not be bought off at any price. There was no immediate reaction from Livni, who has set a deadline of Sunday for concluding negotiations and who is not likely to give up easily on her quest to be confirmed as Israel's first woman leader since Golda Meir in the 1970s. Her centrist Kadima party, previously led by Olmert, and the left-wing Labour party of Defence Minister Ehud Barak favour pursuing peace talks and insist now is not the time to burden Israel with elections -- partly due to the U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations and partly to the mounting world economic crisis. Both have pledged to press on with talks, launched under the patronage of President Bush a year ago, in search of an accord to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. SHAS STANDS FIRM "Shas cannot be bought and Shas will not sell out on Jerusalem. This has been our consistent line throughout negotiations," said Shas political leader Eli Yishai, Israel's trade and industry minister in the outgoing government. Both Israel and the Palestinians claim Jerusalem as their capital and Olmert has made clear he is ready to discuss ending Israel's refusal to give up Arabs parts of the city seized in the 1967 war. Shas says Jerusalem is not "merchandise for sale". "If there could have been a commitment that there will not be negotiations over Jerusalem ... We could have recommended to the party to approve a deal," Yishai said. He also indicated that the party was disappointed in Livni's response to its demand to increase welfare benefits. Shas sees itself as a champion of the disadvantaged in Israel. But its bid to significantly increase the welfare budget as the price of joining a coalition met firm resistance. Livni, hitherto foreign minister under Olmert and chief negotiatior with the Palestinians, has been trying to forge partnerships since she was elected leader of Kadima last month. Her overtures were quickly rejected by the opposition right-wing Likud party of former premier Benjamin Netanyahu, which is ahead in the polls and favours holding a national ballot. This could now come early in the new year. Some analysts did not rule out the possibility that Livni could still form a minority coalition relying on the support of smaller parties outside government, including Arab politicians. Others said that was an unlikely outcome
