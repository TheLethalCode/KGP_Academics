 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Energy Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Electric Supply Company has initiated plans to generate power investing its own funds, a senior government official said on Wednesday. "We are thinking about generating electricity of our own. We are waiting for the rules and regulations being formed by the government," DESCO's managing director Saleh Ahmed told bdnews24.com. A proposal on power generation by DESCO was placed at a meeting of its board of directors, said officials. They said the power company had amassed some Tk 700 crore in profits, that could be put to good use in this way instead of keeping the funds idle in banks. The plans would be finalised once the rules and regulations are clarified by the government, Saleh Ahmed said. A power division official said a draft of the rules and regulations had already been sent to the law ministry for vetting after which it would be sent to the cabinet for approval. Old state-owned power plants will look to be rehabilitated through public-private partnership, according to the draft rules and regulations. In case of public-private partnership, the government will ensure fuel supply of and sales of the electricity. DESCO officials say the company may resume production by repairing old plants. They also say there are a number of power plants where production could be boosted by newer generators. According to DESCO estimates, it bought Tk 55 crore of power last summer and Tk 44 crore last winter from the Power Development Board at previous rates. It now has to pay up to Tk 9 crore more as the price of electricity has been revised. The demand for power in the DESCO area is 350 megawatts, but its supply is 100 megawatts short. DESCO currently has 3.85 lakh subscribers. It made profits of Tk 100 crore in 2007-08 fiscal. bdnews
