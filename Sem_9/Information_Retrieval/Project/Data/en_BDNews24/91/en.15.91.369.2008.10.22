 NEW YORK, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wachovia Corp reported a third-quarter loss of $23.9 billion on Wednesday, the largest quarterly loss by a banking company in the global credit crisis, underscoring the challenges Wells Fargo & Co will face when it acquires the big lender. The loss stemmed mostly from an $18.7 billion writedown of goodwill because asset values fell. Wachovia has lost $33 billion in the last two quarters. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender added $4.76 billion to reserves for soured loans, and nearly doubled its forecast for losses on a fast-deteriorating $118.7 billion mortgage portfolio. Wells Fargo has agreed to buy Wachovia for $15.1 billion, without any government backing to cover loan losses it said could reach $74 billion. The purchase would more than double San Francisco-based Wells Fargo's size. It would create the nation's fourth-largest lender, with $1.4 trillion of assets, and biggest retail banking network, with more than 6,600 branches. "We have weakening in the economy, and loan losses continue to be problematic," said Gary Townsend, co-founder of Hill-Townsend Capital in Chevy Chase, Maryland. But he said "Wells wants and needs Wachovia for its future to build size and its position," and said the merger will "absolutely" go through under its original terms. Wells Fargo did not immediately return a call seeking comment, but Chief Executive John Stumpf in a statement said Wachovia's results "were very much in line with our expectations." Wachovia's net loss amounted to $11.18 per share. A year earlier the company posted a profit of $1.62 billion, or 85 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, the loss was $4.76 billion, or $2.23 per share. Analysts on average had expected a loss of 27 cents per share excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Wachovia shares closed Tuesday at $6.09, while Wells Fargo closed at $32.64. The all-stock merger was valued Tuesday at $14 billion and has won federal regulatory approval. MARKET ENVIRONMENT CHANGES Wells Fargo won Wachovia in a bidding war with Citigroup Inc, which had offered $2.16 billion for part of Wachovia, with government backing to limit loan losses. Wachovia arranged the Wells Fargo merger just four days after agreeing to the Citigroup transaction, and less than three weeks after Wachovia Chief Executive Robert Steel said the company was healthy. "The market environment changed more precipitously than anyone had expected," Steel said Wednesday in a statement. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Board said emergency conditions, including Wachovia's weakened financial state, warranted quick approval of the Wells Fargo transaction. Citigroup is suing Wells Fargo for $60 billion for alleged interference with its agreement with Wachovia. Much of Wachovia's troubles stem from the $118.7 billion portfolio of "Pick-a-Pay" option adjustable-rate mortgages it largely took on when it bought California lender Golden West Financial Corp for $24.2 billion in 2006. Wachovia said it now expects losses on that 438,000-loan portfolio of $26.1 billion, or 22 percent, up from the 12 percent it had forecast in July. Wells Fargo has estimated losses could reach 26 percent. Option ARMs let borrowers defer interest and principal payment. Wachovia stopped making the loans this year. Sixty-nine percent of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio is in California and Florida, two states hard hit by the housing crisis. DEPOSITS UNDER PRESSURE About two-thirds of Wachovia's goodwill writedown related to retail and small-business operations, including the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. Most of the rest related to commercial banking operations. Overall, the bank set aside $6.63 billion for credit losses, while net charge-offs totaled $1.87 billion. Wachovia said core deposits fell 8 percent in the quarter, including a 24 percent slide in high-cost commercial deposits. It said this reflected "significant market turmoil," which included worries about Wachovia following the collapse and failure of Washington Mutual Inc, whose banking units have been acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wachovia said the commercial deposit outflows have reversed. Results also included losses or charges of $2.5 billion tied to market disruptions, $682 million on principal investing, $515 million for job cuts, $497 million for a regulatory settlement over auction-rate securities, and other items. In consumer and business banking, Wachovia's largest unit, profit fell 43 percent to $857 million. Corporate and investment banking had a $703 million loss, wealth management had a $84 million profit, and capital management had a $499 million loss because of the auction-rate settlement.
