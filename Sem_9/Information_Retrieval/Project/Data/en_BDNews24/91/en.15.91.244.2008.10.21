<TITLE> Thai police on alert ahead of Thaksin graft ruling </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai police were beefing up their presence at a court due to rule on Tuesday on graft charges against deposed leader Thaksin Shinawatra but anti-Thaksin protesters said they would avoid any confrontation with his supporters. The Supreme Court was due to deliver its verdict at around 2 p.m. (3 a.m. EDT) on whether there was a conflict of interest when Thaksin, at the heart of Thailand's political crisis over the past three years, allowed his wife to bid for state land when he was in office. The ruling is the first in a spate of corruption charges against Thaksin and his political associates prepared by graft investigators appointed after a military coup in 2006. An elected government returned to power this year but the main party in the coalition, the People Power Party, is seen by anti-government protesters as a proxy for Thaksin. Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat is Thaksin's brother-in-law. The court's compound was plastered with signs warning Thaksin supporters and opponents they would be in contempt of court if they caused any disturbance. Police planned to deploy 300 officers to keep peace at the court after both sides said they would mobilize supporters for the ruling. But the anti-government People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which has occupied the compound of the prime minister's offices since August, said on Tuesday it would not march to the courthouse to avoid confrontation with Thaksin supporters. "We are staying where we are. We don't want to create any trouble," PAD spokesman Parnthep Pourpongpan told Reuters. If found guilty, Thaksin, who skipped bail in August and now lives in Britain with his wife and adult children, could be jailed for up to 10 years. The political crisis dates back to 2005 when the PAD launched street protests against Thaksin, alleging corruption and abuse of power. It has meandered through a coup to elections and back to protests and shows no sign of resolution
