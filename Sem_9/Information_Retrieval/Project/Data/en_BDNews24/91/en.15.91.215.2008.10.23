 DHAKA, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram has been ruled out for the second and final test against Bangladesh starting on Saturday in Dhaka. "He has got a back problem. He has been ruled out for the second test, (and) will fly home on Saturday," team manager Lindsay Crocker told Reuters. "He will undergo several medical tests at home and only than we will be able the assess the situation." Crocker said a member of the squad will take Oram's place. Oram suffered back pain while bowling on Sunday and was rested before Bangladesh were all-out for 242 in the second innings of the first test. New Zealand lead the series 1-0 after their three-wicket win in Chittagong on Tuesday. Middle order batsman Oram was out for a duck in the first innings and not out for eight in the second. The medium pacer ended 20-14-14-0 in the first innings and 8-2-19-0 in the second
