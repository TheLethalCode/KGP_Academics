<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has decided on principle to provide Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia with the highest state security during the election period, an adviser said on Thursday. "We are on the electoral highway. We are now heading for the polls fast," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said at a joint press briefing after government dialogue with the Awami League. The adviser said the cabinet would take a final decision on security aspects for the two former PMs. Saying the dialogue with political parties was almost concluded, he added: "We are now discussing some very specific issues. These issues will be resolved through discussion in line with policies." The adviser did not say whether Hasina's eligibility to contest the polls had been addressed in the AL dialogue. "The AL chief is a very important person in the political arena. It is an important thing to make a way for her to lead the party." "The law will settle other things," Hossain Zillur told reporters at the Chief Adviser's Office. The post-electoral scenario also came up for discussion, Hossain Zillur said, adding that they talked about how to keep the situation stable. Awami League acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said the dialogue touched on various issues, including the permanent release of Sheikh Hasina and her security. Withdrawal of the state of emergency, re-demarcation of parliament constituencies, deferring upazila polls, neutrality of administration, media policy, and amending sections of the RPO relating to cancellation of candidacy were among the AL's demands, Syed Ashraful said. He also said the talks were fruitful. "Today's talks have convinced us that the election will be held on Dec 18," the AL leader said. On the state of emergency, Hossain Zillur said the government would take a decision on the basis of real needs. "We do not want any political party starting its election campaign under the burden of embargo. But we do not want the rights of voters to come under threat either. We are thinking of all angles," he said. He said the AL demanded a gap between the national and upazila polls. "We gave them reasons for holding the polls. We mentioned the keenness of grass-roots people for upazila polls." The adviser also hoped a resolution over redrawing of parliament constituencies would be reached soon. He said the AL demanded that an objective policy and code of conduct be formulated for all government and non-government media to ensure their neutral role during the polls. The government would sit with the representatives of mass media to work out a solution on the matter, the adviser added. The three-hour talks with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed began at 2.30pm. Advisers Ghulam Quader, AF Hassan Ariff, Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, Anwarul Iqbal and Hossain Zillur Rahman were present. AL acting president Zillur Rahman, presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam were in the AL team. The AL had first dialogue with the government on July 3. bdnews24.
