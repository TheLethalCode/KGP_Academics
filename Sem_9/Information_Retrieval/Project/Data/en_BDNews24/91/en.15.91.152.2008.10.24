 Dhaka, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com)  Radical Islamic activists on Friday tried to stage demonstrations outside Zia International Airport defying a police ban and later declared the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of civil aviation and tourism ministry unwanted in the airport area. A few hundred people under the banner of "Airport Roundabout Idol Resistance Committee" tried to bring out a procession from Haji camp mosque after Friday prayers nd hold a rally at the roundabout. But the police resisted them. At the same time Khelafat Majlish and Islami Chhatra Shakti tried to hold rallies and take out procession at the north gate of Baitul Mokarram National Mosque. But the police thwarted the move. The radicals vandalised the under-construction Baul (mystic poets) sculpture at Airport roundabout last week. Authorities later removed the sculpture whose 70 percent work had been completed. The religious bigots said they would resist any attempt to re-construct sculpture at the same place. They also demanded removal of sculptures from different places of the country. On the other hand, different political parties and cultural organisations have been protesting the removal of sculpture from the airport area. They have been also condemning the government's giving in meekly to the radicals. As the "Airport Roundabout Idol Resistance Committee" announced the rally on Thursday, Dhaka Metropolitan Police imposed a ban on any type of rally or procession in the area. But the committee tried to bring out procession from Haji camp mosque after Juma prayers defying the ban. Failing to proceed towards the roundabout in the face of police obstruction they returned to the mosque. They held a rally at the mosque premises. At the rally the convenor of the committee, Mufti Noor Hossain Noorani, said, "The idol (sculpture) was being constructed at the personal wish of Mahbub Jamil. So we declare him unwanted in the airport area." He demanded setting up a hajj minaret at the roundabout, instead, and naming of the road from Hotel Siraj International near the airport to the airport terminal as Hajj Avenue. Noorani criticised the police for obstructing the rally. Huge numbers of riot police were deployed as security at the haji camp and the Airport was intensified since Friday morning ahead of the programme of the committee". Khelafat Majlish and Islami Chhatra Shakti tried to bring out procession from Baitul Mokarram's north gate after the juma prayers, failing which they held a rally at the mosque gate. Khelafat Majlish leader Ahmadullah Ashraf, Zafrullah Khan, Chhatra Shakti leader Abdus Sattar and Azizur Rahman spoke. They condemned setting up Baul sculpture at the Airport. bdnews24.com/
