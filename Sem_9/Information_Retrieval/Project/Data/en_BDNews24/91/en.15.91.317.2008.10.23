"A fund mission will begin discussions with the authorities within the next few days on a program aimed at strengthening economic stability and enhancing confidence in the financial system," Strauss-Kahn said in a statement, adding: "The amount of fund financing under a stand-by arrangement has yet to be determined. Financing could be made within the framework of the Fund's emergency financing mechanism." IMF and Pakistani authorities have been meeting in Dubai since Tuesday to discuss details of the country's financial restructuring plan. Pakistan needs $10 billion to $15 billion of support from foreign lenders, the country's newly appointed economic trouble-shooter said on Tuesday. It is widely believed that with an IMF program, bilateral donors will then also be willing to agree to giving the government money.
