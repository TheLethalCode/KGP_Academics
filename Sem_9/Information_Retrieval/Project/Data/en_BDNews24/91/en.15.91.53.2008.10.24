 KARACHI, Oct 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian Geoff Lawson has been dismissed as coach of Pakistan, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday. A spokesman for the board said the former test bowler had been released from his contract and given three months' pay as compensation. "I have been told about their decision but there are a few issues to be sorted out," Lawson said. The decision to sack Lawson came hours after the Australian had met with Chairman Ejaz Butt to discuss cricket matters. "The decision to release Lawson and (chief operating officer Shafqat) Naghmi was taken by the chairman," the spokesman said. "Lawson has been informed about the decision." Lawson was appointed in August 2007 after the death of Bob Woolmer during the World Cup. His two-year contract was due to end in 2009. Butt had said on Monday that Lawson was "useless" but that he would see out the remainder of his contract. Former board chairman Tauqir Zia told Reuters the abrupt decision to sack Lawson would mean no foreigner would be willing to come to work for Pakistan. "I think the board should have discussed this at the governing body level before reaching a decision," he added. Naghmi will be replaced by Saleem Altaf, the PCB spokesman said. The board is expected to name former test captain Intikhab Alam as the temporary coach for the one-day series in Abu Dhabi against the West Indies from Nov 12. "I would be willing to consider a coaching position if they approach me," Alam said. Lawson, who took 180 wickets in 46 Tests, was preferred over the more experienced Dav Whatmore last year when the PCB shortlisted three foreign coaches
