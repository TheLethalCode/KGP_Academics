 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)UN agencies have voiced concerns over possible melamine contamination of milk products in Bangladesh, offering support for further testing of milk powder samples, and reminding not just public authorities but the food industry of their duty to ensure safety of food products. In a joint statement issued Wednesday, the offices of three UN agencies in Bangladesh expressed their concern "regarding the implication of melamine contaminated milk products on infant and child nutrition and health." "FAO, WHO and UNICEF supports the government efforts in addressing the issue of melamine contaminated powdered milk and advise the authorities to remove all melamine-contaminated milk products from the market as soon as tests can confirm the level of melamine in powdered milk and infant formula, while immediate action should be taken to ensure supply of safe dairy products," said the statement. "FAO and WHO are ready to support the Government of Bangladesh for further testing of powdered milk samples by internationally certified laboratories." "The UN agencies urge the government to ensure food safety and quality, especially for powdered milk, by enforcing the national mandatory food law (s) and regulations in order to address evolving episodes of food contamination, such as melamine in powdered milk," said the statement. "However, food safety is not the sole responsibility of public authorities. The food industry, producers and importers are also responsible for ensuring a safe supply of food to the consumers." FAO and WHO will continue to provide technical expertise and advice to strengthen the national regulatory framework and build the capacity of the concerned national bodies to ensure consumer protection, they said. The UN agencies advises all parents in Bangladesh that breast feeding is the best, safest and most natural way of providing infants with the nutrients they need, and recommend exclusive breast feeding for the first 6 months of life. "However, when breast milk is not a viable option, infants up to 6 months would need to be fed infant formula which is designed as a sole source of nutrition for these infants. "Replacing infant formula with other products such as condensed milk, regular milk powder, or fresh liquid milk is inappropriate as these products would put at risk the safety and nutritional status of this vulnerable group," the statement warned. The UN agencies stressed the importance of giving this information to all mothers during antenatal and postnatal care. They also call for the full enforcement of the existing Code of Marketing of Breast Milk substitutes, which has been approved in Bangladesh in 1984 and amended in 1990. The agencies highlighted the need for public information on the food safety issue and in particular advice for citizens on how they can avoid food safety risks associated with the contamination problem.
