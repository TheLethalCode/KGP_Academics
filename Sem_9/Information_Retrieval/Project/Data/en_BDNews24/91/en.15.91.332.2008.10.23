 KARACHI, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The West Indies have offered to play two tests against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi in November, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Thursday. Pakistan are due to play three one-day internationals against West Indies Nov. 12-16 and PCB Chairman Ejaz Butt said that if the proposal was accepted the tests would immediately follow the one-dayers. Butt said the West Indies proposal was under serious consideration and the board was trying to find sponsors and work out other logistical matters. "The West Indies offer is a shot in the arm for Pakistan cricket and if these tests go ahead our players will finally get the much needed exposure they badly need," Butt said. He confirmed the PCB would have to pay appearance fees to the West Indies board for the two tests, which were not part of the ICC future tours program. "We are hoping we will be able to make necessary arrangements to have the two tests," he added. Pakistan have not played a test this year after Australia postponed a tour in April due to security reasons. The International Cricket Council also postponed the Champions Trophy in August as some teams had security and safety concerns for their players
