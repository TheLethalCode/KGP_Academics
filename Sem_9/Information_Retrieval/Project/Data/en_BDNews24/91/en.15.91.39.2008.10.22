<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission has found that crores of taka were misappropriated by officials of BTTB, now Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited, by tampering with pay slips of some 256 workers appointed for inconsequential office work. In a weekly briefing on Wednesday, TAC member Manjur Rashid said the then-BTTB officials added extra digits on the amounts of money recorded on pay slips in order to misapproporiate funds. The information was revealed during an investigation into the statements of BTCL officials seeking clemency from the commission. The TAC had already collected a file from the related ministry to investigate the allegations against the officials, named by previous clemency seekers. Manjur Rashid said misappropriation of crores of taka took place at the revenue and engineering departments of the former BTTB. The engineering department misappropriated Tk 14 crores over one fiscal year, he said. Commission chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said at Wednesday's briefing that politicians had yet to apply to the TAC for clemency, and the number of businessmen that had approached the commission was still very low. Replying to a question, he said it was not possible to extend the Oct 31 deadline for application to seek TAC clemency. "We have to finish our work in five months. Two and half months have already elapsed," he said. Commission member Asif Ali said the TAC had completed 65 percent of pending work in 30 working days. The commission was pacing to its work to complete it by the given period. bdnew
