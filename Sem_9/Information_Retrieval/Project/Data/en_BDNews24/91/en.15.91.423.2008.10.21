 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)A group of Jahangirnagar University students physically assaulted head of drama and dramatics department Sanwar Hossain Sunny on campus Tuesday, in ongoing protests against the teacher who was cleared in a controversial sexual harassment case last month. JU students had declared Sanwar Hossain 'persona non grata' on campus after a syndicate meeting on Sept 14 cleared the teacher of sexual harassment charges brought against him by four female students due to a lack of evidence. When he appeared on campus around noon Tuesday, a group of male and female students of the drama department barred him from entering his office, reports bdnews24.com's JU correspondent Aminur Rahman Rasel. He attempted to take refuge in the teacher's lounge, where the students followed, dragging him out and beating him. Two fellow teachers came to his rescue, with the proctor soon arriving to intervene. Activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal, allegedly backed by teachers, also appeared on the scene and clashed with the drama students. Around 10 students were injured in the latter incident. The BCL and JCD activists ended up vandalising a number of rooms of the department. The sexual harassment allegations were made on May 3 when four female students of the university's drama department submitted a written statement accusing the drama teacher of improprieties. Students have long been demanding regulations to be enforced regarding sexual harassment, with the JU campus troubled by ongoing protests against Sanwar Hossain. bdnew
