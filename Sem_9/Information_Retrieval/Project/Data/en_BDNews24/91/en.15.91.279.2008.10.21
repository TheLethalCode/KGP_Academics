<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  A trial court has suspended the hearing of the Niko corruption case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and others until Nov 9. The Special Judge's Court-2, set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises, adjourned proceedings on a motion by defence lawyers Tuesday. Hasina's lawyers told the court that a final hearing on the defence's appeal for quashment of the case was scheduled to be held in the High Court on Oct 29. They asked the court in such circumstance to suspend the trial for a month. Special judge AK Roy adjourned the court for three weeks. The High Court on July 7 stayed the proceedings of two graft cases against the former prime minister, including the Niko case, on petitions by Hasina challenging the legality of the cases. The Appellate Division upheld the High Court stays on Aug 13, on a counter-appeal by the ACC against the stay orders. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Dec 9 last year against seven people including Hasina. The commission later pressed charges against a total of nine. The case alleged that the state suffered a loss of Tk 13,630.50 crore under Hasina's term in office as the Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields were handed to Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd without tender. Hasina was released on parole from special jail on June 11, and is now under treatment in the USA. bdnew
