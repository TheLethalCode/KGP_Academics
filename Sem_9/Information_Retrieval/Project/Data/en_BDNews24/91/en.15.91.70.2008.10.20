 Moinul Hoque Choudhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, October 20 (bdnews24.com) Islamic Democratic Party (IDP), formed comprising the members of banned Harkat Ul Jihad Al Islami Bangladesh (Huji), applied for registration with the Election Commission Monday. IDP's advisor Kazi Azizul Haque and convenor Moulana Sheikh Abdus Salam submitted the registration form to the EC. "We have formed the IDP with the members of Huji to pursue political goals complying with the Constitution of Bangladesh," Abdus Salam told reporters. "The Huji ways of doing politics was not right in this country's context. We'd like to ask Huji activists to come to the right path, to pursue politics for the country  We are now working democratically." Azizul Haque claimed Huji did not exist any more. "And IDP has no links with the Huji." But most members of the new outfit are former Mujahideens, who fought for the Taliban in Afghanistan, returned to Bangladesh in 1992 after the fall of the Najibullah regime and launched the Huji in April that year. Haque said Abdus Salam was a member of Huji but that the outfit dissolved itself in Aug 1998. He said 300 former Huji activists had joined IDP, successor of an outfit, borne out of Huji, in different names. In April 1998, he said, Huji had ousted Mufti Hannan and thus had no links with the terrorist incidents attributed to the now-detained Afghan veteran. After the serial bomb blasts across the country on August 17 in 2005, the government banned three Islamist organizationsthe Huji, Jagroto Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB) and Jamaatul Mujhahidin Bangladesh (JMB). Earlier on May 21 in 2002, the US State Department enlisted the Huji as a terrorist organisation. On March 5 this year, the US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice classified Huji as a "foreign terrorist organisation" and "international terrorist group". The IDP's advisor Azizul Haque claimed they did not belong to "the Huji banned by the government in 2005". bdnew
