Elections are due on December 18 which hopefully will provide Bangladesh a democracy that will be durable, stable and sustainable." he said at a function commemorating the UN Day on Friday in Dhaka. "The UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon will soon visit Bangladesh, this distinguished visitor will also rejoice with Bangladeshis at their success." "Our soldiers and policeman are serving the cause of peace in distant trouble spots all over the world." The adviser was confident that the UN will stand by Bangladesh as "we strive to realise the fruition of our dreams, with the path of our destiny lit by the torch of hope." Renata Lok Dessallien, UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, read out a message of Ban Ki-moon. The UN chief said, "We have just passed the midpoint in the struggle to reach the Millennium Development Goals-our common vision for building a better world in the 21st century." "Climate Change, the spread of disease and deadly weapons, and the scourge of terrorism all cross borders. If we want to advance the global common good, we must secure global public goods," Ban added. In her speech Dessallien said, "In a few weeks' time, the UN secretary-general will be visiting Bangladesh at which time he himself will be conveying his deep appreciation for Bangladesh's many important contribution to the UN."
