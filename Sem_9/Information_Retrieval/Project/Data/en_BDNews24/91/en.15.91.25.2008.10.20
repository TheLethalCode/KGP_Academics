 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh has said the party now formally recognises the 1971 liberation war, and has now renamed itself. The party's new name is Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, according to its new constitution submitted to election officials Monday. Jamaat says the change in name is intended to "avoid confusion". The party has also endorsed Bangladesh's constitution, independence and sovereignty, acknowledged the 1971 liberation war in its draft amended constitution, filed with the Election Commission for party registration. "We have added necessary clauses in the draft constitution to this end," assistant secretary general M Quamaruzzaman told reporters after filing registration papers at the EC Secretariat. "Many people say that the constitution of Jamaat-e-Islami is unconstitutional. This is not right," said Quamaruzzaman, a former publicity secretary of the party. "We have brought a few changes to the constitution complying with the Election Commission regulations," he said. The draft amended constitution says: "The independent Bangladesh is the third largest Muslim country in the world. "Through a heroic struggle of the people of Bangladesh and the freedom fighters, Bangladesh emerged as an independent, sovereign nation state in the world. "Therefore, based on this fundamental faith and spirit, this constitution is introduced with an aim to build an Islamic society." The Jamaat leader read out these lines from the draft that he had submitted to the EC officials. Quamaruzzaman claimed said his party had no "affiliate" organisations. Committees at all levels are formed through by party councillors, he said. Already, women constitute 25 percent of all committee members and the ratio will be raised to 33 percent by 2020, he said. A total 107 parties had applied for registration up to the deadline on Monday at 5pm, said the EC officials, with LDP being the first party to receive its registration certificate on the day. The EC stretched the registration deadline to Oct 20 from the earlier date of Oct 15, responding to the appeals of BNP and its allies including Jamaat. bdne
