 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) The government has approved a second poverty reduction strategy paper, giving priority to the agricultural sector and targeting seven percent GDP growth over the next three years. It also focuses on climate change adaptation, rising food prices in the global market and the impact of a changed political scenario, PRSP-2 committee chief Ismail Hossain told reporters Thursday after a meeting of the National Economic Council. The NEC meeting, chaired by the chief adviser, approved the strategy paper for 2008-09 to 2010-11. The first PRSP, which expired this June, was adopted on July 25 2005, by the BNP-led four-party alliance government. According to the new PRSP, 56.6 percent of the population lived below the poverty line in 1991-92. In 2000, the percentage of people living below poverty line dropped to 48.9 percent, and to 40 percent in 2005. But the PRSP-2 gives no similar figure on poverty after 2005, nor does it contain any account of the development driven by the first PRSP. bdnews
