 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - The government will sit with the Awami League in dialogue again on Oct 23 at the Chief Adviser's Office, an Awami League leader said on Monday. "The time for dialogue with the government has been set at 2.30pm on Oct 23," AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed told bdnews24.com. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman had already said earlier in the day, the government would hold another round of talks with Awami League and BNP by Oct 23. "We're not being 'bureaucratic', we are only trying to progress systematically, by holding consultations, towards a free and fair election, fulfilling people's hopes for quality democracy," the adviser said. After a meeting with three fellow advisers, Zillur Hossain told reporters the forthcoming dialogues with AL and BNP would be centred around the election environment and qualitative upliftment of the country's politics. On Saturday, AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that the government contacted AL leaders to have talks. Withdrawal of the state of emergency, permanent release of Sheikh Hasina, deferring upazila polls would be key issues on the agenda of the talks, Syed Ashraful said. b
