<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Tue Oct 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New York City voters are split on whether Mayor Michael Bloomberg should be allowed to run for a third term and 89 percent believe the issue should be decided by a referendum, not the city council, a poll showed on Tuesday. The Quinnipiac University poll indicated 51 percent of New Yorkers oppose extending the city's eight-year term limit to 12 years, while 45 percent support the move. A similar question asked in an October 3 poll -- conducted before Bloomberg announced he would seek an extension on term limits and run for a third term -- found 54 percent supported extending term limits and 42 percent opposed it. "Opponents of Mayor Bloomberg's plan to extend term limits are winning -- narrowly -- the battle for the hearts and mind of New Yorkers," said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. "They love Mayor Mike and two weeks ago they were ready to give him a third term, in a hypothetical situation. But now that it's real and other voices are being heard. Voters are having second thoughts," Carroll said. The poll found that 75 percent of voters approve of the job Bloomberg is doing. He wants a third term to help guide the city through the Wall Street crisis and the poll showed 59 percent would "definitely" or "probably" vote for him. The October 15-19 poll surveyed 1,017 New York City registered voters, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points
