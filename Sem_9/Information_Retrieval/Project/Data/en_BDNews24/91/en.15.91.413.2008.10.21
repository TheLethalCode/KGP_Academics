 MOHALI, India, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's stand-in skipper Mahendra Dhoni was surprised at Australia's lack of fight in the second test after the hosts clinched a record 320-run win on Tuesday to take a 1-0 lead in the four-match series. Dhoni was also quick to hail his batsmen, particularly centurions Saurav Ganguly and Gautam Gambhir, and a bowling attack led by leg spinner Amit Mishra, who took seven wickets as a late replacement for injured skipper Anil Kumble.
