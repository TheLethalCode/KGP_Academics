 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Warriors tasted their first triumph in the Indian Cricket League when they handed a comprehensive 62-run defeat to Delhi Giants at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in Ahmedabad, India on Monday. Habibul Bashar's side bundled Delhi Giants out for 112 with eight balls to spare after posting a challenging total of 174 for five in 20 overs. After being put into bat first, openers Shahriar Nafees (30 off 27 balls) and Nazimuddin gave Dhaka a solid 91-run foundation on which other batsmen carried the momentum to finish on top. Nazimuddin played an explosive 29-ball 54 smashing five sixes and five fours and later was adjudged man of the match. Alok Kapali struck a 25-ball 34 and Bashar made 28 off 23 balls to help Dhaka past the 150-run mark. Delhi, in reply, fell in trouble to be reduced to 46 for five and never recovered from the damage though Abhinav Bali remained unbeaten on 33, but it was not enough to take Delhi home. Mohammad Sharif, Mohammad Rafique and Mosharraf Hossain took two wickets each for 18, 19 and 21 respectively to wreck Delhi innings. bd
