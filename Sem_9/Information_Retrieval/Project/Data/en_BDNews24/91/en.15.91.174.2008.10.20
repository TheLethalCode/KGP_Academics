 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Liberal Democratic Party on Monday was the first party to be registered by the Election Commission ahead of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections. "The purpose of registration is not to impose any control over parties. Registration will also play a role in establishing democracy within parties," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on the occasion. Oli Ahmed, president and co-founder of the party, received the registration certificate from the CEC. "LDP has made history by being the first to get registered, even though it is a new and small party," he said. "Registration will ensure transparency and accountability of the parties. We have been registered in line with the rules of the commission," he told reporters. Oli called on the government to lift the state of emergency before elections. "If not lifted fully, some conditions should be relaxed for the sake of elections." CEC Huda was "happy to hand the first registration certificate to a party." "It is encouraging that the major parties have applied for registration within the time given. We hope it will help create a congenial atmosphere for elections," Huda said, adding that Monday would remain the last day for applications. He pointed out: "The previous commission also moved for registration, but was not successful." After leaving BNP in 2006, Oli Ahmed formed LDP with former president Badruddoza Chowdhury. Badruddoza quit LDP six months later, however, returning to his former party Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. To be eligible for registration, a party must have a minimum of one constituency, or one percent of the total ballot or full fledged committees in at least 10 districts. LDP met the last condition in getting registered, EC officials said. The EC began handing out forms for registration on Aug 27, with LDP applying on Sept 11. Some 107 parties, including Awami League and BNP, had applied for registration by Monday 5pm, when applications came to a close. bdnews
