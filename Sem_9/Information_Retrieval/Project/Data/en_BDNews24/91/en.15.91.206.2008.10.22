<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shaun Marsh has been selected as a replacement for injured opening batsman Phil Jacques in the Australian test squad currently touring India. The 25-year-old Western Australia player has yet to play at test level but averages 47 in eight one-dayers and impressed in an official Twenty20 league in India this year. "Shaun has been selected having opened the batting for Australia in the one-day international arena and shown great potential," chief selector Andrew Hilditch said in a Cricket Australia statement on Wednesday. "As a replacement batsman on the tour, should the opportunity arise, we are confident that Shaun could fill any role in the batting order." The selection was also made with the future in mind, he added. Jacques did not play in the opening two matches of the series and was forced to return home to seek specialist advice for a back problem. Australia trail the four-match series 1-0. The third test begins in New Delhi on Oct. 29
