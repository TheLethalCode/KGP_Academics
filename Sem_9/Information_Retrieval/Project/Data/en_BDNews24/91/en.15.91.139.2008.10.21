 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - The prices of all kinds of fuel will be lowered by eight to 12 percent within a week, a special aide said on Tuesday. "We have taken the move as the oil prices have come down by half in the global market," M Tamim told reporters at the Secretariat. Finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam told bdnews24.com Monday night that prices of petrol, octane, diesel and kerosene would come down this week. "The government has already decided. The ministry will send a proposal in this regard to the chief adviser in a couple of days," he said. After approval from the CA, the decision will be implemented within a week, said Tamim, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of energy, power and mineral resources. The CA's special assistant said the government would still have to pay subsidies yet, but the ratio would be less than before. "The world market has been witnessing the price of oil at $70-80 per barrel for the last 20-25 days. OPEC intends to keep the price within $80-90. It also will depend on international markets." Bangladeshi Bank believes oil prices will remain around $80-90 even in 2009, Tamim said. Asked whether transport fares would also be cut Tamim said: "The transport costs will be cut in other districts but it will not be make any great impact in Dhaka and Chittagong as most public transports are run by CNG in the two cities." "The fare of long-distant buses will be less," he said. The special assistant was not optimistic about the gas crisis. "There is no possibility of quick solution of gas crisis. But the crisis will be narrow in a year by the short term step taken by the government." Some 30 million cubic feet of gas has been added this month to pipelines from Sangura gas field and the Fenchuganj gas field has added 15 million cubic feet. "We are hoping another 100 million cubic feet will be added by January that will lower the crisis." The government hiked fuel prices on June 30, raising the prices of diesel and kerosene to Tk 55 from Tk 40, of petrol to Tk 87 from Tk 65, and octane to Tk 90, up from Tk 67. bdnew
