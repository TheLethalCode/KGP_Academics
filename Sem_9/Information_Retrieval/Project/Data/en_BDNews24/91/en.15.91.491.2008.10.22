<TITLE> Japan PM wants to build trust in Asia amid crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, Wed Oct 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's outspoken nationalist prime minister, Taro Aso, will try to build trust with regional counterparts when he makes his Asian diplomatic debut this week as leaders look for ways to curb the worldwide financial crisis. But when it comes to showing leadership on policy, the best he can offer at the Asia-Europe Meeting summit in Beijing may be sharing lessons from Japan's past financial crisis, vowing to support Japan's flagging economy and repeating an offer to give more money to the International Monetary Fund for crisis-hit countries. "Japan has the experience of seeing how badly a delay in fixing bad loans problems can affect the real economy," said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Barclays Capital Japan. "Its experience and lessons may be the biggest contribution it can probably make," he said. As the world grapples with the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression, Japan is stepping up its own efforts, compiling a second package of economic steps next week and strengthening bank bailout plans. At the two-day ASEM summit that starts on Friday, Aso will explain what Tokyo has been doing to shore up the world's second-largest economy, which posted its sharpest contraction in seven years in the second quarter, a Japanese government official said. He will also relate Japan's experience with its financial crisis of the 1990s and call for action based on lessons learned. "While the financial system in the United States and Europe is facing an unprecedented crisis, the impact has been small in emerging countries in Asia, so we will urge the need to prevent the impact from spreading further," the official said. In what analysts said was an attempt to play a more active leadership role, Japan has said it is ready to lend part of its $1 trillion foreign reserves to the IMF if the multinational lender needs it to support countries facing crisis. TONE DOWN IMAGE Aso, who is pondering whether to call an election for late November, has been preoccupied with reviving Japan's economy. But the premier may try to score some points by toning down his image as an outspoken nationalist and keeping on track warming ties with China, where bitter memories remain of Japan's military aggression in Asia before and during the World War Two. The 68-year-old Japanese leader, who took office last month after his predecessor abruptly quit, is expected to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao as well as South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Friday morning. Issues ranging from the financial crisis to denuclearisation by North Korea and food safety may be on the table, but building trust will be high on the agenda at Aso's first bilateral meetings with those leaders, Japanese officials said. Aso has in the past offended Seoul with remarks that appeared to try to whitewash Japan's often brutal 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula, and irked Beijing by referring to its big military spending as a threat. But analysts said Aso, who never visited China while he was foreign minister from 2005 to 2007, was likely to act pragmatically to keep ties with Asian neighbours on an even keel. "A basic judgment of mine is that Aso will uphold the main framework of China-Japan relations established during the period of previous prime minister Yasuo Fukuda," said Liang Yunxiang, a professor of international relations at Peking University, referring to Fukuda's efforts to improve ties with Beijing. "Although he is conservative, during this visit I don't think he will have any big friction with China," he said. But that alone will not help Aso to win votes as speculation grows that he is leaning towards calling a snap poll for parliament's lower house for Nov. 30 in a bid to break a deadlock caused by the opposition's control of the upper house. "He can win big points if he can play a leadership role in Asia by sharing Japan's experience with solving the bad loan problems. But with his support rate in public opinion polls falling on concerns over the economy and pension, diplomacy won't win him big voter support," Barclays' Morita said
