<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - The Supreme Court on Monday upheld the bail for former BNP ministers Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, halting the stay orders on the cases against them. An Appellate Division bench comprising five justices, led by Chief Justice (CJ) MM Ruhul Amin, also upheld the bail for former state minister for planning Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. The Anticorruption Commission filed two cases against Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain on charge of amassing illegal wealth and land grabbing. After the order, advocate Ahsanul Karim who stood for them, told reporters that there was no legal obstacle to freeing them. But proceedings of the cases will go on in the court as the HC stay order has been halted on the cases, he said. bdne
