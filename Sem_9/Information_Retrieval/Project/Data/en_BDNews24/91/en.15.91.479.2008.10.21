<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said his country was ready to cooperate in an International Monetary Fund loan scheme to rescue countries struck down by the global credit crisis, Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported on Tuesday. At the Group of Seven finance leaders' meeting in Washington this month, Japan said it was ready to offer part of its $1 trillion foreign reserves to the IMF if the multi-national lender needed it to support countries facing economic crises. Singh told a group interview with Japanese media on Monday that India, with foreign exchange reserves of roughly $300 billion, would happily accept any request for cooperation in expanding the IMF's emergency lending scheme, the Nikkei said. Singh is due to arrive in Japan on Tuesday to meet Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso before heading to China for a summit of Asian and European nations later this week
