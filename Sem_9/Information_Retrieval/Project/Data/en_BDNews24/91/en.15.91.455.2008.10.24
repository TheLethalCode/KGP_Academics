Razzak also said that everyone should be alert against any shifting of the election date under any circumstances. "The JS polls must be held on Dec 18. AL is fully primed for the polls .. though some quarters are getting cold feet about the reforms and polls. Be careful, everybody," Razzak said. The AL leader was speaking as chief guest at a discussion organised by the Rickshaw Workers League at the AL head office. "The government said Sheikh Hasina would be freed. There cannot be any elections in the country without Sheikh Hasina," the AL leader said. He also sounded positive about participating in the upazila elections.
