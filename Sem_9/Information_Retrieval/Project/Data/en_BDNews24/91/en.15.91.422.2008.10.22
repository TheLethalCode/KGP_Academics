<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)The US polls observation mission will start arriving in city in early November, says ambassador James F Moriarty. "The 120-member election monitoring team will start arriving from early November," Moriarty told reporters Wednesday, following a meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the ministry. The ambassador said the state of emergency would not hamper the process of sending a US polls observation mission to Bangladesh. "The United States wants to see a free, fair and credible election", Moriarty said. The foreign adviser said: "We also discussed the current state of preparation for the upcoming elections on December18, a process to which the US is according full support." The chief adviser has previously said the caretaker government wanted to maintain the state of emergency to hold "free, fair and credible polls", but the emergency would be "relaxed as necessary" ahead of the parliamentary polls. Unlike the US, the EU has made it clear to the government that they will not send election observers to Bangladesh if the government does not restore certain civil and political rights by relaxing or lifting the emergency. bdnews
