 WASHINGTON, Wed Oct 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush will host a summit on November 15 in the Washington area to discuss the global financial crisis and reforms to prevent it from happening again, the White House announced on Wednesday. "The leaders will review progress being made to address the current financial crisis, advance a common understanding of its causes, and, in order to avoid a repetition, agree on a common set of principles for reform of the regulatory and institutional regimes for the world's financial sectors," said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino. Bush invited leaders of the G20 which includes the Group of Seven major industrial economies plus key emerging-market countries like China, India and Brazil. The heads of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, United Nations and Financial Stability Forum have also been invited. Bush will host a dinner for all the leaders the night before the summit at the White House. The summit will take place just 11 days after the US presidential election and Perino said that the White House will seek input from the winner, either Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama. "The two candidates have been made aware of the meeting and the president's intention to invite the leaders, and I think they were supportive of the idea," Perino said. Some European leaders had pushed for a summit before the end of the year and suggested that a total overhaul of the financial system be considered. French President Nicolas Sarkozy had suggested that the summit take place in New York. "Everybody will come with their ideas and the president recognizes that every country is going to have a responsibility but not every country is going to have the same solution," Perino said, adding that the United States will come with its own recommendations. However, she cast doubt over whether the first meeting will produce detailed solutions. "I don't believe that you'll have any details coming out of this meeting in terms of things everyone agrees to at the first meeting," Perino said. She said Bush was committed to a series of summits but it was unclear whether another gathering would occur before he leaves office on January 20
