 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) Two of the big names in Bangladesh's real estate business are under ACC scrutiny for allegedly grabbing government land worth Tk 2 billion, a spokesman said. An ACC special team deployed at the land ministry says there is a prima facie case that Bashundhara Housing and Borak Builders each has eaten up state property valued at Tk 100 crore. According to documents scrutinised by the ACC team, Basundhara had 80.29 acre of government land in Gulshan exchanged with its 85 acres in Keraniganj, an underdeveloped area on the other side of the Buriganga. The legal formalities were yet to be complete, but Basundhara, according to ACC, finished the landfilling work and sold the property to different individuals and organizations. The state lost Tk 100 crore in the process, if the difference of price is calculated, ACC director general Col Hanif Iqbal told a regular press briefing Thursday. In the other case, the government leased out 0.82 acres of land in capital's Kakrail to Red Crescent Society for 30 years. In 2001, when the Red Crescent authorities insisted the land be allotted to them permanently, the land ministry scrapped the lease deal itself. ACC alleges the then Dhaka deputy commissioner Abdus Sattar Khan had the land allotted, illegally, to the Society and gave permission to construct an 18-storey building on the plot. ACC says Red Crescent shared the land with Borak Builders in an uneven dealwith the developer getting a whopping 75 percent. Borak build and sold away the 18-story complex, causing the state to lose another Tk 100 crore, according to ACC. "This is primary information. Now the investigation is on. Legal action against those involved will follow a full inquiry," Col Iqbal said.
