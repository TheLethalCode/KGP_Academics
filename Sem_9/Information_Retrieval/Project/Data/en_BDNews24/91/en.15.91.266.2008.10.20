 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have set New Zealand to chase 317, to bag the two-match Test series opener, after putting on 242 runs in their second innings on the fourth day at Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong on Monday. The Kiwis have their work cut out for them, never having won a match outside their home ground chasing over 200 runs. The hosts will be banking on their spinners again to win what would be their second Test match against a major nation, since their lone home win against Zimbabwe in 2005. The last such win for the Black Caps was against Australia in Perth in 1985-86 when they chased down 164 runs. Meanwhile, New Zealand's fourth innings best in the sub-continent was 177 all out against Pakistan in 1990, to lose by 66 runs against the hosts. The Tigers, having resumed the day on 184 for eight, added another 58 runs to finish on 242 in the second innings, marking the fifth time Bangladesh has exceeded 200 runs in both innings, previously achieving the feat against Pakistan, England, Australia and Sri Lanka. Overnight batsmen Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and Abdur Razzak put on a quick 40 for the eighth wicket before Razzak was caught by Ross Taylor off Iain O'Brien for a 45-ball 18. Mashrafee then added another 22 runs for the last wicket with Shahadat Hossain, who remained unbeaten on nought off 17 balls as Mashrafee was stumped by Brendon McCullum off Aaron Redmond. Mashrafee hammered seven fours in his 87-ball 44 innings. New Zealand were all out for 171 in the first innings in reply to the Tigers' first innings total of 245. bdne
