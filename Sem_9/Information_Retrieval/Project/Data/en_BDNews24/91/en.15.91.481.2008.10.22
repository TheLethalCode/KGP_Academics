 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission sees no major obstacle to Awami League getting registered, election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said on Wednesday. The remark came after a meeting between a four-member AL team and the chief election commissioner accompanied by two fellow commissioners. On the meeting, Sohul Hussain said: "What we discussed with the Awami League was an 'editing matter' over their constitution." "[The party] does not face any problem regarding registration. According to rules, an advertisement will be published soon, to invite any objections, before the registration certificate is handed over." The AL applied to the EC for registration on Oct 15. The commission's scrutiny committee asked the party to clarify its position on associate organisations. The AL gave explanations in two phases to the committee and the commission. Emerging from the meeting, AL office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan told reporters that the commission was happy with the AL's explanation relating to its associate organisations. Asked about its student, workers and other associate bodies, the AL leader confirmed that the organisations would be run according to their own constitutions. The main party would have no control over them, Khan said. According to electoral laws, the political parties are not allowed to keep any associate or front organisations under their constitutions. As many as 107 parties have applied to the Election Commission for registration. The Liberal Democratic Party was first to be registered by the EC ahead of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections. bdnews
