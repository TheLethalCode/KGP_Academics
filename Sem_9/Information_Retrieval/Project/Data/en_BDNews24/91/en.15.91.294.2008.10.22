<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank fears that the global economic crisis may hit non-banking financial institutions in Bangladesh, on the back of loans to private enterprises. "We have suggested they be more cautious in giving loans to businesses, as these financial institutions are more vulnerable to the economic crisis than banks," BB governor Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with the NBFI chiefs at his office Wednesday. The central bank has previously said it is not overly-concerned about the global crisis hitting the country's banks. But, Salehuddin said, the central bank had called Wednesday's meeting with the aim of alerting NFBIs to be more cautious in disbursing loans by playing the 'money market'. Clarifying, the governor said: "They borrow from banks for a short term at lower interest rates and lend the same to clients for longer terms at higher interest rates." The central bank chief said the rate of loan default was higher for NBFIs than banks. According to the BB figures, the average rate of loan default for 30 private banks is 6 percent, while it stands at 8 percent for NBFIs. "We have instructed them to give loans only after thorough scrutiny of the applications," said the governor. "They have also been advised not to take loans from the call money market at higher rates of interest if not essential". He said Wednesday's meeting was a follow up of a similar meeting with bank chiefs on Oct 19, in the wake of global recession fears. bdnews2
