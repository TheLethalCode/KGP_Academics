 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP submitted its registration form to the Election Commission, along with its new draft constitution, on Mondaythe last day of the EC's extended deadline. "There are several changes in the party constitution in line with the new RPO. According to the new constitution, there will not be any front organisations of the party," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said after submitting its form to the EC. A total of 107 parties had applied for registration by 5pm Monday, when the EC Secretariat closed its doors to all further applications. Amid much speculation ahead of the EC deadline, the party finally announced on Sunday that it would be registering by the Oct 20 deadline. BNP's decision to register was made to "safeguard the party", secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain had told reporters. Nazrul Islam Khan also told the press Monday that BNP had registered to "frustrate any conspiracies against the party." The party's standing committee approved a draft amendment to the constitution at an 'emergency meeting' called by BNP chief Khaleda Zia at her Gulshan office Sunday night. Nazrul Islam Khan said Monday: "We will not have front organisations. If there are any associates, those names will not be mentioned in the party constitution." "Different professional bodies that follow our ideology will run as per their own constitutions. Overseas units will run according to the laws of the concerned country," he said, echoing similar-sounding provisions of rival party Awami League's new draft constitution. The BNP leader also said the new constitution allows election of party leaders at any level by council. Asked whether the power of party chairperson was reduced in the new constitution, he answered: "Nothing regarding this was mentioned in the RPO." BNP's allies, Jamaat, BJP and IOJ also applied for registration Monday. Key ally Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh said its new constitution now formally recognised the 1971 liberation war, and the party has renamed itself. The new name is Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, according to its new draft constitution submitted to election officials Monday. The Liberal Democratic Party was the first party to be registered by the Election Commission ahead of the 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections. "The purpose of registration is not to impose any control over parties. Registration will also play a role in establishing democracy within parties," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on the occasion. bdnews24.c
