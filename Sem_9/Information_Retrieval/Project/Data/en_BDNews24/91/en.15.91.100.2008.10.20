 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)With both major parties and government looking to more dialogue to reach accord, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Monday the government will have another round of talks with Awami League and BNP by Oct 23. "We're not being 'bureaucratic', we are only trying to progress systematically, by holding consultations, towards a free and fair election, fulfilling people's hopes for quality democracy," the adviser said. After a meeting with three fellow advisers, Zillur Hossain told reporters the forthcoming dialogues with AL and BNP would be centred around the election environment and qualitative upliftment of the country's politics. Congratulating AL, BNP and other parties on their timely decisions to register with the Election Commission, Zillur said: "Through party registration, we are accomplishing one important preparatory task for a free and fair election." Asked if the caretaker government will single out 'ideal candidates' for the polls, Zillur said: "The government will only ensure the proper environment, enabling all willing parties to participate in the elections and voters to cast their votes freely and fearlessly." bdnews24.com/mk/ff
