<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Russel KC maintained their unbeaten run in the B. League with a 3-0 win over struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad KS at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. With the fourth win in six matches, Sheikh Russel stretched their lead to 14 points, five points ahead of Dhaka Abahani and Rahmatgan MFS. Abahani, who were out of action due to their players' involvement in the national team, played a match less than Rahmatganj's five. Meanwhile, Brothers Union (eight points) and Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club (seven points) were also out of the games for the same reasons. It was the fifth consecutive defeat in as many matches for Muktijoddha Sangsad, who were demolished 7-0 against Dhaka Mohammedan SC in their previous match. Compared with their previous performances, Muktijoddha Sangsad on Wednesday played well fighting equally to force the league leaders to a goalless draw in the first half, but they failed to keep the momentum and went down six minutes into the second half. Russel, however, went close to taking a lead in the first half when winger Mobarak whipped a cross from the right for striker Alfaz Ahmed, who, however, failed to connect it from a very close range to disappoint Sheikh Russel in the 15th minute. Veteran Alfaz, however, did not mistake to give his side a lead in the 51st minute as the former national striker struck his league's sixth goal capitalising on a Mobarrak lob with goalkeeper Nizam Majumdar and defender Omosowone Davis Majemu struggling to clear the ball. Moroccan striker Mohamed Younes headed a Igir Mohamed cross home to double the lead in the 71st minute while Igir, also a Moroccan footballer, fired an Alfaz cross home to seal the match eight minutes from time.
