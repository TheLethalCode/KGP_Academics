 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Hosts Bangladesh face Sri Lanka in 'the final match' before the finale of the Tri-Nation Cup on Wednesday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Stunned by Zimbabwe in the tournament opener, Bangladesh must win the final group match after Sri Lanka almost ensured their place in the final by thrashing the Africans by massive 130 runs. Bangladesh toiled hard in the last two days in nets to get through their bad patch and vice captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza believes Wednesday's match will be 'the final before the real final' . "I think it is kind of a final clash before the final match as a win takes us to the final match and we will play positive cricket tomorrow (Wednesday), "said Mashrafee at a pre-match press briefing in Mirpur on Tuesday. "Everyone was very much disappointed after playing badly in the first match. But we have worked hard in the practice in the last two days. If we can make a good start against Sri Lanka, then we will have a good chance in the match," said Mashrafee. The Bangladesh pace spearhead, however, admitted that playing against a big team always meant pressure, but the boys were confident to play positive. Mashrafee said there was no alternative to performing better in all three departments if they were to win against Sri Lanka. The 25-year old pacer also wants to capitalise on the top-order failure of Sri Lanka, whose top four batsmen have been struggling to get runs since Zimbabwe tour. "You know that their top four batsmen Upul (Tharanga), (Sanath) Jayasuriya, (Kumar) Sangakkara and (Mahela) Jayawardene play better and if we can stop them early in the match, then I think we can put pressure on them." Mashrafee has no doubt about Bangladesh's capability of pushing the opponents hard. The Bangladesh strike bowler, however, seemed a bit worried over Sri Lankan spin attack comprised of Ajantha Mendis and Muttiah Muralitharan. "Sri Lanka have trump cards in spin duo Mendis and Murali, but I think we have nothing to be worried as Shakib (Al Hasan), (Mohammad) Ashraful and Mushfiqur (Rahim) handled both of them well in Test series. "I think the batsmen will once again put some runs on the board to give bowlers something to bowl at." Mehrab Hossain Junior, Enamul Haq Junior and Nazmul Hossain have been kept out of the playing eleven, which means middle-order batsman Mahmudullah Riad and uncapped pacer Rubul Hossain are set to play. Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene said they were not complacent after a convincing win over Zimbabwe and that they were serious about Tuesday's match. "We never take any game lightly. To us it is important to win every match we play and we always try to do that. We want our players to continue improving and get better all the time. We don't want any let-ups. "I am sure they (Bangladesh) have had a few things to worry about because it was a game they were expected to win. I am also pretty certain that they would want to come out strong because this is a must-win match for them." Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah Riad, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Rubel Hossain
