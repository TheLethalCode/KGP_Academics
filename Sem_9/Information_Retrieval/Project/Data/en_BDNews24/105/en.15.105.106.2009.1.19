 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)--The government will soon appoint a new set of lawyers to represent the state in the higher courts, the new attorney general made it clear Monday. A deputy attorney general said Mahbubey Alam had already asked all law officers in his office to prepare resignation letters. "The AG, at a meeting in his office at 4pm today, asked all attorneys to submit resignation letters," deputy attorney general Jahirul Islam Mukul told bdnews24.com on Monday. Contacted by bdnews24.com, the attorney general confirmed the DAG's statement. "I did not ask anyone directly to resign," he said. "I asked them to make ready their resignation letters, so as the government does not have to 'remove' them from office." "I also asked them to continue with their duties, until the president accepts their resignations," Alam said. "The AG said the letters would remain 'pending' with him," said deputy attorney general Mukul. "We will all resign tomorrow," he said. The AG's office currently includes one additional attorney general, 20 deputy attorneys general and 60 assistant attorneys general. Official sources say the government is planning to appoint three additional AGs and has already prepared a short list from among senior lawyers. bd
