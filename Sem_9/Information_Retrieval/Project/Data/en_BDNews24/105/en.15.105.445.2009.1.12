 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited kept their away winning record intact in the Citycell B. League by beating their Chittagong namesakes 1-0 in the second-leg match at MA Aziz Stadium on Monday. It was the fifth away and overall 10th triumph in 14 games for the sky blues, who are perched on top of the 11-team point table with 32 points, five ahead of Brothers Union. Brothers and Sheikh Russel KC, trailing the leaders by six points, however, have played a match less. Title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan now have 25 points from 12 outings, and the black-and-whites will face Brothers on Tuesday. Chittagong Abahani, who are yet to taste win in the second-leg four matches, remained at 13 from 14 matches. The going got tough for Dhaka Abahani, who missed Ghanaian playmaker Awudu Ibrahim, medio Pranotosh and Nigerian striker Emeka Christiana due to bookings. They lost the ball in the midfield and the port city outfit almost denied their more illustrious rivals in the first half before defender Wali Faisal broke the deadlock in the 45th minute. However, Wali's strike was apparently an own goal by opposing defender Mintu, who in desperation to clear a cross drove it home. Wali's strike was enough to see off the hosts though striker Jahid Hasan Emily missed from the spot in the 32nd minute to disappoint the reigning champions. Emily was brought down inside the danger zone by defender Nazir, but Abahani's national striker was denied by netminder Golam Mustafa. After resumption, Abahani went into a defensive shell but managed to get away with full three points
