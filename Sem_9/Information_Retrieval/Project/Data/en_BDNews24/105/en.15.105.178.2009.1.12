<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)The new government has not meddled with the Anticorruption Commission's activities so far, said ACC director general Col Hanif Iqbal on Monday. "The ACC has so far been working independently, unimpeded by the government," he said at a routine press briefing. Asked if the ACC would ask newly sworn-in ministers to submit wealth statements, he said, "It's up to the government to decide. The commission initiates its probe only after it receives allegations against an individual." Meanwhile, a two-member US government team met the top ACC officials to exchange views on allegations against former prime minister Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco of pocketing some $200 million in bribes to award work orders to different companies. On the Coco case, Hanif said according to the agreement executed between the two countries the US and Bangladesh are entitled to seek each other's cooperation in identifying any criminal act, exchanging related information and providing assistance in investigation and prosecution. bdnews24.
