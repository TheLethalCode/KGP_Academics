 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Two sensible knocks from Roqibul Hasan and Mehrab Hossain Junior helped Bangladesh level the three-ODI series 1-1 with a convincing six-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the second match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Mushfiqur Rahim struck pacer Tawanda Mupariwa for four and six in two successive deliveries as Bangladesh raced to 164 for four with 31 balls to spare after restricting Zimbabwe to 160 for nine in 50 overs. The series-decider takes place on Friday. Roqibul remained unbeaten on 52, his fifth ODI fifty, while Mehrab fell seven runs short of what would have been a deserved fifty. Mushfiqur chipped in with a 20-ball 13 not out. Mehrab, asked to open the innings with Tamim Iqbal in place of off-form Junaed Siddique, justified his inclusion to Bangladesh's fragile top-order with signs of a long innings from the word go. The young opener played off pacer Edward Rainsford at forward leg for a double and struck a four in the very next ball to pick up seven runs in the opening over to give Bangladesh a fine start before Tamim fell. Tamim initially struggled but grew in confidence to club Prosper Utseya and Rainsford for fours in two successive overs and welcomed first-change Mupariwa with a risky four in the fourth delivery. But taking another risk, trying to flick, he missed the line in the next delivery to bury his prospects on just 21 off 27 balls studded with three boundaries. Mohammad Ashraful joined Mehrab, but the Bangladesh captain once again misjudged wide ball outside off-stump off a Rainsford delivery only to give catch to Utseya at short-cover for five. He left the side at 42 for two in 15.1 overs. Roqibul and Mehrab kept their cool, unlike their more illustrious fellow batsmen, to take the side to 94 for three in 27.4 overs before the latter lost his concentration to fall to Raymond Price. Left-handed opener Mehrab came down the wicket against left-arm spinner Price to swing across the line and holed up straight to Utseya at midwicket to finish a sensible innings, including five boundaries  just what the team had sought from the top-order batsmen. Shakib Al Hasan played a quick 24-ball 22, studded with three boundaries, before Utseya had him caught behind by wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu. But, by then Bangladesh had almost reached the target, needing only 36 runs with six wickets in hand. Roqibul clubbed seven fours in his 100-ball innings and Mushfiqur ensured the rout without further damage. Sean Williams had earlier struck his eighth ODI fifty to lift Zimbabwe to 160 for nine from a precarious position. Williams, batting at number five, hit 59 to put on 96 runs for the seventh wicket along with Prosper Utseya after pace duo Nazmul Hossain and Rubel Hossain dented the top-order. Both Williams and Utseya concentrated on singles to build confidence as Bangladesh fielders allowed them to settle in after reducing Zimbabwe to 47 for six inside 19 overs. Williams clubbed three fours and one six facing 89 balls before being run out in the 48th over. Utseya made a patient 38 off 101 balls until he was trapped leg before by Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who also dismissed Raymond Price in the last delivery of the final over. Put in to bat first, Zimbabwe got off to a fine start before Nazmul struck double blows in two successive overs to remove both openers Hamilton Masakadza (17) and Vusimuzi Sibanda (7) and reduced the visitors to 29 for two in 11.2 overs. Rubel Hossain joined the party, having Tatenda Taibu (3) caught brilliantly by Mehrab Hossain Junior for three. Mashrafee forced Stuart Matsekenyeri (10) to be run out by a direct through from the non-striking end. Nazmul bowled Elton Chigumbura (1) with a superb in-swinger and Rubel beat Malcolm Waller (1) through pace to uproot the stumps, leaving Zimbabwe wobbling at 47 for six in 18.3. But, Williams and Utseya stuck to the pitch to give their bowlers a target to bowl at. Nazmul grabbed three for 28 while Mashrafee and Rubel chipped in with two wickets each for 22 and 29 respectively. bdn
