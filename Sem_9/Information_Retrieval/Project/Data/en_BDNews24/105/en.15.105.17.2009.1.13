 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Former finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has termed the reduction of the price of diesel and kerosene by Tk 2 per litre as "practical." "The benefits of this will be enjoyed by farmers," he said after a meeting with finance minister AMA Muhit at the ministry. "The minister wanted to be briefed about the overall economic situation and possible economic challenges," said Mirza Aziz. "I told the minister that foreign currency, food and fertiliser reserves are satisfactory," said the former adviser. "I also told him that we have added 450 megawatts in the power sector and if the agreements signed by us are implemented, then an additional 1100-1150 megawatts will be added soon." The former adviser also stressed the need to stem losses to the jute and sugar sectors. Mirza Aziz welcomed the fact that the price of diesel and kerosene had not been reduced too drastically, saying that if the price went much lower the possibility of fuel being smuggling out of the country would arise. Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, referring to the revised diesel and kerosene price said, "I think we have done right." The minister also said it would benefit farmers and food production. Mirza Aziz also identified labour cost as a major component of food production cost. "But the government has no way to reduce labour cost because the income of the poor people is linked with this." The former adviser said of the caretaker government: "We managed to produce a record amount of food grain and therefore, the price of food grain must go down." But with falling food price, profit will plunge and eventually production will also plummet, he added. "So, these factors need to be considered in fixing the price of food grain." Talking about global recession he said that it did not affect Bangladesh due to a healthy flow of remittance. bdnews
