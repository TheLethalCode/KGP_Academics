 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court bench has ordered Bangladesh Biman Airlines to reinstate 54 terminated employees. A HC bench comprising Justices AFM Abdur Rahman and SM Emdadul Huq gave the order on Monday after a full hearing of petitions submitted by the employees including terminated Biman official Zahir Akhtar. The HC also ordered the payment of all dues and benefits to the 54 persons in question. Since March 2007, the national carrier has handed out mandatory retirement to over 2,000 officials and workers. A writ challenging the legality of the mandatory retirement and termination was submitted in 2007 and on Monday the HC gave a verdict on 54 cases. Hearing on behalf of the writ petitioners was carried out by barrister Nazrul Islam and advocate Salauddin Dolon. 'Officials and workers were terminated without any valid reason," observed barrister Nazrul Islam. "Biman terminated and retired people without showing any cause and by handing out unequal retirement benefits," said Salauddin Dolon. After considering these issues, the HC passed a ruling terming the termination orders illegal, he added. Salauddin Dolon also said that, according to the verdict, terminated officials and workers will be reinstated with their dues and benefits. bdnew
