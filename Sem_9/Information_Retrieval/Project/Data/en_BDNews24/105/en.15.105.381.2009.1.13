 KARACHI, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf believes Shoaib Malik does not deserve to be the national captain and said his appointment was an injustice.

Yousuf was one of several senior players overlooked for the captaincy after Pakistan's first round exit from the last World Cup. Yousuf, who set a world record for most test runs in a calendar year in 2006, said he still wanted to play for Pakistan but did not regret his decision to join the ICL.
