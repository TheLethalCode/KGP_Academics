<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opener Salman Butt slammed an undefeated century to power Pakistan to an eight-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the first one-day international on Tuesday. Pakistan stormed to a 1-0 lead in the three-match series after Butt struck his eight career century and helped produce a 168-run opening stand with Khurrum Manzoor (83). All Butt's hundreds have come against Asian teams including five against India and two versus Bangladesh. Butt was on 100 from 117 balls with 13 fours when Pakistan finished on 220 for two in 45.5 overs chasing Sri Lanka's total of 219 runs at National Stadium. "I rate this as one of my most satisfying innings as it came against the best spin attack in the world," Butt said. "Considering the hype surrounding (Ajantha) Mendis and (Muttiah) Muralitharan the hundred was valuable," he added. Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar returned to the one-day team after a gap of 14 months but failed to claim a wicket. Manzoor, who hit nine fours in his 128-ball innings, was out in the 38th over after hitting straight back to spinner Muralitharan. Younis Khan (20) was the second man out, caught off Farveez Maharoof. GOOD TRACK Paceman Rao Iftikhar returned career best figures of four for 42 and Umar Gul took three wickets to bowl out Sri Lanka in 45.2 overs on a good batting track. The left-handed Butt and right-handed Manzoor faced no problems bringing up their century stand in 146 balls. After a slow start of seven runs in five overs and 32 in 10, the youngsters even neutralised the threat of unorthodox spinner Mendis, who failed to claim a wicket in his seven overs. Butt took only 66 balls to reach his 10th fifty with seven fours while Manzoor brought up his third half century in his fifth international from 93 balls with five boundaries. The impressive Iftikhar had a double strike in one over and was ably supported by Gul, who took three for 30, as the pair overshadowed the return of Shoaib. The fast bowler, still entangled in a court battle with the Pakistan board over disciplinary issues, was wicket less in his seven overs as Sri Lanka openers Tillakaratne Dilshan (42) and Sanath Jayasuriya (38) put on 71 in 53 balls. Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik was delighted with his team's victory after their long absence from international cricket. "It was not easy for us out there today but our game plan against Mendis worked," he said, adding that the batsmen were told to play Mendis on merit. "I think (the fact) that we were not chasing a big total helped us play him well.
