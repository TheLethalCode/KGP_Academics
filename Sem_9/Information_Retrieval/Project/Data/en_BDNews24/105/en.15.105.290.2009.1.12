 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The committee formed for evaluation of 120 ordinances passed by the caretaker government has started scrutinising the laws. "It will take quite a time to finish the task of scrutinising 120 ordinances passed by the caretaker government," said law minister Shafiq Ahmed on Monday. After chairing the committee's first meeting at his office, the law minister said, "Some tasks have been completed but more meetings will be needed to finish the job." "Nearly half of the assignment is done and we'll sit again on Jan 15," he said. "We'll try to finish the job before Jan. 25 so that the ordinances can be ratified in the first sitting of parliament," Shafiq Ahmed said. Parliament will have to decide whether or not to pass the ordinances into law within 30 days, the minister added. Asked if the constitution may have to be amended to validate any of the ordinances, the minister said, "This is not at the discretion of the committee, this is an issue that the cabinet and the parliament would look into." "We'll make recommendations on the issue, and the government will decide the next course of actions.' The meeting attended among others by law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal, additional secretary Mohammad Shahidul Haque, legal expert Dr M Zahir, barrister Rafiqul Haque, barrister Azmalul Haque QC, Toufique Newaz and MP Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash. bdnew
