 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)-- Citing latest trade data, exporters say the Bangladesh economy has apparently steered clear of global financial meltdown. According to government figures for five months to November, exports grew nearly 27 percent over the same five months last fiscal. According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), Bangladesh exported products worth US$ 6551.5 million in the first five months of the current fiscal year. Last year, the amount was US$ 5166.6 million. Top exporters are elated, shrugging off fears of any negative impact in the future. "The October figures scared us a bit. But the export volume in November has made us believe that Bangladesh may not see a downward trend in export," BKMEA president Fazlul Haq told bdnews24.com on Sunday. The BGMEA chief was equally upbeat. "The November (export)figure is indeed encouraging," Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez told bdnews24.com Sunday. "I don't really expect a slowdown." Knitwear was the largest contributor to the export earning and growth. Knitwear exports went beyond the expected US $2574.2 million to US $2736.7 million in the first five months. This meant knitwear grew nearly 35 per cent on the same period last year. Woven products also made more money than hoped. Woven exports were to the tune of US $2305.3 million, while the official target was US $2222.45 million. The growth for woven was 25 percent. Frozen foods also fared fantastically. The official target was US $224.48 million, but shrimp and other frozen foods fetched US $242.38 million in those five months. Tea, terry towel, footwear, textile fabrics, pharmaceuticals all crossed their exports. bdne
