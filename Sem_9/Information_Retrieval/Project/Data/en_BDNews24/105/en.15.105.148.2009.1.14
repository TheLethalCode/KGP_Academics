 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion traced a fake 'blood bank' in Mirpur on Wednesday and arrested two traders for selling unhygienic blood products. Acting on a tip-off, the RAB-1 team raided the counterfeit blood bank at Bara Bari area, behind Mirpur Police Station, and arrested the two men identified as 'Mizan' and 'Sujan', RAB-1's major Saiful Islam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. The elite force also recovered five bags of blood including three syringes, he said. "Hospital workers are involved in the illegal blood trade making deals with middlemen," said the RAB officer. The blood is sold at Tk 800-850 per bag, he added. "The blood is often collected from drug addicts. One bag may contain the blood of two-three people," Maj Saiful said. Warning receivers of blood products, the RAB officer said that such blood might cause the death of patients. bdnews
