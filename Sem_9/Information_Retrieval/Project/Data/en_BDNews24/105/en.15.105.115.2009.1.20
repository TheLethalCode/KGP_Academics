 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)As Barack Obama makes the historic move into the White House Tuesday, environmentalists in Bangladesh hope to see a balanced policy on climate change and bio-fuels from the new US administration. "To the people of poor nations, we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow; to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds," Obama said in his inaugural speech, after being sworn in as the 44th president of the United States on Tuesday. "And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty, we say we can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For the world has changed, and we must change with it." For Bangladesh, as with other food deficit nations, the large-scale conversion of corn and wheat into bio-fuels, which threatens global food security and food aid to poor countries, has been a contentious US policy. On the frontline of climate change, Bangladeshis also have high expectations of the new US administration cutting greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 and playing its due role in December's climate talks in Copenhagen. "The world's food supply depends on the US," M Asaduzzaman, research director at Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS), told bdnews24.com Tuesday. "Obama should not risk global food security by turning corn and wheat into ethanol for fuelling cars." Obama, elected on Nov 4 last year, had said in the lead up to his election that he would promote bio-fuel and reduce dependence on fossil fuels as oil price peaked to around $148 per barrel last year. Now, oil has plummeted to around $40 per barrel. Environmentalist Atiq Rahman, winner of last year's UNEP prize, told bdnews24.com, "If corn continues to be turned into bio-fuel we will continue our fight. Adequate food must be available in the international market". According to media reports, the US consumed 25 percent of its corn production as bio-fuel in 2007 leading to just one percent reduction in the country's oil consumption. In 2008, 30 percent of the US corn crop will be converted to ethanol, according to May 2008 forecasts. "US food aid to Bangladesh could well be reduced if the US continues to promote bio-fuel," said Asaduzzaman. "The aid is important for implementing many development projects in Bangladesh," he said. Bangladesh, a food-deficit country with a population of more than 140 million, gets a significant portion of food aid from the US  some $2.5 billion since 1972, according to the local USAID office. The two environmentalists also hoped the Obama administration would play its role to reduce CO2 emissions of carbon dioxide to counter climate change and save vulnerable countries like Bangladesh. Bangladesh would be one of the worst victims of climate change, losing significant land area if sea levels rise. "I hope that Obama will respond to the calls of the G-77 and the LDC groups of countries and agree to cut emissions 80 percent by 2050," Asaduzzaman said. The G-8, group of eight industrialised nations, have already agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent within the period. Asaduzzaman said the new US administration could also help the poor countries like Bangladesh by transferring low-carbon technology to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions. "Indications show that Obama is serious about renewable energy to reduce emissions in the future. His administration could play a hugely positive role in the climate change talks in Copenhagen," said Atiqur. bdn
