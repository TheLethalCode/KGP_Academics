<TITLE> Tough antigraft stance should boost foreign aid: Muhit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhit has expressed hope that Bangladesh's strong stance against corruption will help increase foreign aid. "Within the next three years, the revenue budget and development budget will be merged to give one single budget," he said on Monday. "This will ensure transparency and accountability." The minister made these comments at a discussion with officials of the External Relations Division at the NEC auditorium on Monday. Emphasising increased foreign aid in view of the country's present scenario, the minister asked his colleagues in the ministry to take it as a challenge. "When I was a secretary of this department 30 years ago, foreign aid constituted more than 12 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product and slowly, that has fallen below three per cent." Due to delays in the implementation of projects, corruption and inefficiency of officials, donor countries and agencies have reduced aid, he said. But, the minister also said that since the new government has taken a strong position against corruption, the amount of aid is likely to rise in the future. "Though we have many complications in utilising foreign aid, Bangladesh has never failed in repaying a loan with interest," said AMA Muhit. In repayment, we have a solid reputation that most countries lack, he added. "I am thinking of asking the donors to give us the money, that we repay them each year with interest ,as budget assistance." I shall support this demand with our reputation as a prompt loan returnee, observed the minister. "But for this, the efficiency of ERD officials has to increase." Defending the decision to give a single integrated budget instead of two on revenue and development, the finance minister said, "The government faces various problems with two separate budgets; accountability and transparency also cannot always be ensured." "In three years the country will see a single budget," he concluded. Abul Maal Abdul Muhit also said that all development oriented promises made in the electoral manifesto will be implemented. bdnew
