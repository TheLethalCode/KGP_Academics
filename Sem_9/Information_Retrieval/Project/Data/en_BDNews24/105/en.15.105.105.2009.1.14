<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com) The government will assign two new judges to expedite the trial of the Bangabandhu murder case, said the law minister on Wednesday. "None of the past governments took care to accomplish the trial of the important case," law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at his office. "On the contrary, the murderers were rewarded and justice thwarted." "The Awami League government took the initiative to start trial of the case in 1996," the minister said. Independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and almost all members of his family were assassinated on Aug 15 1975, by a group of army officers. The trial of the "heinous crime" is finally in its last stage now, said Shafiq. The law minister said the attorney general's office would take necessary steps to appoint the two judges to finish the trial of the case. Replying to a query as to whether there was any obstacle to the outgoing speaker administering oaths to BNP lawmakers-elect, he said: "There is no legal constraint to the speaker's swearing in the MPs-elect till a new speaker is elected by parliament." bdnews24.
