 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Ferry operations on Paturia-Doulatdia and Mawa-Kawrakandi routes resumed on Wednesday after being suspended for hours in the early hours due to heavy fog, but passengers were left to battle severe traffic chaos at terminals in its wake. bdnews24.com Manikganj correspondent said that Paturia-Doulatdia ferry movements resumed at around 10am. BIWTC Doulatdia office assistant manager Orpon Kumar Chanda told bdnews24.com that traffic tailbacks could be seen for some three to four kms at Doulatdia terminal. bdnews24.com Munshiganj correspondent said that ferry operation on the Mawa-Kawrakandi route resumed at around 9:30 am after being suspended from about 6am, but hundreds of vehicles remained stuck at Mawa. BIWTC Mawa terminal manager Sirajul Islam told bdnews24.com that it would take two hours to get the situation back to normal. Assistant manager Chandra Shekhor Roy said it took three and a half hours to cross the Padma due to poor navigability on the Mawa-Kawrakandi route. The ferries were still taking time on the river due to limited navigability and it would take time for traffic tailbacks to clear even after the fog had cleared, the official said. bdnews24.c
