<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club and Sheikh Russel KC played a 1-1 draw in the crucial B. League tense-encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. Abdul Baten Komol put Mohammedan ahead in the very fourth minute before Moroccan Samir Omari leveled the margin for Sheikh Russel in the 20th minute. The draw meant a blow for both sides, as both needed a must-win to close the gaps with league leaders Abahani Limited by winning the match. The defending champions, Abahani, still stay atop with 35 points from 15 outings, four and six points clear of Sheikh Russel KC and Dhaka Mohammedan. The Black and Whites, however, played a match less than the league leaders and Sheikh Russel, who went 2-1 down to Mohammedan in the first-leg match. The match had apparently become a battlefield for both sides who irked each other through rough plays prompting referee Azad Rahman to warn seven players during the match. Mohammedan, however, enjoyed a superior ball procession in the second half but their forwards launched a series of vain attacks leading to fifth draw in 14 outings. Picking a ball from a fellow teammate, Mohammad Robin advanced into Sheikh Russel's danger zone before defender Jahirul Islam charged the young striker roughly inside the box and referee Azad did not hesitate to award Mohammedan a 12-yard spot kick in the fourth minute. Komol converted the spot kick, but Mohammedan lost Robin, who was forced to be side-lined to allow Faisal Hossain in. Sheikh Russel leveled the margin with Omari converting a spot kick in the 20th minute. Capitalising on a through pass from winger Mobarak Hossain, Omari darted in the box before Mohammedan defender Rajani Kanta Barman seeming charged on the ball, and the referee awarded Sheikh Russel a 'dispute' penalty shot to help Sheikh Russel come back in the game. After resumption, Mohammedan bossed the midfield and yielded a lot of scoring chances, but failed to cash in on any. From a counter attack, Nigerian striker Alamu Bukola Olaleken advanced into the box to smash a fine drive in the 75th minute that kissed the side-net of Sheikh Russel to frustrate a huge number of Mohammedan fans. One minute later, Mohammedan net minder Aminul Haque frustrated Sheikh Russel winger Mobarak, who ran down the right to get Aminul in one-on-one situation, but finally failed to beat the national goalkeeper.
