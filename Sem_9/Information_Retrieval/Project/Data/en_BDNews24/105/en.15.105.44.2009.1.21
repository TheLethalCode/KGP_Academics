 COLOMBO, Wed Jan 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A blast authorities blamed on Tamil Tiger rebels killed two people and wounded 11 others on Wednesday in eastern Sri Lanka, police said. The explosion in the town of Batticaloa came as the military has cornered the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northeast of the Indian Ocean island nation and is fighting toward a decisive battle to end the 25-year-war. "An explosion in Batticaloa town has killed one police officer, a civilian and injured 11 others including four schoolchildren," police spokesman Ranjith Gunasekara said. He blamed the LTTE for the blast. The LTTE could not be reached for comment. The blast came a day after the navy destroyed four Tiger boats off the northeastern coast and ground troops were surging fast toward the separatist rebels' last remaining strongholds in and around the port of Mullaittivu
