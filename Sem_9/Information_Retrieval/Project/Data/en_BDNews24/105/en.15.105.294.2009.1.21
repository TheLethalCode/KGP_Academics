 NEW DELHI, Wed Jan 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India rejected on Wednesday a suggestion by Britain that security in South Asia was linked to the Kashmir dispute, and urged nations to act against states which sponsor terrorism. "When the foreign secretary of the UK visited us he shared his perceptions about the situations, and I equally told him and all the interlocutors that this is your perception," Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters. "We do not share with it," he said. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said last week he did not believe Pakistan's government directed the November attacks in Mumbai that killed 179 people, and showed no support for India's demand for extradition of the accused. He also said stability in South Asia was linked to resolution of the dispute over Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim in full but rule only in part. Miliband's comments were seen as embarrassing the Indian government and highlighting a chasm between New Delhi and some of its key Western allies, which think there may not be enough evidence to implicate the Pakistani state. India says Pakistan militants that carried out that attack must have had the support of some state agencies. But what has alarmed India the most was Miliband's comment on Kashmir, cause of two wars with Pakistan. India, analysts say, is worried Miliband's comments signalled a broader Western strategy that sees resolution of the dispute as crucial to bringing stability to Pakistan and Afghanistan. India sees Kashmir as a bilateral issue and dismisses any outside influence. Reiterating India's frustration at Pakistan's failure to act against the militant group India blames for the Mumbai raids, Mukherjee urged the international community to act fast. "It is high time for international community to recognise that such recalcitrant states must be brought to discipline by resorting to various international mechanisms," he told a regional security conference in New Delhi on Wednesday. India has provided Pakistan data from satellite phones used by the attackers and what it describes as the confession of a surviving gunman, part of a dossier of what it calls evidence. Islamabad, which denies any state involvement in the attacks, has said it would look at the "information" India had provided. Besides demanding extradition of the accused, India also wants Pakistan to destroy what it says are militant camps
