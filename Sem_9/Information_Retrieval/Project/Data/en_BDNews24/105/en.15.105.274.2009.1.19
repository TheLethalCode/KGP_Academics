 KARACHI, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia are not keen to tour Pakistan for a one-day series in April and May and the matches could be played at neutral venues, Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ejaz Butt said on Monday. Butt told a news conference after a meeting of the governing board that Australia had indicated it still had security issues playing in Pakistan. "Chances of them agreeing to play in Pakistan are slim. They have asked us to suggest three neutral venues where the series can be relocated," Butt said. He said England, Malaysia and the Emirates states of Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Dubai were under consideration to host the five one-day internationals and a twenty20 match. Butt said the neutral venues would be discussed when he met with Cricket Australia officials in Perth later this month during the ICC executive board meeting. Australia refused to tour Pakistan last year for a test series citing security and safety concerns for its players. The Australians have not played in Pakistan since 1998 and a test series in 2002 was also relocated to Colombo and Sharjah. "We want Australia to play in Pakistan but our first priority is to ensure the series is played. We have to be realistic, flexible and pragmatic about having this series," Butt added
