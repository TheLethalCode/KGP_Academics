 LONDON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson hit back at Liverpool counterpart Rafael Benitez on Sunday, describing the Spaniard's extraordinary verbal attack on him as 'ridiculous'. Benitez accused Ferguson of getting away with comments about referees during a four-minute monologue on Friday, also saying the Scot was nervous because Liverpool are top of the league. After United thrashed Chelsea 3-0 on Sunday to close the gap to Liverpool to five points with two games in hand, Ferguson dismissed Benitez's comments.

"I think he was an angry man and was disturbed and that's all I want to say about it. At this moment in time I just want to concentrate on chasing the leaders who are Liverpool.
