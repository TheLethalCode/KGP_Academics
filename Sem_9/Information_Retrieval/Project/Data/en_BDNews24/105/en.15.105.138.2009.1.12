<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government, having decided to reduce the cost of diesel and fertiliser to boost farm ouput, is likely to announce the new prices in a day or two, the prime minister's press secretary said after a cabinet meeting on Monday. "There is a possibility of announcing new prices of diesel and fertiliser by today or tomorrow," Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after the meeting at the Secretariat. "The prime minister will adjust the diesel price consulting with the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission," he said. Sheikh Hasina sat with BERC representatives Monday afternoon. After the talks, BERC chairman Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation will apply to the commission to cut diesel price. The commission will decide on it after reviewing the application." On how many days it might take, he said: "It may happen today or it may take one or two days." "We have to take it under consideration oil prices of neighbouring countries while fixing prices. We have to be careful so that our diesel is not smuggled across the border," the chairman said. Hasina's press secretary also said after the earlier cabinet meeting: "The number of committees will be minimised to ease administration. There are currently 24 committees under the ministries at different levels of government." The next meeting might set the number, he said. The cabinet also approved an annual list of holidays, including 13 national holidays and nine government holidays to be observed in line with an executive order, said Azad. The cabinet decided to observe the March 17 birthday of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as National Children's Day, though not as a public holiday, he said. Minister GM Quader told reporters after the meeting that Aug 15 would be observed as National Mourning Day and the day would be a national holiday. "There is a court order in this regard," he added. bdnew
