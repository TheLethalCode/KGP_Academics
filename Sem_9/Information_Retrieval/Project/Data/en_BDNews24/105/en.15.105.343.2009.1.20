 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)A two-judge High Court bench has declared illegal the Dhaka University admission criteria requiring students to have studied a minimum two 100-mark courses in both Bangla and English at higher secondary level. The HC bench, of justices Mir Hasmat Ali and Shamim Hasnain, gave the order on Tuesday after hearing a writ petition. Barrister Abdur Razzak, the petitioners' lawyer, told reporters that the ruling lifted all restrictions on the madrassah students, clearing their way for seeking admission into any discipline at Dhaka University. Shah Deen Malik, the lawyer for Dhaka University, said he would discuss with the university authorities whether they would appeal against verdict. The HC on Oct 26 last year issued a rule nisi following a writ petition filed by five madrassah students challenging the legality of the decision of the university authorities, which barred them admission. Seven DU departments imposed the condition on students seeking admission. The seven were: Bangla, English, Economics, Mass Communication and Journalism, International Relations, Linguistics, and Gender and Women Studies. The HC on Dec 2 halted the admission process of the seven subjects for 2008-09 session.
