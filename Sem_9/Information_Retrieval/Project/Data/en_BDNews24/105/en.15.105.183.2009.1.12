 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene on Monday said he was confident to defend 210 for six against Zimbabwe in the second match of the Tri-Nation Cup with the bowlers he had. "We knew that we can defend any total with the bowlers that we have got. So we were confident," said Jayawardene at a post-match briefing. Pacer Nuwan Kulasekara and sensational spinner Ajantha Mendis shared six wickets to steer Sri Lanka to a convincing 130-run win over Zimbabwe, who on Saturday stunned Bangladesh with a 38-run defeat in the tournament opener. After posting a moderate total on the board, Sri Lanka skittled Zimbabwe out for a meagre 80 inside 29 overs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. The Lankan skipper said he had no complaint about playing on a flat wicket but said it was 'tough'. "Sometimes you know you will struggle. But the good thing was that you knew a few of our guys fought really well to get through the situation," said the 31-year old batsman, whose side slumped to 97 for five before Angelo Mathews struck an unbeaten maiden fifty to lift the side to a moderate total. Tail-end batsmen Jehan Mubarak (31), Mathews (52) and Thilan Thushara (28) played vital roles after middle-order batsmen Kumar Sangakkara (4), Jayawardene (0) and Chamara Kapugedera (4) had fallen cheaply. "Angelo has got potential. He has proved that over and over with the A team and Under-19 side. When we have the opportunity to get him in the squad, he paid a lot of dividend to us. He is very consistent with the bat," Jayawardene observed. The Lankan skipper thought in the end of innings the wicket tended to keep a bit low, helping the spinners, but his batsmen, being put in to bat first, handled the situation very well. "Ajanta has been something special for us. He has now achieved a very good milestone. We are quite happy with him. We will celebrate the occasion," he added. Ajantha grabbed three wickets for 15 while spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan took two for four after Kulasekara rattled the top order to return three for 13. Zimbabwean skipper Prosper Utseya said their performance was disappointing and that they had approached the game with a wrong mindset. "The approach when we batted I think it was a wrong mindset. We needed someone to put his hands up and bat for a long time. One of our top four batsmen should have scored," said Utseya. The Zimbabwean captain said they would have to wait how Bangladesh and Sri Lanka were going to play. After losing the first match against Zimbabwe, Bangladesh must win against Sri Lanka to have any chances of playing the final though all teams will be levelled if Sri Lanka go down to the hosts. Jayawardene, however, warned that they would play hard against Bangladesh in the group final match
