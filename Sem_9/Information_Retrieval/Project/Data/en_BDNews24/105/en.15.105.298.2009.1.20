<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan fast bowler Mohammad Asif was granted a release from his Indian Twenty20 league contract on Monday, a week before his appeal against a positive dope test. The bowler was suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after testing positive for a banned substance in the inaugural Indian Premier League (IPL) tournament last year. His B sample also returned positive. "Due to personal reasons I'm having to take this step, and definitely it has not been easy as I still have a contract valid for another two seasons, with lucrative financial benefits," Asif said in a statement released by his Dehli-based side. "I'm going through a tremendous amount of pressure... My only purpose and wish is to play for my nation Pakistan again, and for that I need to disengage from any other cricket engagements," Asif, who has played 11 tests and 31 one-dayers, said. The bowler was also detained in Dubai for 19 days last June after customs officials found opium in his wallet while he returned home from playing in the IPL. The public prosecutor's office did not press charges but Asif was deported from Dubai
