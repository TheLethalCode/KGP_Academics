<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  The government has sought a bigger loan than already promised from the Asian Development Bank for construction of the Padma Bridge, the communications minister said on Wednesday. "ADB has already pledged financial assistance of $350 million for the Padma Bridge. But we have sought more from them," Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after a meeting with visiting ADB vice president Xiaoyu Zhao at his office. ADB has so far invested significantly in infrastructure in Bangladesh, the minister said. "The ADB vice president has ensured that he will discuss the matter with concerned officials," Abul Hossain said. Zhao told reporters the Manila-based multilateral lender was working for the economic development of the region. He said he hoped the new government would work efficiently and take the country forward. bdnew
