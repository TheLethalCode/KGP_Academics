 Brisbane, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) - Cameron White's brutal innings of 40 ensured Australia claimed a clean sweep in the Twenty20 series after a six-wicket win over South Africa. The all-rounder put on 69 in just 35 balls with Mike Hussey (53 not out) to take the match away from the tourists. Set 158 to win, the home side faltered at 29-2 before a 71-run stand between captain Ricky Ponting (38) and Hussey injected fresh impetus to the innings. JP Duminy's 69 from 41 balls was the highlight of South Africa's 157. The left-hander was once again the outstanding performer in yet another indifferent batting performance from South Africa, according to bbcnews. He smashed seven boundaries and two sixes on an uncharacteristically sluggish pitch in Brisbane, but finding support at the non-striker's end proved more difficult. However, lower order cameos from Mark Boucher (19) and Albie Morkel (19) ensured South Africa ended their 20 overs with a competitive total. James Hopes was the pick of the Australia bowlers, finishing with 2-29 from his four overs. The interval saw Matthew Hayden, who announced his retirement from first-class cricket earlier in the day, embark on a lap of honour in front of a 50,000 strong crowd at his home ground at the Gabba. South Africa captain John Botha took advantage of the unresponsive pitch to open the bowling with his off-spin, an unorthodox move which surprised Australia's openers. And after reaching a pedestrian 21 from five overs, David Warner - fresh from his ferocious 89 from 43 balls on debut in Melbourne on Sunday - eventually succumbed in the fifth over when he was bowled attempting to swipe Dale Steyn over mid-on. Opening partner Shaun Marsh followed, but Hussey and Ponting began the rescue operation with a patient third-wicket stand. Hussey was given a lifeline on two when Mark Boucher spilled a difficult stumping chance off Botha in the 10th over. And the left-hander capitalised on his fortune, striking five boundaries and a six during his assured innings. Although South Africa managed to dismiss Ponting and David Hussey - caught by a brilliant take at full stretch from Duminy running backwards at full speed at deep mid-off - the tourists bowled too full as White and Hussey took advantage. And White clinched the match in sensational style with a huge six over long-off.
