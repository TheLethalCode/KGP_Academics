 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhit has promised a permanent pay commission to raise salary and benefits for government workers, in line with an initiative of the immediate past caretaker government. "Such a promise was made in our electoral manifesto and we are thinking about a permanent commission to fulfil our pre-poll pledge," said the finance minister on Wednesday after talking with members of the 7th Pay Commission. Meanwhile, chairman of the commission, M Mustafizur Rahman has said that a final report on this will be submitted to the government at the end of March or at the beginning of April. The 7th Pay Commission was formed in September under the caretaker government with Rahman as its head. "We were given the task in September of forming a permanent commission with a six month deadline and hopefully the work will be done on time," he observed. Rahman said that a salary structure will be recommended based on inflation. Muhit pointed out: "A non-permanent pay commission makes a recommendation every 5-7 years and salary increments are made based on that, but this is not ideal." The finance minister said a permanent pay commission would overcome such complications in the system such as having to declare dearness allowances. The caretaker government declared a 20 per cent dearness allowance for government officials and workers for the current 2008-2009 fiscal year. bdnews24.
