<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Near simultaneous break-ins took place at Railway headquarters and regional offices in Dhaka and Chittagong, with looting of valuables and papers, officials said Monday. A group of unknown attackers broke into Railway Bhaban in Dhaka on Sunday night, ransacking nearly 60 rooms and stealing cash and other valuables. Meanwhile, two back-to-back breaks-in took place Eastern Zone Office of Bangladesh Railway in the port city, on either Friday or Saturday night and on Sunday night, said police. "There might be an organised intention for the serial breaks-in," the communication minister Syed Abul Hossain told reporters after visiting Railway Bhaban in Dhaka Monday afternoon. He said they were investigating possible motives behind the incident. "We will see whether the incident took place to 'remove' any documents of the previous government," Hossain added. Railway Bhaban had seen a similar break-in some years earlier, when intruders had taken away hard-discs of a number of computers relating to key railway departments. DHAKA BREAK-IN Railway Bhaban employees saw dozens of offices were broken into from the first to sixth floor on Monday morning "We have been given a list of 56 rooms, which saw broken locks and cabinets and ransacked documents," Shahbagh police sub-inspector Md Nasimuddin told bdnews24.com. A four-member probe committee has been formed and asked submit its report within three days, the director general's personal secretary Sarder Shahdat Ali told bdnews24.com. Accounting manager Philip Rosario said that Tk 86,000 cash was found missing along with three mobile phone sets and a laptop after the break-in. Missing documents were still to be identified. The communication minister said there was a likelihood of insiders being involved along with outsiders. Authorities have temporarily suspended seven security guards in connection with the incident, said security officials. CHITTAGONG BREAK-INS The two back-to-back break-ins at Chittagong Eastern Zone Office resulted in theft of "some old documents", officials said. Police said the thieves broke in through windows over the weekend, "either on Friday or Saturday night", and on Sunday night. Two separate cases have been filed. A three-member probe committee has been formed, said divisional transport officer Masudul Arefin. Arefin claimed there was no link between break-in at the capital's Railway Bhaban and "the pilfering of documents here in Chittagong". The divisional officer told bdnews24.com, "No important papers were taken." "We are initially assuming that the thieves were just taking old papers for sale. An old timetable book and some other papers were recovered from a nearby shop Monday morning," Arefin added. bdnews24.com/corr/lh/sit/
