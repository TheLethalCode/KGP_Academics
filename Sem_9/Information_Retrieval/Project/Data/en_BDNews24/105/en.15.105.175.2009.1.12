 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Monday Bangladesh must move away from aid dependence but asked diplomats in Dhaka not to cut assistance now in the wake of crisis in rich Western economies. "It is not right that we'll continue to seek assistance for ever," Moni told journalists after a meeting with Dhaka-based diplomats and aid officials at the foreign ministry. "We are also capable of helping others," said Bangladesh's first woman foreign minister. The minister, who specialises in conflict resolution among other areas, referred to Bangladesh's role in peace keeping operations and presence of professionals in in Sub-Saharan Africa. The foreign minister said she did not expect the donors and the development partners to cut aid to Bangladesh. "No, I don't expect that to happen," Moni said in reply to a question whether the global financial crisis would reduce aid inflows. "Aid depends upon many factors," she said. "People have given us a huge mandate. I think the development partners will see it  in a positive way." The government would work to improve governance standards, she said and added she knew this was a key condition for attracting development aid. The Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in Dhaka, Swiss ambassador Dora Rapold, told reporters that international community was ready to cooperate with the new government. "The British government looks forward to working very closely indeed with the new government of this country," British high commissioner Stephan Evans told reporters after the meeting. State minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud was present at the briefing.
