 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Aspirants for the Rajuk plots in Purabachal and Uttara will get three more months to apply. The chairman of the city development authority told bdnews24.com on Tuesday night the deadline for filing application had been extended to April 30. Shafiqul Islam said application forms could be collected until April 29. He said the government decided to stretch the time-limit since the target for applications had not been met yet. It is the second time that the city developer extended the time for dropping application. On Dec. 17, the time for filing application for the housing plots was extended to Jan. 15. He added the housing plots were meant for the general people. As many as 7500 plots of different sizes are there in the two projects. The government also plans to build 120000 flats for which land has been earmarked. The housing and public works ministry in a press release on Dec. 15 said applicants for the plots may pay Tk 150 court fees instead of non-judicial stamps for their affidavits. The decision was taken due to the dearth of Tk 150 non-judicial stamps. Rajuk had asked applicants to file affidavits using Tk 150 non-judicial stamps, but vendors taking advantage of their scarcity have been selling a Tk 150 stamp for Tk 1000, the press release said. bd
