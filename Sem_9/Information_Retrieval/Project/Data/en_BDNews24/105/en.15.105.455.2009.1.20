 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Two rail and road projects costing Tk 408 crore got ECNEC's nod, while a planned link road between the capital's Indira Road and Panthapath was cancelled on Tuesday. "The meeting approved three projects, among them was a Tk 249 crore rehabilitation of Kanchan-Panchagarh section of Bangladesh Railway," planning minister AK Khandaker told reporters after the meeting held at the NEC office at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the city. Another was a Tk 159 crore for roads and other infrastructure in Jessore and Khulna districts, said the minister. The third project was a Tk 81 crore project for expansion of the Defence Services Command and Staff College at Mirpur in the city, he said. "A proposed Tk 37 crore road project linking Indira Road and Panthapath was cancelled," he said. Queried, the planning minister said, "Many major buildings would have to be demolished and private lands acquired at exorbitant prices to implement the project." On the Defence Services project, the minister said, "This is an educational development project of the internationally acclaimed Staff College where some 40 foreign defence officials study." Finance minister AMA Muhith, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury, labour and employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and communication minister Syed Abul Hossain were among those present at the meeting, Khandaker said. The Tk 26,000 crore ADP of the current fiscal year includes 904 projects, according to planning ministry officials. bdnews
