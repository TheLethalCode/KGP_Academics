<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP secretary general on Sunday night said the US federal district court filed a case against the Siemens company, not Arafat Rahman Coco who has no connections with the case. "But the media has exaggerated the case," Khandaker Delwar Hossain said at a media briefing at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. The briefing followed a meeting of the BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia with her lawyers. The allegations against former prime minister and BNP chief Khaleda Zia's younger son, Coco, include pocketing some $200 million in bribes to award work orders to different companies. "Siemens had worked during 2000-2004 when bribe was exchanged through consulting company ABC. Siemens had first bribed on May 4, 2001 when BNP was not in power," Delwar explained. "But Awami League was in power at that time. So Coco or BNP has no link with the bribery case," he added. Even the plaintiff in the case brought charges against Siemens and did not mention Coco, the BNP leader continued. He said Siemens admitted their involvement and agreed to pay compensation. TH Khan, Rafiqul Islam Miah, Ahmed Azam Khan, Kaiser Kamal were among those present at the briefing. Earlier in the day, Delwar termed ongoing bribery allegations against Coco motivated and false "propaganda". "This case is a motivated one. They are deliberately spreading misleading allegations as propaganda to defame the Zia family." Delwar spoke to reporters after visiting seriously injured BNP leader Azizul Islam at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Azizul was attacked, allegedly by Awami League supporters, in Netrokona. Delwar said: "These are false allegations. Why would he take bribes for getting somebody a work permit? There is no proof of any who paid such bribes." On recent comments of home minister Sahara Khatun on post-election violence across the country, he said, "The way our home minister spoke was simply provoking. It was very much unacceptable." "The old character of Awami League has not changed," he added. The US and UK on Sunday sought assistance from Bangladesh to get back around $200 million the BNP-led government had allegedly taken in bribes to award work orders to different companies. "The US and UK have sought our assistance in getting their money back. The transaction took place in exchange for getting work permit to various companies. We assured them of assistance," law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with the delegation of the two countries at the Secretariat. "The law ministry, finance ministry, attorney general's office and Bangladesh Bank should work jointly in assisting them to recover the money," he said. Deputy chief of US Department of Justice Linda M Samuel, Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Deborah Heprevotte and UK Institute of Management consultant Ferdous Ahmed met with the law minister. bdnews24.com
