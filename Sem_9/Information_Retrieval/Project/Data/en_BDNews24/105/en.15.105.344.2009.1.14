 CAIRO, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Cairo on Wednesday at the start of a Middle East trip that aims to bring an end to the 19-day Israeli offensive on Gaza. The UN chief is expected to hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. His trip will also take him to Jordan, Israel and Syria but he has indicated he would not have direct contacts with the Hamas militants who control the Gaza Strip. Ban has called for an immediate ceasefire but both Israel and Hamas have ignored his pleas. The Israeli offensive has so far killed 971 Palestinians. Israel says 10 soldiers and three civilians hit by cross-border Hamas rockets have died
