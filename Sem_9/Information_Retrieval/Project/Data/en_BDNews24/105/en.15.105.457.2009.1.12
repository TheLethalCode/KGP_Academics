 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnew24.com)Outgoing Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar says he will administer oaths to 30 lawmakers of the BNP-led alliance on Wednesday. "I'll administer oath to the BNP MPs-elect on Jan 14, as per constitutional guidelines," Sircar told bdnews24.com on Monday in reverse of an earlier statement. The opposition MPs had earlier refused to be sworn in as scheduled on Jan 4, and the outgoing Speaker at the time had said, "I can no more administer oath to the BNP lawmakers". He had referred to Article 148 of the Constitution, which says that if the Speaker is unable to administer oath to newly elected MPs within three days of the election results being published by gazette, they must take oath from the Chief Election Commissioner or thereafter from the new Speaker. "But I was not unable or indisposed to administer oath to the newly-elected lawmakers. I administered oath to MPs of Awami League and other parties," he said on Monday. "Therefore, the article does not restrict me from administering oath to the BNP legislators-elect," said Sircar, who is a barrister. Pointing out a gap, the Speaker said there was no clear-cut directive in the Constitution whether the newly elected lawmakers would need to take oath from the new Speaker if they fail to take oath within six days from either the Speaker or the CEC. On his previous position, Sircar said, "I did not study the Article well". Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta also told bdnews24.com on Friday that the outgoing Speaker could not swear-in the BNP lawmakers-elect as per Article 148. He said the legislators who did not take oath within the stipulated six days must take oath from the new Speaker who would be elected at the first sitting of the ninth Jatiya Sangsad on Jan. 25. Suranjit also said the post of Deputy Speaker was unlikely to go to BNP as they would not be able to attend the opening of parliament without being sworn in. According to the constitution, the first sitting of a new parliament must elect a Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Whip. If the BNP MPs-elect take oath on Wednesday, the opposition party has a chance of securing the post of Deputy Speaker as pledged by the ruling Awami League. BNP and its alliesBangladesh Jaamat-e-Islami, Islami Oikya Jote and Bangaldesh Jatiya Partysecured 32 seats out of 299 parliamentary seats. BNP chief Khaleda Zia will have to vacate two of the three seats she won, giving them up for by-elections. The Awami League-led grand alliance bagged 262 seats in the Dec. 29 polls. Article 148 (2A) of the Constitution says: "If, within three days next after publication through official Gazette of the result of a general election  the person specified under the Constitution for the purpose  is unable to, or does not, administer oath to the newly elected members of Parliament, on any account, the Chief Election Commissioner shall administer such oath within three days next thereafter " If the MPs-elect fail to take oath within the stipulated six days, they will have to take oath from the new Speaker within 90 working days after the first sitting of the new parliament according to Article 67 of the constitution. bdn
