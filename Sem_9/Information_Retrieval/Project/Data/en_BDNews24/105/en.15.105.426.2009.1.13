Anwar Hossain with critical wounds was admitted to National Institute of Traumatology Orthipaedics and Rehablitation (NITOR), better known as Pongu hospital. The other injured are Khaja Ahmed Khaja Ahmed, 22, Rahim Badshah, 28, Nasir Uddin, vice president of Labour League unit-56, Biplob, 40, vice president of Labour League unit-36, and Rahmataullah, 27, were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. The clash erupted from heated arguments between Biplob and a hawker named Nayeb Ali. Biplob allegedly wanted to grab the space on the footpath in front of Gulistan Trade Central Market at 5pm where Ali had been doing business, said on-duty sergeant Bulbul of Sergeant Ahad Police Box at Gulistan. Biplob claimed he would do business there setting up his makeshift shop on the footpath, said Bulbul. He also said they had arrested four people of two front organisations of Awami League from the scene.
