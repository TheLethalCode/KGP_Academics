 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has said the government may consider changing the weekly holiday, terming business community calls for introducing a Sunday weekend "logical". "We will consider the matter of a Sunday weekend and give a decision," he said Wednesday after a meeting with FBCCI representatives. The minister asked the business leaders to gather public opinion in support of their demand. FBCCI president Anisul Huq told reporters that two urgent matters were presented to the minister: lowering of interest rates to allow industrial growth and changing of the weekly holiday to Sunday from Friday. Huq said lowering interest rates would undoubtedly boost the economy. On the change of weekend, he said: "As Sunday is a weekly holiday all over the world, we are always three and a half days behind the international market." "This has a very adverse impact on our export-import trade and the overall economy," said the chamber president. bdnews24.
