 MELBOURNE, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer took his first step towards a record-equalling 14th grand slam title with a 6-1 7-6 7-5 victory over Italy's Andreas Seppi in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday. The world number two, seeking to equal Pete Sampras's grand slam-title record of 14, romped through the first set but was made to work hard by the world number 35, who squandered several break opportunities throughout the match. "It was a close match. I think it could have gotten easier or could have gotten tougher," three-times former champion Federer told reporters. "I think the second set was kind of a close set, which was the key to the win. "He had many chances, so it was good for me to erase those. "I was pretty happy with my game. "We had long rallies (and I) had to really battle hard because it's hard to find the weak spot in Seppi's game, forehand or backhand. "I really thought he was hitting his spots really well and that kind of made it a bit more tough today." AUDACIOUS SHOT Federer proved he was in good touch, producing an audacious overarm forehand in the fifth game. He first turned and then while running at full speed glanced over his shoulder to see Seppi's positioning as the Italian approached the net and then passed him down the line. The shot drew a sustained round of applause from the crowd and a wry grin from the 27-year-old Swiss. Seppi produced a better performance in the second set, holding a set point on Federer's serve at 6-5. With the pair trading blows down the line, both appealed each other's shot with Seppi's adjudged out on television review to return the score to deuce and his advantage was lost. The second seed took a decisive 3-1 lead in the tiebreak that he extended before sealing the set 7-4. Seppi again refused to be intimidated and on several occasions matched Federer, though his ultimate failure was converting break points when he had the opportunity. Five times Seppi could have broken serve and possibly forced the match into a fourth set, and on five occasions Federer held him off. "When you miss so many (break points), it becomes a tendency, you keep on doing it," said Federer. "He was struggling with his forehand on the break points and it was good for me. "I was trying to look for that. I was playing tough. I was trying not to make any unforced errors, and it worked on those points." Federer will next meet Russian qualifier Evgeny Korolev
