 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government has halved the prices of non-urea fertilisers ahead of the Boro crop season, in its promised bid to bring food prices down by helping farmers raise output. Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury and industry minister Dilip Barua in a news briefing Wednesday said the price of TSP (triple super phosphate) was brought down from Tk 75-80 to Tk 40 per kg, MoP (murate of potash) was down from Tk 69-70 to Tk 35 and DAP (di-ammonium phosphate) from Tk 87-90 to Tk 45. However, Barua says supply of urea to Boro farmers poses a big challenge for the government. "Timely supply of fertilisers during the upcoming season will be an "an acid test for the new government", Barua told reporters after a meeting with officials of BCIC Tuesday. Barua said some 12.1 lakh metric tonnes of urea will be provided during the coming IRRI-Boro season and an additional 2.5 lakh MTs will be kept in reserve. The measures will help the farmers get fertiliser at Tk 10-12 per kg, and the additional reserve will be used to meet any unforeseen crisis, the minister said. He asked BCIC officials to change their "mindset" now that they were working for a "people's government". Meanwhile, the new government is planning to spend tens of billions of taka to build two new urea plants and overhaul the old ones in a bid to reduce dependence on urea imports, officials say. BCIC chairman Mukhlesur Rahman said, after the meeting with Barua on Tuesday, the two new factories will each cost between Tk 5,000 crore and Tk 6,000 crore while the country's six existing urea plants will be overhauled at a cost of Tk 2,800 crore within four years. The government also lowered the price of diesel from Tk 46 to Tk 44 earlier in the week, to help farmers reduce irrigation costs. The mere Tk 2 reduction has however raised eyebrows, with some observers commenting it was not a sufficient cut to be effective. Others, however, including former finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, have termed the reduction "practical" in the face of all considerations, saying the benefits will be enjoyed by farmers whereas a drastic cut in diesel price may cause other concerns. Finance minister AMA Muhit told reporters at the time that the government would not have to give subsidy for the diesel price adjustment. However, fertiliser has to be subsidised if the price is adjusted, he said, adding subsidy was a must if food output was to be upped. bdnews
