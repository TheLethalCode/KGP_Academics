 KABUL, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US-led coalition forces killed 22 militants, including two Taliban commanders, during a series of operations in Afghanistan, the US military said on Tuesday. The raids, which involved air support, took place on Monday in southern and eastern Afghanistan, the US military said. One operation targeted a Taliban network in Kapisa province, to the northeast of Kabul. Troops killed 18 insurgents and a commander, who was involved in a series of attacks against Afghan and foreign forces, the US military said in a statement. Coalition troops detained eight suspected militants during the operation, it said. In two separate raids, one Taliban commander was killed in southern Kandahar province and two more insurgents were killed in neighbouring Zabul province, the US military said. The military did not say whether there were any casualties among the foreign troops. The Taliban could not be reached for comment and Reuters was unable to verify the military's accounts. Removed from power in a US-led invasion in 2001, the Taliban have made a comeback since 2005, escalating their campaign in recent months with several high-profile attacks, including in Kabul
