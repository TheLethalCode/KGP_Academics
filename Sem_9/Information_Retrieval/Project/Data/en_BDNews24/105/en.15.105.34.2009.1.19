 MADRID, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid battled back from a goal down to beat bottom-of-the-table Osasuna 3-1 on Sunday and reclaim second spot in the Primera Liga from Sevilla, 12 points behind leaders Barcelona. Jose Antonio Camacho's side took a shock lead at the Bernabeu on 20 minutes when Iranian midfielder Javad Nekounam outleapt Fabio Cannavaro to nod Jaroslav Plasil's cross past Iker Casillas. An error by goalkeeper Roberto Fernandez gifted Real an equaliser just after the break, a long-range Sergio Ramos shot spooning into the net off his hands, and Gonzalo Higuain netted shortly after, tapping home Arjen Robben's low cross. In-form Robben made sure of the points in added time, cutting in from the right and driving the ball past Fernandez.

"Barcelona are playing very well and producing some magnificent football," Real coach Juande Ramos said at a news conference. "Madrid is not playing as well but has been achieving good results for the last month and that creates confidence and allows you to play much better." In other matches on Sunday, Atletico Madrid ended a run of four straight losses but could only manage an ugly 1-1 draw at Almeria and relinquished fifth spot to Villarreal, who beat struggling Real Mallorca 2-0. Fernando Llorente's penalty in added time snatched a 3-2 win for Athletic Bilbao against fourth-placed Valencia as the Basque side twice came from behind in an ill-tempered clash at the San Mames. Malaga thumped Espanyol 4-0 to climb to seventh ahead of Deportivo in eighth and Athletic in nint
