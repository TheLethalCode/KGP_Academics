<TITLE> Russia says to restart gas supply to Europe </TITLE>

 MOSCOW/KIEV, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's state-controlled gas firm Gazprom said it would resume supplies to Europe via Ukraine at 0700 GMT on Tuesday, nearly two weeks after a contract row cut flows to freezing European countries. The order to start pumping gas again followed the signing of a 10-year gas contract between Moscow and Kiev and late-night talks between Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and officials from the Gazprom gas export monopoly. Officials have said it would take 36 hours or more after the restart for the pipeline system to become operational again and for gas to reach Europe, parts of which have had to ration supplies to households and business because of the dispute. "From 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on January 20, Gazprom and (Ukrainian state energy company) Naftogaz will start to bring the system into normal operation for supply and transit," Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Reuters. "(This is) in accordance with instructions which were issued at 4 a.m. by the heads of the two companies." EUROPE AWAITS GAS The European Union, which has expressed mounting frustration that the former Soviet neighbors' dispute was hurting European consumers, said it would not consider the crisis over until its monitors verified that gas had reached the bloc. "For the EU, the decisive moment will come when renewed supplies are registered at its borders," Martin Riman, industry minister for the Czech Republic, which holds the EU's rotating presidency, said after the new contract was signed on Monday. Russian media quoted Tymoshenko as saying after her talks in Moscow that under the new contract her country would pay about $230 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas in 2009. That is a figure that officials in Ukraine, struggling with a deep economic slump, say they can just about afford to pay. Gazprom has yet to publicly confirm the price. The dispute follows a shorter disruption three years ago and has once again called into question the credibility of Russia and Ukraine as reliable energy suppliers for Europe. Russia provides about a quarter of Europe's gas requirements and pumps 80 percent of this via Ukraine
