 MONTEVIDEO, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man was shot following a pre-season match between Penarol and Nacional in another bout of Uruguayan football violence, police said on Sunday. The 33-year-old Nacional supporter was taken to hospital after being shot in the chest as rival fans clashed outside the Centenario stadium following Saturday evening's game, police said in a statement. Media reports said the man, who has not been named, was in intensive care and that his condition was serious. Police added that 93 people were arrested before, during and after the match between the country's two most popular clubs. The Uruguayan championship was suspended for two weeks last November after around 200 supporters fought on the pitch following a match between Danubio and Nacional. The tournament was again suspended last month on the eve of the final round of matches in the first stage after police declared Danubio's stadium unsuitable to host Penarol. The matches are due to be played at the end of this month
