<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court granted bail on Monday to 43 BNP leaders including Ilias Ali of Sylhet. The court also ordered the government to explain why permanent anticipatory bail should not be extended to the 43 in a case filed on charges of obstructing police in their line of duty. Biswanath police in Sylhet filed the case against 50 local BNP leaders including Ilias Ali, accusing them of obstructing the law enforcers as they were seizing scattered ballot papers the day after the Dec 29 election. The HC bench of justices M Abdul Wahab Mia and M Delwar Hossain gave the orders on a joint petition by the 43 BNP leaders for anticipatory bail. Barrister Moudud Ahmed and barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan submitted the petition for the defendants. bdnew
