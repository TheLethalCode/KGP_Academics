<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  A Biman Bangladesh Airlines Boeing 747, which suffered mid-air engine failure with 465 passengers and crew on board late Sunday night, was being repaired, said an airline official on Monday. The plane's 417 passengers, who were heading for Jeddah via Dubai when forced to return for an emergency landing in Dhaka, were accommodated on an afternoon flight. "The passengers of BG 035 boarded another 747 on the same route departing at around 4pm," Biman public relations officer Tasmeen Akhter told bdnews24.com. The airline's general manager (airport service) Shafiqul Hassan had earlier told bdnews24.com: "Experts have sorted out the technical glitches and the repair work on the plane is underway." The passengers, most of them overseas labourers, were taken to different hotels in the capital overnight, Shafiq said. The flight, BG 035, took off at 11:30pm Sunday, but 25 minutes later the plane lost one of its engines, Khan Mohammed Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Airport Police Station, told bdnews24.common in the early hours of Monday. All the passengers and crew were safe, he said. The pilot offloaded much of the fuel mid-air as part of routine safety procedures to prevent the plane catching fire on landing. Firemen, RAB and police were kept on alert at Zia International Airport just in case. Duty officer of the fire brigade control room Mohammed Ali said, "We rushed all units to the airport as we had been told there was risk of fire." The national flag carrier has a ramshackle fleet of aircraft that are prone to trouble and the flights often fail to honour time commitments. bdnews24.c
