A Microsoft spokesman said on Monday that the company did not yet have a tally of how many copies of the program have been downloaded. However, it has eliminated its limit of 2.5 million copies for the first two weeks of availability, to allow more people to get a copy. Microsoft, the world's biggest maker of software, has said Windows 7 would incorporate touch-screen technology and allow users to more easily personalize the system. It promised more user-friendly features, such as a new taskbar that previews all open windows from a single application by hovering over the program's icon.
