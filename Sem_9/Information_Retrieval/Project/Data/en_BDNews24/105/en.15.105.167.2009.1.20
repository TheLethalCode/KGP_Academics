<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Tue Jan 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama stepped into history, taking the oath of office Tuesday as America's 44th president - and the country's first African-American leader. Obama placed his hand on a Bible shortly after noon (EST), and promised to "preserve, protect and defend" the US constitution. Hundreds of thousands of people, bundled up against the cold, packed Washington's Mall, which stretches 2 miles (3 km) from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial on the Potomac River and along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Television pictures showed a sea of people, many waving American flags, in the grassy plain of the Mall as Obama was sworn in taking over from Republican George W. Bush, riding a wave of public optimism he will need to tap to deal with the worst economic crisis in 70 years and two wars. . "It is amazing to be here. This is history in the making," said Judy Bailey, 42, of Cincinnati, Ohio. The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas, will be full of ceremony, and full of symbolic meaning for African-Americans, who for generations suffered slavery and then racial segregation that made them second-class citizens. Obama took his oath of office with his hand on a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in 1861, standing on the western steps of the capitol, a building that was partly built by black slaves. His swearing-in was followed by the U.S. Marine Corps band playing "Hail to the Chief" and a 21-gun salute. Some estimates put the number of people packing the Mall and inaugural parade route at more than 2 million. Crowds clogged the city's metro rail system and thronged the security check-points. Polls show widespread support for Obama and optimism about the coming four years of his presidency, despite a deepening recession that has saddled the country with a $1 trillion deficit and 11 million people unemployed. Bush, who is also leaving a legacy of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is departing office after two terms having plumbed record lows in his approval ratings. GETTING DOWN TO WORK Obama, a former Illinois senator who capped a hard-fought election campaign with a comfortable win against Republican John McCain in November, has stressed that the time to party and celebrate will be short-lived. On Wednesday he will start shepherding an $825 billion economic stimulus plan through Congress. He faces daunting challenges -- global economic turmoil, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global warming, conflict in Gaza and tensions between Pakistan and India. But analysts say that at least for now, it will be his ability to revive the recession-hit economy that will be the benchmark by which his presidency is judged. The Washington Post reported that in one of his first actions as president, Obama planned to name former Sen. George Mitchell as his Middle East envoy in one of his first actions as the new U.S. president. Obama is expected to meet his military commanders on Wednesday to discuss the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq, to fulfill a campaign pledge to withdraw all troops within 16 months. SECURITY The inauguration was taking place amid unprecedented security, although authorities say there was no credible threat of an attack. About 8,000 police were deployed and a total of 32,000 military personnel were on duty or on standby. Obama and his wife, Michelle, along with his Vice President-elect Joe Biden and his wife attended a church service at St. John's Episcopal Church before going to the White House for coffee with the Bushes and Vice-President Dick Cheney and his wife. Obama, acclaimed for his stirring oratory, was set to deliver his eagerly anticipated inauguration speech, expected to last about 20 minutes, just after midday. "He is going to lay out a lot of the challenges we face as a country, but he will also remind ... that America has faced great challenges before," his spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN on Tuesday. "He will talk about responsibility, particularly the great responsibility in the action of government and financial institutions, some of whose actions have got us into the mess we are in now." He played down suggestions that Obama could issue executive orders as early as Tuesday to close the U.S. military prison at for foreign terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay and repeal a ban on overseas funding for clinics or groups which provide abortion services. The Guantanamo prison has been a lightning rod for broad world disapproval of many Bush policies in Washington's declared war on terrorism after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that shook Bush's presidency early on. Gibbs said some announcements would be made later in the week. "Amid high anticipation the world will be watching the 44th president's inaugural address for inspiration and a road map out of the gloom," the Council on Foreign Relations' Robert McMahon said in a commentary. No president has begun his four-year term in office with as much public confidence -- a 78 percent approval rating in the most recent Gallup poll -- and a sharp contrast with Bush's unpopularity
