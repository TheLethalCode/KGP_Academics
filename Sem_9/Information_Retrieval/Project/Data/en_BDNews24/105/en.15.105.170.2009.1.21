 Maruf Mullick bdnews24.com telecoms correspondent Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  State-owned BSCCL Tuesday expressed eagerness to set up an alternative submarine cable link in the country, officials said Tuesday. Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd showed its keenness at a mass hearing on the adoption of submarine cable guidelines under private initiatives. "We too want to join the race," BSCCL managing director Monowar Hossain told bdnews24.com after the hearing. Some 18 local and foreign companies took part in the programme organised by telecoms regulator BTRC at its office on Tuesday for views on the draft guidelines. "No matter which companies do the job, the clients must be offered competitive service which would also reduce cost," Monowar said. "The repayment of $35.2 million loan taken from the Islamic Development Bank for setting up a new cable link would be difficult if the BSCCL clients are split among other operators." "It will take six more years to repay the loan," he said. BTRC said in a press release Tuesday that the views expressed in the mass hearing and individual opinions expected to be submitted by Jan 31 would be reviewed before finalising the guidelines on its website. BTRC chairman retired major general Manzurul Alam said, "The guidelines will be finalised on the basis of the views of all concerned." "We'll ensure transparency in licensing and must stay unhindered on the technological superhighway for Bangladesh's info-tech prosperity," he said. The BTRC chairman said, "We can ward off risks of becoming disconnected from the world if an alternative submarine cable link is set up." "It will also increase bandwidth naturally boosting internet speed and, consequently, raising internet penetration." Bangladesh is now linked to SEA-ME-WE-4 submarine cable, the link managed and maintained by BSCCL. Of the 24.12 gigabyte capacity, 7.5 GB is being used, statistics show. bdnews
