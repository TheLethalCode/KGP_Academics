<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  New attorney general Mahbubey Alam has said he will help the government to bring back stolen funds laundered overseas and prevent money laundering. The home ministry, assisted by his office, would take steps to stop the rogue business of laundering money abroad through letters of credit, share scams and 'hundi' (unauthorised money transfer), he said. In his first briefing at his office hours after the appointment on Tuesday, he pledged to work imbued with the "secular spirit" of the independence war. Alam said he would also move to conclude the murder case of independence architect 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and clean up the judiciary. President Iajuddin Ahmed approved Alam's appointment, effective immediately, while accepting the resignation of outgoing attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed submitted on Monday. Alam, who enrolled as a senior Supreme Court lawyer in 1998, was additional attorney general from Nov. 15, 1998 to Oct. 4, 2001. Salahuddin Ahmed resigned his position Monday, saying: "I have submitted my resignation in line with the tradition that the attorney general resigns after a new government takes over." Salahuddin was appointed attorney general on July 13 last year by the caretaker government. He had earlier served as additional attorney general from Feb. 13, 2007. bdnew
