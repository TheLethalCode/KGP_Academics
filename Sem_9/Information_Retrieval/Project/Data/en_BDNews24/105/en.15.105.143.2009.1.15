 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)Thirty one lawmakers-elect of BNP and its allies will take oath from outgoing Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar on Thursday. "Everything is ready for the oath-taking ceremony tomorrow," Sircar told bdnews24.com Wednesday. The swearing-in formalities is set to be held at 4.00 pm at the "Oath Room" of Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building. BNP and its allies won 32 of 299 seats in Dec 29 parliamentary polls, including three seats contested and won by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. BNP's AKM Mahbubuddin Khokon was later elected in the deferred Noakhali-1 election on Jan 12, while Khaleda will vacate two of her seats for by-elections. The oath taking will make the opposition MPs eligible to attend the Jan 25 inaugural sitting of parliament. The BNP-led four party combine had earlier refused to take their oaths as scheduled on Jan 4. But according to constitutional guidelines, lawmakers-elect cannot enter the house without taking oath. The first sitting of the Jatiya Sangsad will elect a new Speaker and a Deputy Speaker as per the constitution, and BNP may select one of its lawmakers after taking oath Thursday as the next Deputy Speaker since the ruling Awami League has offered the post to the opposition. The Awami League-led 'Grand Alliance' won a massive majority in the house in a landslide election victory that gave them 262 seats. bd
