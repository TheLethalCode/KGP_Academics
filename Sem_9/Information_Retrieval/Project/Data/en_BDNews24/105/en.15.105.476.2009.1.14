<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan, the hero of Bangladesh's five-wicket thrashing of Sri Lanka, says his 92-run innings is the best of his 58-ODI career. Shakib's unbeaten 92 to help Bangladesh storm into the Tri-Nation Cup final with 151 for nine in 23.5 overs, in reply to Sri Lanka's 147 all out in 30.3 overs, in the fog-curtailed match. "Considering the situation, it was my best innings," said the left-handed batsman at a post-match briefing at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "Before this, a hundred against Pakistan was my best because I had to play in a similar situation as today. But I put today's innings ahead of that one because the team won this match," said Shakib, who hammered 108 against Pakistan last year. The 21-year old batsman said he felt he hardly made any mistakes in the 92 and 108 runs he piled up against the two rivals. "I played in line with the merit of every ball rather than thinking of the target and it eventually took the side home," he said of Wednesday's performance. He thought Bangladesh might win the match when Naeem Islam smashed Ajantha Mendis for four. Asked about the secret of playing well against spin duo Muttiah Muralitharan and Mendis, Shakib said, "I think my sweep shots forced Murali to change his line and length repeatedly and the game-plan against Mendis was to play him straight bat." Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful said the triumph against Sri Lanka was important for them, especially after going down against Zimbabwe. "It was an important event for us because all of us were upset after losing to Zimbabwe and so this victory meant a lot." "Every victory is sweet, but this win is special because we qualified for the final." said the Bangladesh captain, adding that every triumph for them was "an answer" to the critics. Ashraful said that Shakib's innings was one of the best performances he had seen. "He met the demand and made the task look easy despite the early dismissal of three batsmen." Ashraful also did not forget to praise pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who rattled the Sri Lankan top order dismissing Upul Tharanga, Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuria. "I want to give all credit to Mashrafee. Mashrafee always determines the path in his first spell on the way to a Bangladesh win. However, all eleven players had the due share of contribution in the victory." The Bangladesh captain also praised debutant Rubel Hossain, who returned four for 33. "All went in our favour today. Rubel bowled well during the third powerplay taken by the batsmen as he has pace along with varied bowling action." bdnews
