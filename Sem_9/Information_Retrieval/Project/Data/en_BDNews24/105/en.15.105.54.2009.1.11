 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Sunday decided to print another 70 lakh textbooks to be available in the market by Jan 15, said a senior education official. The decision came from a meeting of National Curriculum and Textbook Board. "A total of 70 lakh books that include 14 lakh books on five subjects each will be printed," said additional education secretary Mozammel Haque Khan, who chaired the meeting. "We have ordered 28 publishing houses for printing these books, who we consider as the best on the basis of the job they did for us before," said Khan. "Those who will create any irregularities in releasing books will be dealt with legal actions," education minister Nurul Islam Nahid told reporters while visiting book libraries at Bangla Bazar in the city. Nahid urged all to extend assistance to make sure the students get the books soon.
