 WELLINGTON, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jesse Ryder has been recalled by New Zealand for Tuesday's deciding one-day international against West Indies after a late night of drinking cost him his place in the last match. Ryder was dropped for Saturday's fourth match after missing a team meeting and training session following a night out in Auckland. New Zealand coach Andy Moles said he had no hesitation in recalling the powerful left-handed batsmen for the series decider in Napier. "Jesse is a match-winner opening the batting," Moles told reporters on Sunday. "He and Brendon (McCullum) are a formidable pair." Last February Ryder had to have surgery on his hand after punching a window in the door of a Christchurch nightclub. That ruled him out of the tour of England in May. "Jesse assures us it's a thing of the past and we have to move on with that in mind," Moles said. Mathew Sinclair, who replaced Ryder in Auckland, drops out of the squad while Martin Guptill, who scored a century on debut after being promoted to open, moves to number three. The series is locked at 1-1 with two of the previous four matches washed out
