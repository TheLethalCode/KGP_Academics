 Chittagong, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Four assistant proctors of Chittagong University resigned their positions on Tuesday as pro-Awami League students continued to campaign for resignation of the vice chancellor. VC M Badiul Alam confirmed to bdnews24.com that he had accepted resignation of three of them. They were Nurul Islam, HS Faruque Alam and Anwar Hossain. But he did not accept the resignation letter of another assistant proctor Mohammad Manzur Morshed, who was working as coordinator in absence of the proctor. "We are mulling appointment of new proctor considering the situation," the VC said. Earlier around noon, some 50-60 pro-Awami League activists cut off the telephone line at the VC office after forcing their way in when he was out, Morshed said. The proctors were trying to resume administrative work, he said. The university reopened Monday, but the presence of students was very thin on the campus, with a very few classes held. Police searched the dormitories and cottages adjacent to the campus in a midnight raid Monday. But their efforts yielded nothing. During a two-hour raid from 12 am to 2 am, they broke open locks of the six dormitories, and detained some non-residential students but released them after questioning. The police action came after two days of tense lockdown enforced by the pro-AL students who had alleged that the vice chancellor failed to deal with the unruly activists of pro-Jamaat Islami Chhatra Shibir. The pro-AL students had been pressing for the VC's resignation, a demand he rejected calling it "illogical". All members of the proctorial body and hall provosts were present during the raid and search. bdne
