<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12(bdnews24.com)  Commerce minister Faruque Khan on Monday said the government will set a ten-year target to reduce trade deficit and boost exports instead of the traditional yearly readjustment. "We will review the progress every year but go for a 10-year goal," the minister told reporters after receiving delegations from Sri Lanka and India at his ministry. Faruque Khan met with Sri Lanka's business development and external trade minister JL Peiris and a delegation of the India-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry led by its president Abdul Matlub Ahmed. On his meeting with Peiris, Faruque Khan said his Sri Lankan counterpart expressed his country's interest to invest in pharmaceuticals and the service industry in Bangladesh. Bangladesh at present exports medicines and service goods to Sri Lanka, he said. Peiris told reporters after the meeting, "I have conveyed a message of congratulations to the new government in this courtesy call. The Sri Lankan president and the prime minister have already hailed the government officially." He said he had visited the Dhaka International Trade Fair "that also houses a Sri Lankan stall." The IBCCI delegation led by Matlub Ahmed raised various points with the commerce minister, including reduction of trade deficit between India and Bangladesh. "The government should take initiatives to address the causes behind the huge trade gap between Bangladesh and India," said Matlub. "IBCCI will help the government to resolve the issue, if asked," he added. He gave a number of suggestions seeking a separate EPZ for Indian investors at Ishwardi or elsewhere in the country, a long-term multiple-entry Indian visa for Bangladeshi businesses and simplification of investment procedures for businessmen of both countries. On the India-Bangladesh trade deficit, Faruque pointed out that the Indian foreign minister would visit Dhaka next month. "There will be detailed discussion on the issue so that trade deficit could be narrowed." Assuring local businessmen , the commerce minister said, "The government will work to help businesses, not control the trade and commerce." "Our efforts will aim to get more facilities to the business people and help boost exports. Some rules and regulations may also be amended, if necessary." bdnews24
