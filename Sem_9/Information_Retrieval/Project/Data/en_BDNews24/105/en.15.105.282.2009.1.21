 DUBAI, Wed Jan 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US consulate in the cosmopolitan Gulf Arab business hub of Dubai closed to the public for security reasons Wednesday, it said without giving details of any threats. "Based on security information specific to the consulate general provided by Dubai authorities, the US consulate general in Dubai will be closed to the public on January 21, 2009," the consulate said in a statement on its website. "The United States embassy in Abu Dhabi remains open to the public." A US embassy official declined to give more details about the nature of the information. The United States reminded citizens in June to remain vigilant to the threat of attacks after Britain raised its threat alert for the United Arab Emirates. The United States last updated its warden message in July, issuing a worldwide caution to American citizens about the "continuing threat of terrorist actions and violence against Americans and interests throughout the world." It said "anti-American violence could include possible terrorist actions against aviation, ground transportation, and maritime interests specifically in the Middle east, including the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa." It said Wednesday it would issue a follow up warden message once the consulate reopens. Several Gulf countries have faced attacks from Islamist militants angry over their close ties with the West, but there has been no major attack or political unrest in the UAE, a federation of seven emirates that includes the Gulf's top tourism destination, Dubai
