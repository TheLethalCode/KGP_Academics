 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Khulna Abahani Krira Chakra on Wednesday earned the first point after 14 defeats in a row when the hosts held visitors Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club to a goalless draw at Khulna Stadium on Wednesday. Away at MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, hosts Chittagong Abahani Limited were also held to a goalless draw by visitors Farashganj Sporting Club. Khulna Abahani, who never won or drew a match since their stunning 3-1 win over struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad in their league opener, parried off mighty Chittaogng Mohammedan till the final whistle and snatched a point to raise their tally to four from 16 outings. It, however, did not make any difference to the 11-team point table as Khulna Abahani are still in the relegation threat to stay at the bottom. Chittagong Mohammedan, who handed a 2-1 home defeat to Khulna Abahani, maintained their fifth place with 24 points from 15 games. In the port city, Chittagong Abahani and Farashganj SC once again shared honour playing a goalless draw as both sides had earlier played a 1-1 draw at Bangabandhu National Stadium. With the fifth draw in 15 games, the Old Dhaka outfit, Rahmatganj, have 20 points to stay at sixth position while Chittagong Abahani joined seventh-placed Rahmatganj MFS with 17 points each. Chittagong Abahani, however, played two matches more than Rahmatganj's 14. bd
