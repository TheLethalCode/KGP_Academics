<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)The food minister has said he will do away with the so-called "allocation for the MPs" for development projects, sending the foodgrains, instead, to local government leaders. "The allocation for the MPs in development project provided by the food ministry will not be allowed this time," Abdur Razzak told reporters Tuesday. "In line with the existing rule, the allocation will go to the districts. From there, it will be passed on to the Upazila and Union Parishad chairmen who will do the work of development projects," he said. "The MPs will not have any chance to interfere," the minister added.
