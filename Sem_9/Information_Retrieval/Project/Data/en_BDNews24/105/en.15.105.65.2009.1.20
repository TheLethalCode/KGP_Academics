<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) - The trial of war crimes is possible under the existing laws, the Ekattorer Ghatok Dalal Nirmul Committee said on Monday. "The trial of war criminals is closely connected with the prevention of fundamentalism, as it has emerged as a problem not only for Bangladesh, but also for other countries," said Shahriar Kabir, acting president of the committee. The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act-1973 has enough provisions to try the war criminals, leaders of the committee said at a press conference. The committee does not see any role necessary for the United Nations when it comes to trying the 1971 war criminals. Under the 1973 act, war criminals can be tried any time, it said. Monday was the 17th founding anniversary of the 'committee for elimination of '71 killers and collaborators'. Reading out a written statement, Kabir demanded the government ban the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami and its associated student body Islami Chhatra Shibir, as "they capitalise on religion to do politics". "Jamaat is the greatest enemy of Islam," he added. "If the government is keen, the trial of war criminals may be completed during its present tenure," he said. Kabir announced the formation of two "citizens' commissions" to extend cooperation in implementing the government's electoral pledge of war crimes trials. The two commissions are being headed by national professor Kabir Chowdhury and justice Golam Rabbani, with barrister Tania Amir and Dhaka University journalism teacher Rubayat Ferdous as member secretaries. The commissions, with eminent citizens as members, will submit their recommendations to prime minister Sheikh Hasina by Mar. 27, said Kabir. The Ekattorer Ghatok Dalal Nirmul Committee will film two separate documentaries on fundamentalist networks and secularism and will publish a white paper on fundamentalist activities by the end of the current year, he added. Kabir also urged the government to collect proofs of genocide and war crimes from the archives of neighbouring countries to create an archive in the country. The press conference was held at the Liberation War museum bdnews2
