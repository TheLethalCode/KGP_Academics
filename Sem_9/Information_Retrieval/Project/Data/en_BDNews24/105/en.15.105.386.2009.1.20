 SOFIA, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Chelsea coach Avram Grant has met the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) to discuss the vacant post of national manager but is unlikely to be appointed because of salary demands, the union president said on Tuesday. Bulgaria are seeking a replacement for Plamen Markov, who was sacked last month following three draws in 2010 World Cup qualifiers and the humiliating 6-1 loss against Serbia in a friendly. "I've talked several times to Avram Grant and Klaus Toppmoeller but we couldn't reach agreement," union president Borislav Mihaylov told bTV on Tuesday. "We're still unable to meet their financial demands." Mihaylov added that the next coach will be a Bulgarian. Markov's successor will be announced at the BFU's congress on Jan 30.
