 KARACHI, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan paceman Rao Iftikhar returned career-best figures of 4 for 42 and Umar Gul took three wickets to help bowl out Sri Lanka for 219 runs in the first one-day international on Tuesday. The performances of Iftikhar and Gul, who took three for 30, overshadowed the return of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar to the one-day team after a gap of 14 months. Shoaib did not take a wicket in his seven overs. Sri Lanka got off to a fast start, reaching 71 from 53 balls with openers Tillakaratne Dilshan (42) and Sanath Jayasuriya (38) in fine form. But Gul removed both openers and later Iftikhar derailed the innings with a double strike in the 35th over when he got the key wickets of Kumar Sangakkara (49) and the hard-hitting Thilan Thushara for a duck. Sri Lanka, after winning the toss and chosing to bat first, lost wickets at regular intervals to some loose shots and were indebted to resolute knocks from Chamara Kapugedera (27) and Nuwan Kulasekara (24). Dilshan pulled Gul straight to Salman Butt at deep backward square leg while Jayasuriya was trapped leg before as Sri Lanka slipped to 86 for three. Their captain, Mahela Jayawardene, fell for one run caught behind to become Iftikhar's first victim. Sangakkara played patiently in his 70-ball innings as he and Kapugedera added 54 runs for the fourth wicket. But after Shahid Afridi bowled Kapugedera, Sri Lanka lost Jehan Mubarak to a run out and Iftikhar then had Sangakkara caught by Butt at gully and bowled Thushara first ball to leave the innings in trouble on 176 for seven. Sri Lanka is in Pakistan to play three one-dayers the first international series in the country since the Asia Cup was held last June
