<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday moved quickly to launch the ambitious Tk 101 billion project to bridge the mighty Padma, allocating Tk 140 crore towards the cost of design and appointing consultants. "We have approved the appointment of a design consultant today," finance minister AMA Muhith told reporters after a cabinet committee meeting on Monday. The process of appointing consultants started in May 2007, he said. The minister said engineering group Maunsell AECOM, based in the Asia Pacific region, had been chosen as design consultant. The designing, to be funded by the Asian Development Bank, will cost nearly Tk 140 crore, he said. "The design will be completed in 22 months," said Muhith. Communications minister Syed Abul Hossain said the proposed bridge would link the south-western region with the rest of the country. "The bridge will gear up economic and industrial activity in that region adding some 2 percent growth in GDP, he said. The minister said he hoped the designers would be able to finish before the scheduled time. "The bridge construction will start soon after land acquisition are settled," Hossain said. The initial cost of the bridge is estimated to be Tk 10,162 crore, say communications officials. The ADB, the Japanese government, the World Bank and the Islami Development Bank have pledged to fund the project, they say. bdnew
