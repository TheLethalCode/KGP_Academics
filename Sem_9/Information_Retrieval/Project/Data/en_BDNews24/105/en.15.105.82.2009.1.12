<TEXT>
 Maruf Mallick Energy correspondent Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Energy regulators have cut diesel and kerosene prices by Tk 2, effective from midnight on Monday, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission said in an order. The diesel and kerosene have been priced at Tk 44 a litre from Tk 46 and the new tariff will remain in force until further notice, the BERC added. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, BERC chairman Golam Rahman and energy secretary Mohammed Mohsin decided the drop in the price after the cabinet meeting on Monday Finance minister AMA Muhit told reporters after a meeting with officials of the Economic Relations Division the government would not have to give subsidy for the price adjustment. However, fertiliser has to be subsidised if the price is adjusted, he said, adding subsidy was a must if the output was to be upped. Muhit said there was enough fertiliser in stock and there should not be a problem if the supply was smooth. The caretaker government earlier on Dec. 22 reset the price of diesel at Tk 46 from Tk 48, petrol at Tk 74 from Tk 78 and octane at Tk 77 from Tk 80. Earlier at noon, the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said the government might announce the new prices of diesel and fertilisers in a day or two. The interim government had first trimmed the price of fuel oil on Oct. 26 in 2008, after enhancing it twice in 2007 and 2008. bdnew
