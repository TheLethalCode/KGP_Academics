 Chandpur, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The bodies of 22 labourers were recovered by Tuesday evening from the Meghna river at Chandpur, some 36 hours after a trawler capsized in the early hours of Monday. "Two labourers, who are feared dead, are still missing, as the rescue operation was halted for the night at around 5.00pm," said Mohammad Kamruzzaman, officer-in-charge of Matlab North's maritime police camp. All 22 victims, including four brothers of a family, hailed from Chaikhola in Chatmohor, Pabna, said Kamruzzaman. The bodies were being kept at Doshani ferry station under police protection. There was still no sign of the capsized trawler. Maritime police said they will decide later whether the search and rescue operation would continue. Twenty five people were initially feared dead after the trawler capsized at around 3am Monday, said police. The earth-laden trawler Sabbir-1 with 50 labourers on board was heading for Munshiganj from Chandpur when a cargo vessel, coming from the opposite direction, rammed the trawler near Doshani ferry station, said Matlab North police. Of the 50 on board, 25 managed to swim ashore after the collision. Another survivor was later rescued. The others were sleeping in their cabins as the trawler went down, said the survivors. bdnews24.com
