<TITLE> Barua ready for fertiliser challenge </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Industries minister Dilip Barua says supply of urea to IRRI-Boro farmers poses a big challenge for the government. "Timely supply of fertilisers during the upcoming season will be an "an acid test for the new government", Barua told reporters after a meeting with officials of BCIC, which owns and manages state urea factories. Barua said some 12.1 lakh metric tonnes of urea will be provided during the coming IRRI-Boro season and an additional 2.5 lakh MTs will be kept in reserve. "The measures will help the farmers get fertiliser at Tk 10-12 per kg, and the additional reserve will be used to meet any unforeseen crisis," the minister said. The minister asked the officials to "change your mindset" now that they were working for a "people's government". BCIC also part-owns export-oriented KAFCO, managed by its foreign owners. This year, the BCIC factories are forecast to produce 14 lakh MTs of urea, while Bangladesh will require 28 lakh MTs. Five lakh MTs will come from KAFCO and the rest from costly imports, BCIC chairman said.
