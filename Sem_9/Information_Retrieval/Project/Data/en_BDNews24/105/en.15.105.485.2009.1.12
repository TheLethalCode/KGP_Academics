 Noakhali, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Four-party candidate Mahabub Uddin Khokan of BNP was leading in primary vote counts of 41 centres out of 105 in the Noakhali-1 election on Monday. The results showed Mahbub with 'sheaf of paddy' with 38,817 votes with second in place grand alliance candidate HM Ibrahim of Awami League on 28,902 votes shortly before 9pm. Returning officer and Noakhali district commissioner M Abdul Haque said, "Results of 41 polling centres reached my office by 8:45pm." "Voting was held peacefully with no untoward incidents from 8am to 4pm," he added. Polling centres in Noakhali-1 (Chatkhil-Sonaimuri) saw long queues of people ignoring chilly weather from morning, and peaceful voting through the day in the seat's deferred election. Voters expressed satisfaction with a free and peaceful voting environment. Eight candidates were vying for the ballots of 247,407 registered voters in the constituency. The Election Commission postponed the Noakhali-1 parliamentary poll following the death of Gonotantree Party president and grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam in early December. The commissionannounced the constituency's new election date of Jan 12, just days ahead of the Dec 29 elections to 299 of the total 300 parliamentary seats. Police, Bangladesh Rifles and Rapid Action Batallion were being deployed across the constituency as striking and mobile forces from early morning until ballot counting is complete, to ensure a trouble free vote. The seat has earlier gone to BNP four times and Awami League twice. bdnews2
