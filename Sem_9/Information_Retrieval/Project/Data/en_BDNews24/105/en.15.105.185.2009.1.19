<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Zimbabwe took a 1-0 lead in the three-ODI series with a two-wicket win over Bangladesh in a low-scoring first match at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. Zimbabwe raced to 127 for eight with four balls to go after restricting Bangladesh to a paltry 124 all out in 48.1 overs, a contrasting performance against the hosts' last two matches against Sri Lanka in the Tri-Nation Cup. Needing six runs in the last six balls, Raymond Price struck Nazmul Hossain for two successive fours to steer Zimbabwe home and put on a significant 35 runs for the unbroken ninth wicket with Tawanda Mupariwas, who made a 22-ball 10. Man of the match Price, who had earlier wrecked the hosts innings with a career-best of four for 22, played a patient 24 off 52 balls that included two boundaries. Zimbabwean captain Prosper Utseya held the middle after Shakib Al Hasan and Mashafee Bin Mortaza wrecked the top and middle order respectively. Utseya, who came in after six wickets down, stuck to the crease to make a patient 21 off 75 balls before contributing two significant partnerships with debutant Malcolm Waller (24 off 48 balls) and Price. With Zimbabwe reeling at 44 for six in 19.4 overs, Utseya pulled his side from the brink of defeat as he put on 28 and 20 runs for the seventh and eighth wickets. Mashrafee had earlier returned three for 21 while Shakib grabbed three for just 11 in his 10-over spell. Mashrafee had ripped through the top order dismissing Hamilton Masakaza (2), Tatenda Taibu (14) and Sean Williams (8) while Shakib removed Stuart Matsekenyeri (7), Elton Chigumbura (0) and Keith Debengwa (1). The remaining bowlers failed to keep the momentum, though Mahmudullah Riad returned one for seven. It was not clear why Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful did not use the off-spinner later. Ashraful's decision to bat first on the slow and low wicket in foggy conditions also raised questions as to why he put his batters in first on the tricky pitch, which tended to bring low scores in the last four matches in the Tri-Nation Cup. Spin duo Raymond Price and Keith Debengwa shared seven wickets to help Zimbabwe restrict Bangladesh to a measly total. Bangladesh decision to bat first in foggy condition proved disastrous after losing three scalps, Junaed Siddique (3), Ashraful (4) and Tamim Iqbal (13) in quick succession. The hosts could manage only 31 runs in 17.1 overs in the face of some disciplined bowling from the Zimbabwean pacers. Pace duo Edward Rainsford and Tawanda Mupariwa exploited the early damp conditions to get fine movement to add misery to the Bangladesh top-order batsmen, who continued their bad patch from the two Tests series against Sri Lanka. Rainsford's first eight overs cost just 12 and Mupariwa allowed 13 from his eight. Bangladesh openers Junaed Siddique and Tamim Iqbal hardly got any room to make runs before Rainsford drew the first blood trapping Junaed (3) leg before in his fourth over, leaving the hosts at just 10 for one in seven overs. Ashraful (4), promoted to number three following Mushfiqur Rahim's successive failures in the same position, frustrated his charges to be holed out to Rainsford off Elton Chigumbura, who replaced Tawanda Mupariwa in the 13th over to strike in the same over. Struggling opener Tamim Iqbal edged second-change bowler Hamilton Masakadza to wicketkeeper Tatenda Taibu for 13, leaving the side wobbling at 31 for three in 17.5 overs. After losing three batsmen, Roqibul Hasan and Shakib Al Hasan tried to free the hosts from the African clutches and it seemed they were going the right direction. Roqibul struck Price two successive fours before becoming the first victim of Price, giving the bowler an easy catch in the next ball for a 33-ball 28 runs, studded with six fours. In the next over, Shakib followed Roqibul to fall to Price for a 21-ball 15, leaving the side at 69 for five in 25.2 overs. Prince also removed Mahmudullah, who went for a reverse sweep to be caught by Debengwa for a 41-ball 14, and Nazmul Hossain went down to be stumped by keeper Taibu. Prince finally returned a career-best of four for 22 in his 10-over spell. Debengwa dismissed Mushfiqur Rahim (22), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (5) and Naeem Islam (15) to return three for 15 to return his career-best figure of three for 15. bdnew
