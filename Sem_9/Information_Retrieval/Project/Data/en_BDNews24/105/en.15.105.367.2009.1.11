<TITLE> 2009 Boi Mela may venture beyond Bangla Academy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  As much as half of this year's Boi Mela or '21st Book Fair-2009' may for the first time be located beyond the Bangla Academy grounds, the top academy official told bdnews24.com on Sunday. "We are thinking of such a move as there is a space crisis inside Bangla Academy," said the academy's director general Dr Syed Mohammad Shahed. Shahed said they will lose space of around 120 stalls this year due to construction work of a building on the bank of the academy's pond and construction materials lying inside the academy. The 2008 Boi Mela held a total of 373 stalls in the academy grounds. "We have already started working to expand the fair onto the academy's front road, Suhrawardy Uddyan or anywhere else nearby," said the academy boss. He, however, added that no decision has been finalised yet in this regard. The director general told bdnews24.com in last year that the fair might in future be shifted to Dhaka University's playground or Suhrawardy Uddyan upon gradual expansion of the fair. bdnew
