<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  The education minister on Wednesday sees building up an illiteracy-free Bangladesh as the "biggest challenge". "As much as half the population is illiterate," said Nurul Islam Nahid in his first formal programme since being sworn in. "Building up an illiteracy-free Bangladesh is the biggest challenge ahead of the nation. However, it has to be within standard education," he said at a training programme on secondary-level education and evaluation at Government Laboratory High School in the city. "About 50 percent of students drop out before passing Class-5, although admission rates into schools accounts for nearly 90 percent children," he pointed out. He vowed to take a strong stance against graft in the education sector. "No corruption, irregularity, and indiscipline will be tolerated. But all-inclusive assistance will be extended for creative and entrepreneurial work." The training programme was organised under the secondary education sector development project (SESDP) and attended by around 300 trainees including upazila level education officials. Prof Atiar Rahman, director of SESDP, delivered the welcome address at the programme chaired by Prof Khan Habibur Rahman, acting director general of the directorate of secondary and higher education. bdnew
