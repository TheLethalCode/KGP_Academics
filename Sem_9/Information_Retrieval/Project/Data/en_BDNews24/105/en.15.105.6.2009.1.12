<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Paceman Nuwan Kulasekara and spinner Ajantha Mendis rampaged through the Zimbabwe batting order, sharing six wickets to power Sri Lanka to a convincing 130-run win in the second one-dayer of the Tri-Nation Cup at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. Zimbabwe were skittled out for 80 in 28.2 overs in face of some probing, disciplined bowling from Sri Lanka, who posted a moderate total of 210 for six in their stipulated 50 overs. Strike pacer Kulasekara removed both openers Vusimuzi Sibanda (3), Hamilton Masakadza (7) and two-down Tatenda Taibu (9) to reduce them to 27 for three in 10.4 overs. New-ball pair Thilan Thushara bowled Sean Williams (8) to reduce Zimbabwe to 47 for four in 16.3 overs. Sensational spinner Mendis, brought in the 19th over, dismissed Stuart Matsekenyeri for a 29-ball 15, the only double-digit score for the Africans. Afterwards, spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan wrecked the upper tail end to return two for four in his three-over spell and Mendis cleaned up the tail to return three for 15. Earlier, Sri Lanka recovered from a middle-order slum to reach the modest total, thanks to an unbeaten maiden fifty from all-rounder Angelo Mathews in his third ODI. Mathews, the former under-19 captain, laboured hard on a slow pitch to remain unbeaten on 52 off 96 balls studded with two sixes and one four. He built up two valuable partnerships with Jehan Mubarak and Thilan Thushara. Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuirya gave Sri Lanka a fine start to put on 51 runs for the opening partnership with an average of 5.88 runs an over before first-change pacer Elton Chigumbura made the inroad in the 14th over. Chigumbura had Jayasuriya, who returned to the fold after being rested for the five-match series against Zimbabwe in November, caught at slip by Masakadza for a 30-ball 22. Coming to bowl in his second spell, strike bowler Edward Rainsford triggered a collapse, removing one-down Kumar Sangakkara (4), Mahela Jayawardene (0) and Chamara Kapugedera (4) in three successive overs. Sri Lankan skipper Mahela Jayawardene, who edged a catch behind the wicketkeeper, continued his miserable one-day run with the third successive duck, all against Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya came in the attack in the 21st over and trapped Tharanga leg before for 43 off 55 balls in his first over, but Mathews and Thushara kept cool to take their side out of trouble. Mathews and Mubarak shared 69 runs for the fifth wicket before the latter gave a catch at long-off to Williams off Raymond Price for a patient 31 off 62 in the first over of the third power play, chosen by the batting side. New batsman Thushara eased the pressure with two successive sixes off Keith Debengwa to take Sri Lanka beyond the 200-mark and remained unbeaten on 28 off 27 balls. Rainsford grabbed three for 41 while Chigumbura, Utseya and Price took one wicket apiece. Sri Lanka play the final game before the final against hosts Bangladesh on Jan. 14
