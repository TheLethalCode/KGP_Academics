 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Wednesday granted bail to former communications minister barrister Nazmul Huda in a graft case involving false registration of a vehicle. Judge ANM Bashir Ullah granted the bail, but Huda will not be released as he is convicted and serving a jail term in another case. Dhanmondi police filed the car graft case against Huda on March 1, 2007; he was charged on May 31 the same year. Huda was arrested and put behind the bars on Feb 25, 2007. The former BNP minister faces several pending graft cases at various stages of trial. bdnew
