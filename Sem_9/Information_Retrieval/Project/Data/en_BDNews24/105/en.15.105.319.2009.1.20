<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Champions Bayern Munich, alarmed by the size of Manchester City's failed bid for Brazilian Kaka, fired off a warning shot to potential buyers on Tuesday to stay away from their inspirational midfielder Franck Ribery. "We stand by what we have said," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Bild newspaper. "We are not prepared to enter any discussions on Ribery no matter how high the offer." Team manager Uli Hoeness said it would take 150 million euros ($194.7 million) "to even start thinking about it". Manchester City were reported to have bid 110 million euros for AC Milan playmaker Kaka and offered wages never before seen in soccer but the deal fell through late on Monday. The Frenchman has been outstanding for Bayern this season, keeping his team on track for a domestic title and Cup defence and leading it into the knockout stages of the Champions League. Ribery, 25, has a contract running to 2011 but recently said he would enjoy playing for other European clubs. "Bayern are obviously one of the biggest and best clubs in the world," he said late last year. "Obviously there are other clubs that would be a dream: Real Madrid and Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United." "I certainly love Real Madrid because of the great tradition but I feel happy here at Bayern. We will have to wait and see what the future holds." Manchester City, the world's richest club since being taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group, signed Robinho from Real Madrid in the previous transfer window. They did have some success in the transfer market on Monday, signing Craig Bellamy from West Ham United. City also confirmed on Tuesday a fee had been agreed with Hamburg for Dutch international midfielder Nigel De Jong
