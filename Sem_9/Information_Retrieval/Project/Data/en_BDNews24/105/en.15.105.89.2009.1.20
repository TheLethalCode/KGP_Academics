 Washington, Jan 22 (bdnews24.com)Barack Hussain Obama stepped into the history books on Tuesday as he was sworn-in four minutes after noon as the 44th president of the United States, and the first African-American. Moments after chief justice John Roberts administered the oath of office, applause filled the air over Washington as an estimated two million people converged on the capital to watch the historic event unfold before their eyes. Along with those fortunate enough to be present on Capitol Hill, hundreds of thousands filled the two mile-long National Mall watching the ceremony on giant TV screens hugging and embracing friends, acquaintances and even strangers with gay abandon. The warmth generated was enough to blow away the frigid cold that had enveloped the city for the past 24 hours. Joyous crowds danced and cheered throughout the ceremony  a hush descending only when President Obama began delivering his inaugural speech, which was interrrupted by bursts of applause from the vast crowd.

"Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things - some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path toward prosperity and freedom. "This is the journey we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. "But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions - that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America."
