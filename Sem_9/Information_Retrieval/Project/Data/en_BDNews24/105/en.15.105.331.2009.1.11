<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury has said "free supply of fertilisers and rice at Tk 10 per kg" is a false pledge cooked up by the BNP that attempted to entangle the Awami League into it. "Awami League never promised free supply of fertilisers and rice at Tk 10 per kg and will accept it if anyone can prove that the AL owns the comment," she told reporters at her ministry on Sunday. Since the Dec. 29 election that the AL-led alliance swept, the BNP is claiming that the AL promised free supply of fertilisers and rice at Tk 10 per kg and demanded that the government fulfil its promise. AL spokesperson LGRD and cooperatives minister Syed Ashraful Islam also recently said the party never made such promise. "The toughest challenge the government faces now is to supply fertilisers and seeds in time during the coming Boro season and the government is working on that," Motia, the agriculture minister. said. Earlier, she attended a cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina at the cabinet division conference hall. bdnews24.c
