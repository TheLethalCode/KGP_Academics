 SUVA, Mon Jan 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiji declared a state of emergency and curfews after severe storms and flooding struck the Pacific island nation, killing eight people and forcing thousands to evacuate homes, officials said on Monday. The floodwaters hit over the weekend along the west coast of Fiji's main island of Viti Levu and although they were receding on Monday, some areas remained inaccessible. "I had just finished eating and heard shouts outside, next thing I know I was thrown out of our house and buried in mud and rubble," said landslide survivor Verenaisi Rokobale, 24. Rokobale told the Fiji Times website that she only survived the Sunday landslide in her town of Lololo because a passerby saw her hand sticking out from the mud and debris. Weather officials warned the South Pacific nation that another low depression, bringing heavy rain and strong winds, was heading toward the Fiji island group. "Widespread flooding, including severe flooding of major rivers and streams, is expected on Wednesday and Thursday," Director of Meteorology Rajendra Prasad said in a weather briefing. Interim Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who declared a state of emergency at the weekend, said the government was doing all it could to help people affected by the worst deluge to hit the islands in a decade. "(My) heart goes out to those people who have suffered losses," Bainimarama said. Under the state of emergency, curfews were imposed in Ba, Nadi and Sigatoka towns. "It is basically to safeguard lives and property. We want to prevent criminal elements from taking advantage of the flood hit areas," Minister of Defense and National Security Ratu Epeli told the Fijilive website on Monday. SWEPT AWAY Rescue teams plucked people to safety from rooftops as floodwaters, up to 3 meters (10 ft) deep, struck some areas. "It was really frightening. We watched as the doors of our homes were forced open by the water," Vetaia Dokonivalu in the town of Ba told local media. "We saw our belongings being swept out of the houses." A total of 6,060 people have sought refuge at 114 evacuation centers, said the National Disaster Management Office, confirming the number of displaced which was earlier reported to be 9,000. "We are providing meals to those in the centers we have on our list. For those who come after that, we give them biscuits, milk and other dry stock," said Joeli Rokovada, commissioner of Fiji's western district. Health officials warned floodwater victims to be wary of diseases such as diarrhea and typhoid. "People need to collect as much rainwater as possible and drink as much of this as possible. The other option is to boil the water," said health official Dr Isimeli Tukana. "Watch out for food from supermarkets especially from the towns of Ba, Nadi, Sigatoka and Rakiraki. Our health inspectors will be doing their rounds as soon as the water goes down," Tukana said. Hundreds of foreign tourists had been stranded in resorts, with flights disrupted in some airports and roads shut. "A lot of the restaurants are shut. They've run out of food," New Zealand tourist Nigel Lagdon told TVNZ television. The flooding washed away bridges and roads and swamped the business districts of several towns. The flooding covers Fiji's main sugarcane-producing region. The Fiji Retailers Association said the floods had caused millions of dollars of damages to the business community. "Retailers have reported more than 90 percent damage and loss in stock in Ba and Nadi. There are quite a few who have a total write off of all the assets," said association president Himmat Lodhia
