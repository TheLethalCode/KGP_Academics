<TITLE> Global funds predict recovery in '09: Watson Wyatt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mon Jan 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fund managers are predicting a recovery in global equities in 2009 with returns reaching 6.7 percent, but volatility will remain above the historical average, investment consultant Watson Wyatt said on Monday. World stocks as measured by MSCI fell 43.54 percent in 2008. Watson Wyatt's survey of 104 global asset managers with $10 trillion of funds under management revealed expectations of a recovery in a number of asset markets following steep declines last year. The fund management industry has seen assets decline due to trading losses and investor withdrawals. Equities fund managers are most bullish on Asia, predicting returns of 10 percent for the region in 2009 with UK and Japan stocks expected to lag behind others with returns of 5 percent, the survey -- conducted at the end of 2008 -- found. Fund firms expect equity returns will revert to historic levels by 2012 following the 40 percent decline in the past year. The survey showed fund managers expect a recovery in the US housing market will be underway by the third quarter this year while the price of crude oil is expected to rise to about $60 a barrel in 2009 and to $80 by 2012. By 1212 GMT, US light crude for February delivery was down $1.97 to $38.86. Fund managers expect real yields on long and short-term government securities to remain low though rising as the global economy recovers, while spreads on corporate bonds are expected to fall by between 100 and 200 basis points over the next three years
