 LONDON, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven football fans have been charged with indecent chanting towards Sol Campbell at a Premier League match between Portsmouth and his old club Tottenham Hotspur, Hampshire police confirmed on Tuesday. During the match in September, former England defender Campbell was the target of abuse which was described by then Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp, now in charge of Tottenham, as "filthy". "Police in Portsmouth, Hampshire, have charged 11 people with indecent chanting at a football match," a police statement said. "It follows an operation to identify a number of people following a Portsmouth versus Tottenham match at Fratton Park on Sunday, Sept. 28." Campbell became the target of vitriolic verbal abuse from Tottenham fans when he left the club to join their north London rivals Arsenal in 2001, prior to his move to Portsmouth in 2006. Portsmouth have issued a statement on their website (www.portsmouthfc.co.uk) warning their fans about their behaviour at the return match against Tottenham on Sunday at White Hart Lane. Tension between the rival fans has increased since Redknapp's switch to Tottenham in October and striker Jermain Defoe's move back to Spurs last week after he left them to join Portsmouth last January.
