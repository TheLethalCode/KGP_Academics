 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  A plane of Biman Bangladesh Airlines Ltd. heading for Dubai with 465 people on board made an emergency landing at ZIA after one of the engines malfunctioned on Sunday, officials said. The flight, BG 035, took off at 11:30pm, but after 25 minutes the plane lost one of the engines, Khan Mohammed Sirajul Islam, officer-in-charge of Airport Police Station, told bdnews24.com's Sayed Talat at 1am on Monday. All the passengers and crew are safe, he said. The pilot offloaded much of the fuel in the air as part of the routine safety procedure so that the plane did not catch fire during landing. Firemen, RAB and police were kept on alert at the Zia International Airport just in case. Duty officer of the fire brigade control room Mohammed Ali said, "We rushed all the units to the airport as we had been told that the plane might catch fire." The national flag carrier has a ramshackle fleet of old aircraft that are prone to trouble and the flights often fail to honour timing commitments
