<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 20, (bdnews24.com/bdnews24.com)  Barack Obama sought "a new way forward" with the Muslim world on Tuesday in an inaugural speech that coincided with stark scenes of devastation in the aftermath of the 22-day war in Gaza. Stepping into history as the first black president of the United States, Obama began his inaugural address by thanking predecessor George W Bush for his service to the nation. Appealing for "hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord", Obama called out to all who sought peace. Obama acknowledged his global audience "from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born". "Know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and we are ready to lead once more," he told them. "To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect," said the 44th US president who took oath pronouncing his full name 'Barack Hussain Obama' "We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people, and forge a hard-earned peace in Afghanistan." "With old friends and former foes, we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat, and roll back the spectre of a warming planet." But the new president sent a stern warning to those who seek to harm and destroy America. "We will not apologise for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defence, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you  we will defeat you." Calling America a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and non-believers, Obama said: "America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace." "We cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself," said the new US president. Obama took his oath of office shortly after noon (EST), promising to "preserve, protect and defend" the US constitution, as America's 44th president and the country's first African-American leader. Obama placed his hand on a Bible used by Abraham Lincoln at his first inauguration in 1861, standing on the western steps of the capitol, a building that was partly built by black slaves. The inauguration of Obama, 47, the son of a black Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas, was full of symbolic meaning for African-Americans. Television pictures showed a sea of people, 2 million by some estimates, acking the Mall and inaugural parade route, dancing and cheering as Obama was sworn in. Polls show widespread support for Obama and optimism about the coming four years of his presidency, despite a deepening recession that has saddled the country with a $1 trillion deficit. Bush, who is also leaving a legacy of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is departing office after two terms having plumbed record lows in his approval ratings. GETTING DOWN TO WORK Obama has stressed that the his celebration will be short-lived. On Wednesday he will start shepherding an $825 billion economic stimulus plan through Congress. He faces daunting challenges -- global economic turmoil, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, global warming, conflict in Gaza and tensions between Pakistan and India. But analysts say that at least for now, it will be his ability to revive the recession-hit economy that will be the benchmark by which his presidency is judged. The Washington Post reported that in one of his first actions as president, Obama planned to name former Sen. George Mitchell as his Middle East envoy in one of his first actions as the new U.S. president. Obama is expected to meet his military commanders on Wednesday to discuss the U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq, to fulfill a campaign pledge to withdraw all troops within 16 months. "He is going to lay out a lot of the challenges we face as a country, but he will also remind ... that America has faced great challenges before," his spokesman Robert Gibbs told CNN on Tuesday. "Amid high anticipation the world will be watching the 44th president's inaugural address for inspiration and a road map out of the gloom," the Council on Foreign Relations' Robert McMahon said in a commentary. No president has begun his four-year term in office with as much public confidence -- a 78 percent approval rating in the most recent Gallup poll -- and a sharp contrast with Bush's unpopularity. bd
