 Chandpur, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Twenty five people were feared dead after a trawler capsized in the river Meghna at Chandpur early Monday, police said. A fifteen-hour search and rescue operation had failed to find any survivors or recover any bodies. "The earth-laden trawler Sabbir-1 with 50 labourers on board was heading for Munshiganj from Chandpur at around 3am," Matlab North police officer in-charge M Salahuddin told bdnews24.com. The accident occurred when a cargo vessel, coming from the opposite direction, rammed the trawler near the Doshani ferry station, he said. "Of the 50 on board, 25 managed to swim ashore," the OC said. The other 25 were sleeping in their cabins at the time. "We are working to rescue the missing people and the trawler," said the police official. Mahanpur police outpost officer-in-charge Kamruzzaman said there was still no sign of the sunken trawler or any survivors at 8.30pm. "No bodies have been recovered so far," he said. bdnews
