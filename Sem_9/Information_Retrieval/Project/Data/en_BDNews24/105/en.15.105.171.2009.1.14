<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has strongly condemned the ongoing killing of innocent civilians by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip. "We are appalled by the scale of devastation and the deaths of innocent Palestinians including women and children in the attacks," said the foreign ministry in a press statement Wednesday. Dhaka hoped that the UN secretary-general's visit to the region "would be helpful in restoring peace in Gaza and in all occupied Palestinian territories". The statement also called for Israel's compliance with international law. "Bangladesh is deeply concerned at the unabated violation of international humanitarian law and international human rights law by the Israeli occupation forces." "Israel must comply with the UN Security Council resolution 1860 adopted on the 8th of January that called for an immediate, durable and fully respected ceasefire, leading to full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza". "We believe that full and sincere implementation of the relevant UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions can only resolve the Palestinian crisis," said the foreign ministry. bdn
