 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  NGOs and businesses talk big but never help the farmers in times of crisis, says agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury. "My experience says neither the NGOs nor the private sector ever came forward as friends of farmers to help the government," the minister told a CPD discussion on Boro cultivation on Monday. "You tend to 'dissect' but hardly suggest any forward looking plans," said Motia Chowdhury, who had served as agriculture minister during the 1996-2001 Awami League government. "I won't call it a 'syndicate' but the government will act in case they try to gang up to create any crisis," she warned. "As elected representatives, we have a responsibility  though we can't do everything." The minister said fertiliser was now available at government-fixed prices at the 'thana' level and that private importers were also being given subsidy. Leading experts and economists were present at the dialogue. Former agriculture adviser CS Karim also came up some word of advice based on his two-year experience. "Direct subsidy to the farmers is difficult to administer but it would be improper to make structural changes during the Boro season," Karim said. Karimm opposed open market sale of fertilizer, saying it would create scope for the highly-subsidised urea to be used for non-farm purposes. The former adviser attributed the record Boro output 1.75 crore metric tonneslast year to the availability of fertiliser at the right time. "And we must keep the irrigation pumps functioning." UN Food and Agriculture Organisation representative Ad Spijkers identified the government's policy and the farmers' efforts as the reasons behind last year's bumper paddy output. He hoped the new government would continue to support the farmers to make its 18 million MT output target possible. Researcher Dr Atiur Rahman, however, said he would rather call it investment than subsidy. CPD's Uttam Deb, who presented the keynote paper, said this year's Boro target was "realistic and achievable". bd
