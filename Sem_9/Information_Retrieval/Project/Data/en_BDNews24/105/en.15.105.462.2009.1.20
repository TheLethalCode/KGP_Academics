 Chittagong, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) Police took even the university administrators by surprise when they launched a raid on dormitories just before midnight Monday. "Police laid siege to all dormitories and then said: 'Join us. We are conducting search'," CU law enforcement coordinator Md Manzur Morshed told bdnews24.com at midnight. Police began their search at 11:50pm after surrounding the hall 20 minutes earlier, he said. The police action came after two days of tense lockdown enforced by the pro-AL students who had alleged that the vice chancellor failed to deal with the unruly activists of pro-Jamaat Islami Chhatra Shibir. The pro-AL students had been pressing for the VC resignation, a demand he rejected calling it "illogical". All members of the proctorial body and hall provosts were present during the raid and search. bdn
