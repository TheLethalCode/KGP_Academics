 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Over 400 Dhaka University teachers, expressing concern over ongoing acts of violence and terrorism in different halls, have asked the government and university authorities to ensure peaceful co-existence within the campus. A statement called for restrained behaviour in the interests of classes and ongoing exams. DU vice-chancellor Prof SMA Faiz on Sunday sent a letter to the education secretary seeking to resign. Prof Faiz, who took up his post in Sept. 2002, made the announcement to reporters after pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal members accused the VC of doing nothing against what they said was the ongoing campus violence. Concern was also voiced over the volatile situation Sunday in a meeting of the Dhaka University Teachers Association. Demands were made for strict legal measures against those hampering a peaceful environment. The forceful resignation of the provost of Zia Hall after a violent incident was condemned and identification of the perpetrators by an investigation committee was demanded. Monday's statement was signed 402 teachers including Prof Dr Sadrul Amin, Dr Amninur Rahman Majumdar, Sirajul Islam, Akhtar Hossain Khan, Mizammel Huq, Anwarul Islam, Abdus Sattar, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, Sheikh Nazrul Islam, Said ur Rahman, Tahmin Akhtar, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, Tajmeri Islam, Ziaus Shams and Borhanuddin Khan. bdmew
