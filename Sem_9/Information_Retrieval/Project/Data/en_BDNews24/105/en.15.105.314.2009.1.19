<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Chamber has recommended a government-business task force to try to keep prices within people's reach. "Government interference in an open market economy may bring negative results but at the same time government monitoring is essential," said new DCCI president Zafar Osman on Monday. Of the proposed joint task force, Osman said the body "would monitor everything from the import of items to sales in the retail market". "The price in the local market is related to the prices of essentials in the international market, but sometimes unscrupulous businessmen increase rates in the local market for extra profit," said Osman. "The government has to keep an eye if anyone is resorting to profiteering," the DCCI president said of the government's role. "We must all be active in identifying dishonest businessmen," he added. Osman also proposed reduction of the two-day weekend to just one day, Sunday. "A one day weekend would be in the economic interests of the country," he said. He said Sunday was a holiday in all countries. "Due to our Friday-Saturday weekend, we are facing problems in the export sector." Presenting the recommendations at a press conference, the DCCI chief also suggested separate timings for government and private offices, schools and colleges to reduce traffic congestion in the city. He suggested 8am-4pm for government offices and 9am-5pm for non-government establishments. bdnews
