 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank hsays "new monetary policy" will help the targeted 6.5 percent growth in the second half of the current fiscal, the governor said on Wednesday. "GDP growth in January to June will stand at 6.5 percent if exports can avoid a big impact from the global economic crisis," central banker Salehuddin Ahmed said at a press briefing Wednesday. "The global crisis might persist through 2009 and we are unsure if it will affect the country's exports and remittance inflow," the central bank chief admitted. "But growth will be over six percent even if the world crisis impacts exports," he said. The governor said healthy economic indicators in the first half of the current fiscal and restoration of normalcy in politics had boosted investors' confidence. "This will propel the economy in the second half." On new policy, Salehuddin said, "Increasing credit flow to agriculture and decreasing it in unproductive sectors are some basic components of the policy." "We aim at poverty alleviation, employment generation, stronger growth, tolerable price inflation and helping entrepreneurs explore new avenues in the six months from January." "We hope the new policy will help increase production and GDP growth," he said. Asked if the central bank had discussed monetary policy with the new government, the governor said yes, but added, "The bank formulated the current policy on its own outlook." The FY 2008-9 budget set a 6.5 percent GDP growth and nine percent price inflation. The central banker pointed out, "Price inflation was down to 6.12 percent in November from over 11 percent in July last year." Inflation will fall further as prices of essentials are on a downtrend, he said. He advised the government to maintain measures to keep farm production costs low. On so called 'unproductive sectors', he said, "Credit flow in the private sector in July-December last year rose 24.3 percent, with a big portion going to consumer credit." "But this didn't help the economy much.
