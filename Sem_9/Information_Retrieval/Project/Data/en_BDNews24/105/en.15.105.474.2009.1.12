 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The education ministry on Monday received the letter of Dhaka University vice-chancellor Prof SMA Faiz who sought to be relieved on Sunday, a top official said. Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid acknowledged the letter reaching his ministry and told bdnews24.com a decision would be made soon. A senior ministry official seeking anonymity said a new vice-chancellor could be appointed in a couple of days after relieving Prof Faiz of his duties. The deputy secretary in charge of universities, Rois Uddin earlier told bdnews24.com, "I got the resignation letter when I got to the office in the morning [Monday]. "I faxed the letter and hand-couriered it to the education secretary," Prof Faiz, who is temporarily in charge after his contract ended a few months ago, told bdnews24.com at 10pm on Sunday: He told reporters he wanted to be relieved of the top office of the country's premier public university "to uphold decency and the dignity of the office". "I will continue to do my job until authorities decide on the letter," he had said. Earlier in the day, his personal officer Siddiqur Rahman said, "Vice chancellor SMA Faiz on Sunday afternoon sent a letter to the education secretary at 5pm asking to be relieved." The resignation letter will take effect after president Iajuddin Ahmed, the DU chancellor, approves it. Prof Faiz took over in Sept. 2002 during the BNP-led coalition government's rule. At noon, the VC told reporters, "I have already prepared a letter seeking to be relieved. I will send it to the appropriate authorities as soon as possible." The VC made the announcement to reporters after the pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal members accused the VC of doing nothing against what they said was the ongoing campus violence. The JCD at a press conference at the Madhur Canteen on Sunday issued a 48-hour ultimatum to the administration to ensure peace on the campus. "We'll go for an indefinite strike from Jan. 14 if the university administration fails to meet the deadline," a JCD statement said. The student wing of the mainstream BNP issued the ultimatum after a JCD member was allegedly beaten up by the ruling Awami League-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League workers on the campus right in front of their leaders. DU JCD president Hasan Mamun claimed at the press conference "an atmosphere for education is absent and the students cannot stay in the halls". "The 'digital prime minister has started her turn for change' but we have to announce the action programmes through the analogue system," he said. Mahmud briefed the journalists on the "BCL repressions" on the campus and also said even reporters were not exempted. He demanded punishment to those responsible and restoration of law and order on the campus so that the weary students, specially the examinees, could go back to the university. JCD university unit general secretary Saiful Islam Firoz said, "JCD workers are attacked every day by the BCL activists just because they are JCD workers." "BCL leaders assured us of peaceful co-existence on the campus but broke their promise after their parent organisation Awami league clinched a sweeping victory in the Dec .29 election," he complained. Firoz attributed the turbulent situation to the failure of the university administration in maintaining law and order. "The existence of such an administration is irrelevant if the students cannot stay in the halls and if there is no environment to study," he pointed out. The JCD leaders called on the VC immediately after a fellow activist was beaten up reportedly by the opponent BCL activists. They blamed his administration for the deteriorating law and order and issued the ultimatum to quell the situation
