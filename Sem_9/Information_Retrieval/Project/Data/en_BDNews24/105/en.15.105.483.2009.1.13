 Dhaka, Jan13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP lawmakers may not join the maiden parliament session on Jan. 25 since the day coincides with the introduction of one-party rule in 1975, Khandaker Delwar Hossain has said. "BKSAL was established in the country by killing multi-party democracy on Jan. 25, 1975. This day has been etched into the memory of the people as a 'black day'. "It is not clear why that day has been set for the first session of the parliament," The BNP secretary general told reporters at the BNP office at Naya Paltan on Tuesday. Delwar had gone there in the morning to attend a meeting of the executive committee and front organisations, which discussed the weeklong celebration of the 73rd birth anniversary of BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman starting Jan. 19. As there was a democratic government in power at present, BNP had decided to observe Zia's birth anniversary this year in an elaborated manner in the capital and elsewhere in the country, he said. The former BNP chief whip said, "As BNP opposes negative politics, we don't endorse Awami League's parliament boycott culture. We want to play the role of opposition effectively." "The grand alliance, especially Awami League, has to make conscious efforts to render the environment in the parliament conducive to all those positive activities." Alleging that the national elections were fraud-ridden, Delwar said, "The recently-held polls were extensively fraud and deception-ridden." "Moreover, the post-polls persecution and murder of the vanquished by the victors has come to everybody's notice, which is ongoing unabated." Criticising AL's slogans highlighting promises of 'changing days', he said, "They should not consider the country belongs to them only. "Rather, they should change their mindset to be able to appreciate that the people today want peace and development and an end to negative politics." Asked if the AL had tried to rig the Noakhali-1 seat, which the BNP candidate won on Monday, Delwar said, "No, they failed this time. "The results of the [elections to 299 constituencies] too would have gone in our favour if things had been manoeuvred in the similar manner." A number of BNP leaders including ASM Hannan Shah, Sarwari Rahman, Mirza Abbas, Aman Ullah Aman and Selima Rahman attended the meeting. bdne
