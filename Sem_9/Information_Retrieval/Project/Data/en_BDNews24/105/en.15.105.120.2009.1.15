<TITLE> Expect N.Korea challenge, Bush aide advises Obama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The incoming Barack Obama administration should be ready for early challenges from North Korea as it tries to test Obama and sunder the six-party talks over the North's nuclear ambitions, President George W. Bush's top Asia adviser said on Wednesday. Dennis Wilder, senior adviser for Asia on the National Security Council, also said doubts remained about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, despite recent efforts to show that he had recovered from a suspected stroke last August. "The North's best act is to try to create the conditions of crisis in order to renegotiate with the United States and the new team will have to be ready for that," he told reporters and scholars at a Washington think tank. "Part of the North's goal will be to see if they can split this five-party consortium that has been created," said Wilder of talks in which China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and the United States have tried to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions in exchange for aid and diplomatic benefits. Any renewed North Korean brinkmanship would also be designed to "see just what the new leader of the United States is made of," he added. Obama takes office on January 20. Wilder welcomed remarks by US Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton on Tuesday in which she backed the six-party talks. "It is a framework that the president-elect and I believe has merit but it also provides an opportunity ... for bilateral contact as well between North Korea and the United States," Clinton said at her Senate confirmation hearing. DOUBTS ABOUT KIM'S HEALTH Wilder told the Nixon Center that keeping the six-party format was critical in ensuring China stays involved in the nuclear issue as Pyongyang tries to "reduce the six-party element of this process" in favor of talks with Washington. Prodding China, the country with the most leverage on Pyongyang, to move from passive observer to active participant after the nuclear crisis with North Korea erupted in 2002 was a hard-won gain that should not be squandered, he said. "The Chinese would be happy if we let them off the playing field and back onto the bleachers. I don't think that's in our interest. I don't think it's in Northeast Asia's interest," said Wilder. Under the six-party talks, North Korea in 2005 agreed to abandon all its nuclear programs. However, Pyongyang tested a nuclear device in 2006 and has since dragged its feet on carrying out agreements on disabling its plutonium program. North Korean state media have repeatedly shown photographs of leader Kim Jong-il meeting soldiers and attending concerts -- public outings believed designed to show Kim was in full command after the suspected stroke in August. But Wilder said the North had shown only still photos and no video footage of the reclusive Kim, indicating there may still be questions in Pyongyang about his long-term viability. "That suggests to me that there are some physical signs of his health crisis that they are unwilling to put out there," he said
