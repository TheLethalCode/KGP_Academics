<TEXT>
 MILAN, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Esteban Cambiasso and Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored extra-time goals to send Serie A champions Inter Milan into the Italian Cup quarter-finals with a 3-1 win over 10-man Genoa at the San Siro on Tuesday. Cambiasso crashed in the rebound of a long range shot from fellow substitute Ibrahimovic in the 10th minute of extra time, with the Swede then slipping the ball through Genoa keeper Alessio Scarpi's legs shortly after to book a meeting with holders AS Roma next week. Brazilian forward Adriano had headed in a Maxwell cross to give Inter the lead in the 75th but Marco Rossi's powerful diagonal strike four minutes later put the score even at 1-1 at the end of regulation time. The visitors were a man down from the 20th minute when defender Giuseppe Biava was sent off for a last-man foul just outside the box on Adriano, who was returning from over a month out with injury. The referee ruled it was inside though and awarded Inter a penalty, which Scarpi saved from Adriano. The Brazilian, who has been at the centre of transfer speculation after irritating coach Jose Mourinho with an alleged lack of commitment this season, responded well and had a number of shots well saved as Inter piled forward in the second half. Genoa's in-form Argentine Diego Milito, the scorer of 12 goals in Serie A this term, could not play because of injury but travelled to Milan with his team mates to meet national team coach Diego Maradona, who was in the stands. The league leaders will take on Roma in the last eight after meeting them in the final of the competition in the last four seasons, with Roma winning the previous two and Inter prevailing in 2006 and 2005
