 MADRID, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid's Primera Liga match at home to Athletic Bilbao had to be halted for a minute due to a continual barrage of snowballs being thrown towards the visitors goal on Sunday. "Before the start of the game and when we were on the pitch home fans behind the goal defended by Bilbao threw numerous snowballs towards the goal, some of them hitting the goalkeeper," referee Cesar Muniz Fernandez said in his match report. The game started after a message had been put out over the stadium PA system asking fans to desist. "In the fifth minute, I was forced to stop the game for a minute because of the continuous throwing of snowballs and had to ask officials to take the necessary measures." The game restarted and Bilbao went on to win 3-2
