 Noakhali, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's Mahabub Uddin Khokan bagged the Noakhali-1 seat in Monday's election, beating the AL candidate by nearly 24,000 votes. Results from the constituency's 105 polling centres showed Mahbub polled 1,04,726 votes, while HM Ibrahim of Awami League secured 80,981 votes. Noakhali deputy commissioner Abdus Salam read out the signed results to reporters before handing them over. "Voting was held peacefully with no untoward incidents from 8am to 4pm," returning officer M Abdul Haque said. Polling centres in Noakhali-1 (Chatkhil-Sonaimuri) saw long queues of people ignoring chilly weather from morning, and peaceful voting through the day in the seat's deferred election. Eight candidates took part, in the constituency of 247,407 enrolled voters. The Noakhali-1 vote was deferred after the death of one of the candidates -- Gonotantree Party president and grand alliance nominee Nurul Islam -- just days before the Dec 29 general elections. Police, Bangladesh Rifles and Rapid Action Batallion were deployed across the constituency from early morning until ballot counting was complete. BNP nominees have won the seat four times, long known as a BNP stronghold. The Awami League won it twice. bdnews2
