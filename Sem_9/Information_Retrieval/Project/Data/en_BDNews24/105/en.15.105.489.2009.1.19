 Chittagong, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong University reopened on Monday after authorities with help of police broke the locks on the main gates and faculty buildings, placed by Bangladesh Chhatra League activists since Saturday. However, the attendance of students was thin, few departments held classes, and administrative activities were at a minimum. Awami League-backed had been holding the campus siege since early Saturday, locking all gates and academic buildings, giving the vice chancellor Prof M Badiul Alam "48 hours" to resign. Vice chancellor Prof M Badiul Alam told bdnews24.com, "Some motivated teachers and a certain quarter are intentionally conspiring to paralyse the activities of the university." He said he would resign immediately if anyone could prove any of the allegations brought against him. CU BCL leaders have defended their actions in past days saying the VC had failed to take action against violence perpetrated by Jamaat-backed Shibir students who have long had a stronghold on the campus. A group of pro-AL teachers have also accused the VC of "corruption in appointments". Despite resumption of academic activities Monday, the CU BCL unit continued their protest by barricading the VC's residence and holding a sit-in in front of the his office. Some agitating students were also seen burning an effigy of the VC. CU BCL general secretary M Ershad Hossain told bdnews24.com that the authorities opened the locks in line with a government. "But we have not withdrawn our siege of the campus." "We will continue our protest until the VC tenders his resignation," said the student leader. bdnews
