<TITLE> Iraqi Shia denies rift among ruling parties </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, Mon Jan 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A leader of Iraq's most powerful Shia group played down political rivalries within the ruling coalition ahead of elections this year, and said rivals from the majority sect would campaign against each other as friends. The future of Iraq's ruling Shia coalition has been put in doubt after parties that campaigned together in 2005 decided to go it alone in provincial elections at the end of this month. But Ammar al-Hakim, widely tipped to replace his ailing father as chief of Iraq's powerful Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (ISCI) and head of one of the majority Shia country's most prominent religious dynasties, denied there was a deep rift. "It is competition between friends in the framework of building up the provinces. We don't see any harm and it's an opportunity for all to know the extent of confidence they enjoy among the people," he told Reuters in an interview. "After that there will be true alliances with anyone who has this confidence, that is our aim." He even hinted at a rapprochement with followers of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who quit the ruling alliance and clashed with ISCI on the streets in 2007 but have since disbanded their militia and indicated they aim to return to politics. "We look with great respect on the other political powers ... We have pledged to ourselves after the elections to extend the hand of cooperation to all the powers and figures that have the confidence of the people," Hakim said of the Sadrists. With his neat beard and easy smiles, Hakim -- 37 year-old scion of the powerful Shi'ite family which heads ISCI -- is a stark contrast to scowling rival Sadr, whose own family has vied with the Hakims for influence for years. Ammar al-Hakim is widely tipped as a likely heir to his father, ISCI leader Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, who has cancer. The younger Hakim said a leadership change was not on the table and doctors were optimistic about his father's health. "The health of (Abdul Aziz al-Hakim) is known, and my brothers in the ISCI leadership have called upon me to be close to his eminence and to help him with his work," he said. ISCI dominates almost all the powerful provincial councils of Iraq's oil-rich south, and is a key member of the ruling United Iraqi Alliance, a coalition of Shia groups headed by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, of the sometime rival Dawa Party. ISCI helped install Maliki in 2005, but the past years have seen the prime minister consolidate his power within the central government, while ISCI has pushed for greater regional independence for southern provinces where it holds sway. The decision to contest the elections separately from Dawa stemmed from disagreement over regional autonomy, Hakim said. "There are many readings and opinions on the role of the provincial councils. ISCI has an understanding ... that these councils should have greater powers and budgets for development and reconstruction." ISCI was formed in exile in Iran, but came to its position of power in Iraq with the help of the United States. It remains close to both arch-foes -- Tehran and Washington -- through a carefully managed balancing act. On George W Bush's last to visit to Iraq, the outgoing US President singled out Abdul Aziz al-Hakim for an embrace and kiss. Opponents have criticised ISCI's foreign links, but Ammar al-Hakim said warm ties with Washington and Tehran make sense. "It is in Iraq's interest to open up to its neighbours and the region, and it is in its interest to open up to the countries that have an effect in international decision making," Hakim said
