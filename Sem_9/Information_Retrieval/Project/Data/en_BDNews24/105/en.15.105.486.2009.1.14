The 74-year-old Canadian icon will perform at the Beacon Theater in New York City on February 19. Tickets for the show at the 2,800-seat venue will go on sale on Friday. A spokeswoman said she could not yet provide details of any additional shows. Cohen has been on tour since May, playing shows across Canada and Europe. He is about to begin a trek through New Zealand and Australia. After his previous tour in the early 1990s, he retreated to a mountain near Los Angeles to become a Buddhist monk. He resurfaced in 2005, claiming that his former manager and lover Kelley Lynch misappropriated more than $5 million, reducing his retirement account to $150,000. A Los Angeles court awarded him a $9 million civil judgment, but he has reportedly not been able to collect from Lynch.
