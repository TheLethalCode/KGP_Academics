 Cox's Bazar, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Fifty-four people were hurt as police and paramilitary BDR shot at unruly protesters after EC had cancelled the candidacy of a local Awami League leader. "[The protesters] rampaged through a bus station and damaged shops in the area," said Ukhia police officer in charge Mustafa Kamal. The EC on Monday announced that Hamidul Huq Chowdhury would not be allowed to run for Ukhia Upazila chairman on grounds of loan default. "Some 54 people were hurt, at least four of them sustaining bullet injuries, in clashes between the protesters and members of BDR, police and Ansar," said the OC. Among the four sustaining bullet injuries, Akhter, 22, Mohammad Ali, 35 and another unidentified man were rushed to Ukhia Upazila Health Complex. The fourth, Shahabuddin, was transferred on to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital. Police and witnesses said the mob tried to storm the local Upazila complex. "They snatched eight ballot boxes from a jeep headed to Thainkali Primary School polling centre and smashed them," said Mustafa. "They also took away 2,807 ballot papers which they later set fire to." Members of police and BDR were also among the injured, as was the candidate's wife Nigar Sultana Huq, said the police officer. Hamidul, who after visiting the spot fainted, was admitted to the Upazila health complex. The OC told bdnews24.com, "The Awami League demonstrators supporting Hamidul blockaded the main road."
