<TEXT>
 Noakhali, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Polling centres of Noakhali-1 saw long queues of people ignoring chilly weather from morning, and peaceful voting through the day in the seat's deferred election on Monday. Eighty year-old Mozaffar Ahmed was found casting his ballot at one of the constituency's 105 centres, in Nadna union. He told bdnews24.com: "I came to vote as the environment is peaceful. I wish voting may be held in such a free and happy atmosphere all the time." Sayera Khatun, another elderly local aged 72, said she did not have any intention of casting a vote, but: "As the atmosphere was peaceful and festive I came to see." Eight candidates were vying for the ballots of 247,407 registered voters from 8am to 4pm in the deferred election for Noakhali-1 that covers Chatkhil and Sonaimuri. The Election Commission postponed the constituency's vote following the death of Gonotantree Party president and grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam in early December. The EC announced the constituency's new election date of Jan 12, just days ahead of the Dec 29 elections to 299 of the total 300 parliamentary seats. Police, Bangladesh Rifles and Rapid Action Batallion were being deployed across the constituency as striking and mobile forces from early morning until ballot counting is complete, to ensure a trouble free vote. The seat has earlier gone to BNP four times and Awami League twice. bdnews24.c
