<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barack Obama, fresh from the pageantry of his historic inauguration, will quickly turn on Wednesday toward his goals of rescuing the economy, charting a new course for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and shaping his approach to the Middle East conflict, turning the page on the Bush years. Obama has pledged bold and swift action to deal with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and declared to millions watching abroad: "We are ready to lead once more." Barack Obama took power as the first black US president on Tuesday, urging Americans to rally to end the worst economic crisis in generations and repair the US image abroad. "Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America," Obama said, addressing an exuberant sea of people in an inaugural speech that was optimistic but realistic about the challenges ahead. He asked his countrymen for patience in grappling with challenges both foreign and domestic that will take time to resolve. Underscoring the tough road ahead, Wall Street ushered in the new presidency with a record Inauguration Day slide amid signs the global banking crisis was far from over. Hundreds of thousands of people erupted in cheers on Washington's National Mall grounds as they watched Obama stand with one hand raised, one hand on a Bible used to swear in Abraham Lincoln in 1861, and repeat the brief oath to become the 44th US president. Beaming, the new president kissed his wife, Michelle, and his school-age daughters, Malia and Sasha. Then he turned to the crowds stretching into the distance on a cold, wintry day. "Obama, Obama," the crowd cheered. Obama, a Democrat, succeeded Republican George W. Bush, who served two terms and left office having plumbed record lows in approval ratings and leaving a legacy of two wars and an economy in recession. Obama offered a sharp break from Bush, emphasizing the need for sacrifice and pledging to restore U.S. global standing, responsibly end the war in Iraq, and focus less on the size of government and more on whether it works. BRACING FOR REALITY Polls show widespread US public support for Obama and optimism about the coming four years of his presidency. But Obama sought to temper soaring expectations with reality. The new president cited the worst US economic conditions in 70 years and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars as having put the country in crisis. "What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility," he said. He said the "badly weakened" US economy will be a top priority as he works with the Democratic-controlled US Congress on an estimated $825 billion economic stimulus package. The economy had fallen victim to "greed and irresponsibility" and an avoidance of hard choices, Obama said. The economic crisis showed that markets can spin out of control "without a watchful eye," he added, signaling he would put a priority on revamping financial regulations. Obama will meet his senior economic advisers on Wednesday to discuss the stimulus plan. Turning to foreign policy and the standing of the United States abroad, Obama vowed the United States would leave Iraq "responsibly" and help Afghanistan win a hard-earned peace. He did not provide a specific timetable for a US withdrawal from Iraq, but under a US-Iraqi agreement, US troops would depart by the end of 2011. Obama has pledged to increase US troop strength in Afghanistan to turn back a resurgent Taliban. He was due to meet military commanders on Wednesday to discuss the possibility of accelerating the US troop withdrawal from Iraq, and the need for more forces in Afghanistan. In a clear reference to harsh US interrogation practices of terrorism suspects that have been widely condemned abroad, Obama vowed a change, saying he rejected as false "the choice between our safety and our ideals." There has been broad world disapproval of many Bush policies in the US war on terrorism that Bush declared after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 that deeply shaped his eight years in office. After years of tense relations with Muslims, Obama offered conciliatory words to the Islamic community, saying he would seek a "new way forward" based on mutual interest and mutual respect. But on the issue of terrorism, he said: "You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you." Bush, his public approval ratings in the basement as the cheers for Obama resounded around the city, left Washington for his home state of Texas after the inauguration. 11 MILLION UNEMPLOYED The recession has saddled the country with a $1 trillion deficit and 11 million people unemployed and has become the top concern of the US public. Economic woes helped Obama beat Republican John McCain in the November presidential election. "I don't care what color he is," said Garrell Winstead, a 67-year-old real estate investor from Cincinnati, Ohio who was in Tuesday's crowd. "If the economy doesn't improve and if he doesn't create enough jobs, patience will evaporate." Obama gave no specifics about his proposed stimulus package. But he said the plan that would pay for new roads, bridges, electrical grids and other projects would set the foundation for future growth. He also repeated campaign promises to "restore science to its rightful place" -- the Bush administration was criticized for packing scientific advisory panels with industry representatives and ideologues. He also promised to put technology to work transforming healthcare, and action toward an alternative energy policy
