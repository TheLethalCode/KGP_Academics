 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  Editors have asked the information minister to further examine the createkr governmet's right to information ordinance before ratifying it in parliament. They sought assistance of the democratic government to ensure freedom of speech for journalists. The editors also asked Abul Kalam Azad to make distribution of government advertisements, payment of bills easy and cut newsprint costs. The newly-appointed information minister met with editors of the news media at his ministry on Tuesday to exchange views. "The people have voted this government to power with a lot of expectations and, if these are not met then the government may face criticism," said editor of the Independent and former caretaker government adviser Mahbubul Alam. So, he added, the government has to keep a liberal outlook. The government has to ensure an unhindered flow of information," observed Ataus Samad. "The critics are the government's best allies," said Mahfuz Anam. Golam Sarwar said, "The media will keep a keen eye on developments and play the role of the opposition." He added steps had been taken to make state-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar autonomous but there were still many obstacles. The government has to decide if it wants to take risks on this issue, he said. ABM Musa, referring to the Press Institute of Bangladesh and Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, said, "These bodies need to become autonomous and the information ministry needs to be free of bureaucracy." Iqbal Sobhan Chowdhury demanded proper investigation into incidents of repression on journalists during the previous government. "Journalists were killed but these were never properly investigated." The minister said the government would take measures on the issues at the earliest. He said in reply to editors' concerns: "The ministry has started work on the right to information law and necessary steps will be taken after discussion with the prime minister." The caretaker government's Right to Information Ordinance 2008 came into effect last October. Azad promised measures to make sure that the flow of information was not hindered. He said the Awami League-led government was the people's government and asked for constructive criticism. "Like in the past, you will have to play an important role," he said to the editors. On the autonomy of BTV and Betar, he said, "A lot of work has been done in the past without any result." Appropriate steps will be taken after this issue is discussed with the prime minister, he added. "The government will take steps to ensure the security not only of journalists but also of the whole nation." Security is a right of all citizens, he observed. Information secretary Jamil Osman, chief information officer Iftekhar Hossain and the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad were present at the meeting.
