<TITLE> South Africa's Zuma faces new graft trial </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BLOEMFONTEIN, Mon Jan 12,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's appeals court Monday overturned a judge's decision to dismiss graft charges against ruling ANC leader Jacob Zuma, opening the way for fresh corruption proceedings against him. The ruling comes only months before a general election in which the African National Congress faces its toughest challenge since the end of apartheid and re-opening the case could damage Zuma's image at a crucial moment. The Supreme Court of Appeal said in its judgment that a High Court judge made several errors in a September 12., 2008 ruling. "The appeal is upheld with costs," judge Louis Harms said in reading the judgment of five appeal court judges. The National Prosecuting Authority welcomed the ruling and said Zuma remained charged. Analysts said the decision increased political risk in Africa's biggest economy ahead of the general election expected around April. The rand currency weakened sharply to a one-month low of 10.0250 against the dollar from 9.9195 before the ruling. "The markets have already reacted somewhat negatively, because this heightens political uncertainty and risk in the near-term," said Razia Khan, regional head of research Africa at Standard Chartered. "Investors fear that a renewed focus on politicking will divert attention from the all-important reassurance they seek that economic policy will not change in a meaningful way under the new leadership. Those reassurances are now likely to take a secondary role, as the battle for grassroots support intensifies," Khan added. Monday's ruling would be unlikely to stop Zuma being elected but could strengthen the challenge from a new party of ANC dissidents called COPE (Congress of the People), generally seen as being more pro-business than Zuma's allies. The ANC said the ruling will not affect its decision to name Zuma as the presidential candidate for the 2009 election. "The ANC and its president reserves the right to pursue all options available in law," it said in a statement. Zuma can still appeal to the appeals court ruling in the Constitutional Court -- South Africa's highest court. A High Court judge dismissed bribery, fraud and other charges against Zuma in September and suggested former President Thabo Mbeki had interfered in the case, an allegation he denied. That judgment caused a political firestorm, leading to the ousting of Mbeki as president and deeply dividing the party. An anti-Zuma faction then formed COPE
