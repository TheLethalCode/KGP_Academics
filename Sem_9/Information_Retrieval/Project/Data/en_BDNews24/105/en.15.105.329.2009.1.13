<TITLE> Ganges water sharing depends on water flow: Indian envoy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Indian high commissioner has said those who say Bangladesh is deprived of its share of Ganges water are either doing so to serve political ends or do not know the water-sharing agreement. "The water-sharing conditions have been fixed based on the flow of water on the Ganges," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told journalists on Tuesday after meeting water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen at the Secretariat. The height of the Himalayas is reducing, causing the water flow in the Ganges to fall and Bangladesh is getting water from what is left, he explained. "If the amount of water plummets then so will the ratio of sharing quantity." The other bilateral issues are river excavation, coast preservation dams near the borders and water management, the envoy said. Talking about stopping work on dams near the border, he said, "This is a bi-lateral issue and a unilateral attempt will not solve this." Chakravarty added the work on the dam would begin following talks between the two countries. The high commissioner was also upbeat about the signing of Teesta River water-sharing agreement. The 1996-2001 Awami League government signed the 30-year Ganges agreement with India. "India has agreed to a Joint River Commission (JRC) meeting on Ganges water-sharing and other issues," said Ramesh Chandra Sen, the water resources minister. He said Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee was coming to Bangladesh in February and hoped all problems "created during the four-party-government" would be resolved. Sen was also hopeful about the Teesta river water-sharing agreement. b
