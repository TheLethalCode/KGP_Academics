 NEW DELHI, Mon Jan 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India plans to cut the price of fuel in 10 days, a move analysts say is aimed at pleasing voters and lifting business sentiment ahead of general elections due by May. "We have to reduce it, and it has to be done at the earliest. It will take another 10 days or so," Dinsha Patel told reporters on the sidelines of the Petrotech conference. India had cut diesel prices by 6 percent and gasoline rates by 10 percent in early December, the first reduction in state-set prices in two years, after crude oil plunged more than $100 a barrel since its July peak above $147. Lower oil prices in a slowing economy have helped India's inflation rate fall to 5.9 percent in end-December, after it galloped to 13-year high of 12.9 percent in August. "The government wants to give maximum benefit to consumers, middle class and farmers," Patel said. Oil prices fell more than $1 to below $40 a barrel on Monday, extending the previous session's 2 percent fall, on persistent fears about energy demand after data showed U.S. unemployment rate rose to its highest level in almost 16 years as a deepening recession forced firms to axe more than half a million jobs. The Indian government, which controls the price of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene, would have cut fuel prices to match the steep fall in crude costs, analysts say. "This is not really a political move but has political overtones," said D.H. Pai Panandikar, an economist at thinktank RPG Foundation. "International prices have come down drastically. In response, the administered price of petroleum has to come down." He said the likely cut in prices would further moderate inflation as petroleum products had a high weightage in India's wholesale price index. "Many of the industries, which depend upon oil will improve their profit margins, which of course will also be reflected in their stock prices," he said
