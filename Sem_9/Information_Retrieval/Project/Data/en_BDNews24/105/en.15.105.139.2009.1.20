 NEW DELHI, Tue Jan 20, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has room for more fiscal and monetary policy measures to revive its slowing economy and the government will act to protect growth in the next fiscal year, a senior policy adviser said on Tuesday. Indian authorities have slashed interest rates, cut factory gate duties and announced extra spending as high borrowing costs and the global downturn has tripped up economic activity. "We need to actively use both monetary and fiscal policies in the coming year," the Planning Commission's deputy chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, told reporters after a business meet. "Obviously there is room to do more and we are working on it," he said. Policy makers say the Indian economy, Asia's third-biggest, is likely to expand by a still robust 7 percent in the 2008/09 fiscal year. But that will be lower than the 9 percent of the last three years, and the central bank governor has said 2009/10 could be a more difficult year. The central bank has cut its key lending rate by 350 basis points since October, as its focus shifted to supporting growth once inflation -- which spiralled into double digits last June -- began to cool. The bank will next review its policy stance on Jan. 27. Indian industry is lobbying for further cuts in rates and taxes, with leading firms expected to announce lower profits while exporters grapple with falling overseas sales. But Ahluwalia said there would be no tax changes between now and the next full budget, after elections due by May. India's parliament will in February begin its final session before the national polls, and the government will seek a "vote on account" rather than present a budget for the financial year starting April. For the 2008/09 fiscal year, India plans to spend an extra 1.47 trillion rupees ($30 billion) over its budgeted expenditure to stimulate a slowing economy, pay food and energy subsidies, fund a farm debt scheme and a pay hike for government staff. "The most important thing on the stimulus is we have made some very, very large and important announcements. If we can implement what has been announced, it will inject a lot of expenditure into the economy," Ahluwalia said. "We must have stimulus also for the next year because what we have announced is for the current fiscal year," he added.
