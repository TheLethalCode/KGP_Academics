 MILAN, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Argentina coach Diego Maradona has said Carlos Tevez should think of leaving Manchester United for Serie A title holders Inter Milan. The 24-year-old Argentine forward's future with the English and European champions is in doubt with his current deal due to expire at the end of the season. "Yesterday (Sunday) I saw Manchester United win (3-0 against Chelsea) without Tevez. This isn't good for him," Maradona was quoted as saying by Corriere dello Sport on Tuesday. "Certain episodes are certainly bringing closer his exit. Italy and Inter in particular would be excellent solutions. "What's more, his contract is running out, which makes it easier to change team." Maradona, who is in Italy to watch Inter's Italian Cup tie against Genoa at the San Siro later on Tuesday, said Atletico Madrid's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero should also consider transferring to Inter. "What advice would I give him? To come running to Inter. I can already imagine the extraordinary partnership he'd form with (Zlatan) Ibrahimovic." Aguero is in a relationship with Maradona's daughter Giannina, who is expecting his child next month
