 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  In her first meeting as ECNEC chair, Sheikh Hasina has cleared three development projects, giving nearly Tk 680 crore to public universities and Tk 170 crore to dredge rivers. The executive committee of national economic council on Tuesday approved the projects in a meeting that heard the prime minister order all to quicken the pace of development projects. The first six months of the current fiscal has seen just 24 per cent of annual development programme (ADP) implemented, which worries the new government leaders. "The prime minister has asked us to employ all our resources to expedite the ADP implementation," planning minister AK Khandaker told reporters after the meeting. "She's instructed us to deliver 85-90 percent by the end of the year," the minister said and added that the second six months had always showed better results in project implementation. Of the three projects, two are new. Public universities will get Tk 444 crore under one new project. In a revised project, a further Tk 233 crore will be spent on improving quality of education and infrastructure in public universities. The shipping and inland water transport ministry will get Tk 170 crore to buy two dredgers, crane boats, crew-houseboat, tugboat and relevant logistics. The minister said the ECNEC would now meet every Tuesday to help quicker ADP implementation. Agriculture will get top priority, followed by infrastructure, power, gas and other socio-economic projects, Khandaker said. The Tk 26,000 crore ADP of the current fiscal year includes 904 projects, said planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury. Finance minister AMA Muhit, agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury with other ministers, state ministers and secretaries were present at the meeting.
