<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing president Iajuddin Ahmed has said that the independence of the media has helped restore democracy. "An independent media always plays a crucial role in the economic and democratic development of a country," the president said in a farewell meeting with editors and senior journalists on Wednesday at Bangabhaban. "Our media have been expressing their views independently, and for that we have become able to return to a democratic government," he said. Iajuddin, who took office as president on Sept 6, 2002, thanked those present for their cooperation during his six-year term. He hoped the ninth parliament would quickly elect a president who would take over the position immediately. On his brief but beleaguered stint as the chief of the caretaker government, Iajuddin said: "I had to take over the responsibility of the head of the caretaker government in an unstable situation after the eighth parliament dissolved." "But after all ups and downs democracy and the people have achieved victory." "As human beings none of us are above all mistakes. We have limitations of knowledge. What seems right today may be proved wrong in course of time," said the outgoing president. "I never wanted harm of any person or institution directly or indirectly. But I am a human being. I am not above criticism." Iajuddin said a free and proper parliamentary election on Dec 29 had helped build "a firm and strong foundation of democracy". bdnew
