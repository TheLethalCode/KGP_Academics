<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Tuesday claimed that no important document was lost during the break-in at the Railway headquarters in Dhaka and Chittagong. "No important document is missing from Dhaka Railway Bhaban according to the information we have got so far," roads and railways secretary Iqbal Mahmud told reporters at the communications ministry. "We still believe that it is simply an incident of stealing. It is shameful that we failed to protect Railway Bhaban," he said. A laptop, four mobile phone sets and Tk 92, 000 in cash were stolen from the Dhaka Railway Bhaban. "People who preserve documents said that no documents have been missing," he said. "But the reports of the newspapers of missing important documents are really worrying. We are carrying out executive and criminal investigation, and hope to unravel the mystery soon," the secretary said. On the incident at Chittagong Railway Bhaban, he said: "Some old timetable charts and documents were kept in a room. These documents are not that significant." Asked to speculate on the reasons behind such incidents, Iqbal said: "We are investigating. It is not wise to make any comment now. It might influence the whole investigation process." The communications ministry and Railways Department have formed two separate committees to probe into the incidents, the secretary said. Action has been taken against one supervisor and seven security guards so far. "But the Railway Bhaban officials cannot evade the responsibility," the secretary said.
