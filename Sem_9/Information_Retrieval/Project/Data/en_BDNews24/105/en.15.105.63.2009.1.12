 Dhaka, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has yet to receive allegations against Arafat Rahman Coco, former BNP alliance ministers and others, involving some Tk 1300 crore in bribes, an ACC statement said on Monday. "The Commission will probe any such allegations once it receives them," the statement said. ACC director general Col Hanif Iqbal, however, told a regular press briefing on Monday, "There could be more than the Tk 11.5 crore, which the Commission found deposited in a Singapore bank in the Coco's name." Representatives of the US Justice Department and UK Institute of Management called on law minister Shafique Ahmed on Sunday to seek the Bangladesh government's help in recovering what they said was almost $200 million (Tk 1300 crore) received as bribes against awarding work orders to different firms during the BNP-alliance government. Hanif Iqbal said on Monday, "We've seen newspaper reports about the 'four-party government ministers and others' receiving some Tk 1300 crore as bribes against work orders' but haven't as yet received any specific allegations to that effect." "Investigations into the allegations, if any, will follow." "As per rules the attorney general passes on such allegations to the ACC, which then follows legal procedures in investigating them. The Commission never discloses unproven facts." Meanwhile members of the US and UK delegations called on ACC high-ups including the chairman, Hanif said. Asked about the issues discussed with the delegation the director general said, "Under the bilateral agreement between the countries, there is a provision for mutual cooperation on exchanging information to identify the corrupt and bring them to justice." "These issues were discussed," he said. Hanif added, "Investigations are continuing on the confiscated funds from Coco's Singapore bank account, which could rise." "Legal proceedings will start soon after the investigations are complete," said the ACC official. bdnew
