 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Another drop in diesel price is likely, and fertiliser may follow soon, finance Minister AMA Muhit said Tuesday. "The price of diesel could be lowered a little more in line with the global trend," AMA Muhit told reporters after a meeting with the National Board of Revenue. "The government will decide on it after further review." Muhit also hinted that budgetary constraints would be taken into account before such a decision.

Work on "readjusting" the price of fertiliser was also underway, Muhit said. "The price of ferlitiser is low in the global market. But the stock we have now was bought at a higher rate. The prices are being readjusted taking all aspects into account," said the finance minister. The government is moving on an emergency basis for the Boro season, he said. Only last month, the caretaker government lowered the diesel price to Tk 46 from Tk 48. It also cut petrol to Tk 74 from Tk 78 and octane to Tk 77 from Tk 80.
