<TITLE> World political freedom declined in 2008: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Taipei, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Political freedoms declined around the world for a third straight year in 2008, with Russia and Greece down over political incidents and Iraq and Malaysia up on increased pluralism, a U.S. rights organisation said on Tuesday. Russia, docked for elections that were "neither free nor fair," and neighbouring Russian-influenced countries that had stifled dissent following peaceful anti-authoritarian revolutions led the downward trend, Freedom House said in an annual survey. Greece sank over nationwide riots in December and the government's "inability" to control them, the pro-democracy group said in a statement released at a news conference in Taipei. But Iraq, despite years of turmoil following a U.S.-led war, moved up the chart due to security improvements and more Sunni Muslim political participation. Malaysia also got a higher mark for the opposition's new momentum in national elections. Freedom House presented the report in Taipei because it sees Taiwan as a free region in Asia, where it wants to make an impact, its local organiser said. The world's 89 "free" countries or regions outnumbered the 42 listed as "non-free" last year, but political rights and civil liberties declined largely because governments worldwide mimicked European anti-authoritarian "color revolutions" that reversed course and squelched democracy, Freedom House said. "Although setbacks in 2008 did not represent substantial declines for most countries, setbacks were numerous and affected most regions," the group's statement says, citing 34 declines and 14 improvements. Finland led the 193 countries and regions surveyed, with North Korea at the bottom. Situations in neither country changed over the year, the Freedom House survey indicated. China scored near the bottom because instead of improving human rights and democracy ahead of the Beijing Olympics last year, it showed the world a "self-confident totalitarian spectacle", Freedom House said in its 2008 report. The global financial crisis threatens political rights and liberties this year in places without "democratic institutions" and "safety valves" to ease any ensuing conflicts, said Christopher Walker, Freedom House's director of studies. "The global financial crisis over time will worsen," Walker told a news conference in Taipei. "So 2009 will be quite a challenge in that respect."
