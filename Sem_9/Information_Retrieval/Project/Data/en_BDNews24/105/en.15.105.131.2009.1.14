 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were 77 for three in 14 overs after Sri Lanka were bundled out for 147 in 30.3 overs in the fog-curtailed third match of the Tri-Nation Cup on Wednesday. Mohammad Ashraful was batting on 14 with Shakib Al Hasan 46 on at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Tamim Iqbal was the latest to go, run out by a direct throw from Chamara Kupugedera for nine, leaving the side at 11 for three in 3.5 overs. Mushfiqur Rahim edged Thilan Thushara behind to Kumar Sangakkara for a eight-ball one after opener Junaed Siddique was run out before facing a ball. Bangladesh now have to chase the target in 24.5 overs, to qualify for playing the final on Friday. If Bangladesh can reach the target in 24.5 overs, then they will be awarded a bonus point along with four match points meaning Bangladesh will go one point up compared with Zimbabwe boasting four points. Otherwise, the victory will go in vain, and Zimbabwe, with an advantage of head-to-head, and Sri Lanka will play the final. The match began at 12.15 pm, more than three hours past the scheduled start time, being reduced to a 31-over-a-side affair because of the dense fog. After winning the toss amid foggy condition, Mohammad Ashraful gave the new ball to Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who did not frustrate the Bangladesh captain providing a blitz start. Mashrafee in the very third delivery of the day trapped Upul Tharanga for a three-ball duck and then bowled Kumar Sangakkara for five-ball duck in his second over with Sri Lanka on four for two in 2.2 overs. But, new ball partner Mahbubul Alam struggled to find line and length to allow Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardene to recover from the damage with a defiant 71 runs for the third wicket. Off-spinner Naeem Islam, who replaced debutant pacer Rubel Hossain, removed Jayawardene for a 44-ball 28, leaving Sri Lanka at 75 for three and Mashrafee was dismissed Jayasuriya in his second spell and returned three for 25 in his seven-over spell. Jayasuriya, dropped on 28 by Roqibul Hasan off Mashrafee, quickfired 54 off 64 balls studded with seven fours and Jehan Mubarak was run out for 10, triggering a collapse. Rubel, conceding 12 runs in his first two-over spell, was again brought and struck to claim his debut wicket of Angelo Mathews, who gave a catch to Mashrafee for a five-ball two. Mahbubul Alam inside-edged Chamara Kapugedera for a 30-ball 28 while Rubel cleaned up the tail dismissing Nuwan Kulasekara (5), Thilan Thushara (o) and Ajantha Mendis (0) in a row to return four for 33. bd
