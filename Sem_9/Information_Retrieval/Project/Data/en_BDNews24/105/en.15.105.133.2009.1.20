 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com) - ADP implementation in the land ministry in last six months has been just 9.58 per cent, revealed land ministry officials on Tuesday. Land minister Razaul Karim Hira held an ADP evaluation meeting on, in which the working paper revealed the snail's pace of execution at the ministry. The minister urged faster implementation, said an aide. He also asked to ensure that funds are spent judiciously, proper engineers are appointed and time target is maintained for the implementation of the projects. Ministry officials said the slow pace of implementation has been due to non-approval of projects. The minister also ordered distribution of 14,800 acres of Khas land among 9500 landless families under the CDSP-3 project. Under the revenue budget, the land ministry has undertaken Computerisation of Land Management System (CLMS) of Dhaka district and the Preservation of International Boundary Strip Maps and Mouja Maps by Scanning. Ministry officials in the meeting said the work would be done by 2009. bdnew
