<TITLE> Japan PM under pressure as ex-minister quits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A reform-minded former financial minister left Japan's ruling party on Tuesday in a sign that unpopular Prime Minister Taro Aso's grip over his Liberal Democrats has weakened further, ahead of an election this year. With public support ratings below 20 percent, Aso is struggling to exert leadership in the face of an emboldened opposition, which controls parliament's upper house and has threatened to stall bills in a bid to force an early election. Aso, 68, has ruled out a snap poll, but Yoshimi Watanabe, an ex-financial services minister and other lawmakers in the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are turning up the heat as anxiety grows about the chances of the party losing more than 50 years of near-unbroken rule. Watanabe handed in his resignation from the LDP after his calls for an early election and other policy demands, including reforms in the bureaucracy, were ignored. "Aso's government has become so out of touch with the people, that we need a change fast," he told reporters. Watanabe is set to vote against or abstain from voting on a second extra budget and related bills in the lower house later in the day. The second extra budget, along with another extra budget for the year to March and a record 88.5 trillion yen ($990 billion) budget for the fiscal year starting in April, will finance 12 trillion yen in fiscal stimulus programs. The amount is equal to 2 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, but the opposition says the measures, particularly a plan to pay out 2 trillion yen to individuals, would do little to prop up the recession-hit economy. The budget could be approved by the lower house even without a vote by the upper chamber, but related bills would ultimately need approval by a two-thirds majority of the lower house to take effect. Speculation has mounted that a group of LDP lawmakers, led by Watanabe, could join forces with the opposition to block bills in parliament and put further pressure on Aso's government. But analysts doubt Watanabe would be able to attract a big enough following for now to rob the ruling coalition of its current two-thirds majority in the lower house. Watanabe denied talk on Tuesday that he would join the main opposition Democratic Party, although he said he would cooperate with like-minded lawmakers from both the Democrats and the LDP.
