 Rangpur, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad says he will gladly accept an offer to become deputy leader of parliament. "I'll be happy to be the deputy leader of the house, if offered," the former president told a group of party leaders and workers at his Palli Nibash home in Rangpur on Sunday evening. In an apparent post-election turnabout, Ershad expressed his reluctance to be president, saying: "Jatiya Party will be destroyed if I take over as president, I wouldn't be able to work for the party and the people." "The president has no work to do," he said. Explaining the reason for giving up his home constituency in Rangpur and his Kurigram seats for the more 'prestigious' Dhaka-17, he said there would have been no suitable candidate for the Dhaka-17 by-election. He thanked the people of Rangpur and Kurigram for voting JP and the grand alliance to power. The former president hoped JP candidates would also win the by-elections in the two seats. "I have bagged a record number of votes in Rangpur sadar constituency, leaving even Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia behind me," Ershad commented. In answer to a question, he said, "The image of the grand alliance government has brightened worldwide as clean and honest people have been inducted in the cabinet." Asking for people's support for JP candidates in the Jan 22 Upazila election, the party chief said, "Jatiya Party will stay forever in the hearts of people if the Upazila election is held, because the Upazila was my creation." Llocal Jatiya Party leaders and workers were present at the meeting among others. bdnews24.c
