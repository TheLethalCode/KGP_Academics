<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam says the role of MPs in local government will be made clear in a bill to be raised in parliament. Saying that the role of MPs was not stated clearly, he added that the bill would be raised in parliament following discussion. "The ministry has already contacted the local government commission in this regard," he told reporters. A local government ordinance was passed by the previous caretaker government to strengthen local level administration. Comparing the local government ordinance to AL's Upazila Parishad Act 1998, Ashraf said, "AL's 1998 law mentions one chairman but in the upcoming polls, one chairman and two vice chairmen will be elected." Dispelling any possibility of conflict between local and central governing bodies, Syed Ashraf said MPs and local government officials must work as a team. "We have to work together and there is no alternative to unity in bringing back a healthy political environment." Earlier in the day, US ambassador James F Moriarty, UNDP resident representative Renata Lok Dessallien and Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty met the minister separately. Ashraf said talks with the envoys touched on government structures, development projects under different ministries and future plans. Moriarty said, "We talked about strengthening the local government system and the US government has already provided assistance in this sector." The envoy also promised the assistance would continue. bdnew
