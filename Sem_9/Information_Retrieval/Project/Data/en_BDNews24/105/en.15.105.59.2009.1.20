 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)On Monday, the BBC broadcast an interview of Martin Luther King Jr, taped the day before he was killed on April 4 in 1968. Unseen by many Americans until Monday evening, the civil rights leader said in the interview "a day would come perhaps in the next 25 years when Americans would elect a Negro president". The prophecy may have missed the mark by just 15 years, but he was proven right when Barack Obama was elected US president on Nov 4 last year, 40 years after Dr King's assassination. As Americans celebrated Martin Luther King Day on Monday, a national holiday, just a day before the official swearing-in of the first African-American, Dr. King's remarks resonated across the nation bearing special significance. No wonder this historic event has generated unprecedented excitement among a vast majority of Americans prompting many of them to come to Washington to witness history unfolding before their eyes. The inaugural crowd on Tuesday could reach two million people, one of the largest gatherings in Washington's history. Millions more will be watching across the U.S. and around the world, with outdoor video screens planned for public squares. Obama will take the oath of office on the giant stage in front of the Capitol Hill Building with his hand on the Bible that once belonged to the last president to hail from Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. The 44th president will stand opposite the Lincoln Memorial, two miles away, where 45 years ago, Dr King called upon the nation to judge people by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. Obama spent Monday celebrating Dr. King's birthday as a day of service, while street vendors sold memorabilia juxtaposing the images of the two black leaders. The inauguration caps a weekend of events and pageantry, and officials predict as many as one million people will seek a spot on the National Mall. It will join Washington's biggest events, ranking with Mr. King's 1963 March on Washington, Lyndon Johnson's 1965 inauguration, and protests against the Vietnam war in the late 1960s. Jumbotron screens have been placed along the grassy lawn. Attendees, many of whom arrived by bus from around the country, were advised to dress for temperatures forecast near freezing. The National Mall was already crowded Monday afternoon, with buses stuck in traffic and tourists taking photos. Visitors made their way through a maze of crowd-control barriers and past dozens of sellers hawking wrist bands, T-shirts and a Spider-Man comic featuring Obama on the cover. A city of just over half a million people managing a crowd of an estimated extra two million is becoming a logistical nightmare for the Washington police chief, Cathy Lanier, the first woman to lead the City Police force. "We're fully prepared and we're doing everything possible to make sure that things go smoothly during the day-long inauguration", she told reporters on Monday. A total of over 20,000 police and military personnel will be deployed to ensure security for the celebration. In addition, fighter jets, helicopters and Coast Guard vessels will patrol the air and waters. Obama will begin his inaugural day with coffee at the White House with the outgoing President Bush. The swearing-in will be followed by a luncheon at the Capitol and a parade featuring high school marching bands. The evening will conclude with 10 official inaugural balls and countless unofficial parties. The President and First Lady Michelle Obama are expected to attend all the official balls. Chief Justice John Roberts will administer the oath of office to Obama following the swearing in of his vice president, Joe Biden by Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. President George W Bush will be there, too, departing immediately after the ceremony on a Marine chopper en route to Texas, where he will begin the next chapter of his life as an ex-president. bd
