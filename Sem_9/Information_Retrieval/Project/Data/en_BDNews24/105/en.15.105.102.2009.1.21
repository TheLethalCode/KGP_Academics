<TITLE> Quantum of Solace, or Boredom? </TITLE>

 Towheed Feroze Dhaka Jan 21 (bdnews24.com) - The new Bond film roars, raves and then loses steam to fall flat on its face. The pre-title sequence was a thriller. Put roaring, loud, breathtaking, jaw dropping moves into a pot and then top it off with panache and you know what I am talking about. But then, pre-title scenes never make a whole movie and so, Quantum of Solace, or the solace of the film, ends right there and post-title, we are thrown into an alien world in which Bond does not fit. To be blunt - he is this running, jumping man who seems to lack any motivation. The filmakers say they are trying to give 007 a new look and we want to ask what that is  does someone want to make him look like Jason Bourne? Well, no harm in that but if Bond has to be more practical and dark then he has to come all the way into Jason Bourne territory and not just half way. That means losing the Aston Martin and giving up Bollinger. What? Well, think 'real spies' guys! You know, half baked ideas always have the habit of losing steam and the new Bond is just that  a train that starts off with gusto and speed but soon, becomes a pathetic putt putting scooter lacking direction. But it did open to a roaring success. Absolutely! And that was because Casino Royale worked well. Of course one can rationalise the absence of the trademark 'Bond feel' in Solace by arguing that Casino had no excess special effects either. But, Casino worked for two reasons  a surprise punch in the film where Bond falls in love and finds himself betrayed and, because, it came to the market with the warning that with Daniel Craig, 007 was beginning a new era that traces Bond's beginning. The combination worked. But, its hard to keep faith when Bond is not sure what he wants to be. Quantum of Solace has one of the best beginnings of a Bond film and possibly the worst plot ever with the most annoying ending. What happens in the end? Well, a large building is set on fire and explodes and we are left to watch the disintegration from start to finish. What a waste of reel! Now, let me think on the finer points of the movie. Umm, what about...the pre-title sequence! I mean am I sounding repetitive here? Please forgive me but what else is there to talk about? People go to watch 007 not because they want a peek into the real spy world but because they want to see a cool, chauvinistic charmer have some fun while savouring the best life can offer. Yes, we want to see Bond escape and swim out of a prison cell to walk into a five star luxury hotel in rags, but the oomph intact, we want him to rev that Aston Martin, push a button and bring out a bottle of Bollinger and caviar to unabashedly seduce his companion on the French Riviera and we really, really want his watch to do some tricks (like work as a magnet to unchain the zipper of a dress). After all, what is Bond but a mirror of the secret desire that all men harbour? Hey, you want some real hardcore spy stuff then watch John Le Carre films but Bond trying to be serious really becomes a comedy. Oh I remember! One good thing that the film offers  the step by step recipe for making that trademark Vodka Martini. Maybe you should follow that and try to make the stuff and drink it while you watch the movie. Or better still, see the sequence of the making of the drink and then put in an all time Bond favourite where 007 is 007 and not trying to be someone he is not. Is Ian Fleming crying up there? Well, I am sure he is, because his hero is no longer stirred and shaken to smoothness; he is plainly a cocktail of mismatched ideas. This movie you will forget in no time. As for me, I will use the term quantum of boredom to refe
