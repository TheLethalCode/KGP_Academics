<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 21 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka has demanded cancellation of the local government ordinance and all new laws relating to local government, issued during the caretaker government, calling them 'anti-people'. He also demanded the Local Government Commission formed under the ordinance be scrapped. "The local government ordinance is against the people and hampers the work of the local government administration," said the mayor. "All ordinances should be re-evaluated before they are passed in the next parliament and, if needed, the sections that go against the people's interests have to be scrapped," he added. The mayor in turn called for RAJUK, WASA and other city development authorities to be brought under the city corporations. He said city corporations must in turn be under the prime minister's office. "City planning and development should be in the hands of the PM." Calling for a rethink of the government's decision to change the post of municipal chairman to municipal mayor, he said, "This is an irrational move because the two posts cannot be similar." He also asked for more funds for development of Dhaka city, terming current allocations as "too low". bdnews24.com
