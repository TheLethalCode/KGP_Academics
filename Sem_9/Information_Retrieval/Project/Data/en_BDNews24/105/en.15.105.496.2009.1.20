 MUMBAI, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India opener Virender Sehwag has attributed his resurgence in form to the influence of coach Gary Kirsten after an "uncomfortable" spell under his predecessor Greg Chappell. The explosive batsman has staged a spectacular comeback over the past year after an extended poor run had cost him his place in the national team. "He (Kirsten) is the best coach I have ever seen," vice-captain Sehwag told PTI news agency on Monday. "His basic premise is: you all are international cricketers and you know how to succeed and how important it is to succeed. So I won't thrust myself on you," he said of the South African. "But whenever you need me, for practice, throwing balls, sharing ideas, worries, I am always there." Sehwag was picked for the Australia tour in December 2007 at the insistence of then captain Anil Kumble following injury to Gautam Gambhir even though he was not named in the initial list of probables due to poor form. In 2008, Sehwag racked up 1,462 runs in 14 tests at an average of 56.23, smashing test cricket's quickest triple century against South Africa and a double hundred of rare quality against Sri Lanka spinner Ajantha Mendis. Sehwag said he had felt uneasy under previous India coach Chappell, a former Australia test captain. "I wasn't comfortable with him," Sehwag said. "He had his view on my front-foot play, my footwork." Former test opener Kirsten took over in February last year after a period of turmoil in Indian cricket which followed a shock first round World Cup exit in 2007 and the subsequent resignation of Chappell, ending his eventful two-year term. India's dominance in test cricket has coincided with Sehwag's excellent form as they beat Australia and England in home series in recent months. India travel to Sri Lanka later this month for five one-day internationals and one Twenty20 international
