 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)The government is considering introduction of rationing system for the poor to help them buy essentials at a "fair" price, the food minister said Tuesday. "The government is studying the option. Economists and professionals have been assigned to come up with recommendations," food minister Abdur Razzak told reporters after a meeting with the UNDP country representative. Razzak said some 54,000 families were currently being given assistance through VGD (vulnerable group development) cards. The government would soon increase the number to 81,000, the minister said. On why the prices of other essentials did not come down even after cut in the prices of flour and sugar, the minister said he would try to find out from the business community and take required steps. "It will take two or three more seasons to get over food crisis in Bangladesh," he said. "But the government will continue with its efforts to deal with the crisis through imports from various sources." On his meeting with the UNDP official, the minister said: "I have requested the UNDP representative to increase food assistance as they reduced such aid to various projects of the ministry in the last six months." "She assured me she would consult other donors and take steps," he said. Razzak said: "The allocation for the MPs in development project provided by the food ministry will not be allowed this time." "According to the present rule the allocation will go to the district levels. The upazila and Union Parishad chairmen will do the work of development project. The MPs will not have any chance to interfere there," the minister added.
