<TEXT>
 Savar, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com) Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain has warned of zero tolerance for political pressure in the Jan 22 Upazila polls. "No political interference in the elections will be tolerated under any circumstances," said Sakhawat at a meeting with local candidates on the election code of conduct in Savar Tuesday. The commissioner made the comment following allegations by a woman candidate of threats from a political leader to keep her away from the election. She also alleged she was being obstructed in her election campaign. She said the person threatening her was associated with a particular party who threatened her with expulsion from that party if she did not withdraw from election. The commissioner asked local police to arrest any such political leader, saying: "It appears from the situation that there should have been tough provision for political leaders interfering in the Upazila elections." "In future, the electoral code of conduct will be made tougher," he warned. Sakhawat said: "It is not the work of the Election Commission to see who will or will not be expelled from a party. But the commission will not let off anybody belonging to any political party in case of a threat to a candidate." He also requested candidates for the local-level elections to refrain from campaigning under any party affiliation or under the protection of any political leader. He asked party leaders to desist from backing candidates. "Upazila polls are very important for decentralisation of administration and strengthening democracy," he said. Cautioning candidates, Shakawat said: "If the election agent of any candidate goes outside the centre while on duty, he will not be allowed to re-enter the centre." "If agents go outside, defeated candidates take advantage of it and raise fictitious allegations of vote rigging, thus keeping the administration engaged," he observed. Sakhawat told journalists that the EC was determined to hold the Upazila polls as peacefully as the parliamentary election. Moderated by Savar UNO Rabbi Meah, others attending the meeting were district returning officer Syed Lokman Hakim, deputy election commissioner Biswas Lutfar Rahman, EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Murshed, district election officer Sheikh Anowar Hossain, Dhaka district police super Ansaruddin Pathan and other officials. bdnews24.c
