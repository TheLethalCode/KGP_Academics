 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former England captain Kevin Pietersen put the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in an "impossible situation" after his public criticism of coach Peter Moores, according to chairman Giles Clarke. Pietersen stepped down as captain last Wednesday following his newspaper comments that he could not work with Moores. He had been captain for less than six months. Moores was also sacked on a tumultuous day for English cricket. "The ECB was faced with an impossible situation and it raised issues that had very serious implications for the game," Moores told the Daily Telegraph on Wednesday. "It has been a very difficult time and when the issue arose it was obvious it was going to be horrendously problematic, but a lot of people have behaved with great dignity throughout, not least Kevin Pietersen and Peter Moores." Clarke said he was pleased that Pietersen had committed himself to work under new captain Andrew Strauss as the squad prepares to travel to West Indies for a tour that begins a year that includes a home Ashes series against Australia. "The matter has been dealt with decisively and our focus is now on the future," Clarke said. "Andrew Strauss is the captain and will be a fine leader, and it is very encouraging to see the players stressing their commitment to pull together under his leadership. "I am delighted that Kevin has reiterated his desire to play for England and actually I think he has handled the whole matter with great dignity. I am a great admirer of his as a player and I look forward to him scoring 10,000 Test match runs and goodness knows how many in one-day internationals.
