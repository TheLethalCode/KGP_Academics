<TEXT>
 Kurigram, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  Changing stance yet again, in an ongoing drama, Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said that he wants to be president "once more". "Sheikh Hasina has pledged that I will be president again, even if it's only for six months," said the former president at a JP workers rally in Kurigram Tuesday. Despite vociferous claims to the presidency in the lead up to general election, post-polls Ershad has claimed he had no wish to give up his party and its chairmanship to be president. Just two days before in Rangpur, Ershad expressed disinterest about the presidency saying that he would rather accept the position of deputy leader. "If I am made president then JP will disintegrate and I will not be able to work for the country," he had said. Ershad has also praised PM Sheikh Hasina's presidential pick, Zillur Rahman. In Kurigram on Tuesday, Ershad said: "If I wanted to be president now, I would have had to vacate all three of my seats and this would have prevented me from organising the party." "The power of the president at the moment is limited and so I suffer from indecision," he admitted. "The president has virtually no work." But, saying that the post of president was a respected one, HM Ershad still expressed his desire to serve one more term before death. On the single cabinet seat awarded to Jatiya Party by electoral ally Hasina, Ershad said, "What is important is that JP is now in government." "One of us has been made a minister and soon more will follow." Ershad promised fulfilment of pre-election pledges, saying that he wanted to repay the loyalty of the people of Kurigram. bdnews24.c
