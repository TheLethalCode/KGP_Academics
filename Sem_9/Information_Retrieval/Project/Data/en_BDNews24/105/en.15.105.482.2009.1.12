<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An unbeaten maiden half-century for all-rounder Angelo Mathews lifted Sri Lanka to 210-6, recovering from a middle-order collapse in their first match of the tri-series one-day international tournament on Monday. The former Under-19 captain, playing only his third ODI, toiled hard on a slow pitch to stay unbeaten at 52 off 96 balls after he came to the crease with Sri Lanka tottering at 97-5. Asked to bat first, Sri Lanka started positively when Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga put together a 51-run stand before Elton Chigumbura made the breakthrough. Jayasuriya, who returned to the side after being rested for the five-match series against Zimbabwe in November, chased a Chigumbura out-swinger to give Hamilton Masakadza a catch at slip for 22. Coming to bowl in his second spell, opener Edward Rainsford triggered a collapse, dismissing Kumar Sangakkara (4), Mahela Jayawardene (0) and Chamara Kapugedera (4) in three overs. Sri Lankan spinner Jayawardene, who edged a catch behind the stumps on the first ball he faced, has now suffered a duck in three consecutive ODI matches -- his worst slump since the World Cup 2003. After Tharanga was adjudged lbw off Zimbabwe captain Prosper Utseya for 43 runs, Mathews shared 69-run with Jehan Mubarak in the fifth wicket to stave off the collapse. Mubarak made 31 runs before he was caught by Sean Williams off left-arm spinner Raymond Price at mid-on. Thilina Thushara struck spinner Keith Dabengwa two sixes in consecutive deliveries to score an unbeaten 28 off 27 balls, helping Sri Lanka to get past 200-run mark. Zimbabwe beat hosts Bangladesh by 38 runs in the opening match on Saturday
