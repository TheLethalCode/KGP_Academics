 LONDON, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will be without defenders Patrice Evra and Rio Ferdinand for their rearranged Premier League match at home to Wigan Athletic on Wednesday. France left back Evra could be out for up to four weeks after injuring his foot during Sunday's 3-0 defeat of Chelsea. Central defender Ferdinand needs another week to recover from a back injury that kept him out of the last five matches. "Evra is out for three weeks minimum, maybe four weeks," manager Alex Ferguson told Sky Sports News on Tuesday. "He has turned the ligament in his foot and we need to get the swelling down which will take eight days or so." Evra has only just returned from a four-match suspension for his part in a fracas at Chelsea last season. Ferguson, whose side can go second with victory over Wigan, one of their two games in hand over their title rivals, said Ferdinand had seen a specialist and had been given a range of exercises to cure the problem. "There is no major problem and he should be back for the Tottenham FA Cup tie (on Jan. 24)," he said. Should United beat Wigan, and Bolton Wanderers at the weekend, they will leapfrog Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. Leaders Liverpool play Everton on Monday
