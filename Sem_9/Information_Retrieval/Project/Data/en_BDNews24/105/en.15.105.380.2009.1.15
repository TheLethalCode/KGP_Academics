<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 14 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan urged business and industry leaders to rein in profits within tolerable limits, while promising a pro-business climate. "This government led by Sheikh Hasina will be business-friendly. But you must be responsible," the minister told business leaders on Wednesday. "You have alreadymade fortunes, now do soemthing for the country," he urged. "You must reduce suffering of the people by reducing your own profits," Faruq told a meeting of business and industry groups, including the apex federation of chambers and the top garment industry association. Delegations of FBCCI led by president Anisul Huque, BGMEA led by Anwar ul Alam Chowdhury, BTMA (Bangladesh Textile Mills Association) headed by Abdul Hye and leaders of BRMA (Bangladesh Re-rolling Mills Association) met the commerce minister separately. They raised different problems with the minister and sought intervention of the government for their speedy solution. Faruq called on them to choose five priority issues and submit them to the ministry in a week. FBCCI called for reopening closed mills, setting up different EPZs, transferring related offices to the port city Chittagong, forming an export monitoring cell and official interventions to step up exports of other industrial products, including hides and skins, to the level of garment exports. BGMEA's demands included setting up garment making palli or villages, adequate security for factories, stopping anarchy in the name of labour movement, cash subsidy for export of garment products and the long-needed increase in quota. Urging the business and industry leaders to fix priorities, the commerce minister said the trade organisations as a whole would act as advisers to the commerce ministry. Asking them to list five issues in order of priority for the ministry within seven days, he promised: "All-out initiatives will be taken to realise them." "If you can list other priorities by this time, we will implement them phase-wise." FBCCI president Anisul Huq said, "Businessmen of course carry out trade for profits. But the FBCCI does not favour massive profits though making people suffer. Profits should be proper and rational." bdnew
