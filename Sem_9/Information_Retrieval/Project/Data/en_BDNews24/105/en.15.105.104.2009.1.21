 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com) Law enforcing agencies have been instructed to help ensure a transparent, fair and peaceful Upazila election, as they did for the Dec 29 national polls, and to root out militancy. "The Dec 29 election was acclaimed as free, fair and neutral both at home and abroad," home minister Sahara Khatun told reporters after an emergency meeting on law and order. "The Upazila polls too would be held in such a manner so that people can vote their choices to the local government bodies," the home minister said. "The government will have no influence on the law enforcers during the polls," she added. On recent campus troubles, state minister for home Tanzim Ahmed, who was also present, told reporters, "We'll have zero tolerance for campus violence."
