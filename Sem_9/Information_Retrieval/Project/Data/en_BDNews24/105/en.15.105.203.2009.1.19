<TITLE> AL in BKSAL mode: Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Monday said post-poll reprisals on their party candidates and supporters by the ruling Awami League show the party was still swayed by the "BKSAL spirit". "It is clear from clashes between the feuding Chhatra League factions, occupation of halls by them, attacks on houses of BNP members and people fleeing homes that the BKSAL spirit is still working in them," Delwar told reporters at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office. "The terrorist attacks by AL people on BNP workers after the parliamentary election cast doubts about the fairness of the upcoming Upazila polls," he added. Delwar called on the Election Commission to ensure a neutral and fear-free environment for the Upazila elections. "We now realise that the cooperation sought by the Awami League is mere rhetoric. In fact, they are engaged in a conspiracy to banish the opposition". "After December 29, some 16 BNP leaders and workers have lost their lives at the hands of Awami League activists," he said. "The ruling party men are intimidating our candidates to stay away from the Upazila elections. They have killed one Upazila chairman candidate at Kahalu in Bogra. Our candidates are afraid to campaign in different places." He again urged the EC and local authorities to create conditions so that candidates can campaign fearlessly and voters can caste their votes without harassment. Among others present at the press briefing were BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed. bdnews2
