 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has completed all preparations for the third Upazila polls, set to be held countrywide on Jan 22 after nearly two decades. "The government is extending full-fledged support for holding the election peacefully," said election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain on Tuesday. Sakhawat said he believes the local body polls will be acceptable to national and international observers as was the Dec 29 general election. Around 73 million voters will elect chairmen, vice chairmen and female vice chairmen of the key local government institution. Election materials reached all 481 Upazila, while campaigning ended Tuesday midnight. Restriction on traffic movement in election areas has since been in place. Voting will take place in 32,381 polling stations of 480 Upazila from 8am to 4pm on Thursday without any break, said Sakhawat. Election to one UpazilaDighinala of Khaghracchari in the hill tractspostponed on allegations of forced withdrawal of candidacy, will be held some time after January 22, he said. Earlier in the week, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said, "We've only one goal -- to ensure that the voters can vote freely without any fear." "We hope the Upazila elections will be as peaceful as the general election on Dec. 29," he said. The CEC is also expecting voter turnout to be near that of the general election, which saw a record 87 percent of ballots cast. Huda is set to deliver an address to the nation on Wednesday evening, said the CEC's personal secretary Mostafa Faurq. Despite some incidents of electoral code breach by candidates, the election commissioner said he was satisfied with security. The government has announced a public holiday for polling day in all Upazila. Like the general election, translucent ballot boxes and indelible ink will be used in the local body polls, said EC official Mihir Sarwar Morshed. According to the EC, there are 8,187 candidates contesting countrywide in the polls, for the three positions in each upazila. Of the total, 13 candidates have already been elected uncontested. The local body elections after such a long break come as a result of an initiative by Fakhruddin Ahmed's caretaker government, whose tenure ended on Jan. 6 with handover to Sheikh Hasina's elected government. The third Upazila polls are being held after some 18 years. Former president General Hussain Muhammad Ershad introduced the Upazila system. Elections to the local government bodies were first held in 1985 and then again in 1990. After the fall of Ershad, the then-BNP government repealed the Upazila Parishad Ordinance in 1991. bdnews24.c
