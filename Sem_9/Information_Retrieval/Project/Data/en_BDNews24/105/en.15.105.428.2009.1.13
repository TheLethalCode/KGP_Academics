 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)Emirates Airlines is adding three more flights to its Dhaka-Dubai route from Feb 1, taking the number of flights from 14 to 17 a week. "The decision comes to allow Bangladeshi travellers to join the month-long 13th Dubai Shopping Festival starting from Jan 15," said Emirates area manager Hanif Zakaria Tuesday. He, however, added the higher frequency of flights would continue even after the festival. "More frequency means better communication." The airline currently operates two flights a day. From February three flights will fly between Dhaka and Dubai Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays. The airline has been plying the Dhaka-Dubai route since 1986, a year after its launch in 1985. Emirates, one of the key sponsors of the Dubai Shopping Festival (DSF), is also offering holiday packages in a bid to promote the event. The all inclusive DSF packages for Emirates passengers includes airfare, accommodation, breakfast and personalised meet-and-assist at Dubai International Airport. "We are offering 10 kgs additional free baggage allowance on return flights to Dhaka in these holiday offers," added the Emirates area manager. Zakaria also said from now on Bangladeshi holidaymakers could book packages in local currency. The amount spent will be deducted from their yearly foreign currency entitlement. Previously, only international credit card holders could avail these packages, said the Emirates official. He also mentioned that the airline is switching to more Airbus A380 aircrafts. Due to its environment-friendly performance the A380s, which use 20 percent less fuel than Boeing 747s, will make a huge contribution to efforts to reduce carbon emissions, added the Emirates official. bdn
