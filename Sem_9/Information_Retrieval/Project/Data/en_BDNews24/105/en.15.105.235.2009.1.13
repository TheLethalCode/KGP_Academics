 Dhaka, Jan 13 (bdnews24.com)  BNP lawmakers-elect will take oath on Jan. 15 , says speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar. "I received a letter from BNP saying MPs-elect of the party wish to take their oath on at 4pm on Thursday," the speaker told bdnews24.com on Tuesday at his office. "Because of their request I have shifted the oath day from Wednesday to Thursday," said Sircar. He said he had forwarded the letter, signed by BNP vice-chairman and MP-elect MK Anwar, to secretary to the parliament secretariat for action. "We have got the instruction from the speaker for administration of oath on Thursday," Ashfaque Hamid, parliament secretary, told bdnews24.com. The outgoing speaker on Monday offered to administer oaths to 30 lawmakers of the BNP-led alliance on Wednesday, but the BNP opted to take oath on Thursday. The opposition MPs had earlier refused to be sworn in as scheduled on Jan. 4. The outgoing speaker said BNP's newly-elected MP from Noakhali-1 constituency Mahabub Uddin Khokan would also be sworn in along with others. Meanwhile, the secretary-general of Bangladesh Jatiya Party, a component in the four-party alliance, on Tuesday afternoon sent a letter asking the parliament secretary to administer oath to its lone MP-elect Andaliv Rahman. The speaker said he would also administer oath to the BJP lawmaker-elect. "Whoever comes on the day, I will administer oath to office," he said. He brushed aside the possibility of going beyond constitutional authorities if he had administered oath to BNP MPs-elect after the constitutionally mandated time. He said he could still administer oath as per the constitution. bdn
