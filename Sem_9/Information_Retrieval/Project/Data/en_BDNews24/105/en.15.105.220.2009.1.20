<TITLE> Smarting Tigers look to level series </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 20 (bdnews24.com)  Smarting from a shocking two-wicket defeat in the series opener, Bangladesh are desperately looking to level the three-ODI series by scooping the second match against Zimbabwe on Wednesday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Despite coming close to winning two successive matches, Bangladesh went down in the last moments against both Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, with no doubt that both defeats are still haunting all members of the team and their fans. To overcome the frustration and failure of their last two matches, the team management on Tuesday had a meeting that focused on performance of the top order batsmen and how to ulitise the third powerplay of the batting side. To solve the first, left-handed Mehrab Hossain has been given room to open the innings with Tamim Iqbal in place of Junaed Siddique, who had scored 0,0,1 and 3 in the last four matches. Junaed has been kept out of the 12-man squad. Before picking Mehrab, the team management has also considered Mehrab's leg-spin bowling that would strength the Bangladesh bowling attack. The team management also pointed out an instance where Australia's Mick Hussey kept cool to steer the Aussies to 198/5 against Bangladesh despite being reduced to 87 for three at one stage. Meanwhile, pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza and left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan will bowl in the third powerplay, the pivot of Bangladesh's defeat to Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in their last two games. Bangladesh vice captain Mashrafee spoke after the team meet on Tuesday during practice ahead of Wednesday's game. "Overall, all of us are disappointed after losing the match. But still two games are to go and we want to come back strongly on Wednesday and finally seal the series winning the remaining two games," Mashrafee told reporters in Mirpur. Asked where the confidence lay after being so demoralised, Mashrafee said, "You cannot carry the disappointment of the first match to the second game.I believe we can overcome and we should beat Zimbabwe easily." Mashrafee admitted the Bangladesh batsmen have been passing a bad patch. "It is tough to read the mentality of each and every player, but it seems they are very much positive and eager for runs. I will say they should make runs against Zimbabwe because the batsmen like Tamim (Iqbal) and Junaed (Siddique) had earlier scored against much better bowling attacks than Zimbabwe and I hope they will come with their best tomorrow." Another defeat to Zimbabwe means Bangladesh will lose the series to the visitors. The Zimbabweans looked more upbeat in the practice as they are look forward to seal the series on Wednesday. "We want to maintain our performance against Bangladesh in two previous successive matches as we were very much disciplined in those games," said Raymond Price, one of the main architects of Zimbabwe's two-wicket win over Bangladesh. Prince said that they were also conscious of Bangladesh strengths. "They can bounce back as they have the capacity. We know very well how they came back against Sri Lanka, but we need to be more patient against them," said Price, who grabbed four wickets and made 23 not out to steer Zimbabwe home in the first ODI. Bangladesh squad: Tamim Iqbal, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Mahmudullah, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Nazmul Hossain and Rubel Hossain. bd
