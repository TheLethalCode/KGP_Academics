 Noakhali, Jan 12 (bdnews24.com) - Eight candidates are vying for the ballots of 247,407 registered voters in the deferred parliamentary election for Noakhali-1, as polling began from 8am Monday. The Election Commission postponed the constituency's vote following the death of Ganatontree Party president and grand alliance candidate Nurul Islam in early December. Police, Bangladesh Rifles and Rapid Action Batallion are being deployed across the constituency as striking and mobile forces from early morning until vote counting is complete, to ensure a free, fair, neutral election. The constituency, which includes Chatkhil and Sonaimuri upazilas, holds 105 polling centres. The EC announced the constituency's new election date of Jan 12, just days ahead of the Dec 29 elections to 299 of the total 300 parliamentary seats. The seat has earlier gone to BNP four times and Awami League twice. bdnews2
