<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 11 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain has termed ongoing allegations against Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco of taking bribes as motivated and false "propaganda". "This case is a motivated one. They are deliberately spreading misleading allegations as propaganda to defame the Zia family," he said on Sunday. Delwar was speaking to reporters after visiting seriously injured BNP leader Azizul Islam at Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. Azizul was attacked, allegedly by Awami League supporters, in Netrokona. The allegations against the former prime minister's son Coco include pocketing some $200 million in bribes to award work orders to different companies. Delwar said: "These are false allegations. Why would he take bribes for getting somebody a work permit? There is no proof of any who paid such bribes." Regarding recent comments of home minister Sahara Khatun on post-election violence across the country, he said, "The way our home minister spoke was simply provoking. It was very much unacceptable." "The old character of Awami League has not changed," he added. bdnews
