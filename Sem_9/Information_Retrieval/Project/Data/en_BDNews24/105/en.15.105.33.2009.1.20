 Dhaka, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com) GrameenPhone on Monday announced major changes to its top management, restructuring key departments and effectively sacking its head of information and CSR. Rubaba Dowla, previously director of marketing, will have a new title of Chief Communications Officer, and be in charge of public relations, corporate social responsibility and market communications. As head of the newly-created Communications Division, she will continue to retain her role as "the face of the company", a senior official said of the changes at the largest mobile phone operator in Bangladesh. "There will be increased focus on corporate branding under Rubaba Dowla as the CCO," a company statement said. "The reasons for this change are to have a smaller and more efficient team, to move some of the managers to new positions to meet our new challenges and to have improved coordination in the organisation," CEO Oddvar Hesjedal explained in the statement. Titus Dan (43), a Romanian national and described as "a seasoned marketing professional in telecommunications and consumer goods", will join as the Chief Marketing Officer, the company said. "He comes from the position as Chief Communications Officer in Pannon, Hungary," the statement said. "Laszlo Barta continues as Sales Director and will in addition be Deputy CMO." For the first time, a Bangladesh national became the number two in the Telenor-controlled company. Arif Al Islam, currently Chief Financial Officer, was made deputy chief executive officer. "As Deputy CEO, Arif Al Islam will be the number two executive in GP," said the statement by the company, jointly owned by Norway's Telenor (62 percent) and Bangladesh's Grameen Telecom (32 percent). The new Management Team as announced by GP consists of the following: Oddvar Hesjedal, Chief Executive Officer, Arif Al Islam, Chief Finance Officer and Deputy CEO, Titus Dan, Chief Marketing Officer, Frode Stoldal, Chief Technology Officer, Rubaba Dowla, Chief Communications Officer, Raihan Shamsi, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, and Arnfinn Groven, Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO).
