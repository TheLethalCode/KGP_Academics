 TOKYO, Mon Jan 12, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso said on Monday he would not resign despite a series of public opinion polls showing support for him falling below 20 percent as he tries to revive the recession-hit economy. In a sign of Aso's fraying control, a former Japanese financial services minister said he would quit the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, after weeks of criticizing Aso's policies. "I won't abandon the leadership," Aso told Fuji Television.

Aso said now was not the time to call a snap election because priority was on measures to help the struggling economy. An election for parliament's powerful lower house must be held this year. Speculation has simmered that some LDP lawmakers could bolt the party and join the opposition in blocking budget-related bills in parliament over the coming months. Yoshimi Watanabe, a former financial services minister, told reporters he would give a letter to the LDP on Tuesday saying he would leave the party, but analysts doubt he will draw support from many fellow lawmakers.
