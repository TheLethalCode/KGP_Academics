 PARIS, Jan 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paris St Germain president Charles Villeneuve faced the possibility of losing his job on Monday over a row with the club's owners. The club's board of directors said in a statement it was resigning and calling for an extraordinary meeting, expected to rule on Villeneuve's fate in the next few days. The board members "can no longer serenely fulfil their duty alongside a president they can no longer trust," the statement read. The conflict was sparked by a letter sent last week by Villeneuve to the board members in which he said there were issues at the club and asked for more power. The club is owned by U.S. property company Colony Capital. French sports daily L'Equipe reported on Monday that Villeneuve had already been sacked. A final decision, however, was not expected until after the extraordinary meeting. Former journalist Villeneuve, 67, was named PSG president last May. The Paris club, who narrowly escaped relegation last season, are sixth in the Ligue 1 standings, six points behind leaders Olympique Lyon
