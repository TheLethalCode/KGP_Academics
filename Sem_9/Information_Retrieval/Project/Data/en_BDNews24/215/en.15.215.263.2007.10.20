<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi President Jalal Talabani was quoted on Saturday as saying he was angry over Syria's support for military action against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq. In remarks published on Saturday, he said: "I heard and saw the remarks by (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad ... I could not bear this dangerous way of going over the limit to all the lines." Assad backed neighbouring Turkey's tough stance over Kurdish rebels operating out of northern Iraq during his visit to Ankara three days ago. Syria also borders northern Iraq. "It would have been better for him (Assad) to say what the Americans and the Europeans have said that it is better to adopt a political solution despite his understanding of the Turkish stance," Talabani, a Kurd, told the pan-Arab daily Asharq al-Awsat. Washington and Baghdad have urged Ankara to avoid military action, which they fear could destabilise the region, and to seek diplomatic and other means. Turkey said on Saturday it expects the United States to act against the rebels of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) hiding in northern Iraq, in comments suggesting Ankara hopes to avoid a military operation in the region. Turkey's parliament this week authorised troops to cross the mountainous border into northern Iraq to track down the rebels.
