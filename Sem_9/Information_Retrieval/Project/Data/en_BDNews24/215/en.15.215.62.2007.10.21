 PARIS, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Springboks basked in World Cup glory on Sunday with coach Jake White hoping South Africa will build on his team's achievement. "This is a massive opportunity for the future," White told a news conference the day after South Africa beat 2003 champions England 15-6 in the final at the Stade de France to win the William Webb Ellis trophy for the second time. "The next challenge is to win back-to-back titles like England and Australia tried," he said at the team's Paris hotel. White named the talented younger players in the team like Francois Steyn, Bryan Habana, Danie Rossouw, JP Pietersen and the unfortunate Pierre Spies who had to remain at home due to illness as the future of the Springboks. Captain John Smit said, however, that the older players bound for European clubs like himself and lock Victor Matfield would also be available if their country wanted to pick them. South Africa, like the other big southern hemisphere rugby nations, do not normally call up their exiles to the national team. "We must keep the group together. Against Wales we can celebrate what's been achieved," Smith said referring to a test match in Cardiff on Nov. 24 followed by a game against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Dec. 1. FUTURE JOB White, whose contract ends on Dec. 31, would not be drawn on his own future either with South Africa or an opening abroad but he did not rule out staying on if asked, whereas prior to the tournament it had looked like his days as national coach were coming to a close. There has been talk of South Africa wanting the Springboks to adhere to quotas of black players in any given squad, while White has always prioritised merit in his selections. "I will take some time off and reflect. This squad also has a test against Wales and we're looking forward to facing the Barbarians," he said. "Winning the World Cup opens more doors for you so I've been very fortunate where seven weeks ago the future was uncertain. "I wanted to be the first coach to finish the job on my own terms so I'm happy that's been possible." White said winning the World Cup was the ultimate achievement in rugby and the fact that his side had not played all of the biggest teams in the competition in no way detracted from the victory. "No matter how you package it, the World Cup is hard to win. We didn't play New Zealand, Australia or France but that doesn't matter," he said. "They were on the other side of the draw and didn't win." South Africa had benefited from having both finalists in the Super 14, the champion Bulls and the Sharks, this year despite the more open game played in that southern hemisphere competition being different to the defence-oriented rugby at the World Cup. White, who picked a large part of his squad from those two sides, said: "It's not the same style but it is the lessons you learn in those tough competitions that help you win the World Cu
