 ANKARA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turks began voting on Sunday in a referendum that will decide whether future presidents are elected directly by the people instead of by parliament. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party has urged voters to back the changes, saying they will boost democracy and accountability in this Muslim but secular nation that aspires to join the European Union. President Abdullah Gul, whose position will not be affected by the outcome of the referendum, has also urged a 'yes' vote. "I consider it very important for our country and our democracy that people take part in this referendum and express their preferences on the constitutional changes," Gul said in a weekend statement urging Turks to cast their ballot. Gul was elected by parliament for a seven-year term in August. If the proposed changes are approved on Sunday, as expected, his successor will be elected by voters in 2014. The proposed changes also include reducing the president's term to five years, renewable for a further five, and cutting parliament's term to four years from five. Now the president can only serve one seven-year term. The main opposition parties have urged a 'no' vote, saying the proposal smacks of populism and will upset constitutional balances in Turkey. Despite Gul's appeal for a high turnout, Turkish newspapers say many voters complain of insufficient information about the issues they are being asked to vote on and may not take part. Some 42.6 million Turks are eligible to vote in Sunday's referendum, which is the fifth in Turkey's history. Voting ends at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT)
