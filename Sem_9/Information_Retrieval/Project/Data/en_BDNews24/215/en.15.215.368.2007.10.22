<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 22 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said that the separation of the judiciary from the executive would be concluded by the deadline. He was speaking to reporters after a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh Administrative Service Association to ease tensions created over the judiciary separation issue. The nearly one-and-a-half-hour meeting ended without any decision. The Association leaders meet the adviser again Tuesday and have expressed hope on finding a solution to the problem at the meeting. Mainul told the reporters that they had discussed in detail how the separation could be made effective and a congenial relation maintained between the two conflicting groups, but that no decision was reached. Association president Abu Md Moniruzzaman Khan refused comment on the matter. The Association's secretary general Kamal Uddin said: "All problems will have peaceful solutions. We have discussed ways to run the administration properly. The government will take necessary measures in this regard." Kamal Uddin said, "The date fixed for the separation of the judiciary will remain unchanged, but the government will look into the discrepancies." He said that the meeting had not taken any final decision. After the meeting, a leader of the Association said, "Proposals have been made for some amendments to four ordinances promulgated in connection with the separation. The government has shown a positive attitude in this regard. If the amendments are made, the separation of the judiciary can be done peacefully." bdnews
