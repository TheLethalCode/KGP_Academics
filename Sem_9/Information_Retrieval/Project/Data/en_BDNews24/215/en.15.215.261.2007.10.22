 KABUL, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain, in charge of efforts in Afghanistan to stamp out narcotics, has not only failed to reduce drug production but has been unable to stop an increase in production, Afghan newspapers said on Monday. Afghan President Hamid Karzai is on a four-day state visit to Britain. Afghanistan produced 93 percent of the world's opium in 2007 and the industry also funds a growing Taliban insurgency, which British and other Western troops are struggling to contain.

Official corruption and terrorism were closely linked to drugs, the newspaper said, adding that the failure to address the problems had pushed Afghanistan to the brink of a "political and social crisis".

It also called for the merger of the 50,000 Western troops in Afghanistan under one command. The US military leads one force fighting militants while a separate NATO-led force operates under a different mandate. Anis said foreign militaries and civilians worked more in the interests of their respective countries than for the long-term interests of the Afghan peop
