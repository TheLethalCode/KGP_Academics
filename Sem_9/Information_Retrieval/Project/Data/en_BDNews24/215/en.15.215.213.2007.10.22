 LONDON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid suffered their first loss of the season in the Primera Liga but still top the table, while Bayern Munich continued their unbeaten run in the Bundesliga. Arsenal and Olympique Lyon both won to sit on top of the Premier League and Ligue 1 respectively. SPAIN Real Madrid's unbeaten start to the season ended when they fell 2-1 away to form-team Espanyol in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Raul Tamudo and Albert Riera, who shone for Spain in their internationals last week, grabbed well-taken goals against a Real side lacking in ideas. But the champions hung on to first place with 19 points from eight games as Barcelona also crashed to their first defeat, losing 3-1 away to an impressive Villarreal. Manuel Pellegrini's side climbed to second with 18, where they were joined by third-placed Valencia who cruised to a 4-2 win away to Deportivo Coruna. Barcelona are fourth with 17, one ahead of fifth-placed Espanyol, and Atletico Madrid are sixth with 14 after they hammered Real Zaragoza 4-0 on Sunday. ENGLAND The top seven teams all won in the Premier League on Saturday, although second-placed Manchester United and fourth-placed Liverpool both ended up playing against nine men. Arsenal were 2-0 winners over Bolton Wanderers with Kolo Toure and Tomas Rosicky on target in the second half as Wanderers slumped to the bottom of the table. Arsenal are top with 25 points from nine games, two more than United and three more than Manchester City, both of whom have played a game more. United conceded their first goal in more than 10 hours at Aston Villa, but hit back to win 4-1 with Wayne Rooney twice on target for the Reds. Villa had Nigel Reo-Coker and goalkeeper Scott Carson sent off. In the Merseyside derby Liverpool also went behind against Everton with a comical own goal from Sami Hyppia. Dirk Kuyt levelled from the spot after Tony Hibbert was sent off for fouling Steven Gerrard and the Dutchman kept his cool to convert another penalty in stoppage time, this time after Phil Neville went off for deliberate handball. Brazilian sensation Elano scored again in a 1-0 defeat of Birmingham City to keep Manchester City's fans in dreamland. ITALY AC Milan are 10 points adrift of Serie A leaders Inter Milan and still seeking their first league win at the San Siro after Luca Saudati's second-half header gave Empoli an unexpected 1-0 victory. Juventus beat Genoa 1-0 in Turin to go second with 17 points, three behind Inter, who won 1-0 at Reggina on Saturday. Giampaolo Pazzini, Adrian Mutu and Christian Vieri scored as third-placed Fiorentina thumped Tuscan rivals Siena 3-0. Vincenzo Montella was on target and Claudio Bellucci hit a brace to help Sampdoria to victory over Parma by the same margin. AS Roma are fourth with 15 points after a thrilling 4-4 draw with Napoli on Saturday. Lazio, who visit Werder Bremen in the Champions League on Wednesday, beat basement club Livorno 1-0 away thanks to a Goran Pandev strike. GERMANY Franck Ribery scored one and set up the second as Bayern Munich came from behind to beat Bochum 2-1 and go six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga. Bayern fell behind to a Dennis Grote goal in the 11th minute before Ribery came to the rescue, scoring the equaliser with a neat back heel in the 35th minute and setting up Bastian Schweinsteiger for the winner with 12 minutes to go. Werder Bremen kept up the hunt with a 3-2 win at home to Hertha Berlin, while Hamburg SV destroyed champions VfB Stuttgart 4-1 to move up to third. With 10 games played Bayern, the only unbeaten side in the Bundesliga, lead with 26 points, followed by Werder and Hamburg on 20. Karlsruhe dropped from second to fourth on 19 points after a goalless draw at home to Arminia Bielefeld on Sunday. FRANCE Olympique Lyon moved two points clear at the top of the Ligue 1 with a 3-1 victory over troubled Monaco on Saturday. Lyon, who travel to German champions VfB Stuttgart in the Champions League on Tuesday, have 25 points from 11 matches. Second-placed Nancy, who have a game in hand, were held to a 1-1 draw by strugglers Sochaux on Sunday. Six-times champions Lyon seemed to cruise towards an easy win after a Juninho penalty kick and an Anthony Reveillere goal had given them a 2-0 lead after 18 minutes. But Monaco, who now have lost their last five league matches, cut the deficit four minutes before halftime through defender Sylvain Monsoreau. It was not enough, however, as Karim Benzema netted his 11th league goal this season with a clinical cross shot six minutes into the second half. Elsewhere, goals by Mickael Pagis, Sylvain Wiltord and Juan Esteban gave Stade Rennes a 2-0 win over Le Mans and third place in the table, four points adrift of Lyon. On Sunday, Olympique Marseille clinched their first home win of the season in Ligue 1 courtesy of a Boudewijn Zenden second-half goal as the Provence side beat RC Lens 1-0. NETHERLANDS Giovanni van Bronckhorst scored 12 minutes from time to give Feyenoord a 1-0 win over neighbours Excelsior Rotterdam that kept them top of the Dutch league. PSV Eindhoven are a point behind in second after beating visitors VVV Venlo 3-1. Ajaz Amsterdam are third following their 0-0 draw with NEC Nijmegen
