 COLOMBO, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed at least 17 Tamil Tiger rebels in clashes on Saturday, the military said, with the north of the island becoming the focus of a new chapter in a two decade civil war. Troops fought two separate artillery battles with the rebels along a "border" that separates rebel from government territory in the northwestern district of Mannar and neighbouring northern district of Vavuniya. In Mannar, troops fired artillery killing eight Tamil rebels "and many were wounded," said a spokesman at the Media Centre for National Security, declining to be named. He said in Vavuniya, the rebels "fired artillery at us and we retaliated with the same. We confirmed another eight Tigers were killed. Four soldiers were wounded." A rebel was killed in another incident in the far northern Jaffna peninsula when a group of Tigers tried to infiltrate forward defence lines, he added. The Tigers were not available for comment and there was no independent confirmation. Military analysts say both sides tend to exaggerate enemy losses and play down their own. The north has become the focus of the fighting after troops drove the Tigers from bastions in the east of the island. The military said dozens of Tigers were killed in heavy clashes in the north earlier in the week.
