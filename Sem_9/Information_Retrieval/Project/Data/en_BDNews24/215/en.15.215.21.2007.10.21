 GAZA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least three Palestinians were killed and up to 35 wounded in the Gaza Strip on Saturday in clashes between ruling Hamas Islamists and other armed Palestinian groups, hospital officials said. Two Palestinians, one of them a 13-year-old boy, were killed in fighting in Gaza City between Hamas and a clan loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction. Hamas officials said the fighting erupted when clan members fired at a vehicle carrying Hamas fighters. The clan refused to hand over to Hamas up to five of their members who were involved in fighting on Wednesday in which three Palestinians were killed. Later on Saturday, Hamas forces clashed with members of the Islamic Jihad militant group in the southern Gaza Strip, according to witnesses and sources in the two groups. A woman caught in the crossfire was killed, medical workers said. Saturday's clashes were among the deadliest since Hamas took over the Gaza Strip after routing Abbas's forces in June
