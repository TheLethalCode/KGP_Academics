<TITLE> Dollar recovers from record low </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar rebounded from record lows against the euro on Friday, as investors awaited the outcome of a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in Washington. Traders said market participants were seeking a more neutral position before the release of the G7 statement late on Friday. They also cited speculation the group's communique could address the dollar's weakness and other currency imbalances. The yen, on the other hand, rose to three-week highs versus the dollar and euro, boosted by a sell-off in U.S. equities in a market that has become more risk-averse after Caterpillar Inc. slashed its profit estimate and warned the housing downturn was spreading to other parts of the economy. The Japanese currency typically gets a boost in times of increased risk aversion since its low interest rates have funded the purchase of higher-yielding assets in carry trades. "We're seeing risk being taken off the table ahead of the risk event which is the G7, so carry trades are being taken off and we're seeing the dollar/yen being hit, although it's been a broad dollar sell-off," said Joe Francomano, vice president of foreign exchange at Erste Bank in New York. By early afternoon trading in New York, the euro reversed gains to trade 0.2 percent lower on the day at $1.4260, having hit a lifetime high of $1.4319 earlier, according to Reuters data. Traders said euro selling was triggered by the single currency's losses against the yen in the wake of the stock market's decline. The euro last traded 0.6 percent lower at 164.13 yen. The dollar index, a measure of its value against six major currencies, traded almost flat at 77.604 but earlier in Asia hit 77.406, its lowest since its inception more than 30 years ago after the Bretton Woods exchange rate agreement broke down. The yen rose to a three-week high of 114.85 per dollar on caution ahead of the G7 meeting and as U.S. stocks sold off. But it then pared some of it gains back to 115.08, still up about 0.3 percent on the day. The Canadian dollar surged to a 31-year high against the greenback at around C$0.9635 per U.S. dollar, after oil prices jumped to a record high above $90 per barrel and earlier data showing a larger-than-expected rise in Canadian core inflation in September. By midday, the U.S. dollar was down more than 1 percent at C$0.9638. Oil prices have since traded lower to $88.88 per barrel in midday trading, but the Canadian currency remained well bid. In contrast, sentiment on the U.S. dollar has been bearish in recent sessions amid a growing view a U.S. economic slowdown will force another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve this month. Weak U.S. data and poor results from several heavyweight U.S. banks, have fueled expectations of a growth-boosting but dollar-negative rate cut on October 31. The futures markets on Friday showed a 98 percent chance of a one-quarter percent easing at the October Federal Open Market Committee meeting, up from 72 percent overnight and 32 percent a week ago. Traders were also keeping an eye on statements from G7 officials but comments so far have yet to significantly move the market. Most analysts do not expect the G7 to change its message on currencies, and say the greenback should be free to continue its downward trend once the meeting is over. "There are unlikely to be any rescue remedies coming through from this weekend's G7 summit, leaving the dollar's fate hanging in the balance early next week," said Bear Stearns in a research note. "What the markets may find should be some continuing solace (through) rate-friendly comments from an assorted throng of central bankers who will no doubt be emphasizing the new spin on policy," it added.
