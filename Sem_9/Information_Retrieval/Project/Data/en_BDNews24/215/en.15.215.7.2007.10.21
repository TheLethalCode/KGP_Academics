<TITLE> Turks back reforms in referendum-partial results </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish voters strongly endorsed in a nationwide referendum on Sunday plans to have future presidents elected directly by the people instead of being chosen by parliament, partial results showed. With nearly half of the votes counted, 72 percent of voters backed the constitutional changes proposed by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party, while 28 percent voted no. The result will not affect the status of President Abdullah Gul, who was elected by parliament in August for a seven-year term. His successor will be elected by Turkish voters in 2014.
