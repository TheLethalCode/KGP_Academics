<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said Saturday that the interim government should sit with political parties for talks about political issues. He said his party was not interested to hold dialogue with the Election Commission about some "political issues". He also said political factors should be resolved "politically" not "legally". Ashraful made the comment at his Gulshan home when he was talking to reporters two days ahead of a crucial meeting of the party's central working committee. The party's senior members are scheduled to sit Monday to discuss its strategy for electoral reforms talks slated for Nov 4 with the Election Commission. He said there were some political issues that should be resolved through dialogue with the government. What are the issues then? Explaining his statement, Ashraful said the political issues include the neutrality of the administration, law and order, election-time environment, measures to make the elections free and fair and election observers. The leader hoped that party chief Sheikh Hasina would walk free from jail through a legal process. "I strongly believe that we'll fight the next polls under her leadership," he said. Replying to a query from BBC Radio (Bangla), Ashraful said he would not disclose now if they would sit with the Election Commission for the talks. He asked all to wait until the Oct 22-meeting to see what resolution comes out from the party forum. bdnew
