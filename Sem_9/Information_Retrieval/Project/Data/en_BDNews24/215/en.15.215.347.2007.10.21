 WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush on Sunday condemned as unacceptable attacks by Kurdish rebels that killed at least 17 Turkish soldiers and said they must stop. "President Bush strongly condemns the violent attacks in Hakkari province and extends his condolences to the families who lost loved ones and to all the people of Turkey," White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said in a statement. "These attacks are unacceptable and must stop now." The attack was one of the worst in more than a decade by rebels of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.
