<TITLE> International telecoms licensing conundrum </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor DHAKA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  The international telecoms liberalisation move is facing questions after legal, regulatory and procedural flaws have been detected in the licensing process. Consumers are unlikely to call overseas at cheaper rates. Increasing the exchequer's earnings by manifolds also remains uncertain. Regulatory, policy and legal experts have urged the authorities to redress the shortcomings. But the government seems unmoved. Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) has invited bids for international telecoms licences on October 7. It will auction licences to operate two interconnection exchanges (ICX) and three International Gateway (IGW) facilities on November 22. The fixed and mobile operators' outbound calls will first terminate in one of the six ICX. The calls will be processed in the IGW followed by getting routed to the overseas destinations via BTTB's submarine cable station. A similar path will be followed for the inbound overseas calls. State-owned Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) will subsequently lose its last frontier of monopoly. But the procedure of choosing new entrants in the business is facing legal challenges. No fixed or mobile telephony provider can compete in the race of IGW and ICX licences. Foreign investments and joint ventures are also strictly prohibited. Even non-resident Bangladeshis are not eligible to invest. London-based lawyer Anatul Fateh, an expert in Bangladesh issues, said the constitution does not distinguish between resident and non-resident citizens. "Therefore, if a person is a citizen, the fact that such person may live abroad and even hold another citizenship does not alter the rights and obligations of that person in the eyes of the laws of Bangladesh." He also criticised the decision to block foreign nationals from participating in the licensing process. "BTRC is acting unlawfully and contrary to the Bangladesh Telecommunications Act 2001 and the National Telecommunications Policy 1998." "For the sake of the rule of law, it is to be hoped that these serious shortcomings in and of BTRC will immediately be redressed," the expatriate Bangladeshi barrister remarked. The stalwarts in policy and regulatory affairs are also sceptic about success of the government's international telecoms liberalisation move. "For many years poor Bangladesh has been used by (the telecoms) analysts making international comparisons as a worst case scenario," said William Melody, visiting professor at Technical University of Denmark and London School of Economics. Despite the private sector's achievements, he said, Bangladesh struggles near the bottom of international telecoms development rankings. Melody regretted the government's lack of interest "in changing the status quo" and condemned the international licensing documents being "Barriers to Bid". The globally acclaimed professor of policy and regulatory affairs also questions BTTB's rationale of obtaining both the licences while it is prohibited for the private operators. "They demonstrate that Bangladesh has marched two steps backward along the telecom reforms curve while most other countries are moving forward at a rapid pace," Melody said. Fees of the licences have also become thorny issues. Each ICX operator pays Tk 12.50 crore ($1.8 million) and every IGW operator pays Tk 24 crore ($3.5 million) in various fees. Besides the bidder for ICX licence has to share at least 10 percent gross revenue while an IGW licence aspirant shares minimum 25 percent of gross revenue with BTRC. The bidder that offers to share highest revenue with BTRC wins the licence. Finnish telecoms policy consultant Arno Wirzenius objects to this formula. He has warned citing the "infamous" European regulatory model of auctioning the third generation or 3G mobile licenses. "Governments tried to cash in on 3G licences in a situation when Europe was the world leader in mobile communications. The outcome was that the licences were paid, but the services failed, and furthermore Europe lost its clear leadership in mobile. Some of the winners went almost bankrupt." Wirzenius said the IGW operators will not be able to sell their services to directly the public but to other operators at a price fixed by BTRC. Therefore, the public will "not notice any visible outcome of the licensing exercise. No price or quality competition will occur." He also predicted that the IGW operators will have nearly equal market share in terms of number of calls and that is also independent of performance. It will result in lack of price competition and lack of possibility to gain market share, he observed. As a result, the offered (IGW licence) arrangements may not be optimal for increased economic growth and the government's revenue, Wirzenius said. But BTRC has brushed aside the experts' analyses and suggestions. "These are all vague statements and sweeping remarks," the regulator's spokesperson Abdullah Ferdous told bdnews24.com in a recent interview. He also said the telecoms ministry is the "owner of international long distance telecom policy" and they have stipulated all conditions. "BTRC is merely implementing the ministry's guidelines while inviting bids." The telecoms ministry officials have refused to comment on this issue "at this point of time." >>Telecom IGW tenders in Bangladesh bdn
