 Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) Popular singer Sabina Yasmin, now in Singapore for cancer treatment, returns home this week if doctors do not ask her to stay further for health reasons, her daughter Badhon said Monday. Sabina's brother-in-law Mobarak Hossain Khan told bdnews24.com that the singer was well, and as far as he knew, leading a normal life. "She is keeping regular contacts with all of us and has also attended a couple of invitations in Singapore," he said. Badhon said: "Maa (Sabina) is done with six sessions of chemotherapy. We are not anxious anymore. Nowadays, she is regularly talking to us. Doctors are very hopeful about her." Sabina is currently at Singapore National General Hospital, where she went on July 11 for treatment. bdnews24.co
