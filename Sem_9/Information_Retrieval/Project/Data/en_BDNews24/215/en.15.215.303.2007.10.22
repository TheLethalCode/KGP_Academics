<TITLE> China blocks US-sought WTO panel on movies, music </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GENEVA, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Monday exercised its right to temporarily block a World Trade Organisation (WTO) investigation into Chinese rules affecting the sale of U.S. films, music, books, magazines and newspapers, diplomats said. In its complaint to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body, Washington argues that China unfairly limits who can import and distribute entertainment products, including movies for theatrical release. "It also appears that foreign individuals and enterprises ... are accorded treatment less favourable than that accorded to enterprises in China with respect to the right to trade," the U.S. complaint reads. China refused the initial request for a panel, in accordance with WTO rules, allowing more time for consultations between the countries. Upon a second request, likely to occur at the next dispute settlement body meeting on Nov. 19, the investigation would be launched automatically. Trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have increased dramatically over the past year. The United States is pursuing other WTO disputes against China over issues including car parts, tax subsidies, and copyright rules. China has also launched a case against the United States over U.S. anti-dumping measures affecting Chinese paper imports.
