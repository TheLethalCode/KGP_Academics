<TITLE> Misery piles upon misery for English sports fans </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English sports fans were reaching for the anti-depressants on Sunday after another gut-wrenching day in front of the television. Less than 24 hours after the rugby team's World Cup dream was slowly strangled by South Africa, they watched in disbelief as a Finnish spanner was thrown into the cogs of Lewis Hamilton's Formula One world title aspirations. All that with a large cloud perched above the national soccer team after a mystifying 2-1 defeat in Russia that means they are unlikely to be present at next year's European Championships in Austria and Switzerland. A nation that prides itself on sporting glory does not seem to be getting much of it these days. Thursday's newspapers slammed coach Steve McClaren's football team while the endless phone-in shows that now breed unstoppably on the airwaves were full of disgruntled followers of the national sport. Players paid millions who never produce when it matters was a harsh, but common thread of Mr and Mrs Angry. The rugby team, by contrast, got praised to the heavens. SPORTING MIRACLE After all, they were written off as a shambles earlier in the six-week marathon in France, having been obliterated 36-0 by the Springboks in the pool stages. The fact they then got their faces out of the dust to beat Australia and France and reach their second successive final was labelled a minor sporting miracle. Sunday's newspapers were full of sympathy. "Heartbreak" said most headlines, England's brave warriors finally meeting their match. There was even a highly contentious disallowed try to lean on in defeat as rugby fans wiped away the tears. Beer sales went through the roof at the weekend as armchair fans loaded up the fridge for a weekend of high drama and celebration. All that was left on Sunday evening was a mild hangover and the background hiss of a nation's hopes deflating once again. Even the fresh-faced Hamilton could not save us. After ditching his car in Chinese gravel two weeks ago he still held all the aces going into the final race in Sao Paulo. After all, he just needed to win or come second to guarantee the title, although anything in the top five would probably have been enough. MISERABLE FACES Instead, he was overtaken by two rivals at the start, then suffered some kind of computer glitch only F1 enthusiasts can explain and ended up seventh, handing the title to race winner Kimi Raikkonen. They say there is nothing like sporting success to put the spring in the step of the real grafters in the offices and factories around the towns and cities. By that reckoning miserable faces should be pretty easy to spot on Monday and it will have nothing to do with rush hour traffic and train cancellations. Still, at least the autumn is dazzlingly sunny, and there's always next year..
