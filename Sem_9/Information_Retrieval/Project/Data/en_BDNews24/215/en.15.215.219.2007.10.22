<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  A special taskforce Monday started probing irregularities at Dhaka City Corporation. The taskforce would run its operations through a special cell set up in the DCC, it was agreed at a meeting Monday at the DCC. Mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka and a six-member delegation of the taskforce led by Lt Col Sultanuzzaman Md Salehuddin worked out the details. The taskforce sat with different department heads of the DCC after meeting the mayor. The mayor told reporters after the meeting: "The taskforce would help to smooth DCC's operations. They will look after our service rules and joint works with other organisations. They will also probe our previous works." Khoka said the taskforce would look for irregularities in the tender process, if any. Asked if the taskforce would open an office at the DCC, the mayor said, "Previously they came and investigated specific complaints. But after discussions it occurred to us that they have a lot of work to do and it's not possible for them to often come and go. They will work here and we will help them." He also said they had sent a letter to the chief adviser for reforms to the DCC. "That may be the reason the taskforce came here," he added. Salehuddin told reporters: "We are at a very elementary stage of the job. We will look for the problems in the DCC. We will work to make the DCC more effective and also look into the matter of reforms." bdnews24.c
