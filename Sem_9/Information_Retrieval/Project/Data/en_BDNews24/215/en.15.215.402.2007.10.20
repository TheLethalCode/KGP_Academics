 SANTIAGO, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police mugshots of the sons and daughters of late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet were leaked to the media and circulated on the Internet on Friday, prompting police to launch an investigation. The photographs were taken after police arrested Pinochet's two sons and three daughters on October 4 as part of an embezzlement investigation. The Pinochets were held in jail for two days before being freed but remain under investigation. They deny all the charges. Under Chilean law the pictures should not have been made public, but they were leaked to the media and published in Chile's leading newspaper El Mercurio on Friday. The black-and-white snaps show the middle-aged members of the Pinochet clan standing against a wall, their faces framed by the classic meter stick to show their height. All five are stony-faced and staring straight at the camera. Identification numbers are stamped on some of the photos. Hugo Ortiz, defense lawyer for Pinochet's oldest daughter Lucia, said the photographs showed the family in a bad light and described their release as "abusive". "These are not people who have been found guilty," he told reporters. The Pinochet offspring were arrested as part of a probe into allegations their father, who ruled Chile from 1973-1990, stole $27 million of public funds and hid it in foreign banks. Pinochet, the most notorious of the military leaders who dominated South America through much of the Cold War, died last December without ever being brought to trial to face either embezzlement or human rights charges
