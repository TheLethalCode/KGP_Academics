 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Saturday staked a claim to any dialogue with the Election Commission. "The Election Commission will certainly send me a letter in line with the law as I am the secretary general of the BNP," the BNP leader told reporters in his NAM flat on an upbeat note. "There is no division in the BNP. Just a few persons or leaders are speaking on different notes. It does not affect the BNP as a whole," he said. On the reports published in some newspapers quoting the chief election commissioner, Delwar said he was "hurt" by the confusion the media reports had created. "It created confusion in the public mind. It is sad that knowing the truth has become difficult. The commission will have to take the right decision so that people's confidence in the Election Commission is not dented." Delwar said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia took action against Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Ashraf Hossain by expelling them from the party as per the party constitution. Asked whether there was any possibility of conciliation or unity with the other faction of the party led by the expelled leader, Bhuiyan, he skirted a direct reply and said: "I don't believe that there is any division in the party." Reiterating his demand to open the Naya Paltan central office of the party, Delwar said: "We have the right to go to our office. But I don't agree with Mr Hannan's (ASM Hannan Shah) call for opening the office to others. He can say it well whether his statement was out of frustration or annoyance." BNP's standing committee member RA Gani said: "There is no division in the BNP. There is a split at the top. But it did not affect the organisation at grassroots level." BNP leaders and workers from Munshiganj and Naogaon had earlier met with Delwar. bdnew
