 BERLIN, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German train drivers decided on Sunday not to strike on Monday as a gesture to long-distance commuters, but vowed to walk off the job again soon if Deutsche Bahn did not improve its pay offer. Guenther Kinscher, deputy chairman of the GDL union, told N-TV television that the union would not halt local rail services as it did for nine hours on Thursday, the latest in a series of one-day stoppages to press its pay demands. "We have decided not to strike on Monday out of courtesy to the long-distance commuters who don't have a lobby behind them," Kinscher said. "It's especially for those from the eastern German states who have long commutes to their jobs in the west. "As far as further strikes are concerned, it's in the hands of Deutsche Bahn executives to prevent it," Kinscher added. "They've got the chance now to put forth a substantial offer." On Saturday another deputy GDL leader, Claus Weselsky, had said the train drivers were likely to begin a three-day strike on Monday to raise the stakes in their pay dispute. It was not immediately unclear why the union had pulled back from the threatened strikes. Union leaders have, however, rejected German media reports about a leadership struggle after GDL chairman Manfred Schell suddenly went off on a three-week leave for medical treatment last week shortly after announcing a deal was imminent. The union, which represents 34,000 train drivers, is seeking pay rises of up to 31 percent and an independent collective labour agreement. "Both demands are unsatisfiable," said Margret Suchkale, a Deutsche Bahn board member, in an interview to appear in Monday's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. "The demand for a pay rise of over 30 percent is completely over the top." Deutsche Bahn, loath to set the drivers apart from its other 195,000 railway workers, has offered a 10-percent pay rise, more than double the 4.5-percent rise rail workers accepted in July. Deutsche Bahn made the drivers a fifth pay offer last week, including a one-off payment of 2,000 euros ($2,800) and a rise in monthly pay of up to 10 percent. The GDL rejected the off
