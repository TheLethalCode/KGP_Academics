 PARIS, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks dropped sharply in early trade on Monday, tracking a global equities decline after poor US corporate results sparked worries over the outlook for the world's biggest economy. At 0748, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.7 percent at a four-week low of 1,537.74 points. Shares of mining and industrial companies were among the worst hit, with BHP Billiton down 3.2 percent, Anglo American down 4.1 percent, ABB down 3.1 percent and Alstom down 2.7 percent. "We think that this correction is not over yet. It really depends on how the next earnings reports will be perceived, but we regard this as a correction and not a real change of trend," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. On Friday, Caterpillar Inc's warning that weakness in the US housing sector was spreading to the broader economy sent US stocks tumbling by the most in more than two months, on the 20th anniversary of the 1987 market crash. Caterpillar, the world's top maker of earth-moving construction and mining equipment, said the US economy will be "near to, or even in, recession" next year. Several industries it serves already are in recession, it said. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index was down 1.3 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index down 1.5 percent and France's CAC 40 down 1.7 percent. Germany's Commerzbank fell 5 percent after its chief executive said the subprime crisis will hit its results in the third quarter. The bank's CEO told German daily Financial Times Deutschland the bank will lose more from investments related to subprime mortgages than the 80 million euros it had previously predicted. Electrolux sank 4.3 percent after the home appliances maker reported third-quarter core earnings that missed market forecasts and said its outlook for higher full-year earnings had grown more uncertain. Among the few stocks that rose, Pearson added 0.8 percent after the company said it traded strongly in the third quarter and upwardly revised sales growth guidance in professional education. British insurer Resolution climbed 2 percent on hopes of a 5 billion pound ($10.2 billion) bid from rival Standard Life, backed by Swiss Re. Suitors have been circling Resolution since it agreed to merge with rival Friends Provident in July. An industry source said on Sunday Standard Life and Swiss Re were working on a bid for Resolution worth around 730 pence a share. With no major macroeconomic indicators expected during the session, investors will turn their attention to a flurry of earnings from U.S. companies like Apple, Merck, Schering Plough , Texas Instruments and American Express as they seek more clues on the outlook for the U.S. econo
