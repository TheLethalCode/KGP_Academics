 Boston, October 22 (bdnews24.com) -- General Moeen U Ahmed Sunday depicted the government's success stories such as a free judiciary and reforms to the Election Commission and Bangladesh Public Service Commission. In a speech to Bangladeshi expatriates at Holbrook in Boston, the army chief referred to the efforts to make a voter list with pictures. Moeen said: "Many things may happen before the national elections in 2008." The general came up with a fable. "Once there was a king, who killed intelligent people of his kingdom. One day a man was held and he sought one year's time from the king, saying that he can train a horse to fly. "The king granted his appeal. His friends asked him why he said so. The man said, 'One year is a long time. Anything may happen. The king may die. I may die or even the horse may fly.'" bdnews24
