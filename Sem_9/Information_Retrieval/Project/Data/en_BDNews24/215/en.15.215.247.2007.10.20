<TITLE> Myanmar lifts curfew imposed after protests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military junta on Saturday lifted a curfew imposed in the country's main city Yangon last month after a crackdown on mass protests. The announcement was made by loudspeaker trucks driving through the streets of Yangon. It was not clear if a ban on assembly of more than five people had also been relaxed. The curfew was imposed on Sept. 25 at the height of the military suppression of peaceful protests, led by monks, against 45 years of army rule in the southeast Asian nation. It was not immediately known if a curfew in the central city of Mandalay, which also saw mass demonstrations against the junta, had been lifted as well. Authorities say 10 people were killed when the army crushed the huge protests, which began as small demonstrations against fuel price rises in August and escalated as Buddhist monks joined in. Western governments say the true death toll is probably far higher. Soldiers and police raided dozens of monasteries in Yangon and elsewhere, arresting nearly 3,000 people and monks and subjecting many to brutal interrogations. State media said this week 377 were still detained. The crackdown sparked international outrage and further Western economic sanctions against Myanmar, including new US measures announced by President George W. Bush on Friday. The military has run the country formerly known as Burma since 1962, refusing to hand over power after Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a 1990 election. United Nations special envoy Ibrahim Gambari is touring Asia to seek a common approach to persuading the generals to compromise with Suu Kyi, who has spent nearly 12 of the last 18 years in detention. Junta leader Than Shwe has agreed to meet Suu Kyi if she gives up key positions, but military government has shown no sign of deviating from its 7-step "roadmap to democracy" which critics deride as a sham to keep the generals in power
