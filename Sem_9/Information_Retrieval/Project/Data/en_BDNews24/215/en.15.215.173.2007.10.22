<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) is planning to defer the 11th South Asian (SA) Games by 10 months to December, instead of January 2009. "We are planning to host the SA Games in December instead of January 2009 as the country will pass a busy time next December and January," said BOA secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed Monday. The BOA has already placed a huge budget of Tk 89 crore with the government to host the SA Games, and the sports adviser to the caretaker government was worried over the huge budget for the mega extravaganza of South Asian countries. While addressing the Bangladesh contingent for the Special Olympic Games at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan last month, the sports adviser said that the government was finding it hard to manage the huge budget for the SA Games because of a financial crisis. Replying to a query, the BOA secretary general said that the SA Games might be deferred due to the crisis. "The deferment is yet to be finalised," said Ahmed, also secretary general of the SA Games working committee. "We will sit with the member countries in December this year in Dhaka and the final decision will be taken at the meeting where we will also finalise the disciplines for the meet," said Ahmed. The meeting among the member countries was scheduled for November 27, but Pakistan requested the BOA to defer the meeting following its commitment to the Islamic Solidarity Games in November, said the BOA secretary general.
