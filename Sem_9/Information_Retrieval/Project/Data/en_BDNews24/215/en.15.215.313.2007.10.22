 Sajjadur Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Business Correspondent Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  A lack of preparation by the government may cost Bangladesh heavily in terms of the World Trade Organisation's 'Aid for Trade' package, which assists developing nations cope with globalisation issues, commerce ministry officials said. WTO members will attend the first global aid for trade review meeting in Geneva on Nov 20-21. Their aim is to enable developing and least developed countries with funds to increase their integration into the world trade system. Other priorities include strategies on how developing nations can use trade more effectively to eradicate poverty. "We are not giving due importance to this issue. We have not developed a strategy to proceed effectively," a senior commerce ministry official, who asked not to be named, told bdnews24.com. The WTO held three regional meetings in Peru, the Philippines and Tanzania recently in preparation for the upcoming talks. According to commerce ministry officials, findings from the three preparatory meetings will be factored into the WTO's Aid for Trade Review meeting in Geneva. "We are not at all prepared. The finance and commerce adviser and the commerce secretary, who both attended the regional meeting in Manila in September, have not yet given the ministry any feedback," the official said. WTO and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development jointly sent a questionnaire to Bangladesh in July requesting them to assess their need for the aid for trade programme. Bangladesh is yet to answer those questions. "We are currently preparing answers to those questions," commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed, who attended the regional meeting, told bdnews24.com. Commerce ministry officials said Bangladesh needs to prepare a strategy to address specific challenges it faces in today's globalising market. "Aid is required to improve constraints in infrastructure and specifically ports to cope with the changes in global trade patterns," a commerce ministry official, who deals with the WTO, told bdnews24.com. The official pointed to the need for better training for farmers on pesticide use and disease control: "If one country fails to adhere to food safety norms, it may endanger the whole world." Funds are also needed to help poor nations meet retailers demand for documented proof that food, animal and plant imports and exports pose no health risk to consumers, added the official. The commerce secretary said: "We've already submitted some trade-related project proposals to the WTO." Least developed countries are already facing challenges from the developed world, which has proposed to reallocate existing funds for the Aid for Trade package. Some LDCs with the WTO's director general Pascal Lamy opposed the plan saying: "Funds should be raised separately." According to Tanzanian Vice President Ali Mohamed Shein, financial resources for Aid for Trade should be raised separately, rather than being reallocated from existing programmes and sectors such as education or health. Lamy said at the African regional meeting that the programme should be viewed as an additional approach rather than a substitute for existing initiatives. He added that trade-related aid should not divert resources or attention from poverty reduction programmes. In early October, the European Union agreed to give 2 billion euros, about $ 2.6 billion, under the "Aid for Trade" package. The funds will be made available annually from 2010. Half of the funds would come from the European Community's budget while the other half would come from the aid budgets of member states. At the WTO's ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December 2005, the EU, the US and Japan pledged financial support to developing countries to facilitate international trade agreements. bd
