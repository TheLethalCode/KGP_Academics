<TITLE> Olmert sees no big breakthrough at Mideast conference </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEN-GURION AIRPORT, Israel, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said on Sunday a US conference on Palestinian statehood would not yield a peace breakthrough as he sought to head off a revolt by rightist coalition partners. Two right-wing members of Olmert's coalition have threatened to quit the government if the conference tackles the most sensitive issues, including control of Jerusalem and its holy sites. Olmert told reporters ahead of a meeting with his cabinet that the conference, expected to be held in late November or early December "is not meant to be an event on its own or an event for an agreement or a historic breakthrough". Olmert said before leaving for a visit to France and Britain that the conference in Annapolis, Maryland, should be viewed as a chance for the international community to support statehood negotiations, expected to formally begin after the gathering. Olmert and Abbas have instructed their negotiating teams to draft a joint document for the conference that addresses so-called final status issues, including borders and the fate of Jerusalem and millions of Palestinian refugees. The joint document is meant to serve as the basis for formal statehood negotiations which Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said should be concluded by August. Strategic Affairs Minister Avigdor Lieberman, the leading far-right member of Olmert's coalition government, said he warned the Bush administration that Olmert's government could collapse if talks go too far. "If, at the Annapolis conference, they deal with the core issues ... there will not be a government and there will not be a coalition," Lieberman told Israel's Channel 2 television on Saturday night. Cabinet Minister Eli Yishai, who heads the ultra-Orthadox Shas party, said he likewise warned U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit last week that the conference "could shake-up the government". The collapse of Olmert's coalition could usher in new Israeli elections and possibly paralyse peace moves for the rest of US President George W. Bush's term. Separately, Olmert said news of a Palestinian plot against his life in August had caused him "great displeasure" but it would not derail his dialogue with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "We will not ignore this ... I have no intention of stopping the dialogue with the Palestinians," Olmert told reporters on his plane before leaving for France and Britain. bdnews24.com/lq/1855hrs Israel's internal security chief told the cabinet on Sunday of a plot to attack the Israeli leader's convoy en route to a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank town of Jericho, media reports said. Olmert arrives in Paris later on Sunday and will meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday. On Tuesday he will meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown in London before returning to Jerusalem. Iran's nuclear programme and the Annapolis conference on Palestinian statehood will top the agenda for the talks, which will be Olmert's first with both leaders since they took office. Sarkozy last week called on Israel and the Palestinians to "take a risk" by pushing for a peace deal. "This is the time to make peace," he told a news conference in Lisbon.

Metro services in Paris, which had been badly hit by the strike, were back to normal. Bus, tram and suburban rail services were also running full services, Paris transport authority RATP said. Rail operator SNCF said intercity services were running normally but there were still isolated disruptions in the Ile de France region around Paris and in Marseille in southern France. Transport workers brought rail services to a halt on Thursday in a nationwide strike over plans to change special pension rules that allow some workers to retire as early as 50. Some disruptions continued on Friday and Saturday. Labour Minister Xavier Bertrand, who is in charge of the dossier, meets unions for further talks next week. The dispute, which unions say could flare up again if no progress is made in the talks, has been the first big test of President Nicolas Sarkozy's drive to reform the economy. The government wants to put state employees paying into so-called "special regimes" on an equal footing with civil servants and private sector workers, increasing their contribution period from 37.5 years to 40 years. The special pension regimes were introduced after World War Two, mainly for workers in physically demanding jobs. They are running deficits that will cost the taxpayer an estimated five billion eu
