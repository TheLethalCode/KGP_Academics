 KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 82, left hospital on Sunday after heart surgery, ending about a month in intensive care. Mahathir, who still wields political influence in Malaysia after ruling for 22 years until 2003, underwent his second heart bypass operation last month but early prospects for a rapid recovery vanished after he contracted a chest infection. Doctors were forced to re-enter the elderly statesman's chest a second time three weeks ago to cut away infected tissue. Mahathir, smiling and looking relaxed in a maroon shirt and dark trousers, waved to dozens of well-wishers, photographers and reporters as he walked with his wife to their car. Some supporters surrounded him to make sure he was not jostled. "Dr Mahathir is expected to continue with physiotherapy exercises at home," said Malaysia's National Heart Institute, where he was treated. He would be required to return to the institute for regular check-ups, it said in a statement. Mahathir, who had his first heart bypass in 1989, was a thorn in the side of his successor's government until he recently began suffering renewed heart problems. After two heart attacks over 10 months, he elected to undergo a quadruple heart bypass. Mahathir has criticised Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi for reversing some of his old policies and projects, accusing his hand-chosen successor of selling out national sovereignty. Abdullah is expected to call an early election within the next few months, but Mahathir is unlikely to resume his attack anytime soon as he concentrates on his own physical recovery. "He will be having a break for quite some time," Mahathir's aide said
