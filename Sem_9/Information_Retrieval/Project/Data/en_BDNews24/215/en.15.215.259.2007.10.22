<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Abu Md Moniruzzaman, president of Bangladesh Administrative Service Association, has said Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Rokanuddowla violated the code of conduct for administrative officials by making remarks against the separation of the judiciary. "The statement by Rokanuddowla is solely of his own," Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com Monday by phone. "The association has no links with it," he said. Moniruzzaman said Sunday's seminar was organised to find ways to cooperate with the government about implementing the separation. "His (Rokanuddowla) speech created chaos at the seminar. I tried to stop him but he did not listen to me," he said. "It seems to me that he was not mentally sound then," Moniruzzaman said. He said the Bangladesh Administrative Service Association would cooperate with the government in "every possible manner" about the separation of the judiciary. Rokanuddowla made several controversial comments Sunday as he demanded a halt to the separation of the judiciary from the executive until 2021. At a seminar on "Independence of the judiciary for good governance", he urged executive officials to stop work from Nov 1 if the government did not clearly state that it would halt the separation process by that date. The magistrate's stance on the proposed judiciary separation was enthusiastically received by administrative officials at the seminar, organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Administration Management. Rokanuddowla said the postponement was necessary to remove the inequality created between executive magistrates and judicial magistrates. The judiciary is scheduled to be separated from the executive branch on November 1. bdnews24.co
