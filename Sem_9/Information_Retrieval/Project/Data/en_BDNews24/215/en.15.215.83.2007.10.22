 LAHORE, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan have included six European-based players in their squad for the 2010 World Cup qualifier against Asian champions Iraq in Lahore on Monday. "We are pretty confident about Monday's match because we have prepared hard and these six players have added to our strength," Pakistan head coach Akhtar Mohiuddin told Reuters on Sunday. The six foreign players in the home squad include Birmingham-born Zesh Rehman, who plays for English Championship side Queens Parks Rangers, Amjad Iqbal, Luke Karim, Adnan Ahmed, Fouzal Azeem and Asad Ahmed.
