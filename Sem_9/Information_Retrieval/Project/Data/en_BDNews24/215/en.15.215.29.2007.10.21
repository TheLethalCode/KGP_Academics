<TITLE> New telecoms services: BTRC's unlawful licensing process </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Anatul Fateh London, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) issued invitations for "eligible Bangladeshi entities", including companies registered under the Companies Act 1994, to apply for licences to supply International Gateway (IGW) and Interconnection Exchange (ICX) services. It appears that little or no attention was paid by BTRC to the requirements of the constitution, or of the general law. The requirements of the constitution prevail over all laws. Article 7 ("Supremacy of the Constitution"), under Part I ("The Republic"), states: "(1) All powers in the Republic belong to the people, and their exercise on behalf of the people shall be effected only under, and by the authority of, this Constitution. (2) This Constitution is, as the solemn expression of the will of the people, the supreme law of the Republic, and if any other law is inconsistent with this Constitution that other law shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be void." The Supreme Court of Bangladesh, in the famous case of Anwar Hossain Chowdhury vs. Bangladesh (1989), based itself on Article 7 to affirm that any provisions in any law (including martial law legislation) are invalid if such provisions are contrary to principles of the constitution. In the preamble to the Constitution can be found these words: "it shall be a fundamental aim of the State to realise a society in which the rule of law, equality and justice, political, economic and social, will be secured for all citizens". Article 19 ("Equality of opportunity"), under Part II ("Fundamental Principles of State Policy"), states in paragraph 1: "The State shall endeavour to ensure equality of opportunity to all citizens." The Constitution does not distinguish between resident and non-resident citizens: it applies to "all" citizens equally. Therefore, if a person is a citizen, the fact that such person may live abroad and even hold another citizenship does not alter the rights and obligations of that person in the eyes of the laws of Bangladesh. Non-resident Bangladeshis must have the same opportunities as resident Bangladeshis, because that is what the Constitution requires. The current government, at least, appears guided by this constitutional principle. It intends to ensure that non-resident Bangladeshis are able to participate in the electoral process. But it appears that BTRC seeks to override the requirements of the preamble and Article 19 of the Constitution. In its "Regulatory and Licensing Guidelines" for each of the service categories (IGW and ICX) BTRC states, in paragraph 4.20: "If the applicant is a company then all directors and shareholders of the applicant must be resident Bangladeshi citizens." According to BTRC, no non-resident Bangladeshi may participate in the provision of such services. This discrimination by BTRC not only is contrary to the Government's policy on non-resident Bangladeshis but is unlawful as contrary to the Constitution. Paragraph 4.20 of the Guidelines also contravenes the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act 2001, so far as it prohibits foreign nationals from participating in any Bangladeshi company applying for a licence. Article 31 ("Powers of Commission") of the Act, under sub-section 2(d), empowers BTRC "to approve, keeping in view the general policy of the Government, the various telecommunication services for which licences are necessary". Article 33(1) ("Powers of the Ministry") of the Act, under sub-section 1, assigns the determination of such general policy to the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MOPT): "The functions of the Ministry shall be to determine the general policy of the Government in the telecommunication sector and to encourage the development of that sector in Bangladesh." MOPT has issued such a general policy: the National Telecommunications Policy 1998. The second sentence of paragraph 3.7 of the Policy states in mandatory terms: "Efforts shall be geared up and co-ordinated to create an investment climate to help optimisation of resources from both national and international sources." Paragraph 3.7.2 of the Policy then goes on to say: "Foreign: Investment from sources outside the country may be arranged through Suppliers Credit, Joint Ventures, BLT/BOT/BOO/ BTO agreement etc" The consequent requirement that BTRC will encourage foreign investment in the telecommunication sector is plain in paragraph 3.10 ("Private Sector Investment") of the Policy: "By opening the telecommunications sector to competition and consolidating an independent regulatory board reporting directly to the Government, private sector investment, both domestic and foreign, is encouraged." The current government, in line with its predecessors, has strongly expressed its desire to encourage and support foreign investment in Bangladesh. Yet BTRC seeks to set aside a long-standing policy with whose implementation in the telecommunication sector it is charged, and seeks to prohibit foreign participation in any Bangladeshi company seeking a licence for the supply of IGW and ICX services. By prohibiting non-resident Bangladeshis from participating in the licence application process, BTRC is acting unlawfully and contrary to fundamental principles of state policy in the constitution of Bangladesh. By prohibiting foreign nationals from participating in the same process, BTRC is acting unlawfully and contrary to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Act 2001 and the National Telecommunications Policy 1998. For the sake of the rule of law, it is to be hoped that these serious shortcomings in and of BTRC will immediately be redressed.
