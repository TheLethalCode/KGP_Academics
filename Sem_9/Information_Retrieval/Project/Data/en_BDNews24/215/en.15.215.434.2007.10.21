 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Executive branch officials have voiced strong opposition to separation of the judiciary, with some executive magistrates threatening to go on strike if the government did not postpone the Nov 1 move. At a seminar on "Independence of the judiciary for good governance Sunday,Magistrate Rokan-ud-dowla, demanded a halt to the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch until 2021. He said the postponement was necessary to remove the inequality created between executive magistrates and judicial magistrates. The magistrate, popularly known for his part in the anti-adulteration drive, urged executive officials to stop work from Nov 1 if a clear statement from the government was not issued by that date. His suggestion was received with applause and cheers by members of the administrative cadre at the seminar organised by Bangladesh Institute of Administrative Management (BIAM) Foundation. Executive branch officials strongly criticised the proposed separation Sunday, demanding that executive magistrates' powers be made specific and demanded that differences between the judiciary and the executive branch be addressed. Speakers at the seminar agreed with the principle of judicial separation but said more and more careful planning was required to do it right. President of BIAM and rector of PATC Abu Md Moniruzzaman Khan was the chief guest at the seminar presided over by Dhaka divisional commissioner Ikram Ahmed. Project Director of the ministry of women and children affairs' Multi-Sectoral Programme Dr Abul Hossain presented the key-note paper. Director General of BIAM Dr Mohammad Sadique gave the welcome address. Former secretary and caretaker adviser Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury, former Dhaka deputy commissioner Abdul Mobarak, UBINIG managing director Farhad Mazhar, Bangladesh Biman managing director Dr MA Momen, magistrate Rokan-ud-dowla of anti-adulteration drive fame, and Faridpur assistant commissioner (Land) Abdullahel Baqui spoke at the seminar moderated by additional secretary Akmal Hossain Azad. Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury described the background to the separation of the judiciary as the result of a court verdict. Two political governments earlier took steps in this regard, he said. "If we accept all verdicts of the court as good why will we not accept it in the same way?" He said that the powers of the executive magistracy should not vanish just because the judiciary is separated from the executive. The powers of land administration, conducting mobile courts, examinations and summary trial should lie with executive magistrates, he said. "Executive magistrates' functions have to be clearly stipulated. The status and powers of judicial and executive magistrates have to be fixed. There must be equity between the two groups," he said. He recommended a separation of the secretariat of the chief justice for the sake of separating the judiciary. He said that since the judiciary will work to implement laws enacted by parliament, the chief justice's secretariat will have to be accountable to parliament. The responsibility to appoint judges could be given to parliamentary committees. Chief Guest Abu Md Moniruzzaman Khan welcomed the decision to separate the judiciary and said, "Good governance is a continuous process. None of us can tell what will happen after November 1. We will have to wait and see. We must remove misunderstandings." He said powers have to be fixed for all the branches of government. Abdul Mobarak said if the judiciary was separated after giving it so much power, it would automatically become ineffective because nobody would abide by its guidance. He said the judiciary was not becoming separate, but the magistracy was. Judges are appointed by the executive branch, the President appoints judges of the higher courts with the advice of the prime minister and the chief justice, he said. Dr MA Momen said administrative magistrates have been stripped of their powers. "The matters relating to lands are yet in the hands of the executive branch as their officials understand the matter well. So they have to be given power. Otherwise, an administrative complexity would arise." Farhad Mazhar said the independence of the judiciary did not stop at separation only, but was meant to ensure that the people receive justice. He called the proposed separation a fraud. Mazhar said it would not be right to implement the policy before an elected government comes to power. "This is a constitutional matter and the parliament should decide. The court has no role here and parliament must be allowed to do its job." bdnews24.co
