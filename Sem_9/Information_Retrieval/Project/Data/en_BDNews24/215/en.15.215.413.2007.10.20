<TITLE> EC to choose BNP faction after review of party constitution </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Saturday said his office would go through BNP's constitution to decide which faction of the party is to be invited to dialogue. "The faction that qualifies for talks as per the party constitution will be invited," Huda said. "We will take special care as the issue is sensitive. The Election Commission does not want to get caught in controversy," the CEC told reporters after inaugurating a voter listing project in Gazipur municipal area. Deputy commissioner Syed Mizanur Rahman presided over the function at Shahid Memorial High School in Gazipur town. Gazipur municipal chairman Mozammel Haque also spoke. The CEC exchanged views with the residents of the municipal area on the preparation of the voter list and national ID cards, next parliament election and reforms to the Election Commission. The CEC said, "Processions, graffiti, posters and banners will be banned during the next Jatiya Sangsad election. We are returning to the original process. The candidates have to go door to door to seek vote." On one candidate contesting from several seats, the CEC said the commission wanted a candidate to compete in one constituency but scope for vying from more seats was kept open as demanded by political parties. There is a negative side to multi-constituency participation, the CEC said. "Former president HM Ershad won a Rangpur seat in national elections. When he vacated the seat Shah Moazzem Hossain of Munshiganj contested in the by-poll and won. It was a farce and deprived local people," he said. Replying to a question, the CEC said the constituencies will be demarcated, keeping in mind the number of voters. Huda said voter registration work in Dhaka city would start in December and end on January 31. "The making of a voter list for Dhaka is a huge task due to a large number of floating voters," he said. The CEC said voter listing throughout the country would be complete by October. "In that case, power will be handed to people's representatives through elections before the deadline." Replying to a question on which faction of the BNP to be invited to dialogue with the EC, Huda said the decision would be taken towards the end of October or in the beginning of November. "I have not read through the BNP's party constitution yet. We will decide after going through the constitution." bdnews2
