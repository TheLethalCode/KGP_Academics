 LJUBLJANA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slovenians started voting on Sunday in a presidential election which might give the country its first right-of-centre head of state since it broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991. Polling stations for some 1.6 million eligible voters in the small but prosperous Alpine country opened at 0500 GMT and will close at 1700 GMT, with first results due three hours later. The winner will be inaugurated only days before Slovenia takes over the 6-month rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan 1. Although a largely ceremonial figure, he will feature prominently in international contacts during the presidency. Since 1991, Slovenia's presidents have been left-leaning. A victory for Lojze Peterle, a conservative former prime minister and the leading presidential candidate, would break the pattern. Slovenia's governments were also mostly centre-left until 1994, when Janez Jansa's conservative coalition won a parliamentary election in 2004, the year Slovenia joined the EU and NATO. Most parties in the coalition support Peterle. "Although the president does not have much power, this election is important because it will be an indicator of a political mood in the country ahead of the parliamentary poll (late) next year," Borut Hocevar, an editor at daily Zurnal 24, told Reuters. Peterle, 59, is likely to win the most support of the seven candidates -- between 26 and 41 percent -- but probably not enough to secure outright victory in the first round. SECOND ROUND VOTE "Opinion polls showed that it is practically impossible for Peterle to get more than 50 percent of the vote in the first round and I expect a very tight race in the second round," Hocevar said. In the second round, due on Nov. 11, Peterle would be likely to face off against Danilo Turk, a former diplomat, or Mitja Gaspari, a former central bank governor. Both are supported by left-of-centre parties. Peterle is a member of the conservative New Slovenia party and enjoys the support of three major parties in the ruling coalition. He was Slovenia's first prime minister, from 1990 to 1992, and is now a member of the European parliament. In an interview with Reuters this week, he said EU unity would be of crucial importance during Slovenia's presidency of the union, particularly on the question of the future status of the U.N.-run Serbian province of Kosovo. President Janez Drnovsek, a popular left-winger who has frequently been at odds with Jansa's government, is not running for a second five-year term.
