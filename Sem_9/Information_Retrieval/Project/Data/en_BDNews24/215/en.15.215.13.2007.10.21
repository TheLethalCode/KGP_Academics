<TITLE> Democracy at China Party meet means all vote "yes" </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's ruling Communist Party has gone to great pains to show it's open and willing to have more debate at this week's key Congress, but when it comes to voting, almost everyone still votes "yes". At the closing ceremony on Sunday, the media were allowed into the Great Hall of the People's main auditorium to watch voting on whether to pass President Hu Jintao's work report and enshrine his doctrines into the Party constitution. But the crucial vote -- though the result was never in doubt -- for the 200-strong Central Committee was done behind closed doors. Reporters, apart from those from approved state media, were locked out, kept waiting in a distant corridor for about 90 minutes. No details on the voting breakdown were provided by the official Xinhua news agency, which limited itself to saying who was left off the name list, like Vice President Zeng Qinghong. Pictures taken by Xinhua showed delegates casting light-red ballots into dark red boxes embossed with a gold hammer and sickle. One box also sat on the main stage, in front of Hu. Delegates interviewed by Reuters declined to elaborate, many saying they did "not remember clearly" the results. "The people who got elected did so with a high margin. This was in accordance with the wishes of the delegates," said Wu Gancheng, a police officer from the southern province of Hunan. That vote all done, the doors were flung open to the second floor gallery and the press flooded in, to be greated by the sight of Hu and his Cabinet sitting patiently on the distant podium at the front, flanked by large red flags. Three motions needed to be passed -- the approving of Hu's work report, which he made at the Congress opening last Monday, the Party discipline organisation's report, and a proposal to add Hu's "scientific concept of development" to the Party charter. Before voting, a man and a woman sitting in a box to the left of the main stage read out the motion in clear, standard Mandarin, gesticulating as they enunciated the turgid prose. Hu, who is also head of the Communist Party, then asked the more than 2,000 delegates who wanted to vote for the proposal to raise their hands. When he next asked for any "no" votes or abstentions, the sound of "none" echoed throughout the chamber, as officials shouted out from different sides of the hall. That was repeated three times, with exactly the same result: everyone voted "yes". Reporters laughed audibly when the first motion was passed unopposed. Former President Jiang Zemin, who has wielded considerable influence despite his retirement, appeared to hesitate slightly when the vote came on the Party constitution, raising his hand later than Hu or Premier Wen Jiabao. Hu has tried to promote a gentler, more environmentally friendly form of growth called "scientific development", rather than the get-rich-quick attitude of the Jiang era
