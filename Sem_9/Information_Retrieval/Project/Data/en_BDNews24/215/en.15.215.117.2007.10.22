<TITLE> Iran defiant on atomic plans before Rome talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TEHRAN, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will not abandon its right to nuclear technology despite the threat of more sanctions, Iran told France in a letter published on Monday, a day before talks to try to defuse the atomic row with the West. Western nations accuse Iran of seeking to build atomic bombs under cover of a civilian programme, which Tehran denies. The United States has not ruled out military action if diplomacy fails to end the standoff and President George W Bush has warned a nuclear-armed Iran could lead to World War Three, trying to shore up international opposition to Tehran. But the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, said in an interview published on Monday that Iran would need three to eight years to make a nuclear bomb, allowing time for diplomacy. Tuesday's meeting in Rome was scheduled to be between European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Ali Larijani, Iran's chief nuclear negotiator whose resignation was announced on Saturday. He will now attend with his replacement. The new chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, is a close ally of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Analysts say his appointment signals a shift to a more uncompromising line by Tehran. "Iran will not let its right to nuclear technology be suppressed ... Using tools like the Security Council, economic sanctions and other threats cannot deprive our nation and our government for a moment from its decision," Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki wrote to his French counterpart. Tehran's refusal to halt nuclear work that could, if Iran wanted, be used to make material for warheads has already prompted the UN Security Council to impose two sets of sanctions. World powers are considering a third round. France, which has toughened its rhetoric against Tehran since President Nicolas Sarkozy took office in May, is pushing for stronger European Union sanctions against Tehran, as well as pressing for further UN measures. "Taking actions and imposing unilateral sanctions against countries is illegal and an obvious violation of the UN charter ... Also it contradicts their commitment to resolving the issue through diplomacy," Mottaki wrote to French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner, Iran's ISNA news agency reported. "You cannot talk about dialogue while following the path of pressure and threats." In his interview published in Le Monde, IAEA head Mohamed ElBaradei said there was plenty of time for diplomacy, sanctions, dialogue and incentives to bear fruit. "I cannot judge their intentions, but supposing that Iran does intend to acquire a nuclear bomb, it would need between another three and eight years to succeed," ElBaradei told the French daily. "All the intelligence services agree on that." Major powers have agreed hold off on more penalties until at least November to see if Iran cooperates with the IAEA to explain its nuclear aims and to await a report from EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who is representing world powers. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney said on Sunday the world would not stand by and let Iran develop a nuclear weapon, and Washington has not ruled out an attack. Washington already has sanctions in place to punish firms doing business in Iran. Russia's second-largest oil firm, LUKOIL, said it had suspended work on an oilfield project in Iran being developed with Norway's Norsk Hydro because of US sanctions, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Iran insists it only seeks to master nuclear technology so that it can produce electricity and preserve more of its massive oil and gas reserves for export. Tehran has dismissed the impact of sanctions and has said in the past that, if foreign firms back out of energy projects, it will do the work itse
