 RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two people were killed during weekend clashes after landless peasants in Brazil occupied the farm of a multinational agrochemical company in the latest of several such protests over the past week. Police said on Monday a peasant leader and a guard were killed at the Swiss-owned Syngenta Seeds farm in the southern state of Parana after it was occupied by 200 landless militants on Sunday.

Borges said earlier police understood the guards hired by Syngenta had authorization to bear arms. The protesters were still occupying the farm on Monday, but the situation was calm and police was patrolling the area, Borges said. "We have no information on them being armed now, although the shootout indicates they had guns," he said. On Thursday, police dispersed a large group of landless peasants that had blocked the tracks of a major railroad operated by Brazilian mining giant CVRD and thrown stones at a passing train. The protest, which was part of a broader campaign by the radical leftist group "in defense of agrarian reform and against imperialism," disrupted iron ore shipments and briefly left CVRD's pellet plant in Maranhao without raw materials. On Tuesday, landless militants briefly invaded tree plantations of Votorantim and Stora Enso paper companies, destroying saplings as part of a protest against multinational agricultural c
