 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - The Asian Football Council (AFC) has dropped Bangladesh as the venue for the AFC Under-13, 14 Festival of Football. Bangladesh had hosted the youth meet for the last two years. "The AFC awarded Bangladesh host status for the AFC U-13, 14 meet permanently. But it recently decided to hold next year's meet in Iran," said Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) president SA Sultan Sunday. Asian football's apex body cancelled Bangladesh as a venue citing weather conditions. Sultan said Turkmenistan and Tajikistan players suffered from the heat during the last meet in April 2007 at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan. They also had difficulty with the food. Considering these two things, the AFC shifted the venue from Bangladesh, he added. The BFF boss said that the AFC did not respond to a BFF proposal to hold the meet in the winner season of December and January.
