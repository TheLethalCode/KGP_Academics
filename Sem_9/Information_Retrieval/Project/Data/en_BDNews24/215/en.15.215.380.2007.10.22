<TITLE> Turks back presidential reform in referendum </TITLE>

 ANKARA, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkish voters resoundingly backed plans in a referendum on Sunday to have future presidents elected by the people instead of by parliament. Preliminary results showed some 69 percent of voters approved the constitutional changes proposed by Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling centre-right AK Party, while 31 percent voted no, but turnout was low for Turkey at just two thirds. Erdogan hailed the result as a victory for democracy. "Today our people, through the verdict delivered at the ballot box, brought a solution to the problems that have caused crisis and tension in the past," he told a news conference. "This referendum can be characterised as a historic contribution to Turkey's struggle for stability." The vote will not affect the status of President Abdullah Gul, who was elected by parliament for a seven-year term in August. His successor will be elected by the people in 2014. The voters also endorsed plans to reduce the president's term to five years, renewable for a further five, and to cut parliament's term to four years from five. At present the president can serve only one seven-year term. Some political analysts said the AK Party had mishandled the referendum process, alienating opposition parties through a lack of consultation and thus undermining its stated aim of boosting democracy in Turkey, a European Union candidate nation. "The decision to hold a referendum could have been a positive step for Turkish democracy, but the way it was handled and the attitude of the parties have turned it into a practically meaningless exercise," said Wolfango Piccoli, a Turkey expert at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. About 67 percent of Turkey's 42.6 million eligible voters cast their ballots in a country where turnout is traditionally much higher in elections. The vote was overshadowed by fighting between Turkish troops and Kurdish rebels in southeast Turkey near the Iraqi border. At least 17 soldiers and 32 rebels have been killed in the clashes, which threaten to trigger a Turkish army incursion into northern Iraq where the rebels are hiding. POLITICAL ROW The AK Party opted to hold the referendum after clashing in May with Turkey's powerful secular elite, which includes judges and army generals, over its presidential candidate. The secularists had tried to block Gul's election, fearing the former Islamist would try to undermine Turkey's separation of state and religion if elected, a charge he strongly rejects. Gul was finally elected by lawmakers after Erdogan called a snap parliamentary poll in July which the AK Party resoundingly won. The government decided it would still press ahead with the referendum, even though Gul has now become head of state. The main opposition parties had urged a 'no' vote, saying the changes would upset constitutional balances in Turkey. They were also incensed by the government's last-minute decision to tweak the text of the questions on the ballot papers, even though voting had already started weeks earlier at airports and border gates. The amendment removed wording in the text that could have laid Gul's presidency open to future legal challenges. In Turkey, the government and parliament hold most power, but the president can veto laws once and appoints many key officials. He is also commander in chief of the armed forces. The AK Party is now drawing up a new constitution for Turkey which will entail transferring some of the president's powers to parliament and making the head of state a more symbolic figure.
