<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  Mashrafee Bin Mortaza guided Khulna to take an overall 187- run lead at stumps after folding Dhaka to 174 on the second day of the first four-dayer in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Saturday. Away at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium, two half centuries from opener Shahriar Nafees and Sajedul Islam took hosts Barisal to a commanding seat against Chittagong, who were still trailing by 56 runs in the second innings. Chittagong were 34 for no loss at stumps in the second innings after bowling Barisal out for 274 in the first innings. Chittagong were bundled out for 176 in the first innings. At Rajshahi Divisional Stadium, riding on two fifties from Khaled Mashud Pilot and Johirul Islam hosts Rajshahi were 229 for eight at stumps in reply to Sylhet's first innings total of 141. Dhaka vs Khulna With overnight 17 for two, Dhaka again lost five more wickets -- Anwar Hossain (8), Mohammad Sharif (7), Al Shahriar (0), Nadif Chowdhury (8) and Mohammad Ashraful (23) -- in the first session before going to have launch at 73 for seven. Pace spearhead Mashrafee picked up three wickets in a row in the first hour. However, Mohammad Rafique and Mahmudullah Riyad (28 not out) denied celebration to Khulna bowlers to put on 66 runs for the seventh wicket before being separated, and Razzak wrapped up Dhaka innings taking two remaining wickets at the end. Syed Rasel broke the stand trapping Rafique for lbw while the left-hander was trying to play Rasel across the line. Rafique's 58 runs helped Dhaka avoid the follow-on. Mashrafee claimed four scalps with 36 runs while Razzak and Rasel chipped in with three for 44 and two for 28. Khulna were 58 for two at the close of Day 2 with Habibul Bashar and Tushar Imran remaining unbeaten on 22 and 29. Barisal vs Chittagong Barisal captain Nafees converted his overnight score of 37 to 79 and lower order Sajedul blazed an unbeaten 64 off 80 as Barisal added 213 to finish at 274 all out after having resumed the day on 61 for two. Sajedul, who grabbed four wickets Friday, put on 54 runs for the ninth wicket with Talha Jubair (35) and added another 46 runs for the last wicket with Tariqul Islam (5). Tareq Aziz claimed five wickets for 80 while Ashiqur Rahman took two wickets for 2. Chittagong openers Tamim Iqbal and Gazi Salahuddin were batting on 17 and 16 when the bails were drawn for the second day. Rajshahi vs Sylhet Riding on a sound foundation laid by openers Jahirul Islam and Junaed Siddique, Rajshahi took a fine 88-run lead in the first innings against Sylhet, who were all out for a paltry 141 in the first innings. Jahirul and Junaed (35) put on 62 runs for the opening stand before Rajshahi faced a little hiccup in the middle to become 115 for four as Tapash Kumar Baisya dismissed Naeem Islam (20) and Anisur Rahman in the space of two deliveries. Former Bangladesh captain Pilot remained unbeaten on 50 to take his side beyond 200-mark before the umpires called the play off for the second day.
