<TITLE> China shapes new party lineup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China's Communists began winding up a five-yearly Congress on Sunday by announcing the Vice President was out of the new Party lineup, making way for President Hu Jintao to install potential successors. Vice President Zeng Qinghong, 68, was not on the newly elected Central Committee -- a council of some 200 full members -- Xinhua news agency reported. Zeng was a powerful Party organization boss long associated with Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Zeng's departure from the Committee along with two other leaders indicates Hu will be able to announce the promotion of potential successors soon after the Congress ends. Security chief Luo Gan, 72, and anti-corruption boss Wu Guanzheng, 69, were also off the list for the new Committee, Xinhua said. Vice Premier Wu Yi -- one of the few women in China's political elite and an experienced trade tsar -- was left off as well, indicating she will also soon leave government. But Jia Qinglin, 67, a long-time ally of Jiang, remains. The new Committee will in turn appoint a Politburo of a few dozen members and a Politburo Standing Committee, the innermost ring of power with possibly nine members, which will be revealed on Monday. The announcements were made on Xinhua's English-language service. Chinese-language state media was quiet on the subject, with government-controlled television news featuring a parachutist in Australia dressed as a large pig. The 2,200 carefully vetted delegates are set to approve writing Hu's trademark slogans into the Party charter, overshadowing those of his predecessor Jiang Zemin. But more than slogans, the membership of the elite bodies will tell how much power Hu wields and how he intends to use it, and who Hu's potential successors and rivals are. "Hu has the power; it's now up to him to decide how he wants to use it and what he wants to do," said Li Datong, a former editor at a Party newspaper who now publishes political analyses. "But Hu won't be adventurous. That's not in his nature, and the Party and country have already formed interest groups that any leader would find it very difficult to move." NEW CHALLENGES Hu promised a "harmonious society" cleansed of conflict and a "scientific outlook of development" aiming to divert more prosperity to backward villages and poor workers and to cleaning up fouled skies and waterways. Hu's predecessor, Jiang Zemin, took 13 years before he was able to push his trademark notions into the Party charter shortly before his retirement in 2002. That Hu has now been able to do the same with many years still in office shows his growing clout, said analysts. But much will hang on who leaves and who joins the Standing Committee so they could emerge as successors to Hu and his colleagues five years hence. Li Keqiang, Party boss of the northeastern industrial province of Liaoning, is a front-runner for promotion who worked under Hu in the Communist Youth League. But the new inner core is also likely to include Shanghai Party boss Xi Jinping and other, younger faces who do not necessarily have longstanding ties with Hu. The new Party lineup also did not include Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan, in charge of industry, or Defense Minister Cao Gangchuan, indicating they will soon give up all their key posts
