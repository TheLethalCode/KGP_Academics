 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed Saturday brushed aside the allegations of taking Tk 1 crore in loans from a bank and said it was all designed to "malign" him. The army chief, visiting the US, said: "It's not true that I borrowed Tk 1 crore from Trust Bank. It's not true either that I paid back Tk 60 lakh." The interview was aired on BBC Radio (Bangla). According to the allegations what BBC said was spread by the internet, Moeen borrowed about Tk 1 crore in loans from Trust Bank in 2005 and repaid more than Tk 60 lakh until the end of 2006. "It's totally false. I have borrowed only as much as permitted for an army officer in line with Trust Bank rules. I didn't borrow even one taka more than permitted." Moeen said he borrowed only Tk 35 lakh, which includes Tk 25 lakh in house loans. "It's all documented. Anyone can see that. Anybody can contact me. I am paying back the loans with the money I get from house rents," he told BBC by phone. "It (allegation) was all designed to malign me." A similar interview with Voice of America's Iqbal Bahar Chowdhury was aired on private TV station NTV. "Before coming to the US, I knew the question about it might arise. I have been living an honest life. I want to retire as an honest man," Moeen said in the interview. Asked if he would submit his wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission, which many high-profile people have already done, Moeen said: "I was the first to say we all should submit wealth statements. I still hold on to my position." Earlier, General Moeen had a meeting with Congressman and co-chair of Bangladesh caucus in US Congress Joseph Crowley. bdnews2
