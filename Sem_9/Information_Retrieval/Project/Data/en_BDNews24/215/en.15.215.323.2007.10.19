 NEW YORK, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks slumped on Friday amid fresh signs of spreading economic fallout from the US housing downturn, raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at month's end. The rate-cut expectations spurred the dollar to a new low against the euro and a basket of currencies, helping to drive another high in oil prices. US stocks headed toward their worst weekly performance since July on a day marking the 20th anniversary of "Black Monday." Disappointing earnings at Caterpillar Inc, the heavy equipment maker, and its warning that the US economy will remain weak into 2008 unnerved investors. "The Caterpillar miss is a negative. It dovetails with the weak dollar," said Jim Awad, chairman of WP Stewart Asset Management in New York. "Caterpillar is such a global company, it raises worries that the US economic slowdown is spreading." Treasury bond prices rose and pushed the 10-year yield down to a one-month low below 4.46 percent as investors bet strains in the credit markets and a slipping economy will force Fed policy-makers to cut rates when they meet on Oct. 30-31. Gold surged to a 28-year high of $770 per ounce on concerns of dollar weakness, near record-high oil prices and simmering geopolitical tensions. Platinum also hit new record highs. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 205.09 points, or 1.48 percent, at 13,683.87. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 20.11 points, or 1.31 percent, at 1,519.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 39.50 points, or 1.41 percent, at 2,759.81. Shares of Caterpillar and diversified manufacturer 3M Co were the top two drags on the Dow. Caterpillar warned that several US industries are in recession and that its machinery sales to nonresidential builders were declining as fast as sales to the residential building industry, which it said was in "severe recession." The US earnings picture also rattled European shares, which retreated after rising in the morning and fell to a two-week low. Worries over a credit market squeeze also hit banking shares. The FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.56 percent at 1,564.441 points. In Asia, the Nikkei average fell 1.7 percent to end at its lowest in three weeks. Treasury bonds extended their gains. "There's short-covering, convexity buying and flight to quality due to stock losses," said Andrew Brenner, market analyst at MF Global Inc in New York. The benchmark 10-year US Treasury note was up 22/32, with the yield at 4.4109 percent. The 2-year US Treasury note was up 5/32, with the yield at 3.8302 percent. The 30-year US Treasury bond was up 38/32, with the yield at 4.697 percent. The dollar sank to new lows against the euro and a basket of currencies, on the rate cut expectations and on speculation that a meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers in Washington could address the dollar's weakness and other currency imbalances. Most analysts, however, do not expect the G7 to change its message on currencies. "The combination of weak data this week and poor results by some of the US largest banks, helped push the dollar to a new record low in Asian trading," said Matthew Strauss, senior currency strategist with RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "Now, investors are squaring those positions ahead of the G7 statement later today," Strauss said. The euro hit a lifetime high of $1.4319 in the Asian session, according to Reuters data, but by late morning in New York it had reversed gains amd traded lower on the day at $1.4254. The dollar was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index down 0.02 percent at 77.575 from a previous session close of 77.590. Oil fell after surging to a record high above $90 a barrel earlier on Friday as tight fuel stocks ahead of winter and the softening U.S. dollar spurred investor buying. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 52 cents, or 0.58 percent, to $88.95 per barrel,, and spot gold prices rose $7.50, or 0.99 percent, to $762.10.
