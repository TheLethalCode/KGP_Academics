<TITLE> UK government meets business over tax changes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling had a "constructive" meeting with business leaders on Monday over his decision to reform capital gains tax, imposing a single rate, a government source said. But there was no suggestion the government was about to roll back on the policy measures it announced only two weeks ago. Darling has been under fire for his decision to bring the rate at which capital gains are taxed down to 18 percent from 40 percent but scrapping an allowance that reduces the rate levied on assets according to how long they are held by investors. Business lobby groups such as the Confederation of British Industry had argued that scrapping the relief will discourage entrepreneurship, while lowering the capital gains tax (CGT) rate to 18 percent will benefit only buy-to-let investors. The source said all present at the meeting agreed to go away and look at measures on how to boost entrepreneurship. "The Chancellor has agreed to work with business on measures to stimulate enterprise in the UK and seek ways to find a way forward on their issue of CGT," British Chambers of Commerce Director-General David Frost said after the meeting. Defending the government's plans, Darling told reporters in Washington at the weekend: "A single rate capital gains tax is right, it is a simplifying measure. "What I want to do is simplify the tax system and I think the proposals I've made and the rate, which is very internationally competitive, is the right thing to do." Darling said that he had been struck by the number of complaints about the tax changes and therefore had called a meeting with Britain's top business lobby groups which also included the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) and the Institute of Directors.
