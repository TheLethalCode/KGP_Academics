 GAZA, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One Palestinian was killed and at least 12 were wounded in the Gaza Strip on Sunday in clashes between ruling Hamas Islamists and the Islamic Jihad militant group, hospital officials said. An Islamic Jihad official identified the dead man as a member of his group. Hamas officials and residents said the clashes broke out after gunmen from Islamic Jihad tried to abduct a member of Hamas in the city of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. Hamas forces foiled the attempt and seized 15 members of Islamic Jihad, including its top commander in the town, they said. Sunday's clash came one day after three Palestinians died in fighting between Hamas forces and members of a clan loyal to President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah group, one of the deadliest since the Islamist group seized the Gaza Strip after routing Abbas's forces in June.
