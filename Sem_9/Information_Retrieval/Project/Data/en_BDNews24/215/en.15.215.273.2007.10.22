 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The first-ever Tokai Kabaddi Tournament begins Wednesday in a bid to promote the game among the street children, better known as Tokai, and amuse them. Bangladesh Kabaddi Federation (BKF) is organising the tournament at the Outer Stadium Kabaddi Court. Orient Bread is sponsoring the event funding Tk 75,000 out of an estimated budget of Tk 95,000. "The street children are being deprived of getting amusement through sports as there has been no governmental or other initiative for them. "Keeping that in mind, we have come forward," BKF general secretary Nazrul Islam said at a press conference at the National Sports Council Monday. Islam also said the tournament aims to keep the street children away from wrongdoing in daily life. The BKF secretary said the street children had been training for the tournament under the supervision of BKF coaches before the Eid ul-Fitr at Mirpur, Khilgaon and Paltan ground. Six teams, split in two groups, will take part in the league matches and the top two teams from each group will play the final. Islam also said they would bring a sports personality every day during the tournament to inspire the Tokai. The teams are Tokai Gulistan, Tokai Paltan, Tokai Stadium, Tokai Mirpur, Tokai Sayedabad Terminal and Tokai Khilgaon. b
