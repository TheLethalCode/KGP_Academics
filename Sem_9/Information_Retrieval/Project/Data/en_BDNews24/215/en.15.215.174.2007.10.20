 BRUSSELS, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nuclear talks between the European Union and Iran will go ahead in Rome on Tuesday despite the resignation of Tehran's top negotiator, an EU spokeswoman said on Saturday. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana will meet Iran's representative replacing Tehran's top negotiator, Ali Larijani, said Cristina Gallach, Solana's spokeswoman. "We have just spoken to the Iranians. Solana is keeping to his plan to travel to Rome on Tuesday and will meet whatever senior negotiator the Iranians send," she said.
