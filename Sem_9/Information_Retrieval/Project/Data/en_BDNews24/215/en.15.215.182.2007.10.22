<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority Monday said a new 50 megawatt power generation plant will be built at the Ishwardi EPZ. In a statement, BEPZA said the $45 million project will be jointly financed by Australia and Bangladesh and is to be operated by Monticore Technology Limited. The plant is expected to come on line in 15 months when it will provide an uninterrupted power supply to the Ishwardi EPZ and its adjacent areas, the statement said. BEPZA said the plant will meet all of Ishwardi EPZ's current and projected energy requirements. The deal also allows for excess power to be sold to the Power Development Board and the Rural Electrification Board, as well as any other private concern. Three industrial units out of 28, comprising 166 industrial plots, are in operation at the site. The statement said the project would help ease ongoing energy shortages in the EPZ and its surrounding areas. bd
