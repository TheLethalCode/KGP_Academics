<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The first-round four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea ninth National Cricket League between holders Dhaka and Khulna ended in an exciting draw on the final day at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. Star-studded Khulna, however, earned six points more than Dhaka, who secured five points (two points for draw after trailing in the first innings and three points for taking nine Khulna wickets in the first innings) from the match. Khulna were awarded four points for the first innings lead and four bonus points for bowling Dhaka out in the first innings. Besides, they earned another three points for scoring over 301 runs in their first innings. At one stage, the match was wide open for both sides, but they missed the opportunities before the umpires called an end to the final day's play with six overs left due to bad light. Chasing a target of 314, hosts Dhaka were 284 for eight in 114 overs. Dhaka needed 242 runs on the final day after having resumed the day on 72 for two with two overnight batsmen Javed Omar (29) and Mohammad Ashraful (3). Ashraful went on score to 85 before Mashrafee Bin Mortaza had the Dhaka skipper caught by Abdur Razzak in the fifth delivery of the 81st over after the new ball was taken. Ashraful, who survived twice on four and 11, stuck to the pitch for near four hours to hammer four fours and two sixes facing 152 balls. The right-hander put on 56 runs for the third wicket with Javed Omar (45), and another 76 for the fourth wicket with Mehrab Hossain Junior, who remained unbeaten on 62 off 184 balls. Mehrab, dropped on 31, hit two fours in 184 balls, having stayed on the wicket for over five hours. After the drinks break of the third session, Dhaka needed just 65 runs in remaining 24 overs with five wickets intact, but Mashrafee removed Nadif Chowdhury (10) in the very first delivery after the pause. Mashrafee's partner Syed Rasel trapped both Mohammad Rafique (1) and Mohammad Sharif (1) lbw in four overs to bring Khulna back in the match, leaving Dhaka at 254 for eight. But Mehrab and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel (8) denied the Khulna bowlers before the umpires called it a day. b
