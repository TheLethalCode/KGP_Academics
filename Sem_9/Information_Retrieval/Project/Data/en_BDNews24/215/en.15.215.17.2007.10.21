 LAGOS, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Nigerian court has nullified the election of Saidu Usman Dakingari as governor of the northwestern state of Kebbi in the second major judicial indictment of April's elections in two weeks. General elections in April were meant to mark a democratic watershed for Africa's most populous nation, but fraud and violence were so widespread that international observers said they were "not credible".

"The first respondent was illegally placed on the ballot paper," Justice Aodover Kakaan was quoted as saying by local media. He ordered a fresh election. Dakingari, who is married to one of Yar'Adua's daughters, said he would appeal the decision and would remain governor of the remote, agrarian state in the meantime. Another court in the central state of Kogi nullified the election of Ibrahim Idris as governor on Oct. 10 because the electoral body removed the name of a main opposition candidate from the ballot. The April polls were meant to mark the first transfer of power from one elected president to another, but vote rigging and violence were so widespread that international observers said they fell far below basic international standards. State governors have considerable power in Nigeria and control about half the nation's oil revenues. President Yar'Adua is also facing an opposition challenge to his victory. The opposition gave evidence to that tribunal last week including what it said were three different official election results. Yar'Adua has recognised that the elections were flawed, but said he believes he has the mandate of the Nigerian people. He has promised to let the tribunals do their work without interference and set up a panel to reform the process before the next vote in 20
