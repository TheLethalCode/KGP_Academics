 LONDON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British computer expert, accused by Washington of `the biggest military hack of all time', was given permission on Monday to take his fight against extradition to the United States to Britain's highest court. Gary McKinnon was arrested in 2002 after US prosecutors charged him with illegally accessing government computers -- including Pentagon, US army, navy and NASA systems -- causing $700,000 worth of damage.

Between February 2001 and March 2002, using his own computer in London, McKinnon gained unauthorised access to 97 computers belonging to and used by the US government. He is accused of causing the entire US Army's Military District of Washington network of more than 2,000 computers to be shut down for 24 hours. At the time of his indictment, Paul McNulty, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said: "Mr McKinnon is charged with the biggest military computer hack of all time."

If found guilty in the United States, McKinnon could face up to 70 years in jail and fines of up to $1.75 milli
