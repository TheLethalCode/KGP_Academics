<TITLE> New bill will widen access to US market: Iftekhar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh, as current leader of the least developed countries group, has expressed satisfaction with the introduction of a new bill before the US Congress that aims to provide trade preference for emerging economies in the US market. The legislation, if passed, will give duty-free access to the US market for imports of all products from least developed countries except Myanmar and Sudan. "Passage of the bill will open the US's doors to the Bangladeshi garment sector," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters in his office Monday. "This is certainly good news for us, but we have to strengthen our lobbying to ensure passage of the new bill," Chowdhury said. The bill, titled "New Partnership for Development Act (NPDA) 2007, was put before the house by Republican Congressman Jim McDermott Thursday and was co-sponsored by eight congressmen, from both the Democrat and Republican parties. In 2005, a similar bill was placed before the House which intended to allow duty-free access to products from 13 LDCs in the US market. However, the bill never came to fruition despite strong lobbying from many developing countries, particularly Bangladesh. According to foreign ministry officials, the 2005 bill was placed by the 109th Congress, which has now been replaced by the 110th Congress. This change requires the creation of a new bill. Chowdhury said: "We deserve preferential treatment. As an LDC, we are doing very well in terms of exports." "Bangladesh's performance needs to be recognised by the developed economies of the US and EU." "The passage of this legislation will help Bangladesh move away from aid-dependency to become a fully trade-dependent country. Our ambassador to the US is working hard to create a strong lobby." The American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition has already opposed the introduction of the bill, saying it would cost US manufacturers too heavily. "This bill represents a substantial threat both to US manufacturing, especially the domestic textile industry, and to our preference partners in Latin America and Africa," said AMTAC executive director Auggie Tantillo. Bangladesh and Cambodia are poised to take the most advantage from the proposed legislation. The two countries currently stand second and eighth respectively as the largest sources of US apparel imports by volume and the sixth and eighth largest sources by value among the LDCs. Earlier, Laotian vice foreign minister Phongsavath Boupha called on the foreign adviser in his office prior to his departure. They discussed bilateral issues, including the enhancement of trade between the two countries. bdnew
