 PARIS, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unions representing cabin crew at French air carrier Air France have called a five-day strike to press management to review salary and working conditions, trade union sources told Reuters. "There is a strike notice from Oct. 25 to Oct. 29 included. All unions are taking part in it, which is a first at Air France," a union source said. The sources said unions were trying to pressure management into renegotiating an agreement on salaries and working conditions that will expire at the end of 2007. "Talks are about salaries and working time. Air France has so far refused unions' demands," the first source said. "People are very motivated because some salaries have been frozen for 10 years, and working conditions have been affected to help the company recover. The company is now doing extremely well and we do not see the benefits of that," she added. A spokeswoman for Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenue, said a meeting between management and union representatives started on Monday, but she declined to say what they were discussing. It was not immediately clear what proportion of Air France's cabin crew staff would effectively go on strike, sources said. Disruption at Air France would follow a nationwide strike over pensions which crippled train, metro and bus transport in France last week.

A flight to Amsterdam was delayed for an hour because of the strike, according to a Reuters rep
