 BISHKEK, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kyrgyz voters went to the polls on Sunday in a constitutional referendum designed to bolster President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's power and ease tensions in the volatile Central Asian state. Home to a US and a Russian military air base, the Muslim nation has been unstable since 2005 when protests ousted veteran leader Askar Akayev and brought Bakiyev to power. The proposed changes boost Bakiyev's authority in picking key officials and give him leeway in dissolving parliament. At odds with the current assembly which was elected in a disputed poll under Akayev's rule, Bakiyev is expected to call an early parliamentary election if the referendum is passed. "People are the real power. After all the debate people will draw a line under it ... and express their point of view," Bakiyev said after casting his ballot in the capital Bishkek. Asked when a snap election might take place, he said: "You will hear about it soon. Everything will be as it should be." People in Kyrgyzstan, calm as 2.7 million registered voters went to cast their "yes" or "no" ballots, said they were ready to give Bakiyev a stronger hand for the sake of stability. "I am ready for any kind of development. I just hope it'll get better," said Burul, a 72-year-old Bishkek resident. The amendments also raise the number of deputies and change the election process from a single-constituency system to a proportional all-party list, which should help Bakiyev gain a power base in the chamber via his newly formed Ak Zhol party. From Kyrgyzstan's mountainous border with China to the densely populated south, people will vote until 8:00 p.m. (1400 GMT), but a turnout of below 50 percent will annul the poll. LIBERAL LEADER Elected in a 2005 vote judged free and fair by Western monitors, Bakiyev is regarded as a liberal among his more hard-line Central Asian neighbours. Kyrgyzstan has a relatively free press, strong opposition and an active civic society. But Bakiyev, who says he came to power in a "people's revolution", is criticised for failing to stop political infighting and not tackling urgent issues such as poverty. On Sunday, he pledged to shift priorities and focus more on fixing the country's fledging economy, burdened by a huge foreign debt. "We will work for the economy. We have to do this. People want a normal life," he said. Seeking to rally support ahead of the vote, Bakiyev opened a monument to commemorate the so-called Tulip Revolution and called it a symbol of his nation's "struggle against tyranny." But memories were fresh of the chaos in 2005 when a violent mob ransacked the presidential palace and forced Akayev, in power since Soviet times, to flee to Russia in what critics said was a coup rather than a peaceful revolt. And some were still sceptical about Bakiyev's promises. "No one cares about people in this country," said Svetlana, a 36-year-old teacher. "It's lawlessness that rules it.
