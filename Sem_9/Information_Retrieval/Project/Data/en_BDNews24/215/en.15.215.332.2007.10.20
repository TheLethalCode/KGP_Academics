 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Saturday announced a roadmap to holding its much-awaited election in the next 10 weeks. "A roadmap for holding the BFF election in the next 70 days was placed at its executive committee meeting Saturday and we must go ahead in line with it to hold the election," said BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu. The meeting also brought amendments to the constitution of district and divisional football associations (DFA) after the FIFA sought some observations on the draft constitution a few weeks ago. "In line with the FIFA observations, we have revised the DFA constitution and will send it to the FIFA as well as to the National Sports Council (NSC) Sunday," said Malu. Malu hoped that they would get FIFA approval in the next two weeks, and then would ask the district and divisional sports associations to take initiative to form DFA in line with the constitution. The meeting also postponed the national football championship, scheduled to start on November 2, until the sponsorship is managed. However, the women's national football championship will start in mid December, decided the meeting. Malu said that they had made a calendar of 20 events for 2008 that would be placed before different houses for sponsorship.
