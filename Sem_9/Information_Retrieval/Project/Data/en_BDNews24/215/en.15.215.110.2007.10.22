<TITLE> Good to see young China leaders, but who are they? </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING/SHENZHEN, China, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The world of Chinese power politics is far removed from migrant worker Xu Changhu's simple life. Living and working in a traditional Beijing alley, or "hutong", just a few blocks from where President Hu Jintao on Monday unveiled a new leadership line-up, Xu summed up the feeling of many Chinese towards those who govern in their name. "To be honest, I've been too busy over the last week to pay much attention to the Party Congress," he said in his small convenience store which doubles as his house, a television in the corner carrying crackly, live images of China's new leaders. "Still, it's good to see some younger people raised up, even if I don't really know who they are," added Xu, from the poor inland province of Henan, who came to Beijing a year ago to earn money for his wife and two children at home in the countryside. At least he knew what was happening. Round the corner in the same neighbourhood of western Beijing, most televisions in stores and restaurants were either turned off or tuned to soap operas. "Didn't the Congress end already?" said Lao Shi, lining up to buy a meat-filled bun, when told what was going on at the Great Hall of the People where Hu was introducing his team. "You know more than we do!" The reaction was much the same in China's southern boomtown of Shenzhen, bordering the former British colony of Hong Kong. "Wu Bangguo, Wen Jiabao, Jia Qinglin, Li Changchun," said Liu Wanxiang, repeating along with Hu as he read out the familiar names of the president's colleagues on television. But as Hu continued with the four new members -- Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, He Guoqiang and Zhou Yongkang -- Liu was lost. "These guys seem new," he said, sitting in a ramshackle shop at a little community of two-level makeshift dormitories for construction workers, almost all from the southwestern province of Sichuan. "Xi Jinping was the head of some province or something, I think. Li Keqiang, I'm not really clear about him. He Guoqiang ... I don't know," said Zhu Zhen, a Sichuanese migrant who popped his head into the shop window. Zhu seemed amused. Liu looked bored. Neither thought the new lineup would mean much to them. "We can't vote so what's the point of paying attention?" Liu asked. "It's all basically the same regardless of who's the leader. Anyway, the policies won't stray too far." And in the cosmopolitan business hub of Shanghai, renowned in China for its lack of interest in politics, people shopping at a fashionable mall generally stuck by their stereotype. The fact their Party boss Xi, sent to Shanghai only a few months ago after his predecessor was sacked for corruption, was elevated to the innermost ring of power, the Politburo Standing Committee, caused little excitement. "Xi, he won't be a force for change all by himself. If there's any change in Shanghai or improvement in corruption it'll be on a systematic level, not just because of one man," said a businessman, who would only give his English name, Kev
