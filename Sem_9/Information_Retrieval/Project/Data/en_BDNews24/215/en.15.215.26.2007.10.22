 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday said a political environment has to be created where people can live happily and where genuine politicians get elected. "Evil forces must be removed from politics." The boss of the Election Commission said: "We do not want to go back to the situation which prompted the promulgation of the state of emergency." The CEC said this during a dialogue with the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD-Rab) on electoral law reforms Monday. The EC began a series of dialogues with political parties on Sept 22. The CEC said: "After holding discussions with all the parties, a summary will be sent to the political parties. We have to work by coordinating the proposals." JSD (Rab) executive president Prof Md Shafique led the 12-member JSD delegation. Party general secretary Abdul Malek Ratan presented the written statement. The party proposed dividing the country into eight provinces, introducing an upazila-based powerful local government system, a bicameral parliament and two voters' lists based on region and professions. After the dialogue, Ratan told reporters that JSD (Rab) also demanded that the government bear campaigning costs for all candidates, and that party symbols should be temporary and should be allocated by lottery. He said the JSD (Rab) wanted war criminals and those proven to be corrupt disqualified from contesting elections. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain were present. bdnew
