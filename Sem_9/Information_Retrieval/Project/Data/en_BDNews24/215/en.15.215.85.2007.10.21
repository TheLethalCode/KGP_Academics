 KIEV, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Defense Secretary Robert Gates will consider shifting US troops from Kosovo to Afghanistan next year if NATO allies do not fulfil their commitments, US government officials said. Gates, in Ukraine on Sunday to ask eastern European countries for help in the war, had first considered laying the threat before NATO defence ministers this week at a meeting in the Netherlands, senior US officials said. But upon the advice of senior military officers, the Pentagon chief has extended the US commitment to Kosovo to summer 2008. If NATO allies have not sent more troops, trainers and equipment to Afghanistan by then, Washington will consider pulling its 1,600 troops out of NATO's Kosovo force KFOR. "The secretary had wrestled with the idea of moving our forces in Kosovo to Afghanistan but decided late this week to extend our KFOR presence until next summer," Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said. "But beyond that is very much up in the air. The secretary is disappointed in NATO's inability to live up to its commitments and if that doesn't change before then, he's prepared to go to the secretary of state and to the president to discuss yanking our troops out of Kosovo," Morrell said. Gates has grown increasingly frustrated by the failure of NATO allies to fulfil promises they made more than a year ago to provide troops and equipment to the war in Afghanistan. The secretary is particularly worried about a shortfall of more than 3,000 trainers for Afghan forces, but commanders also need more combat forces, helicopters and other equipment. By pinning the U.S. commitment in Kosovo to Europe's commitment in Afghanistan, Gates wants to signal that Europe will be left alone to deal with a still unsteady situation in its own backyard if it does not help the United States in Afghanistan, said officials familiar with the discussions. NATO took responsibility last year for operations throughout Afghanistan. The United States contributes the most troops in the coalition -- or about 15,000 of a NATO force totaling just under 40,000. Washington also added combat troops and a helicopter force last year after other allies did not respond to a call for help from commanders. Despite six years of war in Afghanistan, a fight overshadowed in the United States by Iraq, violence has soared in 2007. Taliban suicide bombings are up 50 percent from a year ago and military officers say the group is trying to import the deadly roadside bomb technology that has been used in Iraq. In Kiev, Gates will ask Ukraine and other members of the Southeast Europe Defence Ministerial to send troops to Afghanistan to help cover that shortfall in trainers, another U.S. defence official said. The 11-member group sent a 100-troop brigade, called Southeast Europe Brigade or SEEBRIG, to the war zone in 2006. "It's to have a discussion about SEEBRIG and how SEEBRIG can potentially help in Afghanistan again possibly by undertaking a training mission," the official said when asked about Gates's priorities in Kiev. Ukraine, which received $11.7 million in US military assistance this year, is considered a strong US partner in Iraq and the Pentagon thinks Kiev might send troops to Afghanistan as we
