 Dhaka, October 22 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Monday said that the separation of the judicial magistracy from the executive would be inaugurated by the Nov 1 deadline while bureaucrats opted for an amicable solution to the apparent row over the plan. Mainul, who took a hard line Sunday on any resistance against the plan, made the latest comment after a delegation of Bangladesh Administrative Services Association met him apparently to ease the tension. The row widened Sunday at a seminar on "Independence of the judiciary for good governance" where Dhaka Metropolitan magistrate Rokanuddowla sought a halt to the planned separation until 2021. He urged executive officials to stop work from Nov 1 if the government did not clearly state that it would halt the separation process by that date. Executive officials present at the seminar had welcomed his word amid cheers and claps although some association leaders had said it was the magistrate's personal stand. In a new development, an association leader charged Rokanuddowla with violations of services rules by making remarks for the halt of the separation. In a post-meeting media briefing Monday, the law adviser said that there would be no disruption to their plan. Mainul said they had discussed in detail how the separation could go ahead and a healthy relation could be maintained between the judiciary and the executive. It was not clear what results Monday's meeting yielded. The association leaders will meet the adviser Tuesday again and have hoped to find a solution to the problem at the meeting. Association secretary general Kamal Uddin said the deadline for the separation of the judiciary would remain unchanged, but the government would look into the discrepancies. "All problems will have peaceful solutions," he said. "We have discussed ways to run the administration properly." He would not specify the details. Association president Abu Md Moniruzzaman Khan refused to comment either. But another association leader on condition of anonymity said proposals had been made for some amendments to four ordinances promulgated in line with the separation. "The government has shown a positive attitude. If the amendments are made, the separation of the judiciary can be done peacefully," he said. Meanwhile, Moniruzzaman Khan did not shoulder the statement by Rokanuddowla, saying that he violated the code of conduct for administrative officials by talking rough. "The statement by Rokanuddowla is solely of his own," Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com Monday by phone. "The association has no links with it," he said. Moniruzzaman said Sunday's seminar was organised to find ways to cooperate with the government about implementing the separation. "His (Rokanuddowla) speech created chaos at the seminar. I tried to stop him but he did not listen to me," he said. "It seems to me that he was not mentally sound then," Moniruzzaman said. He said Bangladesh Administrative Services Association would cooperate with the government in "every possible manner" about the separation of the judiciary. Rokanuddowla could not be reached for comment Monday. Separately, Bangladesh Civil Service Coordination Committee that represents several cadres other than the administration Monday stood against any effort to halt the separation plan. In a statement to media, the committee accused the administration cadre of conspiring against the plan. "No sane person can accept such a disorder from one group of cadre out of 29 cadres of the public administration," the statement signed by the committee's publicity secretary Mushtaq Hossain. It said it was clear that the judiciary could not be separated from the executive because of the administration cadre's "ill-intent". "The matter of the separation is part of the democratic system," it said. The Communist Party of Bangladesh Monday asked the government to stick to the separation plan. bdnews24.com/ehb/ahd/g
