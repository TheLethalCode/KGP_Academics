<TEXT>
 ROME, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adriano scored the winner as Inter Milan won 1-0 away to strugglers Reggina on Saturday to extend their lead at the top of Serie A to five points. The Brazilian striker glanced in a Luis Figo free kick after 18 minutes to hand the champions a fourth consecutive triumph. Winless Reggina pushed forward valiantly but their attempts to score in the first half were frustrated by Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo and a rain-soaked surface that frequently held the ball up. In the closing stages Reggina keeper Andrea Campagnolo saved a fierce Zlatan Ibrahimovic shot while Francesco Cozza and Emmanuel Cascione came close to snatching a draw for the home side. Inter have 20 points from eight games, while second-placed AS Roma have 15 after being held to a thrilling 4-4 draw at home to Napoli earlier on Saturday. Argentine striker Ezequiel Lavezzi gave Napoli the lead in the second minute in the Italian capital but Roma hit back in the 30th with a Francesco Totti penalty. Simone Perrotta then knocked in the rebound after a powerful Totti effort in the 41st minute, only for Napoli's Slovak midfielder Marek Hamsyk to level after the break. Daniele De Rossi wrong-footed Napoli keeper Gennaro Iezzo with a 30-metre shot in the 52nd before Walter Gargano equalised with another long-range effort 12 minutes later. The hosts thought they had clinched it when David Pizarro blasted home a free kick in the 80th but Marcelo Zalayeta's header six minutes from time gave Napoli a share of the spoils. Juventus, who are third with 14 points, have the chance to trim Inter's lead to three points with a victory over in-form Genoa on Sunday
