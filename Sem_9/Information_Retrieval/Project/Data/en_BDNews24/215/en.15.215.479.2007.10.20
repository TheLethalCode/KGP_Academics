<TITLE> Bush, Sarkozy to visit home of first US president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy's two-day visit next month with US President George W. Bush will cover topics such as Iran and include a formal dinner and a trip to the home of the first US president, the White House said on Friday. The leaders will go to Mt. Vernon, the mansion just south of the US capital that was home to George Washington for more than 45 years. The venue will conjure the ties between the two countries that date back more than two centuries to France's support for the United States during the Revolutionary War against England. Bush will also host Sarkozy at an official dinner at the White House during the Nov. 6-7 visit. Bush's meeting with the French president comes just a few days before he is to host German Chancellor Angela Merkel at his Texas ranch. The Sarkozy visit was another sign of warming of ties between Washington and Paris since Sarkozy was elected five months ago. By contrast, Bush had a chilly relationship with former French President Jacques Chirac, an outspoken critic of the Iraq war. Sarkozy has shown a greater willingness than Chirac to put pressure on Iran over its nuclear program. White House press secretary Dana Perino said the subject of Iran and the US push to persuade other countries to back tighter sanctions on Tehran will be among the topics of discussion during the meetings between Bush and Sarkozy. "I think that there's a lot of things on the agenda, including Iran and possible additional sanctions for that country if they don't live up to their international obligations," Perino said. "There's a range of issues that they can talk about. And the president is looking forward to the social aspect of it as well," she added. The United States and its European allies are trying to persuade Iran to halt its nuclear enrichment work because of suspicions that Tehran is trying to acquire a nuclear weapon. Iran insists its nuclear program is for the purely peaceful purpose of developing electricity. Sarkozy visited Bush at his father's oceanfront estate in Kennebunkport, Maine in August, where the two shared an informal lunch. The White House offered details on Sarkozy's visit a day after his aides announced that the French president and his wife, Cecilia, had divorced after 11 years of marriage
