 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)- Awami League presidium member Suranjit Sengupta said Sunday a dialogue with the government could take place, but an environment free of intimidation should prevail for that. His comment came a day before his party's central working committee meeting to decide their strategy on electoral reform talks with the Election Commission. He said the committee members would sit Monday with a focus on the possible dialogue slated for Nov 4 with the commission. "But we haven't taken any decision yet on whether we'll sit with the commission," he said. Reacting to a colleague's statement that AL want to sit with the government instead of the commission to resolve some political issues, Suranjit said the matter could be discussed in Monday's meeting. The party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam had said Saturday that some issues should be resolved through direct discussion between political parties and the caretaker government. But law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday ruled out any such dialogue with the parties. "There's no reason to sit with the political parties for dialogue. I can't understand why they want to sit with the government. They should talk to the commission; it will work," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. Suranjit, however, said Ashraful's idea was to overcome the present "crisis". "Our leader Sheikh Hasina is in jail. The question of the election is before us. A national dialogue can surely take place. We want a conducive environment so that our leaders and workers can work in a normal situation." "Still, we'll be able to take a party resolution about the proposal only through discussion in Monday's meeting," he said. He said at the moment many of the party leaders are in jail and some are away from political activities. "This situation has to be overcome to create a political context." On whether the working committee would discuss the so-called reforms to the party, Suranjit said, "Do you think it is the right time to discuss reforms? Political activities across the country are banned. Our leader is in jail. We'll discuss everything with the party chief." bdne
