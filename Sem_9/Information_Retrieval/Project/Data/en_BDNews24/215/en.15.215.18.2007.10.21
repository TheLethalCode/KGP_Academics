<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  The interim government is clearly not happy with the way the administrative magistrates and their fellow cadre officers have reacted to the separation of judicial magistracy. A senior cabinet member Sunday called their campaign unwanted. "What the officials of the administrative cadre are doing is unwanted at a moment when everything is ready," an influential member of the council of advisers said on condition of anonymity. The reaction coincided with the issuance of a charter of demands by the administrators from a seminar where some even threatened work abstention if their demands are not met by Nov 1, the day of the official inauguration of the new arrangement. The government has already appointed as many as 179 judicial magistrates in an effort to implement the separation, and full appointment to fill vacant positions is expected in the next six months. Earlier, Abu Mohammad Moniruzzaman Khan, president of Bangladesh Civil Service (Cadre) Association, had said Saturday many officials from various levels have conveyed their "grievances" to him about the planned changes. At a seminar in the city's Biam auditorium, attended by many incumbent and retired government officials, Sunday put forward a 10-point charter of demands to cope with the new arrangement. They said the executive magistrates and field-level bureaucrats must be empowered so that they can exercise their powers to maintain law and order, conduct mobile court operations, preserve order at public examination centres and perform election duty. The demands were backed by an appeal from one executive magistrate to stop working from Nov 1, which suggestions was welcomed by administrative officials at the seminar. But the adviser denounced such pressure-tactics. "Some officials have spoiled everything in their attempt to control the judiciary. They have issued bail to some people and put others in jail in line with their political masters' diktat," he said. "Conducting trials is not their job. A separate set of people should be in place to do that. The constitution has made it clear. I have talked to the chief adviser this morning about the officials' move. "Those who are doing this are not the government but government officials. They have to keep that point in mind," he said adding, "the officials think this government is weak. If they think that they will realise their demands by putting pressure on us, they're just living in a fool's paradise. They won't succeed." Responding to a query the adviser said, "Why do they think that they will be worthless if magistracy goes. They have executive responsibilities. If they don't have any work, the government will look into that." Meanwhile, speaking on television channels later Sunday, law adviser Mainul Hosein said administrative officials had no right to issue political statements. bdnews24.com/ahd
