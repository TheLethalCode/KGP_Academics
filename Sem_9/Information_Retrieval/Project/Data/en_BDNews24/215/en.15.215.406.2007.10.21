 BISHKEK, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Below are key facts about the Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan, which holds a referendum on Sunday on a new constitution that would strengthen President Kurmanbek Bakiyev's rule. Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous, landlocked ex-Soviet republic bordering China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Most of its five million people are Turkic-speaking Muslims who live in poverty after the economy collapsed in the 1990s. Former President Askar Akayev fled to Moscow in March 2005 after a wave of violent protests toppled his rule and brought President Kurmanbek Bakiyev to power. Kyrgyzstan hosts a Russian and a US military airbase. The United States uses its facility to support operations in nearby Afghanistan. Its traditionally rocky relations with neighbouring Uzbekistan soured further after hundreds of refugees fled across the border into Kyrgyzstan following a rebellion in the Uzbek city of Andizhan in 2005. Kyrgyzstan was the first Central Asian nation to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1998
