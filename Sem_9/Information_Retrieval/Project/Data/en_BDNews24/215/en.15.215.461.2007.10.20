 Cox's Bazar, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  An Indian customs official who was on a personal visit with some of his family members died in Cox's Bazar Saturday, a relative and a doctor said. Anath Nath Ghosh, 76, died after he fell sick when he was returning to Cox's Bazar with others by a speed boat from Moheshkhali. He was rushed to Fuad Al Khatib Hospital in the coastal town but doctors said he was dead by then. The doctors said the man died on the way to hospital and they had nothing to do. Physician Shah Alam, quoting relatives, said Anath was a senior customs official of West Bengal and a resident of West Gopinathpur under Haripal Police Station in Hoogley district.

Anath's nephew Ranjunath Ghosh said they came to Cox's Bazar from India three days ago. They went to visit Adinath temple at Moheshkhali island Saturday morning. But he fell sick on their way back to Cox's Bazar in the afternoon, he said. Ranjunath said his uncle had been suffering from various complications, including diabetes and high-blood pressure.
