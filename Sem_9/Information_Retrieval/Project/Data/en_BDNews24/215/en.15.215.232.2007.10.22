<TITLE> South Korea sees boom in stay-at-home fathers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The number of stay-at-home fathers in South Korea has increased more than 40 percent in three years as more women have found higher-paying jobs in a historically male-dominated society, according to government figures. Although women are responsible for raising children and men are the breadwinners in most South Korean households, the number of stay-at-home fathers was 151,000 in 2006, up from 106,000 in 2003, the National Statistical Office said in a study released over the weekend. Women face enormous barriers at the workplace in South Korea and lag behind men in wage parity, separate studies have indicated, but there has been a steady trickle of women into senior-level positions at companies in recent years. "It isn't rare anymore to see couples where women are older than men or women are getting paid better than men," said Sohn Min-jung, a researcher at the Samsung Economic Research Institute. "These couples are naturally making more rational decisions," Sohn said.
