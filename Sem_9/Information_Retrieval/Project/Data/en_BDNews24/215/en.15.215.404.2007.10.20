<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com) -- A total of 245 acres of land in Hatirjheel of Karwan Bazar and Begunbari canal areas in the city will be acquired for a lake, according to a recent directive issued to the deputy commissioner for Dhaka. The land acquisition drive may target the BGMEA building built in the project area, but no final decision has yet been taken. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal however refused to comment on whether the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association building would be brought down. "I cannot say anything about it. Rajuk may say something," he told bdnews24.com Saturday. Rajuk chairman KMA Harun told bdnews24.com: "It is too early to say whether the BGMEA building will be demolished or whether it is legal or illegal. At the same time, it cannot yet be said what step the government is going to take about the building. However, the government will come to a decision soon." There is property of the ministries of housing and public works, land and communications and under private ownership. "The land needs to be acquired for implementation of the project. The deputy commissioner has been asked to take care of the matter. When the land is handed over after acquisition, Rajuk will start evicting illegal structures." The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council had decided to retrieve the lake in the Hatirjheel and Begunbari area. The local government division and Rajuk will implement the project. The government owns 134 acres while 111 acres are under private ownership. BGMEA president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the question of demolishing the BGMEA building does not arise. "It is not a property owned by any individual." The BGMEA building was constructed on Begunbari canal a few yards away from the Panthapath main road. A senior Rajuk official, asking not to be named, said there were allegations that no design approval had been taken before construction. BGMEA had sought permission to construct a bridge for access to the building from the main road. Dhaka City Corporation Thursday forwarded the proposal to adviser Anwarul Iqbal, but it was not approved. bdnew
