 SAO PAULO, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Team-by-team analysis of Sunday's season-ending Brazilian Formula One Grand Prix (listed in championship order): -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- FERRARI (Kimi Raikkonen 1, Felipe Massa 2) Raikkonen completed a stunning comeback to take his sixth win of the season and first title. Massa led from pole but handed over to Raikkonen at the final pitstop. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- BMW SAUBER (Robert Kubica 5, Nick Heidfeld 6) Sauber ended the season having scored points in every race. They also took their points tally over 100 and scored nearly three times as many points as last year. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RENAULT (Giancarlo Fisichella and Heikki Kovalainen retired) Neither driver made the half distance. Fisichella had two accidents in two laps, hit from behind on lap one and then running off the road a lap later before colliding with Yamamoto on his return. Kovalainen retired on lap 35 when he ploughed into the tyre wall. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- WILLIAMS (Nico Rosberg 4, Kazuki Nakajima 10) Rosberg celebrated the best finish of his career, after starting 10th. Nakajima, son of former racer Satoru, made his race debut. Some of the team's mechanics were injured on his first stop when the car skewed into them. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RED BULL (David Coulthard 9, Mark Webber retired) Coulthard collided with Nakajima towards the end of the race, damaging his front suspension. Webber started fifth but retired with transmission failure. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TOYOTA (Jarno Trulli 8, Ralf Schumacher 11) Toyota's first points finish for six races, Trulli finishing where he started. Schumacher said farewell to the team with another disappointing result. He lost a position at the first pitstop due to problems with a damaged wheelnut. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TORO ROSSO (Vitantonio Liuzzi 13, Sebastian Vettel retired) Liuzzi was clipped by Fisichella at the start of his last race for the team, forcing him to pit for a new front wing. He suspected debris also affected the car's handling. Vettel retired with an hydraulics problem. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HONDA (Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello retired) Both drivers retired with engine failure, ending a dismal season for the team. Button was 10th when he stopped on lap 22, Barrichello 11th on lap 41. The Brazilian also collected a drive-through penalty for jumping the start. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SUPER AGURI (Takuma Sato 12, Anthony Davidson 14) The team celebrated a top 10 position thanks to Sato's early season points. Davidson overcame an early incident with Sutil. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SPYKER (Adrian Sutil and Sakon Yamamoto retired) Yamamoto collided with Renault's Fisichella on lap two, damaging his car irreparably. Sutil collided with Super Aguri's Davidson on lap 16. He continued but struggled with brake pressure problems, retiring on lap 43. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MCLAREN (Fernando Alonso 3, Lewis Hamilton 7) Hamilton and Alonso ended the season a point behind Raikkonen. Hamilton lost out at the start and then suffered a temporary gearbox problem on lap eight that put him to the back of the field. Alonso's hopes of a third title in a row evaporated as the Ferraris pulled away
