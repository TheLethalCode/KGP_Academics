<TITLE> Burundi rebels shun truce monitoring meeting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUJUMBURA, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burundi's last remaining rebel group boycotted a meeting of the team supposed to monitor its truce with the government, part of a deal designed to end the central African nation's long ethnic conflict. The Forces of National Liberation, a Hutu rebel group, is the only insurgent group that has not joined President Pierre Nkurunziza's government. Nkurunziza, a Hutu, was elected in August 2005 as part of peace process to halt an ethnic conflict that had raged between the Hutu majority and the dominant Tutsi minority since 1993. South Africa's Safety and Security Minister Charles Nqakula said earlier this week the FNL would return on Saturday to join the truce monitoring team it left in July and refused to rejoin last month. "They were invited to take part to this meeting, and it is a matter of deep regret that they didn't take up this invitation," Nqakula told reporters. "But, again, I ask them to come back unconditionally and take their positions." The FNL has said it will not return unless Nqakula, whom they accuse of bias, is replaced. "To hold a meeting with one side is like celebrating a wedding without a bride. So this makes no sense," FNL spokesman Pasteur Habimana told Reuters. "There is a conflict between us and Nqakula. We don't see how we can rejoin the truce monitoring team while this problem is not yet sorted out," Habimana said. The team has members from the government, the FNL and the mediation team. It was set up as part of a peace deal signed by the FNL and the government in September 2006. The deal was initially hailed as the last piece of the puzzle finally to end a conflict that has led to 300,000 deaths in the coffee- and tea-growing nation of 8 million people. Saturday's meeting was supposed to work on the release of FNL prisoners and the establishment of areas where FNL combatants would feel safe to come and lay down their arms.
