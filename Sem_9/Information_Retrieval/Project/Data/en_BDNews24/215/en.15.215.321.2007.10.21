 KAMPALA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven officers from Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army rebel group have surrendered to South Sudanese authorities after fleeing a battle between their two top commanders, the Ugandan army said on Saturday. Army spokesman Felix Kulayigye said he had reports from South Sudanese authorities and his defence minister, who was with them in its capital Juba, that the officers had fled LRA hideouts in east Congo to Sudan after a shootout on Wednesday. The LRA, whose brutal 20-year war in northern Uganda killed tens of thousands and spawned two million refugees, signed a ceasefire with Uganda last year but rebels have refused to quit their jungle hideouts in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. "We heard reports of some infighting ... as a result of which they scattered. Eleven officers surrendered in Maridi in western Sudan," Kulayigye said. The LRA was not immediately available for comment
