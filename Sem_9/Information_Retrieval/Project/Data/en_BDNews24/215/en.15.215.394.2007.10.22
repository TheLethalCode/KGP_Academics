<TITLE> Moeen seeks investment from expatriates </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Florida, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  General Moeen U Ahmed has appealed to expatriate Bangladeshis to invest in the country. Moeen, who is now in the United States, told expatriate Bangladeshis Saturday evening in Florida: "A good environment for investment prevails in the country now." The army chief said that certain quarters had tried to turn the country into a failed state by fomenting chaos. They wanted to turn Bangladesh into "another Somalia", he said. But, according to the army chief, the armed forces came forward to help the government stop that ill effort through the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan 11. "Our duty is to make the country economically independent," he said. He said over the past 36 years the nation had been divided instead of achieving the goals of the liberation war. The army chief repeated the interim government's pledge to hand over power to an elected government. "Transferring power to an elected government is the main duty of the caretaker government." "However, if we just hold a good election but fail to curb corruption, that won't bring anything good. This government wants corruption-free elections and a corruption-free economy," he said. He promised to continue the fight against corruption. bdnews
