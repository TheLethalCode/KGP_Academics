 NAPLES, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict told religious leaders, including Christians, Jews and Muslims, on Sunday that faiths must work together to stamp out religiously motivated hatred which uses God as an excuse for violence. The Pope's comments came just minutes before the Vatican announced two priests kidnapped in Iraq had been freed by their captors, in a move a Vatican spokesman said lifted hopes for that country. "Faced with a world lacerated by conflict, where violence is still justified in the name of God, it is important to reiterate that religions must never become a vehicle of hatred," the Pontiff said.

"I strongly hope that this spirit (of peace) spreads above all where tensions are strongest, where freedom and the respect for others are denied, and men and women suffer because of the consequences of intolerance," he said. The Vatican expressed joy over the release of the two Catholic priests, who had been kidnapped in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul earlier this month amid reports they were being held for a $1 million ransom. "We were very worried. ... We hope that kidnappings like this one don't happen again," Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said. Christians form a small minority in Iraq.
