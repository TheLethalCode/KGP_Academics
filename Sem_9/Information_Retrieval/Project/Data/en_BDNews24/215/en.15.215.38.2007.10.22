 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) - Rajshahi and Barisal won the first round four-dayer of the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea 9th National Cricket League at different venues Monday. Last year's runners-up Rajshahi handed an eight-wicket defeat to Sylhet at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium while Barisal defeated Chittagong by five wickets at Shaheed Chandhu Stadium. Rajshahi secured 15 points (eight winnings points and seven bonus points) while Barisal secured 14 points (eight winning points and six bonus points). Despite losing their matches, Chittagong and Sylhet each got four bonus points. Chasing the winning target of 99 set by Sylhet, Rajshahi easily reached home, losing two wickets of Junaed Siddique (2) and Farhad Reza (27) as opener Jahirul Islam (39) and Nayeem Islam (23) remained unbeaten. Earlier, Sylhet resumed their second innings on 176 for four on the fourth and final day and scored 258 all out, setting hosts Rajshahi to chase a paltry 98. Rajshahi posted 301 in their first innings in reply to Sylhet's paltry first innings total of 141 all out. In Bogra, Chittagong pacer Tareq Aziz removed Barisal opener Shahriar Nafees (1) cheaply in the third over of the innings, but the early blow could not stop Barisal. Former Bangladesh opener Hannan Sarkar just went on scoring 49. Later, Raqibul (55) and Raisul (54) took their side to 220 for five in 75.5 overs. Raisul remained unbeaten. Earlier, Chittagong, having resumed the day on 307 for nine, added only 10 runs to finish at 317 all out. It threw a challenge at Barisal to chase 219 in almost three sessions on the final day. Barisal made 274 all out in the first innings after Chittagong were bundled out for 176 in the first innings.
