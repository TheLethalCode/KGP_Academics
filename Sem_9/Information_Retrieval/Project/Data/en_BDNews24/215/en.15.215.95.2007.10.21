 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - The leaders of the two factions of the BNPs Sunday separately said that the party was united, and that they each represented the mainstream. Party secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Sunday said, "The BNP is united. If any unity issue is formally raised, we'll consider it then." Pro-reform BNP leader Ashraf Hossain said, "There is no schism in the BNP; only a difference of opinion. We've said all along that we want a united BNP. And we continue our effort to keep the party united." Both factions claimed to be the mainstream BNP. Ashraf Hossain explained his side's view after meeting Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan residence. The two senior leaders said that the BNP would be stronger if it remained united. Recent media reports have hinted that leaders of the BNP's factions were working to bridge their differences. Delwar Hossain told journalists at his NAM flat: "Nothing has yet come to me about the 'unity' issue. We hear about the issue in the media. If I am given something formally, I will consider it then." On whether the BNP would hold a dialogue with the government as proposed by the Awami League, Delwar said, "It is not our concern which party does what. Our party office is closed. If our offices were open, we could discuss these matters and then decide what to do." The BNP chairperson's adviser retired brigadier general ASM Hannan Shah told journalists, "There is no such thing as the last word in politics. The swipe they (the reformists) took against us still hurts. We will decide what to do about those wanting to return to the party according to the party's constitution." Leaders and workers of Narsinghdi Sadar BNP, Belabo BNP, Mymensingh BNP and a number of organisations under the BNP showed support for Khandaker Delwar Hossain's leadership. Delwar told them, "Jailed Khaleda Zia is the most popular leader. The BNP has become stronger under her leadership. We have to remain alert so that the party does not plunge into confusion. The BNP's unity must remain intact." Not mentioning the names of those expelled from the party he said, "Those who are isolated from the people and from the thoughts of the party leaders and workers will be thrown into the dustbin of history." "Those who said the BNP will split into several factions are now trying to unite under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." He said party loyalists would free Khaleda Zia through a legal battle. Khandaker Delwar said, "The crisis the BNP is facing now will soon be over and the good days will return. Those who were entertaining other thoughts now realise that there is no alternative to the leadership of Khaleda Zia." "None can stop the BNP's march forward. We have to face every conspiracy with patience." Pro-reform leader Ashraf Hossain told journalists after a meeting with Mannan Bhuiyan, "We represent the mainstream BNP. Most of the central committee and standing committee members, vice chairmen and former lawyers are with us." "We have made some reform proposals to strengthen the party. These will be finalised at the party council. There have been some differences of opinion in the party. But we've always said we want a united BNP." He claimed that Mannan Bhuiyan was the lawful secretary general of the party. He hoped the Election Commission would invite his faction to its talks with the political parties. bdnews24.c
