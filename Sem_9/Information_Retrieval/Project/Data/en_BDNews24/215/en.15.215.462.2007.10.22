<TITLE> No separation of judiciary until 2021: Rokan-ud-dowla </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - Rokan-ud-Dowla, a Dhaka Metropolitan magistrate involved in the anti-adulteration drive, made several controversial comments Sunday as he demanded a halt to the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch until 2021. At a seminar on "Independence of the judiciary for good governance", he urged executive branch officials to stop work from Nov 1 if the government did not clearly state that it would halt the separation process by that date. The magistrate's stance on the proposed judiciary separation was enthusiastically received by administrative officials at the seminar, organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Administration Management. Rokan-ud-Dowla said the postponement was necessary to remove the inequality created between executive magistrates and judicial magistrates. The judiciary is scheduled to be separated from the executive branch on November 1. "We have come here to establish our rights and honour. We have come to the administration to defend magistrates' honour. There is no need to stay with the administration if we uphold our honour," Rokan-ud-dowla said. "I have no objection to going to jail if our rights are not secured. I am standing on the gallows." The magistrate said the separation of the judiciary would not bring an iota of benefit to the people. "The chambers and powers of administrative magistrates are being snatched away in an overnight coup." He said that it is widely publicised if a secretary or someone in the administration turns out to be corrupt, but if corruption in the judiciary is mentioned the question of contempt of court arises. Such discrepancies cannot be accepted. He said that although judges' retirement age has been raised to 67 years, officials in the administration are still retired at 57 years of age. Mentioning that a committee had been formed to resist anarchy in the judiciary, Rokan-ud-dowla said that if executive magistrates' demands were not met, executive branch work would be halted. Demanding the appointment of judicial magistrates in phases from 27th BCS to the year 2021, Rokan-ud-dowla said the decision to separate the judiciary could not be implemented before 2021. Dhaka divisional commissioner Ikram Ahmed presided over the seminar. bdnews24
