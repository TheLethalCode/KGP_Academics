 NAPLES, Italy, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pope Benedict condemned "disgraceful" Camorra mobsters who contributed to a culture of lawlessness in Naples, during his first trip as Pontiff to the troubled Italian city on Sunday. Addressing a crowd of thousands huddled under umbrellas in Naples' main square, the Pontiff said Catholics must prevent their children being tempted into a life of crime. "For many, life is not simple: there are so many situations of poverty ... there is the sad phenomenon of violence," the Pope told the crowd on a rainy, grey morning.

Later on Sunday the Pope was due to meet religious leaders attending the conference, including Muslims, Jews and Buddhists. "May this important cultural and religious initiative contribute to consolidating peace in the world," he said. Benedict's visit to Naples came on the 28th anniversary of a 1979 visit to Naples by his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, whose trips to the city also included calls for an end to mob violence. Benedict urged Naples residents not to lose hope. Speaking before a crowd including Prime Minister Romano Prodi, the Pontiff told local people they should not wait for politicians to act.
