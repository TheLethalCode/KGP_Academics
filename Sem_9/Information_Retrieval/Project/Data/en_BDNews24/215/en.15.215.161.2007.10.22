 ATLANTA, Oct 21 -(bdnews24.com/Reuters) Musician Kid Rock was arrested on Sunday after a fight in a Waffle House restaurant in Atlanta just days after he scored his first No. 1 album on US pop charts, police said. DeKalb County police said they arrested Rock, 36, and five members of his entourage at 5:15 a.m. after an argument with a man who entered the Waffle House escalated into a fight. "Rock along with five members of his entourage were charged with one count of battery, which is a misdemeanor. The victim ... was treated and released at a local hospital for his injuries," Mekka Parish, spokeswoman for DeKalb police, said. The Waffle House pressed charges against the man involved in the fight with Rock's entourage after a window was punched out during the fight, which started inside but ended in the parking lot, Parish said. She said Rock had given a concert in Atlanta earlier in the evening and left the scene on his tour bus after the fight. He was stopped and arrested about a mile (1.6 km) down the road, Parish said. He was released on bond later on Sunday. Rock scored the first No. 1 album of his career on Wednesday with "Rock N Roll Jesu
