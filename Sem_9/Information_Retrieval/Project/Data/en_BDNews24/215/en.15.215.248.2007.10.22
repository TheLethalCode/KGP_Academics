 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  The SEC Monday called the all-time turnover high of Tk 3.16 billion on the Dhaka Stock Exchange 'abnormal'. "It's abnormal. Many issues are overpriced and far outpace their fundamentals. Such a situation increases small investor risk and is the reason we're worried," said Securities and Exchange Commission executive director Farhad Ahmed at a press briefing in his office. The benchmark DGEN or general index topped the 2900 mark amid a buying frenzy in banking shares following reports that the IMF suggested bank capital be raised to Tk 5.0 billion. Turnover on the DSE hit a previous high of Tk 2.75 billion on July 22. The SEC executive did not elaborate on why the market was witnessing such a surge in liquidity. "The market suffers from a huge demand and supply mismatch. We are talking to the government about ways to increase the supply of issues to contain demand." The reasons behind the inflow of funds are varied but can be partially accounted for by banks and other financial institutions increasing their market participation to build their portfolios in the wake of low demand for credit among businessmen. Other factors are merchant banks' ongoing propensity for margin loans despite caution from the SEC, savings certificate investors' shift towards stocks, increased foreign investment, and growing interest among retail investors. The result: a steady rally in prices. "We are unable to celebrate the new highs in turnover and indices. We see increased marginal risk of losses unless supply of issues does not increase at par with demand," said DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan. The DGEN or general index finished at an all time high of 2901.69, up 41 points or 1.43 percent. On September 30, the DGEN stood at 2548.18. The DSI or all-share price index gained 31.47 points or 1.29 percent to close at 2456.60. The DSE20 blue chip index rallied 40.98 points or 1.87 percent to 2223.17. Banks with issues worth less than Tk 500 went up over 10 percent, bagged by new retail investors. Advancers beat decliners 120 to 83. Twelve issues held steady. Trust Bank, the most active issue, surged 12.49 percent to end at an all-time high of Tk 1166. BRAC Bank topped its previous high and closed at Tk 1579.5, up 3.67 percent.
