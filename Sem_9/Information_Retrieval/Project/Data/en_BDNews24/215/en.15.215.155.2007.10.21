<TEXT>
 LJUBLJANA, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Conservative Lojze Peterle was ahead with around 27 percent of the votes among seven candidates in Slovenia's presidential election on Sunday, according to exit polls shown on two national TV stations. Peterle needs more than 50 percent of votes to secure an outright victory. If preliminary official results, expected at 2200 GMT, confirm the exit poll standings, the 59-year old former prime minister will compete against a centre-left candidate, Mitja Gaspari or Danilo Turk, in the second round on November 11.
