 FAISALABAD, Pakistan, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa all rounder Vernon Philander has returned home from Pakistan without playing a match after failing to recover from a hamstring injury, a team spokesman said on Sunday. "He left on Saturday as medical reports confirmed he needed at least another two weeks to recover from his hamstring injury," South Africa media spokesman Owen Smith told reporters. "We have sought no replacement for him," he added. Philander, 22, had joined the team in Pakistan as a replacement for fast bowler Morne Morkel who fractured his left foot during training before the first test. South Africa meet Pakistan in the third one-day international in Faisalabad on Tuesday. Pakistan levelled the five-match series on Saturday with a 25-run victory in Lahore
