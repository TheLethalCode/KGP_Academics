<TITLE> US calls for Iraq to take 'swift' action on PKK </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States pressed the Iraqi government and Kurdish leaders to move quickly to stop Kurdish rebel attacks against Turkey and said on Monday it did not want to see the conflict widen along the border. The United States has stressed to the Turkish, Iraqi, and Kurdish leadership that the cross-border attacks must stop, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. But the Iraqi government has little control over the largely autonomous northern region and analysts say the United States must pressure Iraqi Kurds to take action against the rebels to avoid further escalation with Turkey. Internal pressure is increasing for Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan to act with force against the Kurdish rebels after eight Turkish soldiers went missing and at least 12 soldiers were killed in clashes near the Iraqi border. "We want the Iraqi government to take swift action to stop the activity of the PKK," Fratto said. He condemned the attacks and called the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, a terrorist organization. "We do not want to see wider military action on the northern border," Fratto said. The United States calling on the Iraqi government to take action is likely to have little impact because Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government does not control the largely autonomous northern region, one analyst said. The main leverage the United States has is over Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, who has said his region would defend itself if Turkish troops invaded, and whom Turkey does not recognize, said Bulent Aliriza, director of Turkey Project at Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Somebody's got to lean on the Iraqi Kurds, and only the US can lean on the Iraqi Kurds," he said. "The pressures on Erdogan to act are increasing literally by the hour." The office of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, said the rebels would announce a cease-fire on Monday evening. The White House said Washington wanted to see action quickly. "The PKK must stop these attacks," Fratto said. Erdogan said over the weekend that he expected the United States to take "swift" steps against the Kurdish rebels, many of whom are based in northern Iraq. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Erdogan and Barzani on Sunday to make it clear that the United States opposed any unilateral action, State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. She promised Erdogan that she would push the Iraqis to do more to fight the PKK, he said. "We think it's incumbent upon the Iraqi government and the Kurdish regional government to act," McCormack said. Turkey has deployed as many as 100,000 troops, backed by tanks, F-16 fighter jets and attack helicopters along its border with Iraq in anticipation of a possible incursion. The United States and Iraq have called on Turkey to refrain from a military push into the Kurdish region, one of the few relatively stable parts of the Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003.
