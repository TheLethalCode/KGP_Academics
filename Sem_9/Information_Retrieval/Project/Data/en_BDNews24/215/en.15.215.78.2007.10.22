<TITLE> Indian communists seek end to nuclear row ambiguity </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian communists plan to press the government on Monday to confirm it will back off a nuclear deal with the United States, after the prime minister earlier signaled it could be put on a backburner to save his coalition. The four main left parties, which prop up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's coalition, oppose the deal and had threatened to end support if it was pursued, forcing the government to signal it would give in this month after weeks of sabre rattling. Although Singh has said he hopes to avoid elections over the deal and told President George W. Bush there were "certain difficulties" in pursuing it, the government had yet to inform them about the details, communist leaders said. With Singh and his Congress party asserting subsequently that they still hoped the deal would go through, the communists plan to ask the government to end its ambiguity at Monday's meeting of a joint panel formed to resolve the row. "We have not heard anything from the prime minister so far," said D. Raja, a senior leader of the Communist Party of India, the second largest left party. "They are changing their position every day. We would like to know what the stand of the government is," he said. The civilian nuclear cooperation deal aims to lift a three-decade ban on sales of U.S. nuclear fuel and reactors to India, imposed after it conducted a nuclear test in 1974 while staying out of non-proliferation agreements. The deal has been hailed as the cornerstone of a new friendship between Washington and New Delhi, but the communists say it hurts India's sovereignty and imposes U.S. hegemony. The face-off pushed Singh's government to the brink of collapse, sparked the prospect of snap elections and hurt sentiment on India's stock markets before the coalition blinked under pressure from other allies opposed to an early vote. Analysts and diplomats say they hope Monday's talks would give a clearer sense of the future of the deal. But few expect a breakthrough even though the government has said it still hopes to convince the left parties. India needs to conclude a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, get approvals from the Nuclear Suppliers Group and a second backing from the U.S. Congress before the agreement can come into force. Although it faces no formal deadline, Washington wants the pact -- considered highly lucrative for American firms -- clinched next year before the end of Bush's term to avoid its fate becoming uncertain under a new administration.
