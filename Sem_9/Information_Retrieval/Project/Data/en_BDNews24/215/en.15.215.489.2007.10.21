 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday dismissed demands for dialogue with political parties, saying such an exercise would affect the interim government's neutral credentials. Mainul's comment came after a senior Awami League leader's suggestion that the government discuss with political parties to resolve some "political issues". Syed Asharful Islam, acting general secretary of the Awami League, Saturday told a media briefing that it would be pointless to talk to the Election Commission about those political issues. The 58-year old party is clearly facing a tough time since its powerful chief Sheikh Hasina was put behind bars in July. Ashraful had maintained that some issues would not be resolved without direct dialogue with the government. He raised the demand ahead of Monday's crucial meeting of the party's influential central working committee to decide its strategy for electoral reforms talks slated for Nov 4 with the commission. The political issues that Ashraful said his party would want to discuss with the government included the neutrality of the administration, law and order, election-time environment, measures to make the elections free and fair, and election observers. But Mainul, far from convinced, insisted the political parties talk to the commission for any election related issue. "There's no reason to sit with the political parties for dialogue. I can't understand why they want to sit with the government. They better talk to the commission, it will work," Mainul told bdnews24.com by phone. "In light of their dialogue outcome, the commission may seek cooperation from the government. We'll provide the commission with all necessary assistance. Holding a free and fair election is the commission's job. The government can just facilitate them," he said. bdne
