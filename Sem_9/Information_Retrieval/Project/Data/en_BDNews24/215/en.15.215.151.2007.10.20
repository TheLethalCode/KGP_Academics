 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two protesters were arrested in Washington on Friday evening during demonstrations on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank semi-annual meetings. "A couple people got unruly and were locked up," police spokesman D.J. Jackson said on Saturday about the mainly peaceful protest in the upscale Georgetown neighborhood. Activists said another rally was planned for Saturday several blocks from the White House and the headquarters of the IMF and the World Bank. Large numbers of police were massed in the vicinity and several streets were closed to traffic. Finance ministers and other officials are gathered in Washington through the weekend for the twice-annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, institutions set up after World War Two to provide stability to the world economy. The October Coalition, one of the organizers of the protests, criticized the institutions on its Web site, saying they "claim to lead the fight against poverty" but instead act as "global loan sharks."
