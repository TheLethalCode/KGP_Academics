<TITLE> Giuliani woos religious right with values pitch </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Rudy Giuliani appealed to religious conservatives on Saturday to look beyond his support for abortion rights and focus on shared values, such as fighting crime and his vow to relentlessly pursue the war on terror. "I truly believe that what unites us is greater than any of the things which divide us," former New York mayor Giuliani told a gathering of self-described "values voters" -- mostly white evangelical Protestants who comprise a key segment of the Republican base. Stridently anti-abortion and anti-gay rights, this movement of social conservatives has watched with dismay as Giuliani, who shot to national prominence after the Sept 11 attacks,grabbed the lead in the race for the Republican 2008 presidential nomination. Some have spoken of backing a third party candidate to fly their anti-abortion banner should he become the nominee. Opposition to abortion has become an almost sacred Republican plank because of the religious right's influence but Giuliani threatens to break that taboo. The thrice-married Giuliani, a Roman Catholic who also supports gay rights, dismissed charges that he was an "activist for liberal causes" and told the crowd that Christianity was a religion of "inclusion". "Christianity is all about inclusiveness. It's built around the most profound act of love in human history, isn't it?" said Giuliani, who also assured the audience during a 40-minute speech that he felt his faith deeply but privately. He often drew warm applause but no thunderous ovations. Sticking to religious themes, Giuliani said morning prayers were part of his daily routine at Catholic schools. The first time he didn't pray before class was when he started law school. He stressed his record of reducing crime in New York, reiterated his staunch support for Israel and said that victory was the only option in the war on terror -- all areas of agreement with conservative religious voters. Giuliani also assured them that he would appoint conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court -- a key policy plank since the Holy Grail of the social conservative cause is getting a bench that will overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision granting women a constitutional right to an abortion. This assurance won him an endorsement earlier this week from Texas Gov. Rick Perry, an anti-abortion conservative. Giuliani also pledged to work to increase adoptions and decrease abortions -- a stance which hardliners, who say they could never bring themselves to support a pro-choice candidate, regard as far too soft. "The party has always been a big tent but it's not that big a tent," said Michael Scully, a supporter of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is a recent convert to the anti-abortion cause. In a clear shot at Romney, Giuliani said he would not change his views for political advantage. "Isn't it better for me to tell you what I believe rather than change my positions to fit the prevailing wind?" Religious conservatives have yet to rally around a single candidate in what they see as a flawed field.
