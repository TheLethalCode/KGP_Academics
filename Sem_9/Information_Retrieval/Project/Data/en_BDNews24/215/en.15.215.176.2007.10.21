 BAGHDAD, Sun Oct 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US air strikes in a Shia stronghold of Baghdad early on Sunday killed two toddlers, Reuters TV footage showed, in clashes that police said left a total of 13 dead and 69 wounded. The bodies of the toddlers, one in a nappy, lay on crumpled blankets in the morgue of Imam Ali hospital in the poor district of Sadr City where doctors tended to wounded men and boys.

It added that the operation targeted "criminals believed to be responsible for the kidnapping of coalition soldiers in November 2006 and May 2007". Three US soldiers were kidnapped south of Baghdad on May 12. The body of one of the soldiers was found later that month but the other two are classed as missing and captured. A US army translator of Iraqi descent, was kidnapped on October 23 last year when he went to visit relatives, including his Iraqi wife, in Baghdad. His family said he was taken by the members of the Mehdi Army. The US commander for Baghdad, Maj. Gen. Joseph Fil, said in September that while security was getting better in some parts of Baghdad following a US crackdown, areas such as Sadr city were likely to continue to see higher violenc
