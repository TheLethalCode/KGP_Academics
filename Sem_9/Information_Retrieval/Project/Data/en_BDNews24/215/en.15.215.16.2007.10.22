 HONG KONG, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The dollar hit a record low on Monday after a meeting of finance chiefs from rich nations offered no words of support for the currency, while Asian stocks had their biggest fall in two months on mounting US worries. Investors plowed into the relative safe-haven of government bonds and gold, helping drive the 10-year yield for Japanese bonds to a one-month low. Gold, initially weighed by profit taking, clawed off the session low to be within reach of a 28-year high set Friday. Traders said shares took their cue from Wall Street, which marked its biggest fall in two months on Friday, a slide made more unnerving as it marked the 20th anniversary of 'Black Monday', the 1987 stock market crash. "You've got a slower US economy and the credit market issue still bubbling away under the surface. But on the positive, you still got strong economic growth here and in Asia," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO in Australia. "So you have a competition of two forces and at the moment, the negatives are winning." At 0243 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had dropped 3.2 percent, while MSCI's measure of other stocks in Asia had lost 2.6 percent -- its steepest percentage fall since the 5.7 percent slide on Aug. 16. EXPORTERS DOWN Exporters bore the burnt of the selloff, hurt by the double-whammy of a weaker dollar and growing worries about the health of the US economy, the region's top export destination. Caterpillar, the worlds top maker of earth-moving construction and mining equipment, said on Friday several key US industries that it serves were in recession, suggesting the housing slump was spreading to other parts of the US economy. A falling dollar makes exports from Asia relatively more expensive and lowers the value of overseas sales, factors that further undermined some of the region's major exporters. Honda Motor fell 2.6 percent, Canon Inc lost 1.9 percent and Hyundai Motor dropped 3.4 percent. Banks, which have been weighed by worries about a global credit squeeze, were also hit. Japan's top lender Mitsubishi UFJ, Australia's Macquarie Bank and South Korea's Kookmin Bank all fell. Adding to investors woes, energy stocks such as INPEX Holdings and oil-and-gas producer Woodside Petroleum were not spared after oil extended its decline. Investors cashed in on crude's recent rally to a record high above $90 a barrel, but simmering geo-political tensions and the weak dollar meant that further downside was likely to be limited. US crude fell nearly $1 to $87.63. DOLLAR DOWN Traders sold the dollar after the tumble in US stocks and following the G7's apparent indifference over the weakness of the currency. The finance ministers and central bank heads of the G7 countries met in Washington on Friday. "The G7's statement effectively gives a green light to continue selling the dollar," Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at the Bank of New York Mellon, said over the weekend. The dollar hit a record low against a basket of major currencies and carved out a six-week low near 113.20 yen The euro jumped to a record high of about $1.4350. The low-yielding yen tends to benefit from risk aversion because it is often used as the funding currency for high-yield investments. So when those are reversed, the investors buy back into the yen. "We didn't see any surprises from the G7, and weak stocks are continuing to drag on the dollar," said Hideaki Inoue, forex manager at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking. "Risk aversion is a big driver at the moment." But weakness in equities boosted safe-haven Japanese government bonds (JGBs). The yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs fell 4.5 basis points to a one-month low of 1.555 percent. Spot gold was at $759 an ounce, off an early low of $754 and not far off the peak of $770 set on Friday
