<TITLE> Judiciary separation row heats up </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - The row over the upcoming judiciary separation is heating up as executive branch officials voiced strong opposition Sunday to the separation of judiciary scheduled for Nov 1. With some executive magistrates threatening to halt work from that date if the move goes ahead, the government has responded by warning bureaucrats not to take action. "What the officials of the administrative cadre are doing is unwanted at a moment when everything is ready," a member of the council of advisers told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. "Some officials have spoiled everything in their attempt to control the judiciary. They have issued bail to some people and put others in jail in line with the interests of their political masters," he said. Dhaka Bar Association and Dhaka Metropolitan Bar Association termed the meeting by the administrative cadre officials as tantamount to contempt of court. Vice president of the Judicial Service Association and registrar of the Supreme Court Iktedar Ahmed, on the other hand, is claiming there is no significant clash between the Supreme Court and the administrative cadre. Iktedar said, "The separation of the judiciary is not our issue, it is the people's demand. Those who oppose it are negligible in number." The government has already appointed as many as 179 judicial magistrates in an effort to implement the separation, and full appointment to fill vacant positions is expected in the next six months. Serving and former members of the administrative cadre threatened to halt work at offices on November 1 if the government goes ahead with plans to separate the judicial from the executive, at a seminar in the city's BIAM auditorium attended by many serving and retired government officials. Speakers at the seminar agreed with the principle of judicial separation but said more careful planning was required to do it right. They put forward a 10-point charter of demands to cope with the proposed separation. Among other things, the disgruntled bureaucrats demanded that executive magistrates' powers be made specific and demanded that differences between the judicial and executive branches be addressed. Former secretary and caretaker adviser Abdul Muyeed Chowdhury said that the powers of the executive magistracy should not vanish just because the judiciary is separated from the executive. Certain powers, such as land administration, conducting mobile courts and summary trials, should lie with executive magistrates, he said. "Executive magistrates' functions have to be clearly stipulated. The status and powers of judicial and executive magistrates have to be fixed. There must be equity between the two groups," he said. But an adviser to the caretaker government, asking not to be named, said: "Conducting trials is not their job. A separate set of people should be in place to do that. The constitution has made that clear. I have talked to the chief adviser this morning about the officials' move." Leading lawyers have termed the meeting of the administrative cadre officials as tantamount to 'contempt of court'. Dhaka Bar Association president Advocate Fakir Delwar Hossain and general secretary Advocate Golam Mostafa Khan in a joint statement to the press Sunday, said: "The holding of the meeting by the administrative officials and speaking against the verdict of the court amounted to contempt of court." Dhaka Metropolitan Bar Association president Advocate Shah Iliyas Ratan in a statement said, "The lawyers' community will not tolerate any conspiracy against the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch." But UBINIG managing director Farhad Mazhar, speaking at the BIAM seminar, said it would not be right to implement such a policy before an elected government came to power. "This is a constitutional matter and parliament should decide. The court has no role here; parliament must be allowed to do its job." He called the proposed separation a fraud. Speaking to bdnews24.com, the member of the council of advisers said:"Those who are doing this are not the government, but are government officials. They have to keep that point in mind," the adviser said. "Officials think this government is weak. If they think that they can realise their demands by pressuring us, they're just living in a fool's paradise," he said. "They won't succeed." bdnews24
