 DIYARBAKIR, Turkey, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's government was under intense public pressure on Monday to launch a major cross-border operation to crush Kurdish guerrillas operating from northern Iraq after they killed 17 Turkish soldiers. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said he had agreed to give the United States, which is anxious to avert any Turkish military strikes in northern Iraq, a few days in which to make a decision. But he then wanted Washington to take "swift" steps against the Kurdish separatists. The attack, the worst in more than a decade by separatist rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), came four days after Turkey's parliament overwhelmingly approved a motion to allow troops to enter northern Iraq to crush the guerrillas. Ankara estimates there are 3,000 PKK rebels based in northern Iraq fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey. Its military has deployed as many as 100,000 troops, backed by tanks and attack helicopters, along the border. The United States, Turkey's NATO ally, fears a Turkish military strike into northern Iraq could further destabilise the region. "Enough is enough," nationalist newspaper Cumhuriyet splashed across its front page, in a headline voicing frustration. "We are all conscripts," read the headline from religious-leaning daily Yeni Safak. Opposition leaders also urged action. Erdogan will chair a weekly cabinet meeting on Monday, which is expected to focus on escalating PKK violence. He was due in London on an official visit later in the day. He told a news conference on Sunday after a crisis meeting with top civilian and military leaders that Turkey expected concrete steps to be taken by US authorities against the PKK after his talks with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The Turkish lira currency fell three percent to 1.2360 against the dollar early on Monday on concerns of a possible cross-border offensive. ANY PRICE President Abdullah Gul's office said late on Sunday that Turkey would pay whatever price was needed to defeat terrorism. "While respecting the territorial integrity of Iraq, Turkey will not shy away from paying whatever price is necessary to protect its rights, its laws, its indivisible unity and its citizens," said the statement, issued after the crisis talks. Turkey's tougher stance has helped propel global oil prices to record highs over the past week. The PKK has said it might target pipelines carrying Iraqi and Caspian crude across Turkey. Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul told reporters in Kiev after talks with US Defense Secretary Robert Gates that 17 soldiers had been killed, 16 injured and 10 others were still missing. Asked if there would be a military response to those attacks close to the Iraqi border, Gonul said: "Not urgently. They (Turkish troops) are planning a cross-border (incursion) ... We'd like to do these things with the Americans." US President George W. Bush condemned the attacks. "Attacks from Iraqi territory need to be dealt with swiftly by the Iraqi government and Kurdish Regional authorities," White House National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. Turkey has for several years called on Washington and Iraqi authorities to clamp down on PKK rebels, including its leaders, believed based in the mountainous Kurdish northern Iraq region but says it has yet to see any concrete results. Iraq's government said it was taking important steps to end what it called the "terrorist actions" of the Kurdish rebels. But Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani said his autonomous region would defend itself if Turkish troops invaded. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, who called on the PKK to cease fighting and to turn itself into a political organisation, angered Turks further on Sunday by saying: "We will not hand any Kurd over to Turkey, not even a Kurdish cat", according to media
