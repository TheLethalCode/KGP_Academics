 William Melody LYNGBY, Denmark, October 21 (bdnews24.com) -- A review of Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission's (BTRC) documents that invite bids for interconnection exchanges and international gateway facilities associated with international services is likely to drive telecom policy analysts to tears. For many years poor Bangladesh has been used by analysts making international comparisons as a worst case scenario. Telecom policy and regulation have avoided all the tenets of an informed, objective and participatory regulatory process, established monumental barriers to telecom development and done great harm to the Bangladesh economy. Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) has a monopoly over international services. Yet it does not provide service to the vast majority of the population, and the policymakers will not let anyone else. Almost all the telecoms development that has taken place has been by ingenious new players, who were many steps ahead of the policymakers and regulators in introducing mobile technologies and services before they could be prevented. But even with this development, Bangladesh struggles near the bottom of international telecoms development rankings. Things began to look more positive for Bangladesh in 2003 when the government announced that BTTB's monopoly would be brought to an end and other players would be allowed to participate in the development of international telecoms networks and services. After a four year delay, the invitation to bid documents that have finally appeared show clearly that Bangladesh is not interested in changing the status quo. The documents would be better labelled "Barriers to Bid" documents. They reflect a new policy that was developed behind closed doors and hasn't even been made available for public consultation. No foreign participation in bids is allowed, including businesses owned by non-resident Bangladeshis. BTTB will get both interconnection and gateway licences, but other operators are excluded. This will make it highly unlikely that there will be significant bids from operators capable of major investments, and if there are, there will still be opportunities to reject them for variety of reasons. Sadly, these bidding conditions are in direct contradiction to World Trade Organisation principles in both telecom and finance. They demonstrate that Bangladesh has marched two steps backward along the telecom reform curve while most other countries are moving forward at a rapid pace, especially its neighbour India which abandoned similar protectionist policies years ago and is now realisation dramatic growth in telecom networks and services.
