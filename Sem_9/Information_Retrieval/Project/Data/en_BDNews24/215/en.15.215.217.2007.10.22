 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com) -- Biman will start carrying hajj pilgrims from Nov 12, an official said Monday. Ataur Rahman, secretary of the religious affairs ministry, said Biman Bangladesh Airlines would complete its job of carrying the pilgrims to Saudi Arabia on December 14. The return flight will begin on December 23. The last return flight has been scheduled for January 24. He said there were allegations from the Hajj Agencies of Bangladesh, an association of hajj travel agents, that they could not rent houses in the kingdom for the pilgrims since Biman did not give the flight plan. "The matter is settled now. The agencies should rent houses and match flight schedule with Biman," Rahman said. This year, about 40,000 Bangladeshi pilgrims are expected to perform hajj. bdnews24.
