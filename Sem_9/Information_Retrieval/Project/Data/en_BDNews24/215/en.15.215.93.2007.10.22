 WASHINGTON, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Resurgent Russia, keen to erase memories of its economic crisis in 1998, has paid a $343 million credit back to the United States ahead of schedule, Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said on Monday. Russia took out the agricultural credit in 1998, as its economy was falling apart under the strain of global financial turmoil. The final payment had been due in 2020. "We were driven by political reasons when we took the decision to pay back ahead of time," Storchak told reporters in Washington. "As far as financial effectiveness is concerned, the savings are not that big," he added. "But it was unpleasant to keep in our debt portfolio a credit received at the bottom of the national decline." Storchak said Russia was saving only around $47 million by paying back the credit on Oct. 19. After several years of economic growth fuelled by high energy prices, oil-exporting Russia says it is back on the world stage as a leading power. Its rise alarms many Western nations concerned about the decline of democracy in the country. The image of strong and self-confident Russia is one of the key elements in the Kremlin's campaign ahead of a parliamentary election on Dec. 2 and March presidential polls, in which a successor to President Vladimir Putin will be elected. Putin, who is not allowed to run for a third term by law but has a strong influence on the outcome of the polls, has said he wants to make sure a successor sticks to his course. Russian officials say the country, whose gross domestic product is expected to top $1.3 trillion this year, could become the world's fifth largest economy by 2020. Its newly assertive foreign policy has put it at odds with Western partners on issues ranging from US plans to build a missile defence system in Europe to how to deal with Iran, suspected by the West of working to build a nuclear bomb.
