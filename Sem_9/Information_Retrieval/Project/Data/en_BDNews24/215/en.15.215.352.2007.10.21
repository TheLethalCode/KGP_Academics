 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) faced another blow to appoint a coach for the national side when Australian coach John Dyson got appointment as the West Indies coach. The West Indies Cricket Board, however, did not reveal when Dyson would takeover. But the West Indies are due to begin a tour of South Africa in December. "The rest of the team management would be identified and appointed subsequently," said a West Indies board spokesman, according to cricinfo. Dyson, the former Australian batsman and former coach of Sri Lanka, was one of the top choices for Bangladesh along with West Indian Gordon Greenidge and Australian Colin Miller. The BCB had claimed that it had a fruitful discussion with Dyson to award him the job. "I can't understand why Dyson did it after he had requested us to let him know about his presentation date. He even wished to take the charge of Bangladesh on November 15 after his presentation," said Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, head of the coach selection committee. Lipu said he Sunday mailed Dyson to know details about his reported appointment. The former Bangladesh skipper said they faced "a big blow" after losing Dyson, as they were pretty sure the board would get him. He said they even did not maintain good contact with other aspirants in hopes that Dyson would join Bangladesh. Lipu feared the board would not be able to appoint a coach by Oct 30, the deadline fixed by the board. bdn
