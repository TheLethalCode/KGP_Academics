<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign affairs adviser Dr Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Monday called for greater Indian investment at a meeting with members of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), at his foreign ministry office. "Bangladesh welcomes investment from all, including her friendly neighbour India. This is a good time to invest." The adviser said Indian authorities should allow greater market access to Bangladeshi products to curb the existing trade imbalance. He called on the "captains of Indian industry" to establish contacts with their Bangladeshi counterparts and assured them that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would do all it could to facilitate business relations. Iftekhar said the caretaker government's reforms would improve long-term business prospects in Bangladesh, making it a profitable economy to invest in. He added that the successes in social and education policy have reduced poverty and empowered women, transforming Bangladesh into an oasis of stability and peace. Shreekant Somany, who led the 14-member CII delegation, looked forward to expanded economic cooperation and greater Indian investment in Bangladesh. Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakrabarty was also present at the meeting. bd
