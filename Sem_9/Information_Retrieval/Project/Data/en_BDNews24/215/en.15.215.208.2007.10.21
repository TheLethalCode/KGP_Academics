<TITLE> Quality issues needed to curb heating, say analysts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com) - Stock analysts have called for an immediate increase in the supply of quality issues to rein in the persistent surge in prices that was created by the injection of huge amounts of money since the start of the year. The average daily turnover on the Dhaka Stock Exchange now stands at an all-time high of Tk 2.5 billion, according to bourse data. The reasons behind the inflow of funds since January are various, but can be partially accounted for by banks and other financial institutions increasing their participation in order to further build their portfolios due to the low demand for credit among businessmen. Other factors are the merchant banks' ongoing propensity for margin loans, despite caution from the SEC; savings certificate investors' shift towards stocks; increased foreign investment, as well as interest from large and small retail investors. The result: a steady rally in prices. From Oct 1 to Oct 18, the main DGEN or general index added 12.25 percent, reaching 2860.56 points. The DGEN grew 17.71 percent to reach 2548.18 in September from 2149.31 points in June. Salahuddin Ahmed Khan, chief executive of the DSE, linked the trend to a shortage of quality issues which drives investors to bet on the limited number of superior issues that exist in the banking, power and pharmaceutical sectors. "The supply of quality issues should be increased to absorb rising demand. The market suffers from a dearth of quality issues," said Salahuddin. "It is also an opportunity for entrepreneurs and the government to raise funds. However, progress so far in listing good new issues from the private sector is not encouraging," he added. According to DSE data, five issues are currently waiting to begin trading on the bourses, while nine issues are yet to get approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Two state-run petroleum marketing companies, Jamuna Oil and Meghna Petroleum, are expected to offload 30 percent of their total shares within one or two months, according to state-owned investment bank ICB. But the size of most of the companies, including Jamuna and Meghna, are still too small to absorb the level of demand. "Only an issue of the size of an Islami Bank bond is large enough," the DSE chief executive said. A portion of shares from Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company and Bakhrabad Gas Systems Ltd is also expected to be sold through the market, said ICB managing director Ziaul Haque Khondker. "The surge in demand for shares could be met to some extent if Titas and Bakhrabad come to the market faster. But we should remember that the entry of good issues to the market also brings new investors," added Khondker. Mamun Rashid, from Citigroup Bangladesh said: "It's a matter of concern that the prices of companies with weak fundamentals are rising due to the immense interest from investors." "We should all work to address the supply constraints in quality issues immediately." "I think regulators such as the Bangladesh Bank should ask banks not to sanction loans worth more than 100 percent of any company's capital," he added. Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi, chairman of the SEC, is also concerned about the current trend: "The market is heated. It's not rational if you consider the increases in price indices," he said. bdndews2
