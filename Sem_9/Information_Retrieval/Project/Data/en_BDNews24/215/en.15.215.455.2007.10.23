 Dhaka, Oct 23 (bdnews24.com) - All residential halls of Dhaka University were reopened 10am Tuesday after being shut down for 62 days. Classes were suspended and DU students had been asked to evacuate their dormitories following the incidents of campus unrest in late August. A syndicate meeting held on Sep 8 decided to reopen all residential halls of the university on Oct 23 and the university on Oct 24, though university authorities have confirmed that the university will reopen on Oct 28. Provost of Surya Sen Hall, Prof Sirajul Islam, told bdnews24.com: "It is not necessary for students to show their identity cards to enter the halls. But if the house tutors find outsiders in the halls, they will be asked to leave." The students may return to their previously allocated rooms, he added. "To avoid any kind of 'misunderstanding' with the students after reopening the university, there will be no police presence in front of halls," Prof Sirajul said. "But to maintain security, police patrols will be stationed at all entrances of the university campus, the mall chattar and TSC," said the professor. DU Vice Chancellor Dr SMA Faiz said: "The university reopens on Oct 28. I hope all academic works including classes, examinations will run normally." When asked if the situation could return to normal after reopening the university, while four teachers and a number of students were in jail, the vice chancellor said: "Ddiscussion with the government in this regard is going on." Prof Akhtaruzzaman, former general secretary of the DU Teachers' Association, told bdnews24.com: "The demand of the teachers and students is to open the university and to keep the situation calm." "But based on experience, many say that the best step for the government and the university authorities would be to reopen the university after releasing the jailed teachers and students." bdnews2
