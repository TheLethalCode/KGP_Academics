 TEHRAN, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ali Larijani, who quit as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, will attend talks with his replacement this week in Rome to try to defuse a row with the West, the Foreign Ministry said on Sunday. Larijani's resignation was announced on Saturday, a move analysts said exposed a rift with President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad about how to handle Iran's nuclear file and would strengthen the leader's hand in pushing for a tougher line in talks. Saeed Jalili, a deputy foreign minister and close ally of the president, replaced Larijani, who had been due to hold a meeting on Tuesday with European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who represents world powers in the nuclear talks. "Dr Jalili will be there, and Dr Larijani will be there as well, serving as the representative of (Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei)," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini told a news conference. He also said, while both would attend these talks, it was not yet clear if the both would attend future meetings. Hosseini dismissed talk of any divisions over policy or any change in strategy. "The resignation by Dr Larijani was approved and agreed to by the president but the policies, the strategies of the Islamic Republic of Iran vis-a-vis the nuclear issue, these are unchangeable goals," Hosseini said. "There is complete solidarity among the ranks of Iranian officials.
