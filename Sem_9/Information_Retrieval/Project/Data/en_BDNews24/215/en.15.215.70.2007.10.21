 WARSAW, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Age was one guide as to which way Poles cast their votes in Sunday's election. The snap parliamentary ballot showed up the divide between generations in a country where EU membership and fast economic growth are rapidly transforming attitudes. Older Poles endured communism and the painful changes that followed its collapse in 1989. They tend to be particularly devout Catholics, more suspicious of old foreign foes and more likely to back the conservative ruling Kaczynski twins. "Law and Justice is fighting against all the bad things in Poland, like corruption. They do not enrich the elite, but support us, normal people," said 54-year-old retiree Walenty Blazinski after voting for the ruling party. Younger Poles have little or no memory of communist hardships. Their prospects are brightened by the booming economy and they seek closer ties with Europe. The centre-right opposition Civic Platform gets more of their votes. "I voted for Civic Platform because it's an alternative to Law and Justice, which is too radical," said 22-year-old Natalia Chaber, a student in Warsaw. "I hope things will improve." Surveys show over 80 percent of young people feel ashamed of Prime Minister Jaroslaw and President Lech Kaczynski two years after they came to power promising to restore national pride and fight post-communist corruption. The nationalist stand of the Kaczynskis, rooted in Poland's history of Nazi occupation and Soviet domination, has found less sympathy among younger Poles. Sunday was the first time Poles born since the fall of communism could vote and few appeared likely to help return a Law and Justice-led government. Pre-election opinion polls gave a clear edge to Civic Platform overall. ECONOMY "I voted for Civic Platform as a vote against Law and Justice and also because I support their economic programme," said 20-year-old student Grzegorz Osinski. The economy has accelerated to its fastest in a decade and is expected to grow at 6.5 percent this year. Civic Platform promises an "economic miracle" on the back of reforms such as tax cuts and privatisation. "The Platform might decide to privatise the railways and hospitals," said 44-year-old railway worker Dorota Kowalewicz, explaining why she had just voted for the ruling party. The economic picture has become much rosier since Poland joined the European Union in 2004. EU membership has also given younger Poles the chance to go and get jobs in western Europe. An estimated 2 million have done so. One of the biggest questions over the election has been whether younger Poles would vote in sufficient numbers to be able to affect the outcome. Turnout of only 40 percent at the last election in 2005 was widely seen as favouring the Kaczynskis because older Poles were more likely to vote than their children, who had a cynical attitude towards politicians and politics in general. Fifty-year-old Stefania Osinska said she had decided to vote for the opposition on behalf of her children, who have left the family farm and show no interest in running it. "I voted for the future of my kids so they won't have to leave the country to make a living," she sa
