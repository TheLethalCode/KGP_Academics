<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 21 (bdnews24.com)District judges around the country were sent letters Sunday containing directives from the Supreme Court on how judicial magistrates are to discharge their duties in the future. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed, who heads the monitoring committee for the separation of the judiciary from the executive, confirmed the court circular to bdnews24.com. The amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code will come into effect on Nov 1. The change will see magistrates' judicial work come under the control of the district and sessions judges instead of the district magistrate. Administrative officials Sunday demanded a deferral of the proposed separation of the judiciary from the executive. Several lawyers, including Supreme Court Bar Association president M Amir-ul Islam, termed their demands 'a contempt of court'. Speaking from his Eskaton chamber Sunday afternoon Barrister Islam said: "According to the constitution, the sacred responsibility of the executive branch is to obey and implement any Supreme Court order." bdnews24.
