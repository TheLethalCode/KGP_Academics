<TITLE> Bangladesh cheers as ITU puts WiMAX in 3G basket </TITLE>

 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  The broadband wireless technology called "WiMax" finally obtained global recognition Friday and largely excited wireless broadband providers in Bangladesh. WiMax is the acronym of World Interoperability for Microwave Access. It provides multiple megabits wireless connectivity in a large area. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) said WiMax would facilitate delivery of broadband wireless services at lower cost and include multiple wireless broadband internet services, including VoIP (voice over internet protocol). After years of extensive debate, the ITU has finally recognised WiMax as one of the third generation (3G) cellular mobile technology. It has become the sixth choice of 3G technology. "This agreement paves the way for the deployment of a range of voice, data, and multimedia services to both stationary and mobile devices," the ITU said. "Significantly, it opens the door to mobile internet, catering to demand in both urban and rural markets," "WiMax technology currently has the potential to reach 2.7 billion people," said WiMAx Forum president Ron Resnick in an announcement. "Today's announcement expands the reach to a significantly larger global population." The wireless broadband community in Bangladesh is also upbeat about this "landmark" development. "The ITU's endorsement to WiMax will accelerate the narrowing of digital divide," bracnet's adviser retired Major General Syeed Ahmed told bdnews24.com Saturday. "We have plans to provide high speed wireless internet access to more than 1,000 small community libraries at the BRAC high schools across Bangladesh by 2010." Syeed Ahmed thinks the government should recognise WiMax as an effective enabler for e-education, e-health, e-commerce and other internet-based socioeconomic phenomena for rural Bangladesh. The Internet Service Providers Association has demanded immediate finalisation of the draft national broadband policy. "This policy has identified WiMax as a major broadband enabler but the document has been catching dust for unknown reasons," the ISPA president Mohammad Abdus Salam said in his reaction to bdnews24.com. He said the government's current policy "heavily favours" mobile internet service while it "grossly discriminates" the fixed wireless broadband industry. Salam's own outfit Agni Systems was deploying fixed WiMax in Dhaka. "But our project has been stalled as the regulator has stopped further import of the equipment." He said, "The ISPs don't oppose the mobile internet but the government should treat the fixed and mobile internet providers equally." Salam said mostly the affluent people use mobile internet while the middleclass uses fixed broadband. "But the duties and regulatory charges on fixed broadband equipment are manifolds higher." "Such disparity is the biggest barrier to proliferate WiMax in Bangladesh," he said urging the government to waive the all tariff from wireless broadband equipment. The global telecommunications industry is on the cusp of major change, and operators are approaching critical decisions about their 4G strategies, as mobile WiMAX (802.16e) starts to move from trials and pilots to the first real-world WiMAX network deployments. Meanwhile, the New York-based ABI Research said "The mobile wireless industry is in a state of major change as mobile operators decide which IP-OFDMA path they will take for their 4G networks," Its recent study "WiMAX Market Analysis and Forecasts" says that mobile operators and other service providers are planning mobile WiMax networks all over the world, mainly in the 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) and 3.5 GHz bands. The research forecasts substantial numbers of WiMax subscribers worldwide: more than 95 million using fixed-WiMax devices by 2012, and almost 200 million using mobile WiMax devices, with some overlap between the two groups. The major semiconductor and equipment makers, with the exception of Qualcomm and Ericsson, are staking out their positions for this emerging sector, while operators' enthusiasm, led by Sprint's and Clearwire's firm commitments in the United States, is rising sharply. Vodafone is looking to WiMAX for some of its newer markets such as the Middle East and Eastern Europe; BT and Telecom Italia Mobile are also showing interest. bdn
