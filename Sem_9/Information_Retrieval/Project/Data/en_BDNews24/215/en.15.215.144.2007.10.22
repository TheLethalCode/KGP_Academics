<TITLE> Ferrari's Todt says right team and driver won </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SAO PAULO, Oct 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ferrari boss Jean Todt said the right team and the right driver took the title after Kimi Raikkonen won the Formula One championship on Sunday. Ferrari's Raikkonen won the Brazilian Grand Prix to finish one point ahead of McLaren pair Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso. It was a remarkable comeback by the Finn, who had trailed Hamilton by 17 points with two races to go. "In a way, I believe in fair things and it was the right team and the right driver which won," Todt told reporters. "In the end, the team did a fantastic job. I always said at the end of every race that it's not over, we still believe we can win it "Kimi has the right mentality and he did what he needed to do for the team," he said. Raikkonen's win came at the end of a stormy season in which McLaren were fined a record $100 million and docked all their constructors championship points over a spying controversy involving leaked Ferrari data. The ruling meant that Ferrari were crowned as constructors champions back in September. However, McLaren's drivers were not penalised. "I'm still very bitter about this unnecessary story which has happened where our main competitor did not have the vision to stop it when they could have done," said Todt. "It is something I could not expect. I did not expect it could exist, I'm maybe a bit naive about these things." Todt did not want to discuss his own future. "I don't think it's the proper moment," he said
