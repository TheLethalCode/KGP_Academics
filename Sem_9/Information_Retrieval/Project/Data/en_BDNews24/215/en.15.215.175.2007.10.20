 Dhaka, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion is set to launch an operation to net the leaders of a drugs cartel involved in the distribution of methamphetamine, commonly known as Yaba. The move follows the arrest of six men Tuesday and Wednesday in the capital's Gulshan and Banani areas, who were allegedly involved in the distribution of the highly potent stimulant. The six have been sent to jail with the investigating officer's appeal pending for remand. A hearing has been set for Oct 22, said sub-inspector Abdur Rashid from Gulshan Police Station. According to RAB officials, one of the arrested men, 34-year-old Mushfikur Rahman, also known as Tamal, was previously arrested by the Narcotics Control Department in 2002 in connection with the controlled substance, although he was subsequently bailed. All of the arrested men are involved in the real estate business, RAB officials said. Major Saidul Islam, RAB deputy director of operations, told bdnews24.com that they hoped that intelligence gathered from the detained men would result in further significant arrests. "We have not managed to get any concrete information yet, although we are hoping for good results in a few days," Saidul said. Police filed a case with Gulshan Police Station against the six under the emergency powers rules. Police also confiscated a white BMW and a red Porche, both carrying the same number plate, during Mushfikur Rahman's arrest. Other arrestees are Dai Khan Bir nicknamed Chiku, 32, Sheikh Ahmed Shafik, 33, Salman Rahim Joyardar, 28, Altaf Akmal Kollol, 33, and Mahmud Al Zubery, 19. All are residents of Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara. In a separate case filed with Gulshan police Thursday, an unidentified woman accused Mushfikur and two others of sexual harassment and inducing her to take methamphetamine, Gulshan sub-inspector Gulshan Ara told bdnews24.com. bdnews24.c
