 MILAN, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed his side's interest in Real Madrid forward Julio Baptista on Tuesday. Galliani was photographed with Real sporting director Predrag Mijatovic earlier in the week and media reports said Real were willing to sell the Brazilian if European champions Milan took out-of-favour forward Antonio Cassano as well. "If Real Madrid accept this offer for Baptista, good, otherwise it won't happen," Galliani told a news conference at the launch of Milan's new home shirt. "I deny that Real have asked us to take Cassano too." Baptista, who scored in Brazil's Copa America final win over Argentina this month, has struggled at Real and spent last season on loan at Arsenal. Galliani was quick to play down rumours that the future of Milan playmaker Kaka was also discussed with Mijatovic. Madrid have had several huge bids rejected by Milan. "Predrag is aware that he can no longer ask me about Kaka. The boy will stay with us for the next four years," he said. Kaka may soon be joined by another Brazilian after Galliani sent an official to South America to try to secure a deal with Alexandre Pato, who shone for Brazil at the recent Under-20 World Cup in Canada. Rivals Inter have also expressed an interest in the teenage forward. "If we succeed with Pato then great, otherwise life goes on," added Galliani, who has been under pressure from fans after failing to add to Milan's squad so far in the close season
