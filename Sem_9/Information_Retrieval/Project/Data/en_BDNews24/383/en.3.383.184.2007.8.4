 WASHINGTON, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US Agriculture Department on Saturday said it has banned pork and pork products from Britain due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease on a farm west of London. The United States had already restricted all live ruminants, such as cattle and sheep, and their products from the United Kingdom due to bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or mad cow disease. However, this ruling adds swine meat and by-products to the prohibitions. "Immediately, USDA is placing restrictions or prohibitions, depending on the type of product and level of processing, on all UK products derived from any (Foot and Mouth Disease) susceptible species. This includes any products already en route to the United States," said Andrea Morgan, an official with USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. British authorities set up a 3-km radius (1.7 mile) exclusion zone and a wider 10 km (6.2 miles) surveillance area around the infected farm in the county of Surrey. Movement of all pigs, sheep and cattle throughout the country for trade or other purposes was banned as a further precautionary measure. Foot-and mouth-disease is a highly contagious viral disease of cattle, swine, and other animals. It can not be transmitted to humans. Britain had an outbreak of foot and mouth just six years ago when more than six million animals were slaughtered, many of them burned on huge bonfires. Britain accounts for just a small percent of US pork imports.
