 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka and its surrounds in the central regions of the country are seeing floods turning worse although the northern districts saw flood waters receding, a regular Flood Forecast and Warning Centre bulletin said Sunday. FFWC assistant engineer Md Abul Bashar said, "The Buriganga waters rose 10 cm in the preceding 24 hours and the trend is likely to continue through the next three days inundating fresh areas in the suburbs and surroundings of the metropolis." Balu, Turag, Sitalakhshya and Tongikhal, four of the five rivers running through and around Dhaka, saw increases in their water levels by 5 to 18 cm and were now flowing 35 to 50 cm above the danger marks at different points, the forecast said. A number of rivers in the Brahmaputra basin are flowing below the danger level, though. Other rivers are retreating as well. The bulletin said waters of 13 rivers were flowing above the danger level at 21 points. As the Padma and the Dhaleshwari waters were swelling, new areas of Manikganj, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Nawabganj and Dohar upazilas of Dhaka were facing imminent inundation, the forecast said. The swirling Meghna waters put Narayanganj, Narsingdi, Gazipur, Kishoreganj and Brahmanbaria districts at risk of flooding. Of the rivers in the Brahmaputra basin, the Brahmaputra waters receded 19 cm in the past 24 hours and were flowing 12 cm above the danger mark at Chilmari point. The Jamuna water level registered recessions of 17 cm, 11 cm and 4 cm at Bahadurabad, Sirajganj and Aricha points to flow 33, 94 and 121 cm above the red marks. The old Brahmaputra waters receded at Jamalpur but swelled at Mymensingh point to flow only 5 cm above the danger mark at both points. Of the Dhaka contiguous rivers, the Balu river swelled 7 cm at Demra point, the Sitalakhshya waters increased 5 cm at Narayanganj, the Turag swelled 6 cm at Mirpur and the Tongikhal waters swelled 18 cm at Tongi point to flow 39, 44, 36 and 48 cm above the danger levels. Excepting the Padma, other rivers in the Ganges basin were reported to have been flowing below the danger marks. The Padma receded 4 cm at Goalanda point but rose 1 cm at Bhagyakul and was still flowing 145 cm and 110 cm above the danger levels at Goalanda and Bhagyakul points. Almost all rivers in the Meghna basin receded in the last 24 hours. The Surma was flowing 57 cm and 17 cm above the danger levels despite receding 18 cm and 14 cm at Kanaighat and Sunamganj points in the last 24 hours. The Kushiara receded 8 cm and 3 cm at Amalshid and Sheola points in the last 24 hours and were flowing 9 cm and 22 cm above the danger marks.
