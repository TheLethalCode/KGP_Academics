 ATHENS, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greece has revised a school history book that enraged the Greek Orthodox Church, Cyprus and historians with what they said were toned down versions of Greek suffering at the hands of Ottomans and Turks. The book for 11-year-olds, which was introduced to schools last year, was given a thorough revision after suggestions from senior academic bodies, Culture Minister Marietta Giannakou told reporters on Thursday.

The church also said the book failed to highlight its role during the 1821 Greek revolution against the Ottoman empire. Cyprus' Education ministry had also rejected the book, mainly because it called the island's division and subsequent failed peace talks as the "Cyprus issue" rather than the commonly used "Cyprus problem." Cyprus has been split since 1974, when Turkey invaded in response to a Greek-inspired coup in Nicosia. "We did our duty when we handed in our objections in writing," Church of Greece spokesman Father Timotheos said. "Now we will have to see what changes have been made.
