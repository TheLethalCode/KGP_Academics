 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Around 2,000 Pakistani tribesmen rallied in North Waziristan on Friday calling on the government to withdraw troops from the restive region, known as a safe haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants. Holding black flags and wearing black arm bands, the protesters chanted "Down with America" and demanded the government stop what they called unnecessary military operations in the region bordering Afghanistan. "The government says it has sent troops to Waziristan to maintain peace and order but in fact the peace of the region has deteriorated since the army was deployed here," Qari Mohammad Roman, an imam of a major mosque of Miranshah, North Wazirista's main town, told protesters. "Military operations are being conducted here to appease America. We are not scared of America. We are ready to confront it." Pakistan's lawless tribal belt along the Afghanistan border is infested with militants and Islamabad is under growing pressure from the United States to step up action against violent Islamic radicals there. Some U.S. officials and politicians have even suggested there could be American strikes against militant targets in Pakistan. Administration officials say Washington is prepared to act on its own, but only if the intelligence is certain -- a condition some privately acknowledge to be unlikely. "If we had perfect knowledge about the location of al Qaeda... then of course we wouldn't hesitate," Nicholas Burns, U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs, told C-SPAN this week. President Pervez Musharraf, an important ally in the U.S.-led war on terrorism, has rejected calls for American military action inside Pakistani territory. Speaking to ministers and parliamentarians from the ruling coalition on Thursday night, Musharraf said Pakistani forces were fully capable of dealing with militants and did not require foreign help, the official Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Analysts say unilateral U.S. action could pose too great a risk for Musharraf, experiencing the weakest period in his eight-year rule after the reinstatement of the country's top judge, whom he had tried to sack, and a growing militant backlash after an army assault on Islamabad's Red Mosque, a radical Islamist bastion, last month. Government officials say 102 people died in the mosque assault. More than 200 people, mainly police and soldiers, have since been killed in a spate of militant bomb and suicide attacks across Pakistan, mainly in the northwest. Adding to the deteriorating security situation, the militants scrapped a peace pact with the government in North Wazirisiatn last month. North Waziristan had been relatively calm since the peace deal was signed in November but clashes between security forces and militants have intensified in recent weeks. On Friday, militants opened fire on a security forces convoy after it hit a roadside bomb in North Waziristan. "The security forces returned fire and four militants were killed," an intelligence official told Reuters. There were no reports of casualties from the government forces' side, he added. The security forces said they killed 18 militants in the region on Tuesd
