 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue (NBR) has asked banks to freeze accounts of 32 people including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, husband Dr MA Wazed Mia, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy and daughter Saima Wazed Putul. Bank accounts of Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana, her husband Dr Shafiq Siddiqi, Bangabandhu Memorial Trust, Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and Grenade Victims Welfare Fund also came under the freeze. The tax administrator in an August 1 letter also ordered commercial banks to suspend the accounts of former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar and his 15 family members, former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo and former vice chancellor of Bangbandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Prof Md Abdul Hadi. The NBR in another letter asked banks to send information on accounts of 33 people including Hasina, her family members and former foreign minister M Morshed Khan and his family. bdnews24.com has collected copies of the letters issued by Central Intelligence Cell of the NBR on August 1. "We have ordered a freeze on of some bank accounts and asked for account information of some persons," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told bdnews24.com Friday. The NBR move came in line with the ongoing drive against corruption and tax dodge initiated after the emergency government took the reins in early January. The NBR blocked the accounts of Hasina after the Anticorruption Commission asked Hasina and her archrival former prime minister Khaleda Zia to send accounts of their assets. The latest move raised the number of individuals who have had their bank accounts frozen to some 400. Chief of all banks received the orders to suspend current accounts, savings accounts, term deposits, foreign currency accounts, credit cards, vault or locker, and all types of savings instruments, held individually or jointly. Bank accounts of former trade union leader Mollah Abul Kalam Azad, cconservator of forest in Sylhet Lashkar Maksudur Rahman and his family members were in for suspension. The other NBR letter directed banks to send account information of Hasina and her family members, Bangabandhu Memorial Trust and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum. The national exchequer has ordered for account information of former foreign minister M Morshed Khan and seven members of his family including his son Faisal Morshed Khan were also sought. Banks have been ordered to divulge information on the accounts of forest official Tapan Kumar Dey and his family members, Seasons Sweater Ltd's managing director Motiur Rahman Chowdhury, its four directors and a shareholder. Bangladesh Bank has also asked banks to send account information of 199 people, including Joy, a senior official said Thursday. Supreme Court lawyer barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud, former BNP lawmaker Mosaddak Ali Falu, Jamuna Group chairman Nurul Islam Babul, controversial businessman Gaisuddin Al Mamun, and former Awami League minister Mohammad Nasim are among others. The central bank directed banks to send account information of Mahmud by August 5. The banks face the August 8 deadline for the remaining 198 people. "We have asked banks to check whether those people have any account," an official with the central bank told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. bd
