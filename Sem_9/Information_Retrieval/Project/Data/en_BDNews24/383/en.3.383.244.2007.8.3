 LONDON, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Pakistan prime minister Benazir Bhutto will fly home later this year to contest parliamentary elections despite the risk of arrest, her spokesman in London said on Friday. "Next month or the following month Ms Bhutto will be travelling to Pakistan," spokesman Bashir Riaz said in a telephone interview. Asked if Bhutto, 54, was returning permanently from nearly a decade of self-exile, he said: "Yes, that's what I mean. That's a big event ...

A decision would be made at the end of August on the date of Bhutto's return and where she would land, Riaz added. He said Bhutto was travelling in the United States, where she was not immediately available for comment. Musharraf pushed through a constitutional change in 2002 barring any person from becoming prime minister for a third time, but Pakistani newspapers have reported that could be rescinded as part of a compromise with Bhutto. Many analysts believe Musharraf, who took power in a bloodless military coup in 1999, will have trouble holding onto the presidency unless he can reach a deal with her or other opposition elements to get their suppo
