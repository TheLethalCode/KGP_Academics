 LONDON, August 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A man who suffered severe burns when he allegedly mounted an al Qaeda attack on Glasgow airport in Scotland has died in hospital, British police said on Friday. Kafeel Ahmed, 27, was one of two occupants of a fuel-laden Jeep that rammed into the front doors of the airport on June 30 and burst into flames. There were no casualties in the building and both men were arrested. "We can confirm that the man seriously injured during the course of the incident at Glasgow airport ... has died in Glasgow Royal Infirmary," a police spokeswoman said. Ahmed, who died late on Thursday, had been in hospital since June 30 with 90 percent burns. Police kept the engineer from India under armed guard at the hospital's burns unit. The day before the airport incident, two cars were found in central London with bombs packed with gas canisters, petrol and nails which failed to explode. At least one bomb was to have been detonated by a mobile phone which police recovered. The government said the two incidents were part of an al Qaeda plot and Britain's security alert was raised to "critical", its highest level, for several days. It posed an early challenge for Gordon Brown, who had succeeded Tony Blair as prime minister just days before. Eight people were detained and three of them were later charged with planning terrorist attacks. Several of the suspects were doctors.
