<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  A special court is set to hand down a verdict Monday in a corruption case against BTTB trade union president Firoz Miah and wife Rawshan Ara. Judge Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court-5 housed in the parliament complex set the date for judgement after closing the hearing on July 26. If the charges are proved, the accused are likely to be awarded jail terms varying from three to 13 years, fines and confiscation of illegally acquired assets. Firoz Miah's name appeared on the Anti-corruption Commission's list of 50 graft suspects published on Feb 18. The ACC had asked the suspected politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats and others to submit their comprehensive asset statements within 72 hours of serving the notices. Based on the wealth statements they had submitted, the ACC filed a case against Firoz and Rawshan on charges of suppressing details about Tk 1.36 crore in illegal assets. On June 21, metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque transferred the case to the special court for trial, which framed charges against the couple on July 1. Thirty witnesses testified between July 2 and July 10, but the court did not record statements of three witnesses, including Firoz's son, on objections by the state. Firoz is in jail and his wife is evading arrest. bdnew
