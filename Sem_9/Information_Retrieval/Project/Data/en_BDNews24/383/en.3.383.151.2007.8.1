 Dhaka, August 01 (bdnews24.com) -- A lawyer for detained Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina has asked the Anticorruption Commission if a deputy director can serve notice on a former prime minister to submit a wealth statement, a senior ACC official said Wednesday. ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman told reporters that the notice signed by Hasina's lawyer Barrister Fazle Nur Taposh had been couriered to the commission on July 31. The legal notice claimed that only an ACC commissioner could send a notice to a former prime minister in line with ACC rules. Rahman said the deadline to respond to the legal notice was set for August 5. "We'll discuss the matter at a meeting on Thursday," he said. Hasina's legal notice came after the corruption watchdog asked the Awami League chief on July 17 to submit her wealth statement in seven days from notificationa deadline which was later extended by seven more workdays to August 8. The notice for the wealth statement was signed by ACC deputy director Moabara Khanom. Hasina sent a request to the ACC to help her find details of bank accounts to make the wealth statement, but the commission said in a written reply it was not in a position to do so. The former prime minister, arrested on July 16 in an extortion case, wrote the request letter to the commission through jail authorities Monday. On July 25, Hasina sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bank governor through the jail authorities seeking information about her accounts with different commercial banks. The central bank expressed its inability to give the information saying it was "beyond jurisdiction". The ACC also served notice on former prime minister Khaleda Zia and set her the same deadline. bdnew
