<TEXT>
 KAMPALA, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gunmen on Uganda's Lake Albert attacked a boat operated by Canada's Heritage Oil Corp. early Friday, killing one worker, an army spokesman said. "They came between midnight and 3 in the morning," army spokesman for western Uganda, Lt. Tabaro Kiconco told Reuters. "I can confirm they killed one person on the boat, but we don't have any other details at present." Heritage officials were not immediately available for comment. Kiconco said he thought the gunmen had crossed from the Congolese side of Lake Albert. "We think they were soldiers from the Congolese army. It is not the first time they have crossed to attack us," he said. Canada's Heritage owns two concessions in a 50-50 partnership with UK-based Tullow Oil on Lake Albert's eastern shores in Africa's Great Rift Valley. Between them, they have drilled six wells yielding high quality crude. They estimate reserves of up to one billion barrels.
