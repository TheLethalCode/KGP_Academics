 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has refused BNP chief Khaleda Zia paying income tax on her undisclosed money on the grounds that she did not follow a proper procedure. "She tried to legalise the money without following the process in accordance with the income tax ordinance. She did not even fill out the prescribed form of NBR," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told reporters Wednesday. "She also did not submit income tax returns. In this situation, the means to legalise her undisclosed money is not acceptable," he added. Khaleda's lawyer Ahmed Azam Khan told bdnews24.com Wednesday she had legalised Tk 1.33 crore Tuesday by paying Tk 33.37 lakh in tax. The money was deposited with Bangladesh Bank. "A letter with documents to legalise her undisclosed money was couriered to the NBR. But the papers are all photocopies. This process does not meet the terms and conditions," the NBR chief said. "The NBR can under no circumstances accept the process under which she wanted to make her money legal," an official at the income tax policy department of the NBR said, preferring anonymity. "The income tax law is very tough. Paying income tax in any process other than prescribed is not acceptable under the law," Rahman said: "There was no distinct proof that Khaleda Zia had legalised her undisclosed income. The money she has deposited by pay orders did mention the name of the bank." On former finance minister M Saifur Rahman's legalising undisclosed money, the NBR chief said, "No papers relating to undisclosed money of Saifur Rahman reached the NBR until Wednesday. That is why we cannot say that he has made the undisclosed money legal." The government extended the deadline for submission of income tax returns by individuals holding undisclosed money to another two months to September 30, 2007. bdnews24.
