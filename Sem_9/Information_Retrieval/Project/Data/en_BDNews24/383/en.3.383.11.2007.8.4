<TEXT>
 Bangladesh/politics Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Wazed Joy Friday said the government has frozen bank accounts of his family members to smear them. He said he had opened an account in a Bangladeshi bank in his childhood. "That account might have Tk 10000." "The incident of freeze on the bank accounts proves that the government has not gone after corrupt people. The government is after our family. It wants to malign us," Joy told bdnews24.com over telephone from Washington at 11.45pm. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) in an August 1 letter ordered banks to freeze accounts of 32 former prime minister Hasina, husband Dr MA Wazed Miah, son Joy and daughter Saima Wazed Putul, who also lives in the US. Joy expressed surprise at the order to freeze his account. "I have been out of the country since the age of 13. I have only one bank account which was opened when I was in the country. I don't know either which bank has that account or what the number is." "It's fine with me if the government wants to see what I have, what transactions have been made. I live abroad, have a job," Joy said. He alleged the government was not arresting people who were really corrupt. "This government has let some corrupt people off the hook to have them float a new political party," Joy said. bdnews24.co
