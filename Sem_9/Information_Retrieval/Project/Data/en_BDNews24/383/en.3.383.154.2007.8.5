 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)More than eight million people in 38 districts of the country have been affected by the countrywide floods in last 12 days, with the death toll from floods standing at 120 Sunday evening. With further rainfall forecast throughout the country, the flood situation is likely to deteriorate, disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury and information adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters Sunday. But when questioned by reporters, they said national disaster would not be declared. The advisers said the foreign affairs adviser was meeting with different countries and development partners through different embassies. In the government's first official briefing on the floods, Tapan and Mainul gave reporters a countrywide assessment of the situation at the Chief Adviser's Office Sunday. Before the advisers spoke, Lt Col Razzak of the Armed Forces Division informed reporters of the flood losses, numbers of affected people, river positions, and amount of relief distributed among the flood-hit families and flood forecasts. The two advisers said they and other advisers would soon visit flood-affected areas to form local committees to tackle the flood situation. They would work to face disaster by forming committees with local noted personalities. At present, flood-hit areas have been ordered to supply cooked food where there is no scope to cook, while deputy commissioners have been given directives to conduct relief and rehabilitation work coordinating with local NGOs and interested donor agencies. The advisers called upon the service organisations like Red Crescent to come forward with medicare for the flood victims. Meanwhile, according to the Flood Forecast and Warning Centre, central regions of the country, including Dhaka and surrounding areas, will face further flooding in the next 72 hours. Twenty-six rivers in the country, especially those in Dhaka and surrounding districts, are flowing above their respective danger levels. Although the country's northern districts are seeing water levels recede, Dhaka and its environs are experiencing worsening flood conditions, as the floodwaters are heading south. Surging waters have marooned about 50,000 people in Sabujbag, Khilgaon and Demra. In some areas, the scarcity of pure water, food and shelter is acute. Local people fear an outbreak of water-borne diseases. Floodwaters have reached the road to Rampura from Jatrabari behind Kamalapur Railway Station. Local people and rickshaw pullers said floodwater has started submerging the area. Vast areas behind Bashabo have been flooded. Floodwaters have submerged Nandipara Bazar. The road leading to Trimohini has been submerged at many points. Local people in these areas said the water level is rising and new areas are being flooded. As houses are being submerged people have taken shelter on rooftops and bamboo platforms. One local resident of Demra, one of the worst hit areas of Dhaka, said: "The area is flooded every year, but this year's situation is worse even than in 2004." Another local told bdnews24.com that most of the people of the area have left their houses for safer places. Those who have remained are living on bamboo platforms. The crisis of clean drinking water is acute there. Executive engineer of the Water Development Board Saiful Hasan told bdnews24.com, the situation in eastern parts of Dhaka would deteriorate. He said the Buriganga would cross the red level in a day or two, and of the five rivers flowing through the adjoining areas of Dhaka four are flowing above their respective danger marks. The FFWC also confirmed that the Balu, Turag, Sitalakhshya and Tongikhal rivers saw increases in their water levels and were now flowing 35 to 50 cm above the danger marks at different points. As the Padma and the Dhaleshwari waters were swelling, new areas of Manikganj, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Nawabganj and Dohar upazilas of Dhaka were facing imminent inundation. The swirling Meghna waters put Narayanganj, Narsingdi, Gazipur, Kishoreganj and Brahmanbaria districts at risk of flooding. In the rest of the country, however, water levels in the country's three major river basinsof the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna riversare tending to recede to below the danger mark. Other rivers are retreating as well. A number of rivers in the Brahmaputra basin are now flowing below the danger level. Excepting the Padma, other rivers in the Ganges basin were reported to have been flowing below the danger marks. Almost all rivers in the Meghna basin have receded in the last 24 hours. bdnews24.com/corr/wz/b
