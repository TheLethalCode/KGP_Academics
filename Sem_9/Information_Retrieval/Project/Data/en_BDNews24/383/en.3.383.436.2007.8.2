 BAGHDAD, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber drove a car bomb into a police station on Thursday, killing 13 people and wounding 15 in the town of Hibhib, north of Baghdad near Baquba, police said. A police source said the attacker struck a queue of recruits lined up to join the police force in the town. The dead included six police and seven civilians. The attack followed a day of major strikes in Baghdad, in which suicide bombers killed more than 70 people. Hibhib is in Diyala province, the area north of the capital which has been a focus of a US offensive over the past two months after Washington dispatched extra troops to Iraq and spread them out in neighbourhoods within Baghdad itse
