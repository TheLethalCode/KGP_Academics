 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  The prize giving ceremony of the recently concluded B. League will be held Sunday at the auditorium of the National Sports Council (NSC) Tower. Army Chief General Moeen U Ahmed, also the NSC chairman, is scheduled to handover the B. League title to champions Abahani Limited. The popular sky-blue outfit, Abahani, will receive Tk 5 lakh, runners-up Mohammedan SC get Tk 3 lakh along with the trophies. The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) had a plan to organise a gala ceremony at Hotel Sheraton, but later they dropped the idea to shift their programme to the NSC to donate the saved money to the Chief Adviser's relief fund for the flood- affected people. "The BFF has already handed over TK 5 lakh to the Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) for donation to the Chief Adviser's relief fund," said BFF media manager Sayeed Al Fattah. The decision was taken at an executive committee meeting of the BFF held Saturday at BFF House in Motijheel. The BFF discloses the best booter of the B. League among five players; Nazrul Islam, Wali Faisal, Jahid Hossain Amily of Abahani, Jahid Hossain of Mohammedan and Mohammad Robin of Farashganj SC, selected by the sports reporters' votes. The BFF meeting Saturday has decided to start the school football league on August 25 as well as the women's football championship on September 1. The Bangladesh women's football team will play five matches against the Orissa women's team of India in Dhaka, Chittagong and Rangamati this month, the meeting decided. It also decided not to allow foreign players in the senior division football league, which might start after Ramadan.
