 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  A train on trial run, Moitree Express, reached Dhaka from Kolkata Wednesday after two days of official talks about the launch of passenger rail services between the two neighbouring cities. The train reached Dhaka Cantonment station at 6.50pm after it had left Kolkata at 7:00am Bangladesh time, said railway additional director general Quazi Asadullah. The Bangladesh officials had held talks with the Indian officials in Kolkata on the launch of the passenger train services. The train, which went to West Bengal Sunday, made its follow-up trip after an Indian train had visited Bangladesh on July 08. Indian and Bangladesh officials could not reach a consensus on the Indian proposal for constructing a fence along the border for the 'safety' of the trains. The officials referred the thorny issue to the higher authorities for a solution, two officials told bdnews24.com seeking anonymity. Asadullah said the two sides moved closer to opening the services and a formal date would be decided later by the two governments. The officials have agreed to initially run two trains, one from Bangladesh and the other from India, every week, he said. The trains will run Saturday and Sunday, he said, adding that the number of trains will increase upon better infrastructure in future. A train will leave Dhaka for Kolkata Saturday and it will travel back from Kolkata Sunday. Similarly, another train will leave Kolkata Saturday and will go back Sunday, he said. On July 8, a 32-member Indian delegation came to Dhaka for the first round of their discussions. The fares for Dhaka-Kolkata single journey have been fixed at $8, $12 and $20 for different classes. bdnews24.com
