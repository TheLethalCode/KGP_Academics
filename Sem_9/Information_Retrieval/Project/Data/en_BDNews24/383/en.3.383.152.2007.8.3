<TITLE> Russia gives Belarus one week respite in gas row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Belarus avoided a cut in Russian gas supplies on Friday by partly repaying its debt to Moscow, but Russia kept the pressure on by warning Minsk it must pay up in full within a week or face punishment. "The next deadline is Aug. 10 at 1000 (0600 GMT)," Sergei Kupriyanov, the spokesman for Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom told Reuters Television. The previous deadline had been set for 10:00 (0600 GMT) on Friday. Gazprom had said it would halve supplies to Belarus, which owes it $456 million, if the debt was not settled by then. Belarus gas pipeline firm Beltransgas said in Minsk it had made an initial payment of $190 million. Gazprom's threat sent jitters across Europe as it echoed previous disputes between Russia and its neighbours -- Belarus and Ukraine -- which caused gas and oil supply cuts to Europe in the past three winters, underlying the continent's heavy dependence on Russian energy. Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko, branded by the United States as Europe's last dictator, promised on Thursday to repay the debt but accused Russia of trying to privatise all of the Belarussian economy. He has alleged that Russia is using the gas debt to pressure Belarus into selling its most profitable industrial assets to firms like Gazprom. A delegation from Belarus rushed to Moscow on Thursday evening and talks continued throughout the night until Gazprom said it had received the first tranche of debt payment and would postpone gas cuts. "We see real steps from the Belarussian side to settle the debt problem. So we decided not to cut today. But we expect a full debt repayment as well as payment in full for new supplies," said Kupriyanov. Gazprom has told European customers it is ready to use alternative routes to ensure steady supplies, and that it will take legal action if Belarus siphons off gas from transit pipelines. Analysts said any potential supply disruptions to Europe would be limited, as gas demand is relatively low in the summer and Gazprom can pump more gas westward via Ukraine.
