 MEXICO CITY, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A woman in Mexico City kept the body of her dead husband by her bedside for a year until neighbors, disturbed by the smell, called the police. Police broke down Mercedes Velarde's door on Tuesday and found the putrefied body of her husband Edmundo on the floor of her bedroom. Authorities said on Wednesday they were investigating Velarde's claim her husband died of natural causes. They believe the man, in his early 60s, had mental problems that may have been linked to his death. Local media reported that Velarde's son regularly helped remove worms infesting his father's body. Police could not confirm the reports but said her two adult children knew their mother was keeping the body. The family is being examined by a psychiatrist. After an autopsy, the family could face criminal charges or be sent to a psychiatric hospital. Authorities said hiding a dead person, even a family member, is a crime. "Yes, these people have psychological problems, (but) they hid a corpse. Even if it is a family member, they committed a crime," Veronica Sanchez at the Mexico City attorney general's office told Reuters.
