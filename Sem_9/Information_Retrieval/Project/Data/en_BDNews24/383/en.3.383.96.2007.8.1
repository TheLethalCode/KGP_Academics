 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks Wednesday shrugged off the fallout from the Securities and Exchange Commission directive that suspended the financial adjustment facility for quality or 'A' shares. A surge in cement, power, insurance and bank shares powered the rally. The SEC Tuesday suspended the financial adjustment facility, a system which had earlier allowed investors to buy a share from the proceeds of another share without waiting for four day of its settlement. The market moved up in midday trade and fell amid profit-taking. It however ended fairly above the previous day's level. Turnover dived. "The market is moving toward stability. I hope it is possibly heading towards further buoyancy," said Yawer Sayeed, chief of AIMS of Bangladesh that manages about Tk 700 million in funds. Sayeed observed that the prices of issues were increasing against a limited supply of quality shares. Insurance, power and cement sectors ended higher. Bank, pharmaceuticals and mutual funds finished mixed. In early trade, Dhaka Stock Exchange halted the spot trade of some companies after the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited failed to run a day-end cycle needed to settle transactions. MH Abdus Samad, CDBL chief executive, said that a nearly two-hour delay in processing prompted the DSE to halt the trading. "They (DSE) have halted the trading as a precautionary measure," the CDBL chief said. "Increased corporate actions and trading have caused the delay," he told bdnews24.com. The bourse, however, resumed trading on the spot market after midday trade. The DGEN or general index added 9.32 points or 0.41 percent to 2394.11.

The DSE-20 blue chip index slumped 32.65 points or 1.48 percent to 2159.62 due to price adjustment of Islami Bank shares. A total of 136 issues added, 47 fell and 10 remained unchanged. Turnover fell to Tk 929.80 million from Tuesday's Tk 1.16 billion. The CASPI or all shares price index on the Chittagong Stock Exchange and CSE Selective Categories Index closed higher.
