 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is unsure if she can submit an accurate wealth statement to the Anticorruption Commission by the August 6 deadline, according to her lawyer. "Bangladesh Bank has declined to assist her. That's why she is unsure about providing an accurate wealth statement," her attorney Ahmed Azam Khan said to bdnews24.com Wednesday. The central bank has declined to volunteer any information about potentially unknown bank accounts in Khaleda's name. "Khaleda Zia is expected to submit her wealth statement to the ACC on August 6 or 7," he said. The former prime minister has claimed political supporters may have opened bank accounts in her name without her knowledge. The ACC served notice on the BNP chief on July 18 asking her to submit a wealth statement within seven days from the receipt of the notice. The commission pushed back the deadline by seven days to August 6 on an appeal by the former prime minister. "The former prime minister took advantage of the government's offer of legalising untaxed money. She paid Tk 33.37 lakh to legalise Tk 1.33 crore," the lawyer said. "The former prime minister has respect for the law of the land. She served the country for long periods as prime minister." "Khaleda wants the nation to know what her assets are. That's why she intends to submit an exact account of all her possessions," Khan said. "Preparation of an asset list is underway. She owns moveable and immoveable assets worth around Tk 2.5 crore. Whether the list will be added to or not will be known by August 6." "Khaleda owns two houses, one on Shahid Mainul Road in the Dhaka Cantonment and another in Gulshan." Khan added: "The government allocated the houses for a nominal price following the death of her husband former president Ziaur Rahman." "In addition, she has a 10 decimal plot of land in Savar, which Ziaur Rahman purchased. The BNP chairperson does not own any property abroad." The former prime minister has three vehicles registered in her name, a Nissan Patrol and two Toyotas, registered during the 1991 elections and are together valued at Tk 48.64 lakh. "The initial statement declared several FDRs (fixed deposit receipts) and savings certificates valued at about Tk 65 lakh. These were purchased between 1980 and 1986," he said. bdnews24.com/s
