<TITLE> No politics, please, over floods: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)  Information adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday said there had better be no attempts to make political gains from disastrous floods. "No conscientious person should now be using the flood issue for political gains," the adviser told reporters at the Cabinet Division. The adviser said politicians should help the victims on humanitarian grounds. Asked if the government would permit former prime minister Khaleda Zia to visit the flood-stricken areas, he said, "I don't think anyone would stop her doing so." Mainul said the government had decided to run relief operations in an integrated and coordinated manner following reports of mismanagement in relief distribution. "Measures to form local committees for better coordination have been adopted and if necessary the advisers will go from district to district to help form effective committees," Mainul said. He called people across the broader social spectrum to help out flood victims. "The floods have already assumed devastating proportions. The marooned multitudes are somehow managing to live on as sub-human beings. "All citizens including politicians should come with whatever they can muster as succour to assist the distressed." bdnews
