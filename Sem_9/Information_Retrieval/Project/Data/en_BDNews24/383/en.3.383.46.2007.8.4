 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Class-VIII student Bobita Khatun bagged 11 gold medals to lead Bangladesh Ansar to emerge champions in the Keya Cosmetic 23rd National Age Group (Under-20) Swimming Championship concluded at the Mirpur National Swimming Complex Saturday. It was the first age group title in 12 years for Ansar, who last clinched the title in 1995. The government's organisation bagged a total of 100 medals -- 46 gold, 28 silver and 26 bronze. Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) became runners-up grabbing 84 medals -- 27 gold, 40 silver and 17 bronze -- losing their six consecutive titles to Bangladesh Ansar. Rajshahi Alamgir Swimming Club finished third with 25 golds, nine silvers and 16 bronzes. Eleven swimmers  10 girls and one boy -- clinched all 46 gold medals for the Ansar team, composed mostly of swimmers from the village of Amla under the Mirpur Thana of Kushtia from where the national swimmers like Rubel Rana, Karar Samidul, Labani Akhter Jui, Safura Khuan came. Bobita, elder daughter of a farmer, was adjudged the best swimmer among girls with her 11 gold medals in 13 events in which she took part in the 15-17 age group. It was the second national meet for her, who in the last edition bagged 11 sliver and two bronze medals. Nazma Khaun, neighbor of Bobita, also bagged five gold medals in the under-10 group setting up four new national records while Arifa Khatun and Rozia Khatun each captured six gold medals in the 11 to 12 and 13 to 14 groups. Jewel Ahmed, swimmer of the same village, bagged nine gold medals in the boys' 13 to 14 group to lead Bangladesh Ansar to championship. "It was possible for a three-month intensive camp at a pond of Amla village as we earlier got only 35 to 40 days to be prepared," said Ansar chief coach Emdadul Haq. "Besides, the organisation gave the proper support providing the allowances to all the swimmers," said Haq adding that they want a swimming pool at Amla village. Mohammad Al Amin, a BKSP class-IX student, was named the best boy swimmer, who got nine gold medals out of 10 events in which he took part in the 15 to 17 group. Al Amin, who had his head injured by the trophy covered with the glass during the celebration, said that the intensive training helped him bag nine golds after the boy grabbed only one gold in the last edition. BKSP coach Mohammad Solaiman said, "The new rule of restraining the national championship medal holders from the age group championship put us in the backfoot as most of our junior players bagged medals in the last national championship." "So, we had to fight with only 18 swimmers who were mainly backbench players," said Solaiman. Some 59 district sports associations and clubs took part in the three-day meet and 42 of them finished without any medal.
