 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Top leaders of four leftist parties Thursday criticised the present reform measures undertaken by the caretaker government. "The government has to get to the bottom of corruption to wipe it out," said Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Worker's Party. "It's not possible to stop looting and corruption in a free-market economy," he said. Menon was accompanied by leaders of the Communist Party of Bangladesh, the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal, Workers Party and Samyabadi Dal, who voiced similar complaints against the government's reform plans. The delegation spoke to reporters at Zia International Airport Thursday, after their 11-day visit to China. The leaders asked the government to ignore prescriptions by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and to go for more comprehensive reforms that will yield better results for the country. The 16-member delegation held meetings with senior officials from the Chinese foreign ministry and other agencies in China. Menon said: "A huge process of reform is taking place in China. But those reforms are in line with the Chinese character." Regarding Chinese thinking on the current situation in Bangladesh Menon said: "China is an old, tested friend of Bangladesh." "They have never interfered in the past with the internal affairs of the country and they did not make any comment about it this time either," he said. JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu said: "China is following Grameen Bank's ideas on microcredit to reduce poverty. They commended Bangladesh for the initiative." "Reforms are also being carried out in China in line their own models. Reforms in our country should also be achieved in our own way," he said. During their stay, the delegation travelled to the Chinese province of Ningzia and visited Islamic institutions in the capital, Inchuan. bdnews24
