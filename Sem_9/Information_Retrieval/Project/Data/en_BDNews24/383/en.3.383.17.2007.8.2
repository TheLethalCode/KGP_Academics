<TITLE> Advisers won't be asked for wealth info: ACC chief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)  Anti-corruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Thursday said they would not ask the advisers to give wealth information for fear of misunderstanding. He spoke of his lack of interest in a regular news briefing at the ACC's Segun Bagicha office. Hasan Mashhud, who himself was an adviser to the Iajuddin Ahmed-led caretaker government, believed that misunderstanding might arise if the advisers were given notice to submit their wealth statements. He said the advisers were conscious people who could come up with their wealth information on their own. "I think they should submit account of their wealth of their own." ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman was present in the briefing. The secretary usually makes the regular briefing and the chairman joins it once a month. Hasan Mashhud also responded to questions about former prime minister Sheikh Hasina seeking ACC cooperation in her submitting wealth statement and raising questions over the eligibility of the signatory of the ACC notice to her. "There is no reason for anyone to be interested or concerned about her lawyer's notice. This is a legal battle and it will be dealt with under law." He alleged that Hasina was engaging the ACC in a legal battle instead of submitting a wealth statement. "The legal battle will be death with by law. However, we will wait until August 8, the deadline for her to submit a wealth statement. If we do not receive the statement by the deadline we will take legal steps." He said they were going to 20 more cases. Investigation into a good number of cases had been complete and charges would be pressed soon. The ACC boss said that 13 cases were on trial in the five special judge's courts and the number of courts would be increased, if necessary. He said the ACC's activities were somewhat centralised, which would be spread to the grassroots level soon and for this, initiative had been taken to increase manpower. The composition had already been approved and the commission would recruit its own manpower. On the ACC not serving notice on the so-called pro-reform politicians, the ACC boss said, "To us there means nothing as pro-reform or otherwise. Don't involve us in politics. We are doing our work independently. "However, it is also true that five months are not enough to clear the mess of 35 years. More time will be needed to eliminate corruption." Hasan Mashhud said it was not the job of the commission to try to bring back corruption suspects who had fled the country. The organisations or offices responsible would take initiative. However, those still on the run should prove their innocence, he said. bdnew
