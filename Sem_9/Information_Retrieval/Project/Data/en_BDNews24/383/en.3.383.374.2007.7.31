 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  The police were not found guilty of 'maltreating' former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on the day of her arrest, a senior police officer said Tuesday, referring to a probe report. A committee that probed the allegations of maltreating Hasina on July 16 submitted its report to the Police Headquarters, additional police commissioner for Dhaka Moniruzzaman told bdnews24.com. Moniruzzaman who led the probe team said the police were not found guilty. After allegations surfaced against the police, inspector general of police Noor Mohammad said he had formed the committee to probe the allegations. A police officer, asking not to be named, said the officers who were on duty on July 16 gave their statements to the probe committee. Investigators watched video footages and pictures of Hasina before they had reached the conclusion, the officer said. "We don't have any proof of maltreating Sheikh Hasina," the officer said. Two other members of the committee are assistant inspector general of police Zahirul Islam and deputy police commissioner for Dhaka Abdul Malek. Hasina's lawyers had raised allegations of the maltreatment when she was taken to court after arrest from her Sudha Sadan home. Hasina's lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru visiting her in the special jail on the Sangsad Bhaban complex on July 20 claimed that she had complained of maltreatment during the arrest. In a statement, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia said Hasina deserved better as former prime minister than "what she had experienced". bd
