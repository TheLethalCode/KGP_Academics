 PATNA, India, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fears grew on Sunday that epidemics would strike the millions marooned or forced from their homes by South Asia's catastrophic floods as the death toll climbed to at least 330, and criticism of relief efforts spread. The last two weeks have seen some of the worst flooding in living memory affecting about 35 million people in the region, 10 million of them made homeless or left stranded. In India's poor Bihar state, four air force helicopters dropped food, medicines and clothing to some of the 10 million affected, where floods have worsened as more rivers burst banks. "Each pilot is carrying out 12 sorties a day and they have reported huge devastation in central and north Bihar," said Ramesh Kumar Das, a Defence Ministry spokesman in Kolkata. Marzio Babille, UNICEF's health chief in India who is coordinating UN work in Bihar, said aid agencies and authorities must do more to prevent outbreaks of measles, gastroenteritis, dengue fever and other diseases, or "we will see many deaths". He said 20 helicopters were needed in Bihar, where 87 people have died. "The scale is massive, the challenge is enormous for the government and those who are helping," he said in Patna, Bihar's capital. Hundreds of thousands are camped out on elevated highways, railway tracks and field embankments as deep floodwaters swirl around them. Annual monsoon rains are a mixed blessing, vital for farmers but killing hundreds every year. This year much of eastern India and two-thirds of Bangladesh have been inundated. The Indian government says more than 1,100 people have died in this year's monsoon, not including all the latest casualties. Babille said in the 15 days to Aug. 2, 90 cm (35 inches) of rain had fallen in Bihar's worst affected areas, compared to annual average rainfall of 1.3 metres. UNICEF is mobilising doctors by land and boat and is immunising children against measles. Those who were reached on Sunday showed their desperation. "I have been dividing one small piece of bread among four of my children, and I have been starving and somehow surviving," a sobbing Siraj Ahmed told a local television reporter in Bihar. In the eastern Indian state of Assam, where up to 3 million people took refuge in emergency camps or were cut off in their villages, receding waters and soaring temperatures fed concerns of disease outbreaks as villagers returned to their homes. "We are really worried about the outbreak of an epidemic in Assam now," Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi said, but locals said the state government was not doing enough. "While we never expect a perfect government, the Chief Minister should have at least taken the trouble to visit the flood-affected areas," Sanjiv Nath, a teacher, said by phone. In neighbouring Orissa and Uttar Pradesh 39 people have died since Saturd
