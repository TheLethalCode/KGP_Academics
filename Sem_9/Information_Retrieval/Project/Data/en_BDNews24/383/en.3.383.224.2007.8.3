 Savar, August 30(bdnews24.com)  Nearly 400 workers of a readymade garment factory in the old EPZ of Savar Friday fell sick after having lunch at the factory. bdnews24.com's Savar correspondent said nearly 300 sick workers were admitted to the Savar Gonoshasthya Hospital, Savar Enam Medical Hospital and the BEPZA hospital in the export processing zone. A doctor at the Gonoshasthya Hospital said the sick workers crammed nearly three floors of the 5- storey facility. Some workers of Lenny Fashion said the chicken they had eaten for lunch supplied smelled foul. They said some workers began throwing up and others became unconscious. Lenny Fashion assistant superviser Shamsul Huq told bdnews24.com that a caterer 'Kalmilata' had begun supplying food for the workers three days ago. The caterer had supplied substandard food on the first day and factory authorities were told about it, he added. A deserted 'Kalmilata' was found locked after the incident, Huq said. Lenny Fashion, owned by a Hong Kong businessman, employs nearly 3,500 workers. bdnews24.
