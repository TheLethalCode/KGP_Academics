 NEW YORK, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks were little changed on Thursday as news of a mortgage lender in trouble renewed credit market worry and offset positive earnings reports. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a subprime lender in the process of being sold, raised concern about its ability to stay in business, sending it shares down more than 20 percent. For details, see ID:nN02211411. But shares of CVS Caremark Corp. rose after the pharmacy chain posted profit that topped Wall Street's expectations. ID:nN02455502. The stock led gains on the S&P 500 index. "If you take a step back and look at fundamentals, they've actually improved in this shake-out," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. "Equities are getting more attractive on a valuation basis, courtesy of the drop in long-term interest rates, the rise in profits and weaker stock prices." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.51 points, or 0.15 percent, at 13,381.88. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 2.29 points, or 0.16 percent, at 1,468.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.73 points, or 0.30 percent, at 2,561.60. Earnings news has been overshadowed recently by worries about the global credit squeeze and its impact on stocks, especially mortgage and financial companies, leading to several whipsaw sessions over the past few days. Accredited shares fell 22.4 percent, to $6.38 on the Nasdaq. Stocks trimmed gains after a government report showed new orders at U.S. factories rose less than expected in June. Stripping out the the volatile transportation sector, the index fell slightly. Viacom Inc., owner of MTV Networks, Paramount movie studios and Nickelodeon cable channels, reported profit, excluding items, that topped Wall Street's estimates. For details, see ID:nN02189086. Shares of Viacom were up 3.5 percent to $39.33 on the NYSE.
