 Dhaka, July 31 (bndews24.com) - Chittagong Stock Exchange Tuesday sought help from bdnews24.com in its efforts to attract more domestic and foreign investors to the capital market. The CSE made the call for assistance from Bangladesh's first online newspaper at a meeting in the CSE's office in Agrabad in the port city of Chittagong. Listed brokers of the bourse were present. CSE's chief executive Abu Bakar Siddiqui and bdnews24.com's director for operations Nizam Mohammad Uddin spoke among others. Nizam Uddin assured CSE officials of extending all cooperation. "We'll be able to reach updates to non-resident Bangladeshis in Europe and the United States," he said. Nasir Ahmed Chowdhury, CSE's first vice chairman, who chaired the meeting, said he believed that bdnews24.com would be able to provide investors with market information. "We feel Bangladeshi expatriates need updates on the capital market. Despite a lot of efforts, we have failed so far," he said. bdnews
