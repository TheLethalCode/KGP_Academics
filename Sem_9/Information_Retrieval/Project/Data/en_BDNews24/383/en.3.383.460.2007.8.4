<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  The garments sector is passing through a hard time because of soaring prices of yarn on the international market and floods in the country, the sector's leaders have said. The prices of yarn have increased by up to 22 percent pushing the prices of textiles up on the international market over the past one and a half months. The factory owners said their production cost increased by at least 15 percent over the period since they hugely depend on imported fabrics. Garments workers are in hardship since raging floods waters submerged many areas around the capital. Many of their homes and roads are under water in the affected areas. The factory owners said the production was being hampered because many workers are facing trouble to regularly join work. If the floods worsen in coming days and linger, the sector will be in big trouble, the industry leaders said. Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury, president of Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said Friday that the sector had long been suffering from power shortage, high interest of bank loans and many others. "The production cost has increased over the past one and a half months. But we are supplying products to our buyers at the previous rate," Chowdhury told bdnews24.com. "The output is being hampered because many workers are not able to come to work. We don't know what will happen if the flood worsens." He claimed about 450 factories have closed over the past five to six months because they could not overcome the hurdles through which the industry is going. Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, echoed Chowdhury. Hoque said the floods have already engulfed many areas in Savar, Gazipur and Narayanganj, creating hurdles for the workers. "The forecast says the situation will worsen. Both the woven and knit sectors will face tremendous problems if it happens so," he said. The country's garments sector earns about $10 billion in exports a year, and employs about two million workers, mostly women. bdn
