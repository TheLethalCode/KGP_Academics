 Smita Mishra bdnews24.com Correspondent Guwahati, August 1 (bdnews24.com) A fresh wave of Bangladeshi-bashing has begun in Assam, with even a section of the ULFA separatists and an NGO joining in. The All Assam Students Union, which led the violent movement against the so-called illegal Bangladeshi migrants between 1979-85, is leading the charge again. More than 3,000 people died in the conflict, 1,600 of them poor Muslims of the Bengali origin, who were butchered in a cluster of villages around Nellie in February 1983. The AASU leadership has asked for detection and deportation of all illegal post-1971 Bangladeshi migrants from Assam by the end of this year. Leaders of the ULFA's 28th battalion, Prabal Neog and Jiten Dutta, have also told local newspapers and websites they want all "Bangladeshis" to leave Assam by September. However, the central leadership of the United Liberation Front of Assam is silent on the issue, giving rise to speculations that they are either powerless to control the 28th battalion which has emerged as the most powerful rebel faction or they are unwilling to risk unpopularity. Now a powerful civil society group, Assam Public Works has expressed solidarity with the AASU and asked all illegal immigrants to return to Bangladesh by August this year. The NGO has also served an ultimatum to the All Assam Minority Students Union asking it to apologise to the Assamese community within two days for making certain controversial remarks about "infiltration", which stirred up great hostility in the state against the minority students. Assam Public Works has branded the All Assam Minority Students Union as an agent of fundamentalist forces within Bangladesh, demanding that the government ban the student body and arrest all its members. "We ask all the AAMSU members and supporters to leave Assam and go to Bangladesh," says Bitu Talukdar, secretary of Assam Public Works. Meanwhile, the NGO has also slammed the Assam United Democratic Front for its tilt towards the Bangladeshis. "Assam is going through a critical juncture on account of the Bangladeshis and we are going to wholeheartedly support all the steps taken by the AASU against the illegal immigrants," Talukdar says. The NGO's leaders allege that the ULFA, which started as a anti-immigrant organisation, is now silent on the issue because its central leadership is sheltered in Bangladesh. Both the ULFA and Bangladesh stridently deny that this is the case. Coming down heavily on the state government for being too lenient towards the influx of Bangladeshis into Assam, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morchayouth wing of the BJPhas called upon all citizens of Assam to lend a hand in detecting illegal foreigners residing in the state. In a recent statement issued to the media here, BJYM student leaders have claimed the state government had harassed law abiding citizens whenever they raised a voice against the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. They cite the example of an SMS campaign against illegal Bangladeshis that caught the popular imagination in the state. The campaign was peaceful and democratic, say BJYM, but the police later harassed those who were involved. The BJYM says it fully supports local AASU activists who assisted the police in rounding up hundreds of suspected Bangladeshis who tried to sneak into Assam after being chased out of Arunachal Pradesh by students and the local authorities there last month. The police investigation into the nationalities of these persons remains inconclusive. The hostile attitude spreading from the Assamese student and political groups to civil society has created panic in minority areas. "We don't shelter illegal immigrants but we will have to protect genuine local Muslims," says Hafiz Rashid Choudhury, general secretary of the Assam United Democratic Front. The party, led by Badruddin Ajmal, has ten seats in the state assembly. "Their ancestors may have come to Assam several decades ago, but they are Indian nationals," Choudhury says. bdne
