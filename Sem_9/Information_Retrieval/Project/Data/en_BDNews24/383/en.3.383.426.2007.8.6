 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The Hiroshima Day will be observed Monday in many parts of the world with special memory, vigils and peace marches. The day is held to commemorate thousands of people killed instantly as the nuclear bomb fell on the Japanese city. The day is also remembered for the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Three days later a second bomb fell on the city of Nagasaki. As the world marks the 62nd anniversaries of the droppings of the nuclear bombs, radiation from those two bombs continues to cause cancers, mutations and birth defects that are still being documented. The nuclear weapons destroyed both the cities, killing an estimated 200,000 people by the end of 1945. The Little Boy was code name of the first nuclear weapon used in the world War II. It exploded approximately 1,800 feet over Hiroshima, Japan, on the morning of that day, with a force equal to 13,000 tons of TNT. Immediate deaths were between 70,000 and 130,000. The bomb was dropped from a B-29 bomber aircraft piloted by American Army Air Force Colonel Paul W. Tibbets. Tibbets had named the plane Enola Gay after his mother the night before the atomic attack. Various organisations in Bangladesh including Bangladesh Cancer Foundation Hospital, Trust (BCFH) have drawn up programmes. The foundation will hold a special discussion meeting at its Lamatia hospital premises where Director of the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital (NICRH) Professor A M Shariful Alam will be present at the chief guest. Dr Manzur Kader and Professor Habibullah Talukder will present the keynote speeches. Former prime minister and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in a message said, "On that day after the bombings it shook the world. People sought peace and prosperity and the world is still looking for peace on earth." "Everybody wants a peaceful world and at the initiative of the United Nations we are trying to establish peace," she said. bd
