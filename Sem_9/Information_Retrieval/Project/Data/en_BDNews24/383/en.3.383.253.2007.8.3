 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday snubbed chairperson Khaleda Zia for her recent comments that he was plotting to break up the party in the name of reforms. He told reporters at his Gulshan home in the afternoon that the comments were "unwanted and unexpected". Bhuiyan hoped his chief would no more make such remarks if the party was to remain united. Khaleda in teleconferences with the expatriate leaders and workers of the party in last two months and the E-uor-u-w-co Chhatra Dal leaders from Kanchpur in Chandpur Tuesday night came down hard on Bhuiyan. She described him as a left leader who did not believe in God and who had abandoned ideals. He said preparation for the party council was in progress. "The flood has hampered work to some extent. After completion of the primary preparation we will go to the party chairperson for permission to hold the council." Bhuiyan also placed a six-point recommendations before the government to better tackle the floods and asked all to cooperate with the government to face flood. The recommendations include moving flood-stricken people to shelters and providing them with pure drinking water, food and medicare. He suggested preparation of aman seedbeds, collection of seeds of alternative crops, introduction of VGF card and test relief, and arrangement of agricultural loan on easy conditions as post-flood rehabilitation measures. "The government will have to take go all out to get over the flood losses. The farmers must be given seeds, fertilisers and other agricultural inputs." The BNP secretary general said since there was no scope to stand by the flood victims in an organised way due to the state of emergency, people would have to get by their side at their own initiatives. bdnew
