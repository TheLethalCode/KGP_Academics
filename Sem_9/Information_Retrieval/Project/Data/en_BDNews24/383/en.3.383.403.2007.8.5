<TITLE> Malouda relishes Drogba partnership at Chelsea </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Florent Malouda believes he can form an instinctive and lethal partnership with Didier Drogba at Chelsea thanks to memories of two years together in France. Winger Malouda, a 20 million euros ($27.42 million) signing from Olympique Lyon, is set to play his first meaningful game for FA Cup holders Chelsea in the Community Shield clash with Premier League champions Manchester United at Wembley on Sunday. He expects to be on the save wavelength as striker Drogba, who played alongside the Frenchman earlier in his career. "We played together for two years at Guingamp," Malouda told a pre-match news conference. "It was not a very long time but we also used to play against each other when he was at Le Mans and I was at Chateauroux. I have known him for a long time. "I remember every time Chateauroux played Le Mans we won -- but he scored. So I knew the striker at that stage and then we played together and I got to know the other side of the player, the outside. I got to know his family and he met mine. "From that moment, we started to be close as friends. We supported each other in good times and also in bad moments. We have the same vision of life." That shared experience should benefit Chelsea because Malouda expects to form an almost telepathic relationship with his friend on the pitch. "I expect that because we have the same vision of football too," he added. "I know which balls he likes played to him. Everybody knows the way he plays with his head but I know he also likes the ball played to his feet." Malouda hopes his partnership with Drogba can earn him a regular starting place, confounding those who say he will be used only sparingly by manager Jose Mourinho this season. "I'm here to play every game," he said. "It was the same when I arrived in Lyon. There were a lot of people, international players, world champions, ahead of me and they told me the same thing. But in every club I've been at I've proved I can play every game.
