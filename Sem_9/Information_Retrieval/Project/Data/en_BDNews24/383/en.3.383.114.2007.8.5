<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 05 (bdnews24.com)Local government advisor Anwarul Iqbal Sunday asked all political parties to support the country's flood victims by sending aid to district committees for disaster management. Speaking at a DCC seminar, the adviser said: "They (politicians) can go anywhere if there intention is to aid the marooned people. But it is easily understandable that it is meant for publicity if they go with their banners." The advisor made these comments at the DCC seminar on mosquito eradication. Also speaking at the seminar was Dhaka City mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka. Speaking of the flood situation in Dhaka, the mayor said: "We do not need to set up camps for the flood affected, the situation is not that bad." On the subject of the seminar, Iqbal said the only way to prevent dengue fever is to raise public awareness. On controlling the mosquito population in Dhaka, the mayor said it was possible to clean the garbage from the streets but not from people's homes. On other DCC matters, Iqbal also promised that the pay raise for DCC commissioners would be effective in two weeks and that a three-member panel would be formed to keep the system up and running in the mayor's absence. The current DCC laws state that the mayor must give a written statement in handing over his charge. bdnews24
