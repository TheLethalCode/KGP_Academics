 KARACHI, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa have asked the Pakistan Cricket Board to revise their tour programme, which includes two tests and five one-day internationals, due to the security situation in Pakistan. Pakistan Cricket Board sources told Reuters on Thursday that South Africa had expressed concerns over playing in Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP). "They have asked for a revision in the itinerary including a second look at the venues. They are not comfortable with Peshawar," said one PCB source.

He added their could be a special security protocol in place for Australia and South Africa because of the situation. But PCB Chairman Nasim Ashraf told reporters in Karachi the Australia and South Africa tours would be held on schedule. He added that the interior ministry and Punjab police were handling the security arrangements and there was no cause for concern on the part of touring sid
