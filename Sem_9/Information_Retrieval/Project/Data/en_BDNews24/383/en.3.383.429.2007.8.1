<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) -- The Appellate Division hands down a verdict Thursday on a government appeal against the High Court bail to detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. The appeals court Wednesday wrapped up a full-court hearing on the government appeal that sought to scuttle the bail for the Awami League chief, who was arrested on July 16. The nervous legal battle raged over the government's decision to take the extortion case under the cover of emergency powers rules. A six-strong bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin heard both sides before deciding the day for the ruling. On July 30, the High Court granted Hasina bail in the Tk 3 crore extortion case and stayed proceedings of the case under the emergency powers rules. The court gave the government two weeks to explain why the extortion case would not be excluded from the jurisdiction of the emergency powers rules. In the hour-long hearing that began at 9:25am Wednesday, attorney general Fida M Kamal told the court that Hasina's writ petition was related to the emergency powers rules. So it was beyond the jurisdiction of the High Court issuing a bail order without clearing the case from the jurisdiction of the rules, he said. At the same time, Kamal argued, the High Court could not ask the government to halt the trial of the case under the emergency powers rules. The court asked the state counsel to say when the incident of the alleged extortion occurred and when the case was filed. The attorney general said the incident took place in June 2000 and the complainant, Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, filed the case on June 13 this year with Gulshan Police Station. Kamal said the High Court gave the verdict on Hasina's petition a day after it was filed. He said his office got the copy of the writ petition on the day the verdict was delivered. He argued that the High Court could have avoided giving its verdict, as the "logic of seeking remedy for the accused" was not strong. "But the court not only gave its ruling but also granted Sheikh Hasina bail and stayed the case proceedings under emergency powers rules," he said. The AG also explained the emergency powers rules and said a case is non-bailable once the government takes it under the emergency powers rules. The court then asked him who could give such approval. Kamal said the government has the powers to give approval, considering the public importance of a particular case. The court said crimes that disrupt security of the state and people and halt economic activities will come under emergency powers rules, not all crimes. Moreover, there is a timeframe about the crimes that can come under cover of the rules, the court said. The AG said the writ petition had sought explanation of the emergency powers rules but the High Court gave its ruling without giving the explanation. When the court asked the AG if the government had received a copy of the High Court rule, he said it would take four to five days. Kamal then said the government would file a regular appeal with the Appellate Division after getting the copy of the verdict. He later requested the court to stay the HC verdict until the government files a regular appeal. Hasina's lawyer barrister Rafique-ul Huq said: "She (Hasina) won't be free to leave prison even if she gets bail, as she has been shown arrested in another case. More cases will possibly be filed in the meantime against my client." Huq opposed the demand of the top state counsel for staying the High Court verdict. Then the court fixed Thursday for delivering its decision on the High Court verdict. Justice Mohammed Hasan Amin of the Appellate Division Tuesday held a partial hearing of the government's appeal and set Wednesday for a full-court hearing. The Appellate Division chamber judge did not stay the High Court order on the bail and the freeze on proceedings of the extortion case. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury granted bail Monday to the former prime minister who has been detained in the extortion case from July 16. bdnews24
