 SEOUL, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's farm ministry said on Thursday it suspended quarantine inspections of U.S. beef and could ban imports if Washington does not step up safeguards, a move which could put a sweeping bilateral free trade deal at risk. Unauthorised animal parts, including vertebrae, have been found in U.S. beef shipped to South Korea, just as the United States pushes for a full reopening of what once had been the third-largest overseas market for its beef. "South Korea will decide whether to ban U.S. beef imports after seeing if Washington takes sufficient measures. We will ban it if the measures are not enough," Kim Chang-sub, an agriculture ministry official, told reporters. The discovery of the unauathorised animal parts is another blow for the U.S. meat industry, which has been anxiously awaiting full access to the lucrative South Korean market that has been restricted since late 2003, when mad cow disease surfaced in the United States. U.S. beef returned to South Korean store shelves in July after it reached a deal with the United States in September in 2006. South Korea had agreed to partially reopen its market to U.S. beef from cattle less than 30 months old on condition that parts Seoul deemed risky, such as bones, were not included. U.S. lawmakers have said they may not approve a free trade deal, the biggest for Washington in some 15 years, if Seoul does not completely open its market to U.S. beef. The South Korean agriculture ministry said it found spinal material in a box of an 18.7-tonne shipment of U.S. beef imported on July 29. The beef from a Cargill plant has been returned and Seoul has banned beef from that plant, Kim said. South Korea has found bones and chips in other shipments, which led it to suspend imports from certain packers and return the product. Last week, a South Korean animal quarantine committee held off on a decision to open the market wider to include U.S. beef on the bone, with members saying they were not sure if U.S. packers could abide by safety rules Seoul deems necessary. South Korean consumers have shown they want U.S. beef, which sells for about half the price of similar cuts of the domestic product, by quickly snapping up American meat at supermarkets. But farmers and activists, a key voting block for a presidential election this year, have been pressing for go slow. The United States once accounted for more than two-thirds of South Korea's beef imports, or about $850 million a year of products. It is also hoping Japan, traditionally the top market for U.S. beef exports, will increase the age limit of meat imported to 30 months from 20 months or younger currently. The lower age rule has greatly restricted the volume of U.S. beef supplied to Tokyo.
