 JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday it could attend a Middle East peace conference proposed by U.S. President George W. Bush which would bring the key Muslim country to the same table as Israel. But Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said his country would only consider attending the meeting if it tackled "substantive matters of peace". Saudi Arabia was the main mover behind an Arab peace proposal made at an Arab summit this year which offers Israel full diplomatic ties with the 22 Arab countries in return for a withdrawal from Arab territories occupied in 1967. However Israel and its US ally have said Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia who do not have ties to Israel should involve themselves in talks with the Jewish state as a goodwill gesture.

Arab foreign ministers gave a qualified welcome to the US idea of a Middle East peace conference, though Syria objected saying it could betray the Palestinian cause. They said the conference must include all parties concerned, must aim to revive negotiations between Israel and all its neighbours and must be based on previous peace talks.

The Saudi-promoted Arab peace plan calls for Israel to withdraw from land captured in 1967, including Arab East Jerusalem, the creation of a Palestinian state and a "just solution" for Palestinian refugees. Rumours of secret meetings between Saudi and Israeli officials have swirled over the past year but Saudi Arabia has said publicly it will not offer Israel "normalisation" of ties before a final peace deal. Breaking Saudi barriers to contact would be a major diplomatic coup for Israel, because of the prestige Saudi Arabia wields as home to Islam's holiest shrines. But Riyadh will be wary of opposition from clerics and Islamist activists. Al Qaeda militants launched a campaign to topple the US-allied monarchy in 2003 and Riyadh fears that Saudi militants fighting in Iraq could return to wreak hav
