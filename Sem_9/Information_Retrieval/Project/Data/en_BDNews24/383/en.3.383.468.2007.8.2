 GHAZNI, Afghanistan, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea and the United States agreed on Thursday not to use force to free 21 Korean hostages in Afghanistan, but Afghan troops warned of a possible offensive in the area where the captives are held. The Taliban kidnapped 23 South Korean Christian church volunteers, 18 of them women, in Ghazni province, southwest of Kabul, two weeks ago and later killed two of them. The hardline Islamist guerrillas have threatened to kill the rest unless their jailed comrades are freed. South Korean Foreign Minister Song Min-soon and US Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte met on the sidelines of a regional security forum in the Philippines on Thursday. "They agreed that both countries will not use any kind of force," a South Korean diplomat said. The body of Shim Sung-min, 29, the second South Korean hostage to be shot, arrived home on Thursday. His family said it would donate his remains for medical research. The remaining 21 hostages were still alive, but two of the women were seriously ill and could die, a Taliban spokesman said on Wednesday, again warning they all might be killed if the Afghan government did not free insurgent prisoners. The government has refused to give in to the demand, saying that would only encourage further abductions. The Taliban have also warned that any attempt to rescue the hostages by force would put the captives' lives at risk. Army helicopters dropped leaflets in several districts of Ghazni province on Wednesday warning residents to move to secure areas to avoid casualties during an operation to be launched in the "coming weeks", the Afghan Defence Ministry said. But the ministry said it was a routine operation not linked to the kidnapping. Any rescue operation would be fraught with danger as the Taliban have split the hostages into small groups and are holding them in several locations in the mainly flat but lush region. KOREAN DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE The South Korean government is under intense pressure to bring the captives home, but has no power to meet the key Taliban demand -- the release of rebel prisoners. South Korean presidential envoy Baek Jong-chun was in Pakistan for talks with Pakistani officials on Thursday, a South Korean presidential official said. Baek is due in Seoul on Friday after nearly a week in Afghanistan trying to free the hostages. But an aide to Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said he had no knowledge of Baek being in Pakistan and a spokesman said there was no scheduled meeting with the president on Thursday. United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, himself a South Korean, called Musharraf seeking his help to free the hostages. Ban "was told that Pakistan had no links with the Taliban, no contacts", said presidential spokesman General Rashid Qureshi. Afghan officials have accused Pakistan of secretly supporting Taliban rebels in Afghanistan, a charge Pakistan strongly denies. A Korean embassy official in Afghanistan also said he was unable to confirm media reports of planned face-to-face talks between a Korean delegation and the Taliban. Eight South Korean parliamentarians left for the United States to persuade Washington to help end the stand-off. They said they hoped to speak to U.S. and UN officials "to appeal for the quick and safe return of our people in Afghanistan". Seoul has called for "flexibility", a comment analysts say is directed at the United States to sway the Afghan government to strike a deal with the kidnappers. Washington insists it makes no concessions to terrorists. But lawmakers are hoping the United States might make an exception and help an ally that sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. A German engineer and four Afghans kidnapped a day before the Koreans are still being held by the Taliban, who are demanding Germany withdraw its 3,000 troops from Afghanistan. Berlin flatly rejected the demand. One German seized with the group was later found shot de
