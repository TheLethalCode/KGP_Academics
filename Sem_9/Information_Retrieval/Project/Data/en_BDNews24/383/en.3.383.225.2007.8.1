 NEW YORK, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks ended lower on Tuesday, led by declines in computer and financial shares. Escalating concerns about the subprime mortgage market were among factors that soured sentiment and erased earlier gains. All three indexes also ended the month of July lower, with the S&P 500 booking its worst monthly percentage decline since July 2004. For the month, the Dow was down 1.5 percent, the S&P was down 3.2 percent and the Nasdaq was down 2.2 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 146.32 points, or 1.10 percent, to end unofficially at 13,211.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 18.64 points, or 1.26 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,455.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 37.01 points, or 1.43 percent, to close unofficially at 2,546.
