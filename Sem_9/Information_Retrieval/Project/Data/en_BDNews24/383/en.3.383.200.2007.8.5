<TITLE> Rajuk seeks bidders to complete Rangs demolition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)Rajuk is set to float a tender to complete the demolition of the controversial Rangs Bhaban, a top official said Sunday. The work to raze the upper 16 floors of the 22-storey structure will continue for the present in a go-slow fashion. The drive will gather steam after a firm is appointed through bidding to finish the work. Rajuk chairman KM Harun told bdnews24.com Sunday night: "We are going to invite bidders for the job to finish the rest of the work properly. We have sent tender invitations to newspapers to publish. We hope they will come out tomorrow (Monday)." Public works secretary SM Rashidul Hai said: "I had a meeting with Rajuk officials to assess the demolition work." The decision for inviting tenders was made as the complete demolition job will be costly and require specialised equipment, he said. Rajuk won a legal battle in the Supreme Court with the Rangs Bhaban owners regarding the building's construction without proper approval. The city developer Friday morning moved to demolish the major structures of the building. bdnews24
