<TITLE> Rice in West Bank to support Abbas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Aug 2 (Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited the West Bank on Thursday in a show of support for President Mahmoud Abbas and a renewed push for Israeli-Palestinian peace after Hamas's takeover of Gaza. The top US diplomat, who met Israeli leaders on Wednesday, closes a four-day trip to the Middle East during which she won tacit Saudi backing for a proposed peace conference later this year. But analysts are pessimistic about Rice's new push, coming at a time when the Palestinian territories are divided between Islamist Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip in June, and Abbas's secular Fatah whose forces dominate the West Bank. The Bush administration has just 17 months left in office and despite labelling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict a priority, its most pressing concern is Iraq and mounting domestic pressure to bring US troops home. But Rice, who met Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in the West Bank city of Ramallah ahead of talks later in the day with Abbas, has made clear she has faith in the Fatah leader and says he is empowered to negotiate on behalf of all Palestinians. "We do have in the Palestinian territories a government that is devoted to the international principles, the foundational principles for peace and this is an opportunity that should not be missed," Rice said. There is concern that, by allying himself so closely with the United States, Abbas will be seen as Washington's puppet. The likelihood of successful negotiations is also dampened by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's unpopularity with his own voters. Olmert told Rice during dinner on Wednesday that Hamas had to be "kept out of the game" as Israel explores new cooperation with the Palestinians. The United States is pushing for both sides to start tackling more prickly issues, such as the possible borders of a Palestinian state. Abbas would like to negotiate so-called final status issues -- including the future of Jerusalem, borders of a Palestinian state and the right of return of refugees -- but the Israelis are balking at such a broad commitment at this stage. Israeli officials have spoken instead of formulating with Abbas "agreed principles" for establishing a Palestinian state. One senior Israeli government official said Israel was prepared to begin discussing border issues in general terms with Abbas, but saw the fate of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees as too sensitive for the time being. "We're willing to move forward on borders. The government is willing to discuss that," the official said. Rice was set to sign a framework agreement with Fayyad's government to provide US funding for Abbas's security forces. The agreement outlines terms and conditions under which the money can be used. A senior official travelling with Rice said the funding was part of about $80 million promised by the Bush administration to reform the security forces. An initial amount of about $10 million would be handed over, he said. The US Congress has in recent months held up funding for Abbas's security needs, fearing the money could reach the wrong hands. During her visit, Rice has also been trying to harvest support for a US-proposed Middle East peace conference, though the date and venue are not known and its mandate is unclear. A senior US official said it would most likely be held after mid-October because of Ramadan and a string of Jewish holidays throughout September and early October. Saudi Arabia, which does not have diplomatic relations with Israel and has shunned contacts in recent years, has said it could attend the conference if "substantive" issues were covered there. A senior State Department official declined to say what conditions Saudi Arabia had attached to attending, but described the initial Saudi response as encouraging. "They have not said yes, they have not said no," he added.
