 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday made a passionate plea to the people to stand united in the face of the countrywide floods. Updates with more details "Let all of us come forward with whatever we have to face the floods. Let us stand by the flood victims, imbibed with the spirit of serving humanity and patriotism," he said in an eight-minute address that was broadcast to the nation at 9pm Sunday. The chief adviser said the disaster provided an opportunity for national unity. "Our people have always showed resilience in the face of calamity," he said. "I firmly believe that as in the past, this time also we will be able to combat the floods unitedly." He said the cooperation of allmilitary and civilianwas required to effectively tackle the floods. Mentioning that a national disaster management council and an inter-ministerial coordination committee have already been formed, the chief adviser said responsibilities have already been distributed among the advisers to continue flood relief and rehabilitation work. He urged those who want to contribute to the relief work to donate to the chief adviser's relief fund or to contribute to the relief funds formed in different areas. He said if the development partners want to contribute to the flood relief and rehabilitation activities they are welcome to do so. Fakhruddin said the present government is committed to the people. He said the government has taken coordinated steps in all sectors for combating the flood situation, and that alongside the civil administration the armed forces were playing an important role in the flood relief efforts. The chief adviser regretted that the prices of essentials have gone up in response to the floods. He urged local businesses to demonstrate their social responsibility in this regard. Mentioning that 60,000 acres of cropland have been damaged, Fakhruddin said an agricultural rehabilitation programme would be implemented after the floods retreat. The chief adviser said the floods have damaged 75 embankments, and 60,000 homes have been partially damaged while 92,000 have been completely destroyed. He said that 1,175 shelter centres have been opened in the flood affected areas of 38 districts. He said medical teams are working at district and upazila levels. More than eight million people in 38 districts of the country have been affected by the countrywide floods in last 12 days, with the death toll from floods standing at 120 Sunday evening. With further rainfall forecast throughout the country, the flood situation is likely to deteriorate, disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury and information adviser Mainul Hosein had told reporters earlier on Sunday. But when questioned by reporters, they said national disaster would not be declared. The advisers said the foreign affairs adviser was meeting with different countries and development partners through different embassies. In the government's first official briefing on the floods, Tapan and Mainul gave reporters a countrywide assessment of the situation at the Chief Adviser's Office Sunday. Before the advisers spoke, Lt Col Razzak of the Armed Forces Division informed reporters of the flood losses, numbers of affected people, river positions, and amount of relief distributed among the flood-hit families and flood forecasts. The two advisers said they and other advisers would soon visit flood-affected areas to form local committees to tackle the flood situation. They would work to face disaster by forming committees with local noted personalities. At present, flood-hit areas have been ordered to supply cooked food where there is no scope to cook, while deputy commissioners have been given directives to conduct relief and rehabilitation work coordinating with local NGOs and interested donor agencies. The advisers called upon the service organisations like Red Crescent to come forward with medicare for the flood victims. Meanwhile, according to the Flood Forecast and Warning Centre, central regions of the country, including Dhaka and surrounding areas, will face further flooding in the next 72 hours. Twenty-six rivers in the country, especially those in Dhaka and surrounding districts, are flowing above their respective danger levels. Although the country's northern districts are seeing water levels recede, Dhaka and its environs are experiencing worsening flood conditions, as the floodwaters are heading south. Surging waters have marooned about 50,000 people in Sabujbag, Khilgaon and Demra. In some areas, the scarcity of pure water, food and shelter is acute. Local people fear an outbreak of water-borne diseases. Floodwaters have reached the road to Rampura from Jatrabari behind Kamalapur Railway Station. Local people and rickshaw pullers said floodwater has started submerging the area. Vast areas behind Bashabo have been flooded. Floodwaters have submerged Nandipara Bazar. The road leading to Trimohini has been submerged at many points. Local people in these areas said the water level is rising and new areas are being flooded. As houses are being submerged people have taken shelter on rooftops and bamboo platforms. One local resident of Demra, one of the worst hit areas of Dhaka, said: "The area is flooded every year, but this year's situation is worse even than in 2004." Another local told bdnews24.com that most of the people of the area have left their houses for safer places. Those who have remained are living on bamboo platforms. The crisis of clean drinking water is acute there. Executive engineer of the Water Development Board Saiful Hasan told bdnews24.com, the situation in eastern parts of Dhaka would deteriorate. He said the Buriganga would cross the red level in a day or two, and of the five rivers flowing through the adjoining areas of Dhaka four are flowing above their respective danger marks. The FFWC also confirmed that the Balu, Turag, Sitalakhshya and Tongikhal rivers saw increases in their water levels and were now flowing 35 to 50 cm above the danger marks at different points. As the Padma and the Dhaleshwari waters were swelling, new areas of Manikganj, Munshiganj, Madaripur, Shariatpur and Nawabganj and Dohar upazilas of Dhaka were facing imminent inundation. The swirling Meghna waters put Narayanganj, Narsingdi, Gazipur, Kishoreganj and Brahmanbaria districts at risk of flooding. In the rest of the country, however, water levels in the country's three major river basinsof the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna riversare tending to recede to below the danger mark. Other rivers are retreating as well. A number of rivers in the Brahmaputra basin are now flowing below the danger level. Excepting the Padma, other rivers in the Ganges basin were reported to have been flowing below the danger marks. Almost all rivers in the Meghna basin have receded in the last 24 hours. bdnews24.com/corr/wz/bd/a
