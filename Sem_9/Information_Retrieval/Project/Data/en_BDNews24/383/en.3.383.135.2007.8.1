<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com)  The overhauled Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has decided to widen the search for a national cricket coach. It will interview Australians Jamie Siddons and John Hermer, and Zimbabwean Dave Houghton, the three short-listed coaches apart from others, said a BCB official Wednesday. "We would interview those three coaches, who were short-listed by the immediate past committee, along with other ones for the national team," new media committee chairman Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby told reporters after emerging from the first meeting of new ad-hoc committee Wednesday. "After a scrutiny, we would try to appoint a skilled coach for the national side," said the cricket organiser without saying anything about when the national coach would be appointed. The Fakhruddin Ahmed-led emergency government Sunday appointed a 12-member interim committee, head by Major General Sina Ibn Jamali, after the en masse resignations of the elected committee on July 25. Apart from Selim Bhuiyan and Salman Ispahani, all members of the committee were present in the meeting, chaired by Jamali at the BCB management office in Gulshan. Bobby said the meeting had decided to appoint development coach Shaun Williams and former national cricketer Tanzib Ahsan Saad as managers for the upcoming Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa. The meeting also formed 17 standing committees and a six-member working committee, led by member Syed Fahim Munaim, also press secretary to the chief adviser. "It may not be possible to convene board meetings in case of emergencies and keeping this in mind the working committee has been formed to run the board smoothly," explained the media committee chairman. The other members of the working committee are Lt Cor (rtd) Abdul Latif (vice chairman), members Shafiqur Rahman Munna, Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, Salman Ispahani and Bobby. Lipu was named chairman of both cricket operations and Cricket Committee of Dhaka Metropolis while Munna was pickled as the chairman for the grounds and facilities committee. The meeting also formed a three-member selectors appointment committee, headed by Munna, which would find two more selectors as the tenures of chief selector Faruque Ahmed and Athar Ali Khan expire on August 31. The board Monday extended the tenures of Faruque and Athar for one month after their contracts ended on July 31. bdnew
