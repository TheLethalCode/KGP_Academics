<TITLE> Khaleda leaves BNP unity at stake, Ashraf says </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) Khaleda Zia's latest teleconference with her student wing activists inflamed feelings among party reformists that it could strain unity in the BNP. The BNP chairperson Tuesday talked to Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists in Chandpur in a teleconference where she took a dig at the so-called reformists. Khaleda had told her followers: "My family and I have been targeted by conspirators." BNP joint secretary general Ashraf Hossain said Thursday his party leader's efforts were unexpected. "The words chosen by the chairperson during the teleconference are likely to sabotage party unity and solidarity," Hossain told reporters after meeting BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan home. "Such comments from the party leader are unwanted. We all want a strong and united BNP," he said. "We didn't unveil the reform proposals to rid anybody. We simply want to free the party from the restraints of autocracy and family dynasty." "Khaleda is the party leader, but her comments regarding the secretary general are entirely unwarranted." "Khaleda Zia made Bhuiyan secretary general. It was because of her support that he has been serving in that capacity for the last 11 years." "No-one will believe what Khaleda Zia said about Bhuiyan." Ashraf told reporters that preparations were underway for a party council where the reform proposals would be finalised. "Draft proposals have already been dispatched to councillors nationwide," he said. "The council will finalise everything." bdnews24
