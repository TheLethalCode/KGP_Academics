 Martyn Warwick London, August 1 (bdnews24.com) -- A new 212-page report, "Governing the Internet" from the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe (OSCE) a 56-nation strong body says that restrictions on the use of the Internet by individual governments and state bodies is continuing to rise and even accelerate and is eroding freedom of expression and thought. The constant policing and control of the Web is described in the report as "a bitter reminder of the ease with which some regimes  democracies and dictatorships alike  seek to suppress speech that they disapprove of, dislike, or simply fear." The report adds that, "Speaking out has never been easier than on the Web. Yet at the same time we are witnessing the spread of Internet censorship." The OSCE singles out for particularly virulent criticism the governments of Kazakhstan, Georgia and Malaysia, and also lambastes the powers that be in other parts of the world, including Belarus, China, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Tunisia, Uzbekistan and Zimbabwe. The chief of the OSCE's media freedom office, Miklos Harazti, says there are more than 25 countries that routinely and oppressively impose blanket censorships whilst many others around the globe have passed "needlessly restrictive legislation and government policy" to censor their citizen's access to the Internet. The report says that the attitude of the authorities in Kazakhstan, where almost every avenue to getting at information on the Web is blocked in the catch-all name of "national security", is exactly the same sort of repression that was practiced in the Soviet Union during the reign of the dictator Stalin. In Kazakhstan, those behind blogs, personal pages and web sites not to the liking the authorities are subject to criminal as well as civil law and country's information minister, Yermukhamet Yertysbayev, says he will personally purge all Kazakh sites of "dirt" and "lies." The minister recently stated, "Those who think it is impossible to control the Internet can continue living in a world of illusions." The OSCE says Kazakhstan's attitude to the Web has resulted in a "hostile atmosphere where any dissident individual, organisation or an entire country could be named as an 'enemy of the nation.'" The report adds that the determined maintenance of a state monopoly in the provision of internet access and the outlawing of competitive ISPs is also designed to limit any broadband access to the ruling elite whilst leaving a very slow an limited dial-up service as all that the general mass of the population are allowed to use. As for Georgia, the report says, the former Soviet state has passed laws with "contradictory and ill-defined" provisions "that could be, and are, used illegitimately to curtail "freedom of expression on the Internet." Turning its attention to Malaysia, the report points to remarks made only a few weeks ago by a government official who announced that new laws are to be drafted to "police and manage blogging sites" and that the authorities "will not hesitate to prosecute those deemed to have insulted Islam or government ministers." In summation the OSCE says, "It is important to support the view of the World Press Freedom Committee that 'governance' must not be allowed to become a code word for government regulation of Internet content".
