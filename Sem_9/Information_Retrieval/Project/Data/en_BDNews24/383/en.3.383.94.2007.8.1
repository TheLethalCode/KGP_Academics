 Golam Mortuza Antu bdnews24.com Correspondent, back from Tangail Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)Tangail has been among the worst flood-afflicted districts in the country with the river Jamuna inundating 76 unions out of 101. This year's floods have affected almost every family in Tangail, taking lives, land and homes, while an epidemic of water-borne diseases spreading throughout the district is the latest tragedy to strike. The deputy commissioner for Tangail, Akhtar Ali, told bdnews24.com that about 2,800 families of 76 unions are seeking refuge in a total of 19 available shelters throughout the district. The government has allotted 100 tonnes of rice, Tk 5 lakh in emergency funds and another Tk 1 lakh for house building, which the authorities have begun distributing among the flood affected. But, badly needed medical supplies, especially saline, are not yet being provided. On Wednesday the Jamuna continued to flow 65 centimetres above the danger line. But district authorities are having a hard time keeping a record of the flood damage in the affected areas of Tangail. The flood has so far claimed five lives in the district, according to authorities. On Tuesday, floodwaters swept away a bridge on the Tangail-Suruj-Bolla road in Baruriya, Tangail, taking ten people into the water with it. Police say they have so far found four bodies of the ten, while six people are missing. However, locals informed bdnews24.com that a lot more people are missing that have gone unrecorded by authorities. Kutthiboyra village is one of many that now lie under five feet water. Nazma, Halima and Hanif Sheikh have been on the road with their families for the last three days, living in makeshift homes beside the highway. They have had very little to eat and no prospect of work to earn food since the village went underwater. Seventy-year-old Amina Bewa, along with her daughter Aleya Begum and two grandchildren, was also forced to leave her home as the waters rose over Kutthiboyra. All they could salvage from their flood-battered home were three goats and a few cooking utensils. Aleya explained how they have been left not only destitute, but without any prospect of earning a livelihood in the near future as the entire area is now devastated. "We can only hope and depend on government aid now," she told bdnews24.com. Over 1,000 people lost their homes as the floods devastated the village of Jagatpura in Tangail. Yusuf Ali and his family have lost everything to the Jamuna. The 65-year-old farmer had spent all his life on the banks of this mighty river. He had borne the onslaught of its deluge in the past too. But this time, as the entire village was eroded and sank chunk by chunk into the muddy waters, he could only look on with helplessness. "I suffer to see my five children live on relief food," he says. "It hurts my dignity," he adds. With the weekly handout of 10kg of rice at the temporary shelter, Ali is able to manage only one meal a day for everybody in the family. Countless families throughout Tangail district are facing similar predicaments. Local authorities and members of the joint forces are attempting to mitigate the impact of the flood, but their emergency measures are proving inadequate. The available relief is failing to meet the people's needs. Those marooned by the seas of floodwater continue to facing a crisis of drinking water. The surrounding waters have been greatly polluted by human excreta, with very little open space left around existing emergency shelters. Locals are apprehensive about outbreaks of diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases in epidemic proportions. Abdus Sattar, a member of a school management committee in Arjuna, told bdnews24.com: "Such diseases usually occur when the flood waters start receding." But such diseases are already affecting the flood victims sheltering at the crowded camp, according to Sattar. "The supply of safe water and oral saline must be increased," he stressed. bdnews24
