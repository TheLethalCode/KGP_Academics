 MADRID, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A signed pair of Lionel Messi's boots have been sold for 4,000 euros ($5,514) at an auction in Beijing on Barcelona's tour of Asia, Spanish media reported on Sunday. They were the boots the Argentina forward wore when he scored a goal for Barcelona similar to Diego Maradona's famous solo effort against England in the 1986 World Cup, in the King's Cup semi-final first leg against Getafe in April. Other items of Barca memorabilia auctioned included the shirt France striker Thierry Henry wore at his official presentation in June and a cutting of Brazil forward Ronaldinho's hair. Around 1.5 million euros were raised for disabled children in China. The Primera Liga side are on a nine-day tour of the Far East and will play friendlies in China, Japan and Hong Kong
