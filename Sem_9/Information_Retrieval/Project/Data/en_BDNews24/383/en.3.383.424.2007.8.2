<TITLE> Exiled Pakistan premier seeks court help to return </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif filed a petition in the Supreme Court on Thursday seeking his and his family's return after seven years of exile. General Pervez Musharraf overthrew Sharif's government in 1999 and sent him and his family into exile in Saudi Arabia in 2000. In the petition filed through his lawyer, the ex-premier pleaded for the court to order that the government "not directly or indirectly obstruct, hamper or resist" his return with his family members, including his brother Shahbaz Sharif, former chief minister of central Punjab province. Nawaz Sharif says in the petition Musharraf's government deprived him of his liberty by bad faith acts "in rendering him stateless". Despite his exile Sharif still leads the Pakistan Muslim League, one of the country's major opposition parties. "The Sharif brothers have been deprived of their right to live in their country, but today the judiciary is independent and they (the government) will not be able to violate the court's decision," Muslin League secretary general Zafar Iqbal Jhagra told Reuters. The petition comes at a time when President Musharraf is passing through what is widely seen as the most beleaguered phase of his eight-year rule. He took a bad knock in July, when the Supreme Court ruled against a military leader for the first time in its history and restored a chief justice whom Musharraf had suspended four months earlier. There is also public disquiet over the heavy death toll resulting from a July 10 army commando assault on Islamabad's Red Mosque to crush a militant movement, which has been followed in turn by a spate of militant attacks and suicide bombings aimed mainly at the army and police. Musharraf has been trying to reach a power-sharing pact with another former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, before general elections due later this year or in early 2008. Bhutto, who also still leads an opposition party and is a rival of Nawaz Sharif, is in voluntary exile. Most analysts think Musharraf will have major problems holding onto his post unless he can reach an agreement with her or other opposition elements to get their support. In May 2004, Shahbaz Sharif came back to Pakistan but was deported to Saudi Arabia little more than an hour after he arrived in the eastern city of Lahore. The government has said the Sharifs were sent into exile for 10 years under a deal they agreed to. The details of the alleged agreement have never been revealed, and the Sharifs deny one exist
