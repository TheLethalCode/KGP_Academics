<TITLE> No action against Rangs Bhaban approvers for now: Mainul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)- The caretaker government will not take any action against the RAJUK officials involved in the "illegal" approval of the 22-storey Rangs Bhaban, according to a government adviser. When asked whether any action would be taken against the persons involved in the Rangs Bhaban approval, housing and public works adviser Barrister Mainul Hosein Thursday night told bdnews24.com by telephone: "The present government will do only the work it must. Let the Bhaban be demolished first. Then we will see. However, no action is being taken right now against the persons involved." The adviser also said, "Through the court verdict, the misuse of the power of money has been stopped." Although Rangs Bhaban was a risk to air traffic due to its proximity to Tejgaon Airport, Rangs authorities got the design of the building approved by "managing" the people in Rajuk, an official of the city development agency alleged. The official also said the Rangs authorities had the blessings of the then policymakers of the BNP government. Rajuk authorities on Feb 18, 1993 approved construction of the 22-storey building on Bijoy Sarani. Later on June 24, 1999 Rajuk cancelled the approval. Rangs in 1999 filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the legality of the cancellation of the approval. On May 2, 2000 the High Court in its verdict on the writ petition declared the Rajuk's scrapping of the approval illegal. Later, the government appealed to the Supreme Court against the High Court verdict. The Supreme Court on August 2 declared the portion of Rangs Bhaban from above the sixth floor illegal. bdnews24.c
