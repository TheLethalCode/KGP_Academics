 TORONTO, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham ruled himself out of Los Angeles Galaxy's match with Toronto FC on Saturday then defended his cautious return to action from an ankle injury. "Today was the first time I've run and running straight forward is not a problem but turning corners is still a problem for me at the moment," Beckham told reporters after a morning practice session. "I don't think I will be involved in the game tomorrow unfortunately," he added. "Unless there is a drastic change I won't be on the pitch tomorrow." When Beckham stunned the soccer world this year by moving from Real Madrid to the Galaxy in a five-year deal that could net the midfielder up to $250 million, Sunday's game against Toronto was targeted as his Major League Soccer (MLS) debut. But a nagging ankle injury sustained playing for England against Estonia in a Euro 2008 qualifying match has limited Beckham to a brief cameo against Chelsea in a July 21 friendly. Since then the former England captain has struggled for fitness, spending most of his time in the treatment room and the gym. The injury has taken some of the steam out of the Beckham-mania that swept North America following his arrival in Hollywood. Indeed, the honeymoon appears to be over with Beckham coming under criticism earlier this week for not accompanying his team to Dallas for a Superliga match. BECKHAM APOLOGY "I know I've been criticised for not appearing in Dallas but, like I said before, I'm here for five years not just this year," said Beckham. "You've got the likes of Pele and other players who have played with injuries -- and like someone commented, what great ambassadors those players were for the MLS for doing that. "I apologise for the people in Dallas but I'm sure I'll see them next year "I'd love to be out there on field. The amount of fans here who paid a lot of money to see the Galaxy play, I would love to be out there but I have to be really careful with my injury." Despite the uncertainty surrounding Beckham's status, Sunday's game will be a sell-out with extra seats added. More than 200 journalists and photographers have applied for accreditation for the game, which will be shown live on three different television networks. Still, Toronto fans will not be happy about Beckham's absence. When it was announced Toronto FC was likely to be Beckham's MLS debut match the club sold thousands of additional ticket packages within hours. This week Toronto FC warned those ticket holders there would be no refunds if Beckham fails to make an appearance. There could be more disappointment ahead for soccer fans waiting to see Beckham in action. The 32-year-old midfielder said he will need another week to 10 days to reach match fitness leaving him doubtful for the Galaxy's next game on Thursday against D.C. United. "It's an injury that still needs time, it's an ankle injury and that's usually a six to seven week layoff," said Beckham. "It's been 7-1/2 weeks now so it's coming along slowly. "It would be nice to play some part in the game in Washington but I just have to keep my fingers crossed and work at it," he added
