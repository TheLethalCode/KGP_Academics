 LONDON, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foot and mouth disease has been found in cattle on a farm in Britain, the government said on Friday as it shut down livestock movements to stop a repeat of a 2001 outbreak that led to millions of animals' deaths. The agriculture department, Defra, said movements of pigs and ruminant animals such as cows and sheep had been banned nationwide and a 10-km (six-mile) surveillance zone had been placed around the farm near Guildford, close to London. All cattle on the farm will be culled, it said in a statement. The disease causes high fevers and blisters in cloven-hoofed animals and can often lead to death. The disease can be contracted by cattle, pigs, sheep and goats, but very rarely by people. Prime Minister Gordon Brown took part by telephone in an emergency meeting of officials on Friday evening from southern England, where he began a holiday on Friday. He will cut short his break in Dorset and return to London on Saturday to chair another meeting of the emergency committee, COBRA, a spokeswoman said. "Our top priority is to prevent the spread of this disease in order to protect farmers' stock. The plans are tested and well-established," said the spokeswoman for his office. Recommendations made following the 2001 outbreak were being followed "to the letter" she added. The environment minister will also return to London. "This will put a real chill into the heart of every livestock farmer in the country," Chris Huhne, environment spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, told Sky news. "The last outbreak affected the whole rural economy." Britain was the centre of a major outbreak of the highly contagious disease that began in 2001 in an abattoir in southern England, and spread to several other European Union countries before it was eradicated. Then, the country's livestock industry was just recovering from an outbreak of mad cow disease -- Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -- that swept British herds in the 1980s and early 1990s. An EU ban on British beef exports was partially lifted in 1999, but only completely removed in 2006. The 2001 foot and mouth scare turned into one of the world's largest and most expensive animal disease outbreaks, with overall costs estimated at up to 12 billion euros ($16 billion). The outbreak ravaged Britain, where authorities slaughtered 6.5 million animals and burned them on giant funeral pyres to stem the spread of the disease -- turning much of the countryside into a no-go zone, rather than use vaccines. France, Ireland and the Netherlands were also hit. Britain's government came in for heavy criticism for its handling of the outbreak as it failed to stop the movement of animals as soon as foot and mouth was discovered. bd
