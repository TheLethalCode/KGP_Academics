<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)- Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday expressed concern over the flood situation and said it did not seem the present government would be able to combat it, her lawyer and a relative said. After meeting Hasina at the special jail, her lawyer Kamrul Islam and maternal uncle Sheikh Akram Hossain spoke about her concern to newsmen. Advocate Kamrul Islam claimed that Hasina had broken into tears on hearing about the flood-affected people. She called upon all to stand by the flood-hit people, they said. Akram Hossain said Hasina did not believe the emergency government would be able to face the floods and was concerned about it. Advocate Kamrul Islam stayed in the special jail for about an hour. At the time, he talked with Hasina about cases against her. Quoting Hasina, he said, as the Bangladesh Bank and the Anticorruption Commission had not cooperated with her regarding her wealth statement, the statement she would now submit showing respect to the law, would be based on assumption. Islam said Hasina was worried about how her husband Wazed Miah's treatment would continue as his bank account had been frozen. She said that though her sister Rehana and son Joy were abroad, their accounts too had been frozen. Islam said Hasina had posed a question to the government on how the students, getting stipends from the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Memorial Trust, would be able to continue doing so with the accounts of the Trust also frozen. He quoted Hasina as saying the obstacles would go soon and that she would be free with the help of people soon. About 20 to 25 children and juveniles formed a human chain near the police barricade at the entrance to the special jail at midday. They carried banners calling for release of the detained former prime minister. bdnew
