 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) More than 200 employees of private television channel Boishakhi observed work abstention Wednesday to realise their various demands. The workers demonstrated in front of their office in Mahakhali from 8.30am to 3pm bringing newsroom activities to a halt. The television station has been operating without any news updates or regular daily programme since 10am Wednesday. Journalists, artists, technicians and other workers of Boishakhi have demanded wages due since the past three months, adequate technical support and a stop to retrenchments. In the afternoon, a notice was circulated in the office stating that all the dues of the employees would be paid by August 15. The order came from KM Shahidullah, managing director of Boishakhi. He was not present in the office Wednesday. Anis Alamgir, head of news for the troubled TV station, told bdnews24.com that they would go back to work immediately after the satisfactory notice from the authority. He said that the members of the Boishakhi family were loyal to the organisation. The chairman of Boishakhi, Morshed Alam, told bdnews24.com in the evening, "It's not my duty to look after the financial issues of this company. The matter falls under the responsibility of the managing director." He said that he had been informed that the employees were not being paid for three months. He ordered the managing director to take immediate steps to resolve the crisis. KM Shahidullah said, "The crisis is because the company has been facing losses for the last few months. Against an expenditure of one crore taka monthly, our income in only 30/40 lakh. For how will it be possible for us to bear this huge burden? However, we are hoping to solve the problem by August 15." He said that the company earned only Tk 30 lakh from commercials last month. bdnews
