 KABUL, August 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taliban insurgents killed two Afghan policeman and wounded three during a pre-dawn firefight in the eastern city of Kunar on Sunday, provincial spokesman Shah Wasi Mangal said. The Taliban have stepped up attacks against the Kabul government and its Western backers mostly in the south and southeastern provinces of Afghanistan in the last 18 months. Separately, four Afghan police were killed and three wounded when a rocket-propelled grenade hit their vehicle in the southern province of Logar late on Saturday, said the provincial governor Abdullah Wardak. Taliban spokesmen could not be immediately contacted for comment. Ousted from power in 2001, the Taliban are waging a campaign of bombing, ambushes and kidnapping to overthrow the government and defeat its foreign allies.
