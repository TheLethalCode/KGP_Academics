 ISTANBUL, August 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A villager was killed by Kurdish guerrillas in southeastern Turkey after refusing to give them food and supplies, state news agency Anatolian said on Sunday. The killing took place in the Turkish province of Van, the news agency said. Another villager was killed late last month for denying supplies to members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), classified as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. More than 200 people have been killed this year in clashes between the Turkish military and the PKK. The increase in violence has prompted calls from Turkey's military for a cross-border operation to destroy militant camps in northern Iraq. Turkey blames the PKK for 30,000 deaths since the separatists took up arms in 1984 to fight for an ethnic homeland.
