 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) - The legal battle on Rangs building started eight years earlier. On Feb 18, 1993, the official city development agency, Rajuk, gave approval to the Rangs Group of Industries to construct a 22-storey building on Bijoy Sarani only to cancel it on June 24, 1999. The construction of the 16 storeys was complete before the approval was scrapped. On Sept 26 of the same year, Rajuk asked Rangs to demolish the floors beyond six storeys. Rangs had later filed a writ petition in 1999 with the High Court challenging Rajuk's cancellation of the previous approval. A final hearing of the writ petition was held in 2000. In a verdict on May 2, 2000, the High Court ruled that Rajuk's cancellation order was illegal. The government and Rajuk sought permission from the Supreme Court to move against the High Court verdict. The Appellate Division took it for hearing on Dec 5, 2005. Upon a government application, the Appellate Division on June 7 fixed June 13 to hear the appeal before a special vacation bench. On June 13, a bench of the Appellate Division felt 'embarrassed' to hear the matter. The court sent the file of the case to the chief justice to frame a new bench for hearing of the appeal. The chief justice later formed a panel of five judges headed by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim. The latest legal battle based on the appeals of the both sides began on July 24 in the Appellate Division. The Appellate Division heard both sides for five days. The court fixed August 2 for the verdict after concluding the hearing on July 31. The bench of five judges delivered the verdict at 9:40am on August 2. According to the verdict, the floors except for six storeys from the ground were illegal. The building owners said they would file a review appeal with the Appellate Division. bdnews24
