<TITLE> Russia coach Hiddink looks beyond 2008 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Guus Hiddink is relishing the challenge of restoring Russia's fading reputation and would like to stay in the job after his contract runs out in 2008. Rumours have circulated in the Russian soccer community that the Dutchman would leave Russia if they failed to qualify for the Euro 2008 finals, but he was quick to dispell those fears. "If you ask me a hypothetical question because I haven't been offered a new contract yet, then yes, I would love to stay and finish my work here," Hiddink told Reuters in an interview. "Regardless if we qualify or not." The Russians have not made a serious impact on the international stage since the break-up of the Soviet Union, often failing to reach major tournaments. "This country has so much tradition and history in football that it deserves to be among the elite. But of course those post-Soviet years have been very hard and you lost time, so we need to act quickly," he said. "I'm not talking about just the national team, it's the whole process of rebuilding the infrastructure, modernising stadiums, training centres, developing new players and coaches. "Such work cannot be quick, it'll take time so for me, if I stay around let's say until 2010, it would be like completing a cycle. If I leave before that, my job would not be complete." CHELSEA SPECULATION However, the hugely successful 60-year-old, who led the Netherlands and South Korea to the semi-finals of the 1998 and 2002 World Cups, has been a target of constant press reports, tying him with a number of big clubs. Hiddink has been linked with Chelsea because of his acquaintance with the English Premier League club's Russian billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, who was instrumental in helping to lure the Dutchman to Moscow. "Of course, I can't deny that I've never had any approaches from clubs or the national associations but Chelsea was not among them," he said. "Every now and then I get a chance to meet Roman. People see us together and then you have all these rumours flying around. "But we have never discussed (Chelsea's) managerial position because they already have a manager and a good one," he added. "But in any case I wouldn't discuss other offers while I'm coaching Russia because it only distracts you from your job." Hiddink remained upbeat about his team's chances to qualify for next year's finals in Austria and Switzerland. Russia have yet to lose a Euro 2008 qualifier as they lie third in Group E, two points behind leaders Croatia and one above England. "I'm always an optimist and if there's still a chance, even a small one, you must have hope," he said. "We have a very young team that has a lot of potential, but we must continue to push forward. If we do that, then the future looks bright.
