 Bogra, August 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain Saturday asked chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed to seek cooperation from all on an emergency basis to fight floods that have battered 38 districts and marooned millions of people. The death toll from this year's monsoon havoc rose to 81 Saturday while waters on the rivers around the capital continued to rise, according to the flood information cell under the information ministry. "In such a grave situation, the chief adviser can urge all to come forward irrespective of party affiliation or views to stand by the flood victims," he told reporters during a visit to the northern district. The call came at the time when the government admitted that the administration's initial response was sluggish, and amid concerns that the political parties are not coming forward to join hands with the military-backed government's effort. The veteran politician made a stopover at Bogra Parjatan Motel at about 3 pm on his way to the flood-hit Gaibandha, another northern district. "The government must be cautious so that not a single person starves and dies," he said. "The prices of essentials have gone beyond the buying capacity of people. This must be brought within the buying capacity. The government has to take such steps so that people can get enough food." bdnews2
