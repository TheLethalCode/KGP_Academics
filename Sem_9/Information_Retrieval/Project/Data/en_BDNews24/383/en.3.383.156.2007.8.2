 Mokarram Hossain Shuvo bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com) -- University Grants Commission chairman Prof Nazrul Islam Thursday said the four members appointed during the alliance government had been asked to resign to make the institution, regulating the universities, more powerful and dynamic. Education secretary Md Momtazul Islam, on behalf of the government, Monday told the four members to resign over phone. Later, when the members went to education adviser Ayub Quadri to discuss the matter, he also told them to quit. Although some of the members initially raised objections, they ultimately resigned. The four members appointed during the alliance government had to leave three months after the appointment of the new chairman. The commission chairman spoke to bdnews24.com Thursday on the removal of the members and his plans to make the institution dynamic. "The members of the commission were not efficient and able enough to realise the goal for which I have accepted the post," Prof Nazrul said. "The government realised it in the past several months. In this regard, my evaluation is also the same." The chairman said he did not have any objection when the government told the four members to resign, adding that he personally he did not have any problem with the members. But it was not possible to make the commission dynamic keeping them, he said. The members who resigned said they had had to leave without any reason. They did not commit any irregularity or engage in corruption. Even no allegation of irregularity was raised against them, they said adding that asking them to resign in this way was sad. Prof Tareque Shamsur Rehman, the last member of the commission to resign, told bdnews24.com, "Though I got appointed during the alliance rule, I had never attended any meeting of the BNP nor did I participate in any such programme. "I had never patronised irregularity to show allegiance to the BNP. None can prove that I was lenient toward any BNP man in the enquiries I did on behalf of the commission. "I discharged my responsibilities properly as a member of the commission. I worked as per the instruction of the new chairman. Asking me to resign without any cause is sad." When the attention of the commission chairman was drawn to Prof Rehman's comments Prof Nazrul said: "Though they do not see their weaknesses I have found in my last few months work here that they lacked dynamism as members of the regulatory body of the universities." On Prof Faisul Islam Faruqui, the first to resign, the commission chairman said, "Mr Faruqui used to stay three days a week in Rajshahi. It created problems." On Prof Faruqui being controversial in giving mass appointments while he was the vice chancellor of Rajshahi University, the UGC chairman said, "It is known to all. Others were also more or less of the same type." Prof Nazrul said the vice chancellor and syndicate members of the Chittagong University said they would not cooperate with the members appointed during the alliance government in their investigations. On the members who resigned, Prof Nazrul said: "If the image of the commission which regulates the university is in question many problems arise. The commission faced the problem with its members." Asked about the process of appointing new members to the commission, Prof Nazrul said: "The government will do it. However, the new members will be more dynamic and I don't think there will be any scope to raise questions about them." On retaining only Ehsanul Haque from among the five members, the chairman said there is no question about his efficiency and impartiality. "This is the reason he has been kept in the committee for selection of vice chancellors." Asked to elaborate on his optimism, even after Prof Syed Manzoorul Islam resigned as a member of the Vice Chancellor selection committee raising questions about its formation, Prof Nazrul said: "This is his personal view. Though it is not as per the Commission's desire, the process of appointment of vice chancellors is more transparent and positive compared to that in the past. "The commission wanted a former vice chancellor as the chairman of the committee, but instead a secretary has been made its chief. It will not create much of a problem." On making the commission more dynamic and increasing its power, the chairman said weaknesses and problems are being detected. As the chairman, his personal view was that the commission did not have adequate information about the private universities and foreign institutions. The commission did not pay much attention to various irregularities that had occurred in it. Steps were now being taken to make the private universities' wing stronger. Prof Nazrul said an initiative had already been taken to close some foreign institutions. bdnews
