<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  Holders of about 1.4 million beneficiary owners' accounts have to pay a Tk 300 annual fee against each account from Sept 1 to 30, according to a decision taken by the Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday. The SEC took the decision to stop the opening and maintaining of fake BO accounts. The BO accounts are needed to invest in the stock market. The SEC will start canceling or freezing the BO accounts from October 1 if the account holders do not deposit the money by the deadline, Farhad Ahmed, executive director of the SEC, told bdnews24.com Tuesday. The fees will have to be paid to depository participants. According to Ahmed, BO accounts without a share would be closed automatically if the account holders did not pay the fee by the deadline. But BO accounts having shares will be frozen for failure to pay the charge. The SEC move followed a gazette, which has allowed the regulator to impose the fee to stop the opening of fake BO accounts. According to the gazette, if the BO account holders do not deposit the charge by the deadline, the accounts will be cancelled or frozen. The regulator also decided to probe fake BO accounts. The SEC would also ask depository participants to provide details on some BO accounts. "We have examined some BOs and found deficiency in documents. We are going to write to the depository participants to give details," he said, refusing to give the number of the BOs. The SEC also approved a draft margin rule for merchant banks in principle. The commission will seek public opinion before final approval. bd
