 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)Anticorruption Commission chief Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury has said he will depend more on evidence than witness statements in corruption cases so that those charged with corruption do not escape justice. "We'll depend more on evidence than witnesses when the corruption cases are forwarded to court," Chowdhury told a meeting with National Board of Revenue officials Tuesday. "Witnesses may change their minds, but not evidence," he said. The former army chief said the ACC and the NBR are both frontline organisations in combating corruption. "The NBR could help us greatly by sharing information," he said. "As a helping hand, the NBR should not bar the ACC from getting information." The ACC chief also reiterated that punishment alone could not wipe out corruption. "A social movement is necessary for that," Chowdhury said. "The ACC is planning to strengthen the commission by developing experts in different areas, including financial matters, land disputes and corporation issues," Chowdhury said. He said the ACC offices in district headquarters would soon be strengthened to handle corruption cases. bdnews2
