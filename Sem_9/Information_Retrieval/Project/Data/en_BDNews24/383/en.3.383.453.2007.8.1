<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  The curtain of first-ever B. League fell on Wednesday with Dhaka Mohammedan SC and Arambagh KS playing a 1-1 draw in the second-leg final encounter at the Bangabandhu National Stadium (BNS). The ten-man Mohammedan team, whose title triumph vanished after Dhaka Abahani emerged champions with a match to spare, restored some pride ending their last encounter in a draw. The popular black and white outfit, composed of mostly young players including four Nigerian recruits, became runners-up with 40 points from 20 matches, seven points behind champions Abahani, who topped the 11-team table with 47 points from as many outings. Away at Chittagong, Sheikh Russel also played a 1-1 draw against Chittagong Mohammedan SC to finish fourth with 33 points, equalling with Muktijoddha Sangsad KS, who became third by way of goal difference with Sheikh Russel. Dipu gave the hosts an early lead in the first minute while Bulbul restored the Sheikh Russel margain in the 59th minute. Arambagh finished sixth with 27 points from 20 matches, one point ahead of the seventh-placed Chittagong Mohammedan, who raised their point tally to 26 playing as many matches. At the BNS, the players of both the sides could hardly show the natural performance on the rain-soaked muddy pitch. However, Arambagh, who lost the same rivals 1-0 in their first-leg match, enjoyed a superior ball possession over the giants and produced a couple of scoring chances before Nicodemus Gichana Anunda put Arambagh ahead in the 32nd minute. Kenyan striker Nicodemus ran down from the right to fire home outside the box to give Arambagh a lead and Ugandan striker Iddi Badambuze came close to doubling the lead, but Mohammedan goalie Mazharul Islam Himel spoiled Iddi's powerful left-footer at the cost of a corner in the 40th minute. After the breather, the minnows Arambagh continued their dominance over Mohammedan, who missed league's top scorer of injured Nigerian Mwach Ukwu Paul Mac. The Mohammedan saw their striker Walid Khan and Nigerian Emeka Christina float two easy efforts over the opponent's post, but they had the laugh when local medio Mohammad Rony, set by Jumratul Islam Mithu, dodged past Arambagh substitute goalkeeper Mithul Hasan to restore the parity in the 72nd minute. Then in the 77th minute, Mohammedan were reduced to 10 men as their medio Divine Chibuike was sent off due to second bookable offence in the match. Iddi rattled the Mohammedan post in the 78th minute to frustrate Arambagh fans while Rony floated over Arambagh post with their goalkeeper just to beat six minutes from time. "I am happy with the overall performances and finished runners-up though we raced for the title," said Mohammedan coach Shafiqul Islam Manik. "We slipped from the title race at the beginning of the second-leg after dropping a few points," said Manik claiming that the referees blew whistle against them in the league.
