 Dhaka, August 4 (bdnews24.com) -- Army chief Moeen U Ahmed Saturday called on people to stand by flood victims, regardless of political leanings and difference of opinion. "There is no bar on politicians to stand by the flood-affected people, with or without the state of emergency. There are no links between politics and distribution of relief. Bangladesh is now under water. We have only one task: to aid the flood victims," he said. General Moeen's appeal makes the first public call for help from a broader spectrum of society amid wider criticism that the emergency government had been slow to respond to the crisis. He made the appeal at a meeting at the Deputy Commissioner's Office in Manikganj where he went to distribute relief. Deputy commissioner Ataur Rahman presided over the meeting. "It's not possible for the government and the army to tackle the floods alone. The wealthy and able people in society have to come forward," Moeen said. It is widely believed that blanket arrests of politicians on charges of corruption have dampened spirits of people to join hands with the government to aid the flood victims. The army chief went to different flood-affected areas in Manikganj. After landing by helicopter at Tepra helipad in Shibalay upazila at 10.30am, he distributed relief among the flood victims at Barongail Chandra High School, a makeshift shelter. Moeen also took his relief trip to the areas including Jabra and Penchar Kanda under Gheor upazila. Speaking to the press, Moeen blamed the 'rich people' who live apart from the poor. "Some people live in luxury, maybe in Hotel Sonargaon, and think over different problems and give advice." Moeen asked them to come close to the flood victims who are suffering. "Come help them." Replying to a comment that the politicians cannot come to help the flood victims, as there is a state of emergency, he said, "Emergency has nothing to do with the flood victims. So I say, those who enjoy people's support have to stand together by people in times of a humanitarian disaster." The army has already given Tk 2.05 crore set aside from their one-day salary for flood victims, he said. "It's not the proper time for politics. Forty-one districts of the country have gone under water. The leaders of the political parties shouldn't have any problem extending helping hands. Some political parties are desperate to see the government in trouble." The army chief advised the deputy commissioner for Manikganj to supply cooked food and pure water to the flood victims. He suggested that the local administration form medical teams in different unions. bdnews24.c
