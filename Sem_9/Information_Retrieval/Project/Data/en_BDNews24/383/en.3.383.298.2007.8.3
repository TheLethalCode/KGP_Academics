 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  Raging floodwaters continued to wreak havoc across the country Friday amid forecast that capital Dhaka and its surrounding areas were under immense threat and the latest official death count climbing over 65. With water levels in and around Dhaka having risen in the last 24 hours, eastern parts of city have already been submerged, and a flood bulletin said all rivers around the capital continued to rise. Gushing waters from upstream rivers that have flooded many Indian states have created havoc in 38 districts in Bangladesh. The disaster management ministry said Friday that violent waters washed away many mud roads and small bridges across the country. Despite a sluggish start, the government relief agencies ferried dry food to the stricken people in parts of the country, bdnews24.com correspondents reported. Ariful Islam of the Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre told bdnews24.com Friday that the water in the rivers of Dhaka and its adjoining areas would continue to rise for a few more days. According to the FFWC, the water levels of the five rivers around DhakaBuriganga, Balu, Tangi Khal, Shilakkhya and Turag have increased by between 5 and 20 cm Three quarters of Basabo, Nandipara and Trimohoni on the east fringe of the city went under water Friday, with boat being the only means to reach many houses in Trimohoni and Nandipara. Locals are anticipating outbreak of diseases when the water recedes since a major portion of the city's untreated storm waters flowed outside the capital through the area. Selim Hossain, executive engineer of the Water Development Board, said, "The eastern region of Dhaka City is outside of the DND dam. That area is now flooded. The water levels will rise further." Elsewhere In the country, 11 more people were reported dead Friday, including two children who drowned in floodwaters in Pabna and Brahmanbaria, taking the countrywide death toll to over 65, according to the disaster management ministry. Countrywide figures released by the ministry Friday say 6.9 million people have been "flood-affected" in 38 of the 64 districts and almost 6 million acres of cropland have been damaged. The FFWC gave a varied flood forecast for the country. Floods have eased off slightly in the north and Sylhet with the waters of several rivers in the Brahmaputra and the Meghna basins receding and the rise slowing down. Southern areas, however, remain at risk with the floodwaters from the north heading downriver. Flooding eased up in Sirajganj and Sylhet region, but it worsened in Faridpur, Pabna, Netrokona, Brahmanbaria, Munshiganj and Shariatpur. Some parts of Faridpur are under three-foot water and ferry services between Mawa and Shariatpur have been suspended. The regular bulletin of the FFWC said in the last 24 hours waters of 44 rivers went down in 22 points and increased at 35 points. In Pabna ferry movement on Nagarbari-Aricha route remained suspended as the pontoons went under floodwater. Though more than 100 flood shelters have been opened in seven upazilas of the district, flood-hit people are taking shelter at flood defence embankments finding no place in the regular shelters. In Netrokona about 10,000 flood-affected people have taken shelters in 34 centres. The communication between the district headquarters and seven upazila headquarters remained cut off as water submerged roads at various points. In Brahmanbaria district more than 100 villages in 25 unions have been inundated. In Munshiganj overall flood situation deteriorated. Road communication of Louhajang with Dhaka snapped as a part of Louhajang-Mawa road was washed away by floodwaters Friday morning. District relief officer AKM Rowshan Ali said about 27,000 people in 12 upazilas of Louhajang and Tongibari have been hit. He put the damage to crops at about Tk 6.29 crore. In Shariatpur, 38 unions of six upazilas went under water as the flood situation worsened Friday. In southern district of Bhola, roiling waters entered three villages after they breached a large portion of the flood protection embankment around the Bhola town. In northwestern district of Sirajganj, about 700,000 people remained marooned Friday despite a slight improvement of the floods. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Armed Forces decided to donate a day's of salary to the chief adviser's relief fund, a statement of the ISPR said Friday. bdnews24.com/corr/gma/jk/fwc/al/
