 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association Saturday termed the ongoing floods a national disaster and asked trade bodies and philanthropists to come forward with a helping hand to face the situation. "Forty-six districts out of 64 have already been affected by the flood. The situation is critical in 32 districts," BGMEA president Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez told a briefing marking the launch of relief work for the flood victims. "Whether the government announces it or not, the flood situation is a national disaster," Parvez said. "We have asked all, irrespective of party affiliations, to come forward to help millions of flood affected people," he said. He lamented saying that people were not coming forward as they once did in facing natural disasters. As part of its plan, the BGMEA has already raised a fund of Tk 25 lakh donated by its 27 directors while another Tk 10 lakh will be given to chief adviser's fund next Thursday. The organisation has also opened a 'flood cell' at its office since Saturday to monitor and coordinate efforts. Another five centres, one each in Dhaka, Sirajganj, Kurigram, Manikganj and Netrokona districts will work under the cell. Former BGMEA president Annisul Huq asked the government to make arrangements so that people from all strata could contribute to the relief effort. Replying to a query, the BGMEA president said that the country did not need foreign help to tackle the flood situation. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry at an emergency board meeting Saturday asked all trade bodies to help the flood victims immediately. FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain chaired the meeting. The FBCCI decided to donate to the government relief fund besides carrying out relief work itself. Bangladesh is flood-prone because it lies in the delta of three great rivers, the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna. People can grow crops on land regularly fertilised by nutrient-laden silt from the rivers. But extreme floods cause considerable hardship and loss of lifein 1988 and 1998, over two-thirds of the country was under water. Experts are forecasting this year's flood may also take the shape of those in 1988 and 1998. bd
