<TITLE> Hannan Shah sees no council without Khaleda </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson's adviser ASM Hannan Shah said Friday that there would be no council meeting excluding Khaleda Zia. "No council or elections would be allowed to be held minus Khaleda Zia. She has become an uncompromising leader through movements by her own ability. There is nothing to call dynastic here," Shah said. He came down hard on the so-called reformists led by the party secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan for their remarks that Khaleda still favoured family dynasty. BNP joint secretary Ashraf Hossain Thursday said some of Khaleda's comments during a telephone talk with activists of the party's student wing might put the party unity at stake. Khaleda had reportedly branded the reforms campaigners as conspirators. Hossain was critical of Khaleda's statement, saying that she still wanted to run the party through family dynasty. But Shah questioned Hossain's authority to be a party spokesman. "I am speaking in line with the directives of the chairperson. But Mr Ashraf is not a party spokesman, in what capacity is he speaking? "There is nothing called dynasty. The chairperson has established herself in politics by her own ability," he said. "If madam is arrested or any such situation arises, no council or elections will be held without her. It would not be allowed. The party leaders and workers will accept nothing keeping her out." Shah said there was no reason to drop her from the party and accused the "reformists" of rolling out their proposals to drop the party chief. He also took a dig at the Election Commission for what he said was slow pace of work on polls preparations. "I have talked to the party chairperson. She has asked the party leaders and workers to stand by the flood-hit people." bdnews24
