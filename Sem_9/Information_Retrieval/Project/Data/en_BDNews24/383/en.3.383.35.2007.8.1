<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Wednesday defended the government's appeal against the High Court's order that granted bail to Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. "Any corruption case is government affair. That's why the government appealed the High Court order for bail," he told reporters, amid a nervous wait for the Appellate Division's verdict on the government appeal against the bail. "The government is party to the case. Its burden also lies on the government," he said. The Supreme Court is set to hand down a verdict Thursday on a government petition against the bail order for Hasina and a freeze on the proceedings of the case taken under the fold of emergency powers rules. bdnews24
