<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Rangs Bhaban Thursday filed an appeal to halt an Appellate Division verdict that ordered demolition of 16 floors of the 22-storey building. Rangs Bhaban authorities submitted the appeal to the Supreme Court, but the hearing on the appeal was not held, as the Appellate Division chamber judge was not present at the time. The hearing will be held Sunday. In its appeal, the Rangs Bhaban authorities said a petition for formal review of the verdict would be filed after getting a copy of the Appellate Division verdict on demolition. "For this the Appellate Division verdict needs to be stayed," the appeal said. Rangs Bhaban counsel barrister Md Shakawat Hossain told bdnews24.com: "We hope the demolition of the upper parts of the building would remain suspended until the disposition of the review petition." bdnew
