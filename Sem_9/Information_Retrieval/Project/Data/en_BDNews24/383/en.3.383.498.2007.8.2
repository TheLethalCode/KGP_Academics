 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Thursday deferred by a week the hearing on Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina's appeal for cancelling the Meghnaghat power project corruption case. The High Court bench of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ataur Rahman Khan made the postponement until August 8 after hearing an appeal for time extension by Hasina's lawyers. Her lawyers advocate Abdul Matin Khasru and barrister Fazle Nur Taposh told the court that they needed time since senior counsel barrister Rokanuddin Mahmud had returned the case file and new lawyers would have to be engaged. Deputy attorney general Abdur Rouf Miah said opposed the time extension prayer saying more time had been granted only in the preceding week. The court said there was no need to defer hearing as it would hear a senior or a junior lawyer equally and impartially. The court however granted one week's time when the lawyers again asked for two weeks' time. Md Golam Mostafa of the now-defunct Anti-Corruption Bureau filed a corruption case against the former power minister Rafiqul Islam on December 12, 2001 with Ramna Police Station on charges of corruption in setting up Meghnaghat power project. The case details said Rafiq had then caused the government to lose Tk 17.90 lakh through adopting unfair means. The bureau pressed charges against the ex-minister, Sheikh Hasina and two others on October 14, 2002. Hasina filed a writ appeal with the High Court in 2002 seeking cancellation of the case against her. bd
