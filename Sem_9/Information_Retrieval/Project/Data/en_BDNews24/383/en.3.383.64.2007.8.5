 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) - A last-moment spending spree by the caretaker government did not manage to raise the figures for Annual Development Programme (ADP) implementation to the level achieved in previous years, according to government statistics. Development partners and lending agencies, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, as well as local economists have all said that heightened spending at the tail end of a fiscal year can breed corruption. Economist Hossain Zillur Rahman, one of the architects of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, told bdnews24.com: "A spending extravaganza in the last hours erodes the quality of development projects." Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam previously stated that ADP implementation suffered a severe setback due to political unrest over the October to December period. Failure of the electoral reform process and poor judgment in selecting worthy projects combined with an inadequate of inflow of foreign aid exacerbated the problem, according to Azizul. According to official data, some 886 projects were included in the original ADP budget for FY 2006-07. The revised number increased that number to 1,098. Approximately Tk 18,024 crore of the revised ADP outlay of Tk 21,600 crore was spent in the last fiscal year, this is equivalent to 83.44 percent. However, the average performance rate is over 90 percent for previous revised budgets. When the original ADP outlay of Tk 26,000 crore is considered, the 2006-7 figure drops to only 69 percent budget implementation. Some Tk 5,000 crore was spent in June alone, the last month of the fiscal year. Expenditure for the rest of the year combined stood at only Tk 13,225 crore. The finance adviser had earlier trimmed the ADP size to Tk 21,600 crore. According to government statistics, Tk 16,817 crore or 89 percent of the revised outlay for FY 2003-04 was spent, which was 92 percent in FY 2004-05 and 91 percent in FY 2005-06. ADP implementation during the FY 1992-93 was 81 percent, slightly lower than 2006-07 fiscal year's level, according to Bangladesh Economic Review 2007. In terms of amount, the spending for FY 2006-07 was lower than the previous two fiscal years. Some Tk 19,473 crore was in FY 2005-06 and Tk 18,771 crore in FY 2004-05. bd
