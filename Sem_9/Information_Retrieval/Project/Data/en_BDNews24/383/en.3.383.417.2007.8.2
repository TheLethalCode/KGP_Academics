 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Bank is set to sell off embezzlement- ridden Oriental Bank. Initially, the BB will sell Oriental's majority shares worth Tk 350 crore through floatation of an open tender seeking "expression of interest" from local and international buyers. The process will start on August 5, the BB said Thursday in a notice. The BB notification came after the government approved a scheme to restructure the bank. The BB scheme suggested raising Oriental's paid-up capital to Tk 700 crore from the existing Tk 51.90 crore. Of the amount, shares worth about Tk 350 crore would be sold through open tender. In addition, some Tk 50 crore worth of shares, including Tk 44.82 core worth of shares fortified by the BB earlier, and Tk 4.50 crore shares paid up by sponsors, would also be sold. The BB would also sell the remaining Tk 300 crore worth of shares among the depositors of the Oriental Bank. However, schedule of offering shares to the depositors would be announced later, said the notification signed by Bangladesh Bank governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed. "We hope to settle the claims of the depositors after completing the sale," a BB official, wishing to remain unnamed, told bdnews24.com. The process would be completed by the end of January next year, the official added. According to the notification, all liabilities of the bank would be payable based on its accounts on Jan 25. Depositors, however, would get only the principal amount without any profit as the bank, run by Islami Shariah, had not made any profit. Payment of the principal amount would be staggered over five years, according to the notification. The BB issued the notification about seven months after the government imposed a six-month moratorium on the Oriental which came in the red due to embezzlement of nearly Tk 600 crore allegedly by one of its sponsors Obaidul Karim in connivance with Oriental's former managing director CM Koyes Sami. The moratorium restricted withdrawal of over Tk 10,000 a month by old depositors, and barred investment by the bank. The notification, fixing Oriental's authorised capital at Tk 1000 crore, said that the remaining Tk 300 crore worth of shares would raised through initial public offering later. Oriental's current managing director Md Asaduzzaman Khan was not available for comment. bd
