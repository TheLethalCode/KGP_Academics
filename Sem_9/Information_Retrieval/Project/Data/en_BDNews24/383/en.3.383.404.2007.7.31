 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) -- The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday gave a reply to Awami League president Sheikh Hasina, expressing its inability to help her find details of her bank accounts. The written reply signed by ACC secretary Mokhles Ur Rahman on behalf of the commission chairman was handed to jail authorities Tuesday. "The ACC took into account the letter from former prime minister Sheikh Hasina with sympathy. The commission discussing the matter at length in its meeting concluded that it was unable to help." In line with a decision of the meeting, the ACC sent a letter to Hasina Tuesday. A prisons official received the letter on her behalf. The former prime minister, arrested on July 16 in an extortion case, wrote a letter to the commission through jail authorities Monday to help her with a wealth statement. Hasina sought assistance from the ACC chairman in getting information about her bank accounts and in recovering the documents seized from her home. Replying to reporters, the ACC secretary said former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who had also been asked to submit a wealth statement to the graft watchdog, did not seek similar help. On whether sending notices to the detained politicians asking them to give wealth statements was aimed at harassing them, the secretary said: "The commission has no intention to harass anybody. "The commission is an independent institution and will always be." On July 25, Hasina sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bank governor through the jail authorities seeking information about her accounts with different commercial banks. The central bank Sunday expressed its inability to give the information saying it was "beyond jurisdiction". The ACC served notice on Hasina and Khaleda on July 17, asking them to submit accounts of their movable and immovable property in seven days from notification. On their appeals the commission extended the deadline by seven workdays to August 8. bdnew
