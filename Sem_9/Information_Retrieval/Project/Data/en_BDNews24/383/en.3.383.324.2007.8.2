<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal Thursday said the Supreme Court verdict in the Rangs Bhaban case was a victory of the government. The apex court Thursday ordered that only six storeys of the 22-storey highrise on Bijoy Sarani in the capital would stay and building would have to be redesigned. "This is a triumph of the government. We wanted to term the illegal building the same as it is. The verdict proved it," he told the reporters at his office. The government had said it had a plan to construct a road by razing the building to the ground. Asked whether they would go ahead with the plan now that the court allowed the building up to six-storey, the adviser said, "Whether the road is to be constructed or not, we wanted to remove the illegal part and we have done it." On whether Rangs Bhaban got legality in the verdict, he said, "The court will see it. We have not received the copy from the court order. So we cannot say anything right at the moment." bdnews24
