 MOSCOW, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven people were killed in three separate clashes between security forces and insurgents on Friday in Dagestan, part of Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, Russian media reported. The dead included five insurgents, a local police official shot as he walked to work, and the commander of a unit of interior ministry troops, news agencies reported. Police shootouts and attacks by insurgents against Russian forces are frequent in Dagestan, a mainly Muslim region in the south of Russia. Analysts say the violence is linked to clan rivalries, organised crime and a militant Islamist insurgency that has links to neighbouring Chechnya, scene of a long-running separatist war. In the Sergokalinsky district, local police said four militants were killed in a clash with special police units late on Thursday. The commander of the unit was also killed and another soldier injured. In a separate incident, a rebel was killed when special forces raided an apartment building in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala, agencies said. The raid followed the discovery nearby of a car laden with explosives. Three other rebels surrendered to police in the early morning incident. The deputy head of local police in the town of Buinaksk, Abdulmashid Rasulov, was shot from a car as he was walking to work. He had previously been targeted by militants.
