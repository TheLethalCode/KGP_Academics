 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)- The government will build a link road from Bijoy Sarani to Tejgaon-Mohakhali under a Tk 120 crore project, an adviser said Thursday. Work on the road will start after the government acquires land and demolishes the remaining six floors of Rangs Bhaban that are to still stand following demolition of 16 upper floors, now in progress. The link road is meant to rid the city of traffic jams to a great extent. Housing and public works adviser Mainul Hosein Thursday told bdnews24.com: "The government will acquire the Rangs Bhaban land for constructing a link road." "The work of expanding the link road to the east of Bijoy Sarani to Tejgaon-Mohakhali was obstructed due to the illegal construction of Rangs Bhaban," he said. The adviser said the construction of the link road was essential, adding, "The plan for building the link road is awaiting final approval from authorities. The land will be acquired after removal of Rangs Bhaban. After that, roadwork will start." Officials at the Public Works ministry said that a project "Expansion of Bijoy Sarani to Tejgaon industrial area" had been undertaken. Under the project, a one- kilometre long 60- foot wide four-lane road would be constructed from Bijoy Sarani to Tejgaon industrial area. "There would be provision for a rail gate on the road. A flyover will be constructed over the rail gate. A new project in this regard has been included in the ADP for fiscal 2007-08," he said. A total of 3.5 acres of land will be required for construction of the road, two acres of which will come from private owners. The government has 1.5 acres of its own land. The land acquisition will cost Tk 85 crore, which is 70 percent of the total project cost. There are 63 houses, 35 of them tin sheds, from behind Rangs Bhaban to Tejgaon industrial area. It has been learnt that 34 houses are on privately-owned land. The government will acquire the lands, and, as in the case of Rangs Bhaban, the owners will be given compensation. Besides, the government will demolish all the houses constructed without Rajuk approval. The project will cut traffic jam on the road in front of the Chief Adviser's Office. The vehicles coming from the Gulshan side will use the new road and go directly to Mirpur. bdnews24.c
