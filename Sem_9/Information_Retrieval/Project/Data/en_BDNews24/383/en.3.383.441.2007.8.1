<TITLE> Italy's Nesta quits international football </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MILAN, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan's Italy defender Alessandro Nesta has retired from international football, he told a news conference on Wednesday. "I'm not going to play for the national side anymore. My adventure in blue finishes here," Nesta said. The 31-year-old, who has 78 caps, played in three World Cups but his Italy career has recently been dogged by injuries. He was forced to miss last July's World Cup final victory over France because of a groin injury and has only featured once for Italy since October's 3-1 Group B victory against Georgia in a Euro 2008 qualifier. The former Lazio centre back was not included in Roberto Donadoni's squad for the European Championship qualifiers in the Faroe Islands and Lithuania in June after asking to be left out because he was getting married. However, Donadoni hinted then that the decision may have been final and the loss of Nesta is another big blow to the coach following striker Francesco Totti's confirmation last month that he had retired from the national team. Totti, 30, asked to take an extended break from playing for the Azzurri following the World Cup and went on to score 26 league goals last season to scoop the European Golden Boot. He blamed worries about his health for the decision. Italy have several options to replace Totti but look stretched at the back with few suitable candidates to cover for ageing centre backs Fabio Cannavaro and Marco Materazzi
