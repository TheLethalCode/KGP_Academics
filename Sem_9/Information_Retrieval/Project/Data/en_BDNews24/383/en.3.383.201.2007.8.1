<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  Malaysia has agreed to award Bangladeshi businessmen multiple visit visas for three years, the Malaysian high commissioner to Bangladesh said Wednesday. "There are some conditions. Businessmen have to be members of recognised trade bodies," high commissioner Dato Abdul Malek bin Abdul Aziz told a discussion at the Export Promotion Bureau. He was speaking as chief guest at a programme on "Problems in exporting to Malaysia" organised jointly by EPB and Bangladesh-Malaysia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BMCCI). EPB vice-chairman Sahab Ullah and BMCCI president Abdul Matlub also spoke. Businessmen, especially exporters to Malaysia attended the discussion. The High Commissioner said that private sector people had an important role to promote Bangladesh, which often faced an image crisis outside the country. "Bangladesh has huge opportunity in doing business with Malaysia. You don't even try to sell your products in our country," Dato Abdul Malek said. He asked the Bangladeshi businesses to take initiatives to promote their goods in Malaysia so that the trade gap, that favours his country heavily, could be reduced. He said that Bangladesh's import from Malaysia was over $500 million in FY 2006-07, while its export was only $80 million. bd
