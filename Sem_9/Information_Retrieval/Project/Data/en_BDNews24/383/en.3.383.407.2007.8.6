<TITLE> Govt won't seek source of aid to flood victims: Matin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  An adviser Monday said the government would not question people on the source of aid to flood victims in what appeared a desperate attempt to get financial assistance to fight the flood fallout. "We will welcome anybody if they come forward to help the flood-affected people. I don't understand black money or white money. What is important is service to suffering humanity," MA Matin, communications adviser and chairman of the coordination committee on checking serious crimes. Matin, also shipping adviser, spoke to reporters after a presentation of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation in the conference room of the shipping ministry. His remarks came a day after chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Sunday urged those who want to contribute to the relief work to donate to the chief adviser's relief fund or to contribute to the relief funds formed in different areas. "At the moment there is problem in the relief operation of the government. We have adequate relief materials and money. However, if necessary the money recovered through an anticorruption drive will be distributed as relief," Matin said. He said the advisers were tasked with different responsibilities for distribution of relief and monitoring the rescue operation in the flood-hit areas. He said he had been given responsibilities of Comilla, Brahmanbaria, Feni and Chandpur districts. Asked whether the popularity of the makeshift government had been on the wane, he said, "I know nothing. You (journalists) would know about it." Matin welcomed advice from people for running the ministries properly but said, "I don't need any advice. The four ministries I am charged with are running well. "I have made Chittagong and Mongla seaports operational, privatised Biman. No government in the past could do what the present government has done in six months." On suggestions that the anticorruption drive was adversely impacting the economy, the adviser said, "Corruption and economy are being mingled. It is not right. Corruption crippled the country. We are trying to recover the country through an anticorruption drive." bdnew
