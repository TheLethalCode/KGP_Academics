<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) -- The Appellate Division Thursday stayed until August 14 the "entire order" of the High Court that granted bail to detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. The apex court also issued an instruction for an early disposal of the writ petition for the Awami League chief, pending with the High Court. A six-member bench of the Appellate Division, led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin issued the stay order Thursday morning after the government filed an appeal against the High Court verdict. Attorney General Fida M Kamal told bdnews24.com that the order of the Appellate Division means the case against Hasina might go on at the trial court. The nervous legal battle raged over the government decision to take the extortion case under the cover of emergency powers rules. On July 30, the High Court granted Hasina bail in the Tk 3 crore extortion case and stayed its proceedings under the emergency powers rules. The HC also gave the government two weeks' time to explain why the extortion case would not be excluded from the jurisdiction of the emergency powers rules. The government on July 31 filed an appeal seeking a stay on the High Court verdict. The court of the Appellate Division chamber judge instead of staying the order sent it to the full bench for hearing. Thursday's stay order came a day after a full-court hearing by the Appellate Division of the government appeal. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq told bdnews24.com, "The Appellate Division has stayed the High Court order until August 14. The Supreme Court has halted the High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina as well as the stay order on the proceedings of the case. "The Appellate Division ordered the parties to the case to arrange final disposal of Sheikh Hasina's writ petition by August 14." Expressing frustration over the verdict Huq said: "The Appellate Division does not have the jurisdiction to dispose of the content of such writ petitions as per article 102 of the constitution." Security was tightened on the Supreme Court premises from Thursday morning because of Hasina's case. A large number of uniformed and plainclothes security personnel including police and RAB were deployed there. Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury, former speaker Advocate Abdul Hamid and other AL leaders Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin, Dr Dipu Moni, and Hasina's personal assistant Hasan Mahmud were present. Joint forces arrested the Awami League chief on July 16 in an extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of East Coast Trading Ltd, with Gulshan Police Station on June 13. The government included the case in the emergency powers rules on July 16, hours after the Awami League chief was arrested. A writ petition was filed with the High Court on July 29, challenging the inclusion of the case under the emergency powers rules. bdnews24
