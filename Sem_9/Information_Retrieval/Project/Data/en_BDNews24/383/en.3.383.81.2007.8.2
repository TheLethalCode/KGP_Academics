<TITLE> Political leaders not so keen on flood defence: Tapan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)Disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury Thursday said political leaders showed a laidback attitude to efforts to fight the fallout from floods. "The few responses we have received are from nongovernmental organisations," he said at a press conference at the Local Government Division. The adviser hoped that the political leaders would come forward to help lift flood victims out of the crisis. "I don't think their reluctance is because of the state of emergency. They don't need political banners to help the distressed people. "If anybody wants to help the flood victims, the government will help him. He won't be harassed," he added. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal who also attended the press conference said: "Two water purifying mobile plants are supplying drinking water to flood-affected areas. Each plant can disinfect 2,000 liters of water an hour." Separately, law adviser Mainul Hosein told reporters, "It will be very inhuman if any political party wants to use its banner and tries to use relief work for political ends." Once again the adviser mentioned that the government is not willing to accept aid from any foreign country or donor. "We will face the situation with our internal assistance," he said. bdnews
