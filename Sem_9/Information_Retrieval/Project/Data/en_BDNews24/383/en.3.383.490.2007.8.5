 LONDON, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A civilian plane crashed shortly after taking off from a British airport killing up to four people, an Isle of Wight Airport spokesman said on Sunday. "We think there were four people on the plane," Isle of Wight Airport manager Richard Steele said. The Piper Cherokee plane was travelling from Sandown, where the airport is located, to an unspecified destination in France, but crashed within a minute of taking off. "The airport's fire services responded rapidly, supported by the local fire brigade," added Steele. Sunday's crash is being investigated by the Air Accidents Investigation Bran
