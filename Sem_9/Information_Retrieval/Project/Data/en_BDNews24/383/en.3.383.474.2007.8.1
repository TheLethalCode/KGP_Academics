 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) - The train on trial reached Bangladesh territory from Kolkata Wednesday and was expected to arrive in Dhaka later in the day, an official said. The "Moitree Express' reached Darshana station in Kushtia at 12:45pm after it left Kolkata at 7:00am Bangladesh time, said railway additional director general Kazi Asadullah. The train, which went to West Bengal Sunday, made its follow-up trip after an Indian train had earlier visited Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi delegation held a two-day discussion with their Indian counterparts to overcome some disputed issues for a formal launch of the services. Asadullah said the two sides moved closer to open the services and a formal date would be decided later. The officials have agreed to initially run two trains, one from Bangladesh and the other from India, every week, he said. The trains will run Saturday and Sunday, he said, adding that the number of trains will increase upon better infrastructure in future. A train will leave Dhaka for Kolkata Saturday and it will travel back from Kolkata Sunday. Similarly, another train will leave Kolkata Saturday and will go back Sunday, he said. On July 8, a 32-member Indian delegation came to Dhaka for the first round of their discussions. The fares for Dhaka-Kolkata single journey have been fixed at $8, $12 and $20 for different classes. bdnews24.com/
