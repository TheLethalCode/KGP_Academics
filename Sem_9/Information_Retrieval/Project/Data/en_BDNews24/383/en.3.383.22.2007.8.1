 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)Up to two-thirds of patients currently seeking medical treatment for fevers may be suffering from one of three major seasonal ailments, a leading medical practitioner said Wednesday. The three major viral illnesses to look out for are dengue, German measles and viral infections of the upper respiratory tract. Hundreds of patients with complaints of high fever have, of late, been diagnosed in leading hospitals in the capital including Dhaka Medical College Hospital, BSMMU hospital, Dhaka Shishu Hospital, Infectious Diseases Hospital and National Hospital. Professor FM Siddique, an expert in internal medicine at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, told bdnews24.com that all three categories of infection are seasonal and warned that they should not be taken lightly for ordinary sickness as a normal fever can worsen when neglected. "Dengue fever can be identified as having symptoms of aches in the head and joints and sudden onset of fever that persists for 5-6 days. On the 6th day, rashes appear as a reaction to the viral infection," he said. Professor Siddique suggested those who fear they may have contracted dengue to go for routine blood tests in which pathologists are likely to look for platelet and red blood cell counts. The symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections are easily identifiable. The infection starts with a running nose and sore throat together with fever and bodily aches. A persistent cough is a major symptom. German measles appear with rashes on the face on the fourth day of its infection. The rashes gradually spread to other parts of the lower body, accompanied by mild aches and fever. Professor Siddique also warned that typhoid, in addition to the three major viral infections mentioned, cannot be ruled out in this season. During typhoid infection, said the doctor, fever persists for about seven days, with body and headaches being common. bdne
