 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Stocks Exchange Wednesday halted spot trading of seven companies after the Central Depository Bangladesh Limited, through which trading on the spot market is done, failed to run day-end cycle needed to settle transaction. The companies are BRAC Bank, DESCO, Summit Power, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, Progressive Life Insurance, Standard Bank and Prime Life Insurance. Normal transaction however continued and the bourse shrugged off a recent Securities and Exchange Commission directive in the midday trade, buoyed by price spirals of pharmaceuticals, bank, engineering and leather shares. "Spot trading of all demoted companies are being halted for the time being because of the failure of CDBL to run EOD [end-of-day cycle]," said a DSE notice. DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan was not available for comment. MH Abdus Samad, CDBL chief executive, said about a two-hour delay in processing prompted the DSE to halt the trading. "They (DSE) have halted the trading a precautionary measure," the CDBL chief said. "Increased corporate actions and trading have caused the delay," he told bdnews24.com. Spot trading on the Chittagong Stock Exchange however continued. "We have had no problem in settling the spot trading as today's spot trade will follow the previous trade settlement," said Md Atiquzzaman, general manager, compliance, of the CSE. On the DSE, the DGEN or general index added 12.88 points or 0.54 percent to reach 2397.06 at 12:07pm. The DSI or all-share price index rallied 24.26 points or 1.25 points to 1961.09. Indices rose amid buying pressure in the first two hours to midday trade but started going down as investors locked in gains. Turnover stood at Tk 394.82 million. On Tuesday, total turnover was Tk 1.16 billion. Gainers dominated losers 105 to 35, while six issues held steady. At 12:03pm, Square Pharma emerged as the leader on the turnover board followed by Rupali Bank and UCBL. Aftab Auto and Apex Tannery were next to UCBL. Buying pressure drove Square to Tk 5360 from Tuesday's close at Tk 5284. Rupali Bank went up to Tk 1403 from Tk 1168.75 on anticipation of its speedy handover to a Saudi buyer Prince Bandar Bin Abdul Rahman Al Saud.
