<TITLE> New Nigerian president reshuffles top brass </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LAGOS, July 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new Nigerian president has retired more than a dozen generals and redeployed officers from command positions in what the president's office said on Tuesday was a routine reshuffle. The changes came two months after President Umaru Yar'Adua took office and were interpreted by analysts as a generational shift in the top brass following the appointment of a new chief of defence staff in May. The retirements were approved by the army council in June, while the redeployments were made to fill the vacancies created, a statement from the president's office said. "The retired officers are those who were due for retirement having spent the stipulated 35 years in service. In fact, most of the officers were commissioned on March 1, 1972," the statement said. "No other motives should be ascribed to this purely routine movement of personnel in the Armed Forces," it added. Analysts and a defence spokesman had earlier said the retirements and reshuffle were to be expected. "This type of thing happens when there is a change of leadership," said a military analyst, who asked not to be named, noting that all the retired generals were from the year above the new chief of defence staff, Andrew Azazi. "What is clear is that the changes were engineered from within the military," the analyst added. Officials did not say how many people were affected by the retirement. Nigerian newspapers reported that between 13 and 20 army and air force generals would be retired from next month. Four officers commanding various divisions of the army have also been redeployed to either the army or defence headquarters, a Defence Ministry spokesman said. Yar'Adua took the helm of Africa's top oil producer on May 29 after elections deemed "not credible" by international observers because of widespread vote-rigging. The president doubles as commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Yar'Adua named his first cabinet last week, keeping the vital energy portfolio under his direct control and appointing an experienced banker as finance minister. Nigeria has Africa's largest army and its troops are conducting peacekeeping duties in Darfur. The government has agreed to send a battalion to Somalia but has yet to deploy them. The oil exporting country was ruled for two-thirds of its independent life by military dictators, but analysts say the risk of another coup is slim. Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999 and this year's election witnessed the first transition from one civilian leader to another since independence from Britain in 19
