<TITLE> Rangs Bhaban rocks GP network </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) -- The mobile phone services of Grameenphone have been facing disruptions as equipment relocation efforts shifted into gear at the controversial Rangs Bhaban Thursday. The building had housed part of the leading cellphone provider's network that supports more than 1.5 million subscribers. GP's chief technical officer M Shafiqul Islam was found frantically supervising the removal of network hardware from the building that faces probable demolition. "I'm not at all in a position to discuss anything right now," he said while also yelling at the labour contractor to be careful with the handling of precious hardware. "All I can say is, the service disruption will be minimised as much as possible," the technical boss of GP said before climbing the dusty stairs of Rangs Bhaban. The building authorities have abruptly shut down the elevator right before midnight, which has caused a great deal of trouble to its deeply troubled tenants. "Quality of services may be occasionally compromised in Jigatala, Rayerbazar and the adjacent Dhanmondi residential area," Grameenphone general manager Syed Yamin Bakht told bdnews24.com. He said the GP customers in Tangail, Jamalpur and Munsiganj may be also temporarily out of coverage. He said GP began the removal of its gears from Rangs Bhaban before the Supreme Court verdict on Thursday. It expedited the relocation after the verdict was delivered. Gazi Majhar Habib said they are shifting their equipment to their Tejgaon warehouse. bdnews2
