<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will acquire the land of Rangs Bhaban to build a link road, housing and public works adviser Mainul Hosein said Thursday. He told reporters in his office that the court had ordered the demolition of the 22-storey building's 16 floors from top. The court gave the verdict as the building was constructed violating civil aviation rules, said Mainul, also law adviser. Rangs Bhaban stood as a symbol of the misuse of power and the court verdict proved that none is above the law, he said. An official with the works ministry confirmed to bdnews24.com that the demolition drive would start Friday morning. Meantime, Rangs Bhaban authorities filed an appeal to halt the Appellate Division verdict that ordered the demolition. A formal "review appeal" will be filed after Rangs Bhaban receives a copy of the court order. Mainul said the illegal construction of Rangs Bhaban had obstructed the expansion of the Tejgaon-Mohakhali Road on the eastern side of Bijoy Sarani. The public works adviser further said the final plan for construction of the link road was now awaiting government approval. It has been learnt that the government would acquire the lands of another 34 houses in the same area and landowners would be compensated, he said. bdnews24.c
