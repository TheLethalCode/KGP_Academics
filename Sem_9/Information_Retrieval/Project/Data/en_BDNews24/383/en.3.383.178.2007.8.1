<TITLE> Nicaragua's Ortega offers US a trade on missiles </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MANAGUA, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nicaragua's leftist president, Daniel Ortega, offered on Tuesday to give hundreds of Soviet-made anti-aircraft missiles to the United States in exchange for medical equipment or helicopters. Washington wants Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla and Cold War enemy, to destroy or hand over more than 1,000 SA-7 shoulder-fired missiles, which it says could be used by terrorists to shoot down airliners. Nicaragua has been considering destroying 650 of the missiles, and keeping the rest for self-defense purposes. "We'll turn over these rockets and they can take them away if they want," Ortega said in a speech. "But in exchange for medical technology -- and not second-hand equipment." He also said he would accept helicopters in return for the missiles. Nicaragua, one of Latin America's poorest countries, has already destroyed half of 2,000 missiles supplied by the Soviet Union in the 1980s, when Ortega led a Marxist government fighting a civil war against US-backed rebels. Ortega has warned a US plan to help neighboring Honduras buy airplanes means Nicaragua should not drop its defenses altogether. Honduras and Nicaragua were bitter rivals during the 1980s, when Washington beefed up Honduras' military and air force and used its main Central American ally as a base for the Contra rebels it funded to fight Ortega's government. Honduras says the light aircraft paid for by Washington are for hunting drug smugglers and helping in natural disasters.
