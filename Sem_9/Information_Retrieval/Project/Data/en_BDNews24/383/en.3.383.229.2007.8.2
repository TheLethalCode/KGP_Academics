<TITLE> Tough talk on Pakistan from US Democrat Obama </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama said on Wednesday the United States must be willing to strike al Qaeda targets inside Pakistan, adopting a tough tone after a chief rival accused him of naivete in foreign policy. Obama's stance comes amid debate in Washington over what to do about a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban in areas of northwest Pakistan that President Pervez Musharraf has been unable to control, and concerns that new recruits are being trained there for a Sept. 11-style attack against the United States. Obama said if elected in November 2008 he would be willing to attack inside Pakistan with or without approval from the Pakistani government, a move that would likely cause anxiety in the already troubled region. "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will," Obama said. The Illinois Democrat is trying to convince Americans he has the foreign policy heft to be president after a rival candidate, New York Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton, questioned his readiness to be commander in chief. Clinton last week labeled Obama naive for saying he would be willing to meet the leaders of Iran, Cuba, Syria, North Korea and Venezuela without preconditions in his first year in office. A poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News said Clinton has widened her lead over Obama, going up to 43 percent in July from 39 percent in June. Obama tallied 22 percent, down from 25 percent in June. Those polled cited Clinton's experience and competence highest among her positive attributes. Obama said he would make hundreds of millions of dollars in US military aid to Pakistan conditional on Pakistan making substantial progress in closing down training camps, evicting foreign fighters and preventing the Taliban from using Pakistan as a staging area for attacks on Afghanistan. White House spokesman Tony Snow said Pakistan was working hard to fight al Qaeda and the Taliban, and Washington was doing what it could in support. "At the same time, we recognize the sovereignty of the Pakistani government and realize that they're putting on a serious push ... They're taking the fight to al Qaeda," Snow said. Clinton, in an interview with the American Urban Radio Network, stressed the importance of the Pakistanis "taking the actions that only they can take within their own country." But she did not rule out US attacks inside Pakistan, citing the missile attacks her husband, then-President Bill Clinton, ordered against Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in 1998. "If we had actionable intelligence that Osama bin Laden or other high-value targets were in Pakistan I would ensure that they were targeted and killed or captured," she said. Another Democratic candidate, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, said he would not hesitate to use force against extremists but said, "I believe we must first use maximum diplomatic and economic pressure on states like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia to take all necessary actions to stop al Qaeda." Obama criticized President George W. Bush's emphasis on al Qaeda in Iraq and said as president he would end the war there and refocus efforts on the al Qaeda threat in Afghanistan and Pakistan by sending at least two additional US brigades to Afghanistan. He said that "because of a war in Iraq that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged, we are now less safe than we were before 9/11." US incursion talk unhelpful - Pakistani governor Talk by US officials and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama on striking against al Qaeda targets on Pakistani territory undermine Pakistan's fight against militants, a senior official from the beleaguered American ally said on Wednesday. Governor Owais Ahmed Ghani of Baluchistan, a southwest Pakistani province that shares a long border with Afghanistan, said such remarks play badly in Pakistan and could backfire "It sends a very bad signal to our public back home and they become very agitated over it and that puts pressure on the government and I think it doesn't help," he said in Washington in response to campaign remarks by Obama on Wednesday. Speaking amid debate in Washington over what to do about a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban in areas of northwest Pakistan, Obama said if elected in November 2008 he would be willing to attack inside Pakistan with or without approval from the Pakistani government. Ghani said the feeling in his frontline, Muslim country was that "We've had to pay a big price" in hundreds of fallen soldiers and multiple terror attacks as it has backed the US fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda. "If that is the sort of appreciation you get, then why bother at all?" the governor told Reuters in an interview. Pakistan has bristled at statements from US officials suggesting the US military would not rule out attacks in Pakistan. The remarks followed the release last month of unclassified excerpts of a major US intelligence report that concluded the United States faces a heightened threat from al Qaeda in part because of the Pakistan safe haven. Ghani said the government of President Pervez Musharraf has "since 9/11 developed a huge capacity for intelligence operations (and) in problem areas, we have saturated them with troops." The problem was in Afghanistan, which he said had released militants caught and repatriated by Pakistan. Kabul also resisted Pakistan plans to tighten border controls, he said. "There are a lot of open spaces and gaps in the deployment in Afghanistan which is enabling these terrorists to function and reorganize themselves," said Ghani. Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest and most sparsely populated province, shares a rugged and porous 720-mile (1,200-km) border with Afghanistan. It also borders Iran and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, where US intelligence has speculated that al Qaeda may be regrouping. Ghani said the notion that al Qaeda was in that area is "not possible with the type of saturated deployment that we have there, but it is very much possible in Afghanistan, where there are huge gaps." Pakistan has 80,000 troops deployed in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and another 40,000 soldiers bordering that region, compared to 40,000 Afghan troops in the entire country of Afghanistan, said Ghani. Ghani's Baluchistan province, which a year ago put down a violent tribal uprising, has "normalized" and recently signed a joint venture with firms from Canada and Chile to develop the world's fifth largest copper mine, he said. "There is no organized Taliban in Baluchistan -- no base camps, no training camps, no ammo dumps, nothing. However individuals do sneak across," he said, acknowledging that there were Taliban sympathizers among the one million Afghan refugees in the province.
