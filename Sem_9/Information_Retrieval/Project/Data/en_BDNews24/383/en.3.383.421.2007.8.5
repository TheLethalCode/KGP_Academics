 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com) - The advisory committee on government purchases Sunday approved a plan to lease aircraft for Biman to ease its shortage of planes. Biman Bangladesh Airlines will complete their payments for renovated aircraft in a five-year lease-to-purchase scheme. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam chaired a meeting of the committee that also approved the import of urea fertiliser and rice. It okayed the appointment of a consultant for establishment of two power plants. The government has set aside Tk 128.58 crore in expenditure for the import of 1.87 lakh tonnes of urea through four separate tenders. In the face of continued flooding, food stocks will be propped up by buying 50,000 tonnes of rice from India at a cost of $350 a tonne. With the approval of the World Bank, Canadian firm SNC-Lavalin International will be appointed as consultants for the two power plants in Siddirganj. Law adviser Mainul Hosein, communications adviser MA Matin, industry adviser Geeteara Safiya Choudhury, energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury and cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder attended the meeting. bdnew
