<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, August (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sydney Pollack has pulled out of directing HBO Films' 'Recount' because of unspecified medical reasons. Jay Roach, best known for directing the 'Austin Powers' and 'Meet the Parents' feature comedy franchises, has signed on to direct the cable film, which chronicles the ballot recounts in Florida after the 2000 presidential election. Written by Danny Strong, 'Recount' goes behind the headlines to explore the drama of ordinary people caught in extraordinary events that would decide the leadership of the country. The telefilm remains targeted for a 2008 premiere. Pollack, whose numerous big-screen directing credits include 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They?,' 'The Way We Were' and 'The Interpreter,' will stay on as one of the executive producers of 'Recount.
