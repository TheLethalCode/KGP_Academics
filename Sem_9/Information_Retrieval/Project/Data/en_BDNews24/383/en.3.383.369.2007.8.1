 Dhaka, August 01 (bdnews24.com)  An adviser said Wednesday the emergency government's slow response to the raging floods that have battered parts of the country for weeks was a result of the state machinery's lack of preparedness. Disaster management adviser Tapan Chowdhury said it was the fault of the government officials since they could not feel the pulse of the imminent disaster to ring the warning bell in time. His comment came amid latest forecasts that the flood continued to worsen Wednesdayparticularly in the north. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed also took weeks to leave the capital, as he Wednesday visited the northern district of Kurigram to see flood victims in the impoverished region. "Flood takes place each year. It could have been easier to face the flood if we had preparations. The administration had no preparations," Chowdhury told reporters at a press conference in Dhaka. Chowdhury said he feared that the flood might turn deadlier but now it has no merit to call it a national disaster. Since observers and media have already voiced concerns that a political government would have acted better for their closeness to their constituencies, the adviser's statement has proved their concern to some extent. Despite media reports on the worsening floods for past few weeks, the government's relief activities lagged. If the government would seek cooperation of the political parties, the adviser in the news briefing said he felt no need for it. "We live in such a country where people come up with help if one is in trouble. The current situation is no exception. Political parties may come forward but the government is yet to take any decision if they will be allowed to use their party banners," Chowdhury said. The adviser said the government did not seek any overseas assistance to tackle the flood but the European Union has already showed interest to donate US$ 2 million. bdnews24.com's Kurigram correspondent reports: Fakhruddin Wednesday visited flood-ravaged areas in Kurigram district and distributed relief among victims. The CA arrived in Ulipur upazila at about 11am by helicopter and drove to Anantapur Bagua High School and College in Hatia Union where hundreds of flood victims took shelter. He distributed foods and clothes among 271 families in the shelter. He later visited the flood protection embankment that eroded by the raging waters of the river Brahmaputra. The head of the government assured the victims of enough supplies, and said there would be no crisis of food. Ahmed told reporters that 85 medical teams started working in the area to reduce sufferings of the people. The agriculture department and army have been directed to take measures to pull the flood-stricken farmers out of the crisis. He said the government would start work on the flood control project in dry season. Ahmed later left for Sirajganj. bdnews24.com/
