 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  Women and Children Affairs adviser to caretaker government Geeteara Safiya Choudhury Sunday urged the concerned authorities to create congenial atmosphere for women's participation in sports. "There are a lot of potential women in the country, but they need supports and opportunities so that they can put the nation on an honourable position," said Geeteara while speaking at a reception to the Bangladesh Women's cricket team at the National Women organisation Sunday. Bangladesh women's team emerged champions in the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) women's tournament last month. "There are a lot of potential women athletes around us, but they can't prove their worth due to lack of opportunities," said the adviser, who is also in charge of social welfare, industry, jute and textile ministries. Geeteara said, "A nation can't progress keeping half of its women population neglected." The position of women has now become more consolidated because of mass awareness and they are now joining the risky professions like defence and police services, she said Women are now getting opportunities to prove their worth in different areas including the fields of sports and culture, she added. Congratulating the champion cricketers, she hoped that the team would continue to achieve more success with hard toil and great patience. Drawing the attention of the adviser, organisers demanded a separate playground, higher training and initiative at district level for grooming up the women cricketers.
