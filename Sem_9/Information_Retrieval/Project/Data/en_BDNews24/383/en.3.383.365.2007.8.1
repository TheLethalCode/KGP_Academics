 NEW YORK, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Home builder shares fell sharply on Wednesday as credit concerns mounted due to the widening effect of the crumbling US housing market, and Beazer Homes USA Inc. dropped more than 40 percent before bouncing off the lows. According to several sources, there were rumors in the market earlier in the day that Beazer was facing a possible bankruptcy or that an SEC investigation into Beazer was becoming more serious than expected. However, one options analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he had heard a large Wall Street firm tell its clients that the bankruptcy rumors were unfounded. Another analyst, JMP Securities analyst Alex Barron, also doubted the rumor. "From their financial statement, they appear to be in better shape than other home builders." The Beazer fall was its biggest one-day slide since the company went public in February 1994, according to Reuters Data, and was bringing the broader market lower. The Dow Jones Home Construction index .DJUSHB> was down more than 3.3 percent. Beazer shares were down 16.3 percent at $11.70 near midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $48.60 to $13.93. Other names in the sector were also lower in Wednesday morning trade. Hovnanian Enterprises was down 8.8 percent at $12.13; Lennar was down about 3 percent at $29.60; and D.R. Horton shares were off 3.3 percent at $15.77. Shares of many of the publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) were also trading lower. The cost to insure the debt of investment-grade home builders jumped by an average 30 to 40 basis points on Wednesday on concerns about further weakness in the housing sector. Lennar's credit default swap spreads, for example, widened to around 250 basis points, or $250,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, from around 215 basis points on Tuesd
