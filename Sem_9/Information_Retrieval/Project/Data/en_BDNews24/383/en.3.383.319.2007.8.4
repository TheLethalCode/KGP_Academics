<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 4 (bdnews24.com)  Police Saturday started confiscating the property of Basundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, popularly known as Shah Alam, four days after a Dhaka court issued an order for it in a tax-dodge case. Police started making a list of goods and other valuables in his house on Road No. 88 in Gulshan-2. Gulshan police sub-inspector Faruque Hossain told bdnews24.com: "It will take at least two days to seize all goods in the three-storey building." The house is nearly abandoned as the controversial businessman and his family are evading arrest. The police found only security guards taking care of the palatial building. Faruque said the police would lock the house after seizure of the goods. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on July 31 issued a warrant of arrest against eight people, including Alam, his wife and three children. The court also issued an order for property confiscation and asked the police to file a seizure report on Aug 6. Deputy tax commissioner of the National Board of Revenue Kabir Uddin Mollah filed a case against Alam for evading Tk 8.26 crore in tax for 2004-2007. The case was filed under the Income Tax Ordinance 1984 and the Emergency Powers Rules. The accused include Alam, his wife and company director Afroza Begum, director Sadat Sobhan (son), director Sayem Sobhan (son), deputy managing director Mostafizur Rahman and chartered accountant MS Quddus for Basundhara. bdnews24
