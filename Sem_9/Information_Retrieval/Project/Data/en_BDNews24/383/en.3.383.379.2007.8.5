 BAGHDAD, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US forces in Iraq said on Sunday they had killed the mastermind of an attack on a gold-domed Shi'ite shrine last year that triggered the worst phase of the country's spiral into sectarian violence. US forces said they had killed the top al Qaeda leader in Salahuddin province, Haitham al-Badri, whom they blamed for the pivotal 2006 attack on Samarra's al-Askari mosque. That attack, which brought down the shrine's famed golden dome, inspired widespread revenge killings and is seen as the trigger for the war's deadliest phase, when an insurgency mainly of Sunnis against U.S. forces turned into a sectarian conflict pitting Iraq's main communities against each other. U.S. and Iraqi leaders also blame Badri for a second attack on the same shrine seven weeks ago which toppled its minarets. Military spokesman Rear Admiral Mark Fox told a news conference Badri and several other gunmen were strafed by a US helicopter after they were seen preparing an ambush east of Samarra. "Eliminating al-Badri is another step in eliminating the cycle of violence. We will continue to hunt down those terrorists intent on creating a Taliban-like state," Fox said. Washington painted a picture of a successful campaign against the Sunni militant group al Qaeda in Iraq, notably in Salahuddin, which encompasses the mainly Sunni towns and villages in the fertile Tigris valley north of Baghdad. US forces said a week-long Iraqi police crackdown on al Qaeda in Samarra had netted 80 suspects. Among the other al Qaeda figures reported captured over the past few days in the province were the group's local leaders for the cities of Samarra and Tikrit, home town of ousted leader Saddam Hussein. The US military said last week it had killed the al Qaeda leader in Mosul in Nineveh province further north. US and Iraqi officials frequently say they have killed or captured leading al Qaeda figures, and the precise role any particular individual may have played in the shadowy militant group is often difficult to assess. Washington says its military strategy of sending 30,000 additional troops to Iraq this year and spreading them in neighbourhoods is having success, but has complained about the failure of Iraqi politicians to make progress at the same time. Violence against civilians continued. A barrage of mortars at dawn killed at least 11 people as residents lined up for fuel at a Baghdad petrol station. Police said overnight they had found 21 corpses dumped throughout the city. Top Iraqi political leaders are due to meet in the next few days to try to salvage a governing coalition that was supposed to help end sectarian violence by including members of all of Iraq's major groups, but which has failed to enact laws which Washington says are vital to reconciliation. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki announced that he was refusing to accept the resignations of six Sunni ministers, whose walkout last week sparked a political crisis. The largest Sunni group, the Accordance Front, has said it would pull Deputy Prime Minister Salam al-Zobaie and five other ministers out of the cabinet. "We are insisting on our position. For us, the matter does not end with Maliki accepting or rejecting the resignations," senior parliamentarian Saleem al-Jubouri told Reuters. "We are talking about a programme. The issue is if he accepts or rejects our programm
