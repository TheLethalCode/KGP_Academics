<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Wednesday deferred hearing on an appeal for cancelling the MiG-29 purchase corruption case against Sheikh Hasina by a week. Headline corrected The court will hear the case on August 7 upon the appeal by the former prime minister. A two-member panel of Justice Nazrul Islam Chowdhury and Justice Md Ataur Rahman gave the ruling after Hasina's counsel barrister Fazle Noor Taposh sought a three-week deferment of the hearing. He argued that Hasina's chief counsel had returned the case documents and a new lawyer would have to be assigned. Taposh also told the court the hearing needed to be deferred since the same court was set to hear another case, the Meghnaghat power project corruption case, on August 22. The court initially refused to delay the hearing, on the ground that appeals for staying the hearing had been entertained on several occasions. But it allowed time after barrister Taposh again pleaded for postponement of hearing for at least a week. Deputy attorney general Abdur Rouf opposed the time extension. Abdullah Al Jahid, an official of the now-defunct Bureau of Anti-corruption, had filed the case against the Awami League chief on December 11, 2001. The case involves the procurement of eight MiG-29 warplanes during Hasina's 1996-2001 term in office. According to the case details, Hasina had allegedly made the government count Tk 700 crore in losses by signing the purchase order for the fighter jets in 1999. Charges were pressed on January 29, 2003, accusing five persons including Hasina. In 2003, the High Court had frozen the proceedings of the case in the trial court after Hasina appealed for quashing the case. bdnews24
