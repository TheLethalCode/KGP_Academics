<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 5 (bdnews24.com)  Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain Sunday asked the government to channel Tk 650 crore recovered from corruption suspects into rehabilitation of the flood victims. He also suggested chief advisor Fakhruddin Ahmed formally urge the nation to come forward concertedly in aid of the people hit by the ongoing floods. "We know that around Tk 650 crore has been recovered from the corruption suspects. This money can be allocated for rehabilitating the flood-hit people", he said at a news conference at the National Press Club. Dr Kamal said people should come forward without any fear or qualm to stand beside the struggling people in flood-hit areas of Sirajganj, Tangail, Manikganj, Gaibandha, Bogra and other districts. "It is not honourable or desirable that people should think about their political career now," Dr Kamal said. He urged all sink their individual or group identities and be one with the suffering grassroots. Under the banner of 'Sammilita Nagorik Udyog', Dr Kamal organised the emergency press conference, attended by eminent citizens such as writer Abul Momen. Dr Kamal said he, Momen and other members of the organisation visited the flood-hit districts to witness people's sufferings. "As a lawyer, I'm telling you all that there is no legal bar to stop anyone from helping the flood-affected people. "If I were in the government now, I would assure people that they might spend as much money as they wanted to help the flood victims," he said. The human-rights activist said people had been passing days on whatever high and dry chunks of lands they could reach with whatever belongings they managed to save, without water, food and other bare necessities. "It is our tradition to face floods all united. In November 1970, the brave people of Bangladesh had faced the most terrible cyclone and tidal surge ever heroically mustering concerted efforts under a martial law government," the Gano Forum president said recalling the November 12, 1970 cyclone which had claimed a million lives. He urged the government and others to aid the farmers with loans and Aman-Ropa seeds and implements as soon as floodwaters receded. bdnews
