<TITLE> Inequality deep despite 40 years of anti-discrimination laws </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Deep inequalities and discrimination persist in Britain despite 40 years of anti-discrimination legislation, a report by a parliamentary committee said on Thursday. Disabled people and some Asian women are particularly affected by the entrenched discrimination, and they are unlikely to ever achieve parity in the workplace if current trends continue, the communities and local government committee said. The MPs blamed the lack of unified anti-discrimination legislation and delays in producing a review of existing discrimination law on the lack of progress in rooting out inequalities. "It has raised fears that equality issues have slipped down the government's agenda," the committee said. "Equalities legislation has grown piecemeal over the past four decades and a Single Equality Act to unify it must not be further delayed." Committee Chairwoman Dr. Phyllis Starkey said the act was necessary "to reduce the complexity of existing equalities legislation and to increase the effectiveness of the law in supporting individuals and organisations in reducing discrimination". Despite legislation that gives an individual the right to the same contractual pay and benefits as a person of the opposite sex, women will not see the gender pay gap closed until 2085, the report said. Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are particularly affected by inequality, and the committee warned that ethnic groups would not see parity until 2105 even though Britain has had legislation since the 1970s that makes it unlawful to treat a person less favourably than another on racial grounds. The committee said tackling the issue of inequality had economic and social benefits as well as moral importance. The government's proposed Single Equality Bill aims to simplify current laws by drawing together all pieces of legislation. Experts have suggested that a Single Equality Act could simplify employer responsibilities and strengthen the rights of individuals.
