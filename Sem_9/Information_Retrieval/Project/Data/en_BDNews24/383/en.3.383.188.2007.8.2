 KARACHI, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) will not allow current or former players still involved with the board to play in the unofficial Indian Cricket League, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said on Thursday. "The ICL is not recognised by the International Cricket Council or its member boards so there is no question of our players going to play there," Ashraf told reporters. Sources close to some of the players said Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik had received offers days after former captain Inzamam-ul-Haq confirmed he had been approached by the organisers. The ICL has signed former West Indies captain Brian Lara for the Twenty20 series to be played over 45 days starting in October. Ashraf said any player who decided to play in the league would not be selected again for Pakistan. "We have clauses in our central contracts clearly outlining the board decides where the players can play," he said. "Even where former players are concerned if they are not holding any position with the board we can't stop them. But those who are working for us will not be given permission to play in the Indian league." India's cricket board has also refused to endorse the league
