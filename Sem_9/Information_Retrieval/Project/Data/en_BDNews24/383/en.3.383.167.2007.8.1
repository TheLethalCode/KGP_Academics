 GHAZNI, Wed Aug 1, Afghanistan (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan army choppers dropped leaflets warning the Taliban of an assault to rescue 21 South Korean hostages, whose captors said were still alive after another deadline expired. There was no confirmation that a military operation had begun in Ghazni province, where the Christian volunteers were abducted nearly two weeks ago by the Taliban. The Islamist insurgents, who are demanding the release of rebel prisoners, killed two men from the original group of 23 after previous deadlines they had set expired. "The hostages are alive," Khowja Seddiqi, district chief of Qarabagh, told Reuters. "The national army has dropped leaflets from helicopters telling people in several districts to evacuate their houses because it wants to launch an operation." Afghan army and foreign troops were stationed in the area, but no operation to rescue the hostages had begun, Seddiqi said. A Taliban spokesman also said the hostages were alive, and that there was no sign of a bid by the military to rescue them. Earlier the Defence Ministry said the Afghan National Army had launched an operation in Ghazni, but insisted it was "routine" and was not linked with the kidnapping. The BBC, quoting local officials, said fighting had erupted in the area where the hostages were being held. Earlier in the day, a Taliban spokesman said the group was expecting to hear from Afghan mediators over its demand for the government to free rebels from jail, but insisted some of the hostages would be killed if that demand was not met by 3:30 a.m. EDT. The Afghan government has said giving in to rebel demands would only encourage more kidnapping. President Hamid Karzai was criticized in March after releasing a group of Taliban prisoners in return for the freedom of an Italian journalist. However, the head of the Afghan government team tasked with trying secure the release of the hostages has not ruled out use of force to end their ordeal. The hardline Islamist movement has repeatedly said any use of force would jeopardize the lives of the hostages. "We have sent a message to the Afghanistan government that a rescue operation should not take place without the South Korean government's consent," said a South Korean Foreign Ministry official. The hostages' desperate relatives, keeping an agonizing vigil in Seoul, appealed to the US government to intervene. South Korean lawmakers also made a joint appeal to Washington to act. The group of 23, including 18 women, was sent by a Christian church in Seoul to do relief work in Afghanistan. The Taliban spokesman said two women among the 21 Koreans were now seriously ill. "The majority of the hostages are ill, but two females are seriously ill and there is this possibility that they may die," Qari Mohammad Yousuf told Reuters by telephone from an undisclosed location. He said the pair suffered from an unknown illness and the Taliban did not have the right medicines to treat them. The abduction of the Koreans comes after 18 months of rising violence in Afghanistan, the bloodiest period since the Taliban were ousted from power by U.S.-led and Afghan forces in 2001. A day before seizing the Koreans, the Taliban abducted two German aid workers and five Afghan colleagues in Wardak province, which, like Ghazni, lies to the southwest of Kabul. One German was found shot dead and one of the Afghans managed to escape. The other German and four Afghans were still being held. The Taliban have demanded Germany pulls its 3,000 troops out of Afghanistan as the main condition for freeing the other Germ
