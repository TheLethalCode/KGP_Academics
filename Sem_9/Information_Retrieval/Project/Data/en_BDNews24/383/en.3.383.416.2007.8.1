 UNITED NATIONS, August 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council authorized on Tuesday up to 26,000 troops and police for Darfur and approved the use of force to protect civilians in Sudan's arid western region. Expected to cost more than $2 billion in the first year, the combined "hybrid" UN-African Union operation aims to quell violence in Darfur, where more than 2.1 million people have been driven into camps and an estimated 200,000 have died over the past four years. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who conducted months of talks with Khartoum, described the unanimously approved resolution as "historic and unprecedented" and said the mission would "make a clear and positive difference." The resolution, number 1769, invokes Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, under which the United Nations can authorize force. The measure allows the use of force for self-defense, to ensure the free movement of humanitarian workers and to protect civilians under attack, but acknowledges Sudan's sovereignty. The resolution, which has been watered down several times, no longer allows the new force to seize and dispose of illegal arms, saying it can only monitor such weapons. Sudan's UN ambassador, Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, told reporters, "I am comfortable with the resolution." He said the use of Chapter 7 was limited and that negotiators "went to great lengths to satisfy our concerns." The resolution authorizes up to 19,555 military personnel and 6,432 civilian police, which if deployed would be the world's largest peacekeeping force. US Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad called on Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, to provide "maximum cooperation" in deploying the peacekeepers or face sanctions. "If Sudan does not comply with this resolution, the United States will move for the swift adoption of unilateral and multilateral measures," Khalilzad told the council. "Now Sudan faces a choice," he said. "Sudan can choose the path of cooperation or defiance." Visiting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a similar sanctions threat in a speech earlier in the day. The revised text, however, dropped a threat to impose further sanctions if Khartoum balked. China's UN ambassador, Wang Guangya, who chaired the meeting, said the purpose of the resolution was to launch the hybrid force "rather than threaten sanctions." The measure was negotiated by Britain and France and also sponsored by Italy, Belgium, Congo Republic, Slovakia and Peru. Asked why Washington did not join the sponsors, Khalilzad said, "The important thing is that we voted for it and we support it." Diplomats speculated the United States did not approve of some modifications in the draft. Rape, looting, murder and government bombardment drove millions from their homes in Darfur, where mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003, accusing Khartoum of neglecting their desert region. The rebels have now split into a dozen groups, many fighting one another. Infantry soldiers will be drawn mainly from African nations unless not enough Africans can be recruited. Personnel from elsewhere in the world are expected to be used for specialized engineering and in command headquarters. The resolution calls on member states to finalize their contributions to the new force, called UNAMID, the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur, within 30 days. UNAMID would incorporate the under-equipped and under-financed 7,000 African Union troops now in Darfur. Sudan, after months of hesitation, has agreed to the troop numbers, but UN officials expect it will take a year to get the entire force in place. Khartoum also has to agree to allow units from individual countries into Sudan. The new headquarters should be running by Oct. 31, and UN members were urged to cover costs as soon as possible for the AU troops. The combined force is to be in charge of all operations by Dec. 31. Jane Holl Lute, an assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping, said the department would work "non stop" between now and the end of the year, to get accommodations, fuel and communication as well as General Assembly financial approval. "It is an unprecedented undertaking, in scale, complexity and importance," she told reporters. China says implementation of Darfur move crucial China said on Wednesday proper implementation of a UN resolution sending peacekeepers to Darfur was crucial while the European Union said Beijing's role was key in getting the plan approved. "Good implementation of the resolution is of greater importance as the peacekeeping operation makes progress," Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said in Manila, where he is attending an Asian security forum. "The international community should take effective measures to promote the political process concerning Darfur in order to seek a comprehensive solution of the issue." On Tuesday, the UN Security Council authorised up to 26,000 troops and police for Darfur and approved the use of force to protect civilians in Sudan's arid western region. Sudan said it was comfortable with the resolution after changes. The resolution has been watered down several times and no longer allows the new force to seize and dispose of illegal arms, saying it can only monitor such weapons. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who was also in Manila, said China's influence over Sudan was clear. "I think the most important outcome of that is the fact that last night the resolution finally has been approved," he told reporters. "I think the resolution, with the modifications that have taken place during the last minutes, I think it's a good resolution." China is the biggest foreign investor in Sudan and buys much of its oil. It has been generally reluctant to back UN action that would override Sudanese objections. The resolution, number 1769, invokes Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, under which the United Nations can authorise force. The measure allows the use of force for self-defence, to ensure the free movement of humanitarian workers and to protect civilians under attack, but acknowledges Sudan's sovereignty. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who is also in Manila, said on Wednesday he welcomed the UN resolution. "Australia would like to provide some support to the UN peacekeeping. We are looking at providing some doctors and nurses." Violence cuts aid to 500,000 in Darfur-UN official Attacks and banditry has left some 500,000 needy Darfuris out of reach of the world's largest aid operation in Sudan's remote west, a UN official said on Tuesday. More than 12,000 humanitarian staff in Darfur assist 4.2 million people whose lives have been disrupted by four years of revolt. International experts estimate 200,000 have died in the fighting and from famine and disease. "We are under attack every day: We have areas where we can't go to, we have hijacks every day, we have aid workers attacked every day," Mike McDonagh, north Sudan manager for the UN Office for the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), said. "In May 2006, the humanitarian community had access to almost everybody. Now we do not have access to about half a million people," McDonagh told Reuters. In the past, aid workers blamed government restrictions for lack of access to the needy in Darfur, but according to McDonagh, banditry and lawlessness are now primarily to blame. "There is a lot of banditry. Some of these people may be former rebels or may be former pro-government militia," he said, adding there was at least a serious incident every day. Earlier, however, the International Committee of the Red Cross told Reuters in Geneva it had had better access to the region over the past three or four months although general lawlessness still threatened civilians. Affected communities have seen "a high level of criminality and banditry", Yasmine Dessimoz, the outgoing head of ICRC Darfur operations, said. McDonagh said bandits had hijacked 80 vehicles belonging to the humanitarian community since the beginning of the year. "Very many humanitarian staff were held at gun point which is a shocking thing for many people and, in many cases, they were detained for hours and sometimes overnight and very often they were dumped in the desert," he said. These incidents and others, said McDonagh, means humanitarian officials now have only limited access to large areas and no access to certain areas. "We are starting to see the effect of the lack of access. There is an increase in malnutrition. There are also more diseases that prey on children," he said. Rape, looting, murder and government bombardment drove 2.5 million from their homes in Darfur, where mostly non-Arab rebels took up arms in early 2003, accusing Khartoum of neglecting their arid region. Khartoum says only 9,000 people have died in the violence. Only one of three negotiating rebel groups signed an agreement with the government in Abuja, Nigeria, last year. The rebel groups have since split into several factions and aid workers say this has led to more violence, as rebel leaders lose control over fighters and bandits get more weapons. bdn
