 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com) - Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Thursday brushed aside remarks of the business community over IMF's alleged interference in the country's economic policy. He also defended the government stance on withdrawal of safeguard measures, which were meant to protect domestic industry, saying that Bangladesh was still highly protected. The adviser made the comments after a meeting with Adarsh Kishore, executive director of the IMF for the sub-continental region at the finance ministry. The business community here, in an unprecedented move Wednesday, expressed their concern over the IMF suggestion that asked the government in mid July to 'resist' a move to set up a safeguard body to assess the necessity of protecting local industries. "Bangladesh enjoys higher protection than many other countries. The import duty is still about 50 percent, including 25 percent customs duty, 15 percent supplementary duty and 3 percent advance income tax," Azizul told reporters. "The effective duty rate will be much higher if value addition is counted," he noted. The adviser said that he had told the businessmen earlier to inform him about the impact of the safeguard measures, but he said they (businessmen) had not. He said: "I don't know why they are talking about the matter now." Adarsh Kishore said that he was here to discuss the ongoing reforms and their quality. On the IMF opposition to setting up a safeguard body, Kishore told journalists, "The IMF has suggested, but this will be decided by Bangladesh." He, however, said that he represented Bangladesh and the region in the IMF and always tried to safeguard Bangladesh's interests. The finance adviser said that he had asked the IMF official to make suggestions in line with the timing and situation in Bangladesh. Later, Adarsh Kishore met Bangladesh Bank Governor Dr Salehuddin Ahmed at his office. bd
