 TEHRAN, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran, the United States and Iraq will on Monday discuss details of a committee they agreed to set up in July to help restore security in Iraq, a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying on Saturday. Arch foes Tehran and Washington, which cut diplomatic relations shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, held two rounds of rare talks in Baghdad in May and July to find ways to improve security in Iraq. In the second round of talks on July 24 in Baghdad, representatives from the United States, Iran and Iraq agreed to establish a trilateral committee to investigate issues such as support for militias and al Qaeda in Iraq. Iran's ambassador to Baghdad, Hassan Kazemi-Qomi, said officials would on Monday exchange views about the joint body. "In the coming meeting, it is expected that representatives of Iran, America and Iraq would hold expertise debates about the form and the agenda of the security committee," he told Iran's official IRNA news agency. Kazemi-Qomi, who on Friday told another Iranian news agency expert levels talks defining the work of the security committee would be held early next week, did not say who would attend Monday's meeting. Washington accuses Shia Muslim Iran of stirring up violence in Iraq. Iran denies the charge and blames the US-led invasion in 2003 for the bloodshed between Iraq's majority Shi'ite and minority Sunni Arabs. The two rounds of Baghdad talks, which only dealt with the situation in Iraq, were the highest profile face-to-face dialogue between Iran and the United States since 1979. Tehran and Washington are also at loggerheads over Iran's disputed nuclear work.
