<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)  A personal aide to Sheikh Hasina Friday said the government's decision to freeze the bank accounts of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust was a violation of basic human rights. Hasan Mahmud, the special assistant of the former prime minister, asked the government for a rethink. Mahmud made the comment when he went to the parliament building premises with an application seeking permission to meet his boss now detained in a special jail pending trial since July 16. He sent two books to the Awami League chief through prisons officials. The National Board of Revenue on August 1 asked authorities to freeze the bank accounts of Hasina's husband M Wazed Miah, son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana and her husband Shafiq Siddiqui. It also asked to block the account of the Bangabandhu Memorial Museum and another fund created to support the victims of the 2004 grenade attacks on the Awami League rally. "If Dr Wazed's account is frozen, what'll happen to his treatment? What crime Joy has committed?" he said. Wazed Miah is being treated in the city's Square Hospital with multiple complications. Mahmud said the future of 1,200 students and 44 employees were at stake since they are supported by the trust. bdnews24.com/
