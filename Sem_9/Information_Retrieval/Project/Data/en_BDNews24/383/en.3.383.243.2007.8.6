<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday asked the government to explain why August 15, the day Bangabandhu was assassinated, would not be declared a national mourning day and public holiday. The government is also to explain why the decision to cancel the national mourning day on August 15 would not be declared illegal. The High Court bench of Justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and Justice Farid Ahmed issued orders after hearing a writ petition filed by Supreme Court lawyer Md Mozammel Haque. Six people, including the cabinet secretary, chief adviser's principal secretary, law secretary and education secretary, have been asked to respond to the rule in a week. The Awami League government in 1996 declared August 15 a national mourning day in recognition of the contribution of Bangabandhu in the independence of Bangladesh. The day was also declared a public holiday. But on August 8, 2002 the BNP government in an order revoked the national mourning day and the public holiday. Haque in the petition said the country earned independence through a bloody war in 1971 led by the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. But on August 15, 1975 Bangabandhu and most of his family were murdered by some disgruntled army men. The nation is obliged to observe August 15 the national mourning day for the murder of the man who played a unique role in the creation of Bangladesh. He contended that it was the duty of the nation to keep the national flag hoisted at half-mast on the day to show respect to Bangabandhu. The petitioner said the emergency government recognised the contribution of Bangabandhu in the independence of Bangladesh. It decided to portray the real history with the contribution of Bangabandhu in textbooks. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed had also spoken of his contribution. bdnews
