 COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, Aug 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opening batsman Marvan Atapattu's international future is in doubt after the former captain asked Sri Lanka Cricket to release him from his annual central contract. "Marvan sent a letter to chief executive Duleep Mendis on Friday requesting release from his central contract," board secretary Kangadaran Mathivanan told Reuters on Monday. The 36-year-old righthander opted out of the recently completed series against Bangladesh and has been approached to play in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), a rebel Twenty20 competition being set-up by Indian broadcaster Zee TV. Sri Lanka Cricket officials are due to meet on Monday to discuss whether to ban Sri Lanka cricketers who accept lucrative contracts with the ICL. Atapattu's current contract, worth $100,000 per annum plus match and tour fees, expires at the end of March and his decision to be released is likely to rule him out of contention for series against and Australia and England later this year. Atapattu has scored 5,330 runs in test cricket at 38.90 including 16 centuries. The right-hander also scored 8,529 runs 37.57 in one-day cricket
