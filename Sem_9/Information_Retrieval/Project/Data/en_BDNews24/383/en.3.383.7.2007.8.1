 TEL AVIV, Aug 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice began a 24-hour visit to Israel and the West Bank on Wednesday carrying a Saudi pledge of support for a Middle East peace conference proposed by Washington. In talks in the region, Rice will try to inject new momentum into peacemaking between Israel and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's West Bank government following the violent takeover of the Gaza Strip by Hamas Islamists in June.

A nearly $86 million US security plan finalised ahead of her visit will provide funds to boost not only Abbas's Presidential Guard but also his National Security Forces, viewed by many Palestinians as the equivalent of an army. Olmert and Abbas are expected to meet next week, most likely in the West Bank city of Jericho. Israeli officials said ahead of Rice's visit that Olmert was prepared to discuss borders and other core issues in "general terms" that could lead to an "agreement of principles" for establishing a Palestinian state. But Olmert has not agreed to full-fledged negotiations over the three main final status issues -- borders, the status of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees -- as proposed by Abbas. Israeli officials said any commitment now could raise expectations and lead to further violence if talks broke down. Abbas aide Saeb Erekat said final-status issues should be negotiated as a packa
