<TITLE> Prices of goods to keep soaring on floods: Azizul </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com)  Supply disruptions because of the floods will spike the prices of essentials further, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Saturday. "The floods have damaged all types of crops to a great extent. Roads have gone underwater. Transportations of commodities are facing hurdles. "The prices of goods will rise until the disaster is over," Islam told reporters after opening a gathering of the members of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Managers of Bangladesh. "However, I believe it is a temporary crisis," he said. The gathering was organised in the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre to commemorate the institute's 10th founding anniversary. On what types of loss the economy would suffer because of the floods, the finance adviser said: "Nothing can be said yet. But it's for sure that there will be big losses." He, however, said the government had every preparation to fight the disaster. The government will also enact anti-hoarding laws very soon, he said. Islam stressed good governance and said weak corporate governance created indiscipline in the financial sector. The adviser referred to the Rangs Bhaban incident to say that one might make short-term financial gains by indulging in immoral acts but he was ultimately destined to fail. "One may gain financially for a limited time by indulging in activities against morality and law, he may even get social recognition. But one day in his life he will have to be accountable before law," he said. Institute president Mohammad Asadullah chaired the opening session while commerce secretary Firoz Ahmed and Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Faruque Ahmed Siddiqui also spoke. bdnews24.
