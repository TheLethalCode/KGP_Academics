 Dhaka, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladeshi cement companies have started to take advantage of a recent revision in export duty tariffs, by the Indian government. The change, which applies only to cement exports, will go some way to meet the rising demand for cement in the north-eastern states of India, which has reached 3 lakh tonnes annually. They currently produce only 1 lakh tonnes. Three companies, including Holcim Bangladesh Ltd, have already been exporting a limited amount of cement to India for two years through land ports after paying prohibitively high duty rates of 48 percent. However, these companies were unable to use the river routes due to restrictions, imposed by the Indian administration. Under the provision, domestic cement producers will have access to the Indian market at a zero duty rate on all border crossings. Holcim alone will be able to earn $6-8 million a year by exporting nearly 1 lakh tonnes of cement to India, according company officials. PN Iyer, managing director of Holcim Bangladesh Ltd told bdnews24.com: "Last week we exported an initial instalment of 500 tonnes to Karimganj in the lower part of Assam by river. " "Another shipment of 1,000 tonnes started for Gowhati in Assam on Friday. We plan to export 1-1.5 lakh tonnes every year to the region." There is a huge demand for cement in north-eastern India due to local production shortfalls. This has led the construction industry to import cement from more distant states in India at a higher price. "A tonne of cement will cost $80-90 for the Indian importers, with clinker [a component of cement] priced at $55," according to Holcim's managing director. The change was initiated through the Inter-Country Inland Water Trade and Transit Protocol, signed between the two countries in the late 1970s. The Bureau of Indian Standards has certified three Bangladeshi companies, Holcim Bangladesh Ltd, Aramit Cement Ltd and M I Cement Factory Ltd for exporting cement to India. bd
