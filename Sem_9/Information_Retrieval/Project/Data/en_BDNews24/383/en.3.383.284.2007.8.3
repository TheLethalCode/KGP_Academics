 Dhaka, August 3 (bdnews24.com)  Prices of commodities in the city went through the roof Friday mocking government interventions to lower or at least keep them stable. Green chili, selling at Tk 145 to 200 a kg Friday, was too hot to handle. It sold at Tk 80 only last week and in early July Tk 45 a kg. Retailers at Banalata kitchen market in the New Market complex and Hatirpool Bazaar said it was true the supply of vegetables was adequate, but the prices were being abnormally inflated. Prices of almost all vegetables were on the rise. In the span of one week, potol was selling at Tk 30, up Tk 10 a kg, jhinga Tk 30, from Tk 20, dherhosh Tk 28, green papaya Tk 14, kachumukhi Tk 24, bitter gourd Tk 40, kakrol Tk 28, barboti Tk 26, kachurloti Tk 20, aubergine Tk 48 and cucumber Tk 40. Potato was selling at Tk 22, tomato at Tk 80, ginger at Tk 56 and garlic at Tk 50. Turkish lentil was selling at Tk 65 and the indigenous one at Tk 74 a kg. Leafy vegetables apparently were abundant in the markets, but prices were beyond the reach of many. Every fistful of the shaak red, green spinach or kolmi was selling at Tk 15-20. Keeping with the rising costs of the vegetables, prices of rice, fish and meat also shot up. Beef was selling at Tk 170 to 180 a kg, mutton at Tk 220 to 240 and broiler chicken at Tk 85 to 95. Eggs were selling at Tk 54 to 66 a dozen. Coarse rice was selling at Tk 22, Najirshail at Tk 30, Miniket at Tk 30 and pilau rice at Tk 55 a kg. Prices of flour also increased with a kg selling at Tk 32-33. As for edible oil, a kg of soybean oil was selling at Tk 78-80 against Tk 74 the previous week. Despite a government ban on the export and hoarding of hilsa for six months, prices were still to ease. The fish was selling at prices beyond the reach of the common people. On Friday morning, it cost Tk 300 to 400 a kg at Hatirpool Bazar and a big size one cost Tk 600 to 1,000. At Banalata and Hatirpool markets, one kg of shrimp was selling at Tk 220 to 250 a kg, lobsters at Tk 450-600, katla at Tk 220-250, ruhi at Tk 160-220, tilapia at Tk 130-150, pangas at Tk 70-90, baila at Tk 250-280, batashi at Tk 280-300, golsha (tengra large) Tk 260-280 and the exclusive pabda at Tk 500-550. Buyers alleged the retailers were fleecing them despite abundant supplies. Abu Solaiman, a middle-income man who came to Banalata kitchen market to buy essentials, told bdnews24.com, "How can you buy what you really need, hey? Prices have been increasing every week without fail. We don't happen to be enjoying weekly salary hikes, Do we?" "This government has been busy rooting out corruption all right. But it is not taking care of the country's economy. No government will succeed if it loses contact with the business community," Abu Bakar Siddique, owner of Sonargaon Stores at Banalata market, said. "The company distributors used to supply us products directly and now we go to them carrying cash, but even then we are often turned back on the plea that stocks have depleted," he said. "What would you gain by writing our names? Please go to the hoarders who have been stocking goods in their warehouses and telling us that their stocks have run out," Mostafa Kamal of Mahanagar Rice Traders told bdnews24.com. "I bought a bag of paijam rice last week for Tk 1,900 and this week it is Tk 2,000 already!" he added. bdnews24.
