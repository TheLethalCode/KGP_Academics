 STOCKHOLM, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Finland striker Jari Litmanen will be out of action for up to six months because of an upcoming operation on his left Achilles tendon. The injury means the 36-year-old former Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona and Liverpool player will miss the rest of Finland's Euro 2008 qualifying campaign. "Unfortunately I have to undergo another operation, this time on my left Achilles tendon, which means it will take four to six months before I can train and play," Litmanen said on Thursday in a statement on the Web site of his Swedish first division club Malmo. "I have really enjoyed my time at Malmo. The club has always supported me," added the Finn, who has terminated his contract with the club by mutual consent. Litmanen has struggled with injuries since joining Malmo in 2005. He had not made a single appearance for the club this year. Finland are joint second with Serbia and Portugal in Euro qualifying Group A behind Poland
