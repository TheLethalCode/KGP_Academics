 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has set a full-court hearing for Wednesday on a government appeal against Monday's High Court bail to Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case. Justice Mohammed Hasan Amin of the Appellate Division gave the ruling Tuesday after a partial hearing of the government's appeal earlier in the day. However, the Appellate Division chamber judge did not stay the High Court order on the bail and the freeze on proceedings of the extortion case. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury granted bail Monday to the former prime minister who was arrested and detained in the extortion case on July 16. The High Court asked the government to remove the extortion case from the jurisdiction of the emergency powers rules. The court also gave the government a deadline of two weeks to explain why the inclusion of the case under the rules should not be declared illegal. One of Hasina's lawyers, M Enayetur Rahim, told bdnews24.com: "We will file a petition asking the Appellate Division chamber judge not to issue any stay order on the HC verdict." At Tuesday's partial hearing of the government appeal, attorney general Fida M Kamal argued that the explanation of emergency powers rules is also required alongside the writ petition by Hasina. "The High Court cannot grant her bail without explaining the emergency powers rules. It also cannot prohibit the government from proceeding with the case under emergency powers rules," the attorney general said. Hasina's chief counsel, barrister Rafique-ul Huq, replied in court: "The High Court has issued the order with regard to Hasina's appeal, giving two week's time. The government can take the initiative to settle the matter in this time." At this stage the court said the appeal should be sent to the full bench of the Appellate Division for hearing Thursday. However, the attorney general claiming the matter to be "of utmost public interest" said the hearing should be held Wednesday. He also requested a stay order on the High Court verdict until the hearing. The court set Wednesday for the hearing of the appeal in the full bench of the Appellate Division, but without giving any stay order on the High Court verdict. The attorney general told barrister Huq in court: "In the final hearing you will get no remedy. Even if Sheikh Hasina receives bail in this case she will not be released from jail." After the hearing, Fida M Kamal told bdnews24.com: "The court of the chamber judge has not stayed the High Court order. The hearing of the appeal will be held at the regular bench of the Appellate Division Wednesday morning." bdnews24.com/at
