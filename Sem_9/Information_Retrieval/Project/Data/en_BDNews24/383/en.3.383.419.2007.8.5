 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)Stocks plummeted Sunday as merchant banks initiated sell-offs in their investor portfolio accounts to reduce their loan margin ratios to reasonable levels. Merchant banks started offloading shares in their investor portfolio accounts after the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into the margin loans extended by some merchant banks to their employees, a senior SEC official, wishing anonymity, told bdnews24.com. The SEC had earlier directed merchant banks to send details on the loans they sanctioned to both current and former employees. "Some merchant banks had extended loans to their clients beyond reasonable limits," said a senior official of a merchant bank who also preferred to remain unnamed. "The market dropped after they sold the shares in their investor portfolio accounts to bring down the margin ratio to a reasonable level." As a result, almost all sectors fell on the DSE, with bank stocks leading downbeat trade. The DGEN or general index closed 42.75 points or 1.78 percent lower at 2353.37. The DSI or all-share price index shed 31.21 points or 1.59 percent to finish 1924.70. The DSE-20 blue-chip index plummeted 42.55 points or 1.97 percent to close at 2116.82. Turnover picked up to Tk 1.56 billion from Tk 1.25 billion. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange finished downbeat amid a slide in mutual funds, bank and pharmaceuticals stocks. Of the issues traded, 21 gained, 77 declined and five closed unchanged. Turnover slipped slightly to Tk 155.78 million from Tk 156.64 million. On the DSE, Square Pharma, leader in turnover at Tk 147.66 million, slumped 2.51 percent to Tk 5254.75. Summit Power grew 5.10 percent to Tk 1301.75 following its announcement last week that it would establish four more small power plants. BRAC Bank rose 1.59 percent to Tk 952.75 on buying pressure. An announcement by UCBL to begin holding annual general meetings again pulled its shares 5.93 percent to Tk 3,535.5. The bank's AGMs had remained pending since 1997. Its board decided to convene the previous five AGMs from 1998 to 2002. The bank also posted a 30 percent stock dividend announcement for 2001. DESCO, a fifth top issue in turnover, ended at Tk 960 down 3.34 percent from the previous day. Pharma Aid, 2nd ICB mutual fund and Fuwang Groceries were major gainers.
