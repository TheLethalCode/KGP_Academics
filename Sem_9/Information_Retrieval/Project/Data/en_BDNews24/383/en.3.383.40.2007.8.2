<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com)The government starts demolishing major parts of the Rangs commercial building on Bijoy Sarani Friday morning after the Supreme Court ended a tense legal battle Thursday. Dhaka city's developer Rajuk used loudspeakers in the area Thursday afternoon to announce that its workers would begin splitting the concrete of the Rangs Bhaban at 7:00am Friday. It asked the building authorities to vacate by midnight the top 16 floors of the controversial tower, which has stood tall for years illegally overlooking the prime minister's office. At least 400 workers, backed by the army and other forces, will lower hammers on the building of Rangs Group, controlled by businessman Abdur Rouf Chowdhury. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in a verdict Thursday allowed the emergency government to trim the 22-storeys, which had been constructed without official approval, to leave a 6-storey commercial building. Many by passers stopped near the building to hear the demolition announcement while curious onlookers took pictures of the condemned tower, which had served as a symbol of the thousands of unapproved structures across the city of 10 million people. Yet the final fate of the notorious Rangs Bhaban still hangs in the balance as a government adviser separately announced Thursday that the land on which the building stands will be reacquired. Public works adviser Mainul Hosein said the land was necessary to build a public link road to connect Bijoy Sarani directly with the Mohakhali road. Hosein, also the law adviser, said the building was a symbol of the "misuse of power", and the court verdict proved that "none is above the law". The adviser said the illegal construction of Rangs Bhaban had long obstructed the expansion of the Tejgaon-Mohakhali Road on the eastern side of Bijoy Sarani. He said the final plan for construction of the link road was now awaiting government approval. The government will acquire the land occupied by another 34 houses in the same area and the landowners would be compensated, said Hosein. There was no indication, however, how and when the government will acquire the land. Thursday's verdict by the Appellate Division partially upheld the government's appeal against a previous High Court order that had stayed Rajuk's cancellation of the design of the building. The Appellate Division in the ruling also said the design of the building has to be corrected. A five-strong panel led by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim delivered Thursday's verdict at 9:40am after a five-day hearing. Attorney general Fida M Kamal told bdnews24.com that the government appeal was partially granted and the court said the Rangs Bhaban design should be corrected. Kamal said the floors on top of the sixth floor up to the 22nd floor had been built without approval. He said the court rejected a plea by the Rangs Bhaban lawyers for filing an appeal against the verdict saying that no appeal hearing would be possible under the emergency rules. Barrister Rafiqe-ul-Haque, assisted by barrister Shakhawat Hossain and advocate Ahsanul Karim, stood for Rangs. Barrister Hossain told bdnews24.com that they would file a review appeal on the verdict with the Appellate Division. He said if the court stayed the latest order following their review appeal, the upper floors would not have to be demolished. Acting works secretary ASM Rashidul Hai said their job would start Friday morning. "We sought help from the army. As many as 400 workers and 40 officials will work on the site," he said. The owner of the building will bear the cost of the demolition in line with the city developer's rules, he said. Meanwhile, another high official at the ministry, preferring anonymity, said the occupants had been notified privately to move out. OWNERS STILL WANT IT THEIR WAY The Rangs Bhaban authorities later Thursday appealed the Appellate Division verdict for a review. The authorities submitted the appeal to the Supreme Court, but the hearing on the appeal was not held, as the Appellate Division chamber judge was not present at the time. The hearing will be held Sunday. In its appeal, the Rangs Bhaban authorities said a petition for formal review of the verdict would be filed after getting a copy of the Appellate Division verdict on demolition. "For this the Appellate Division verdict needs to be stayed," the appeal said. Defence counsel barrister Shakawat Hossain told bdnews24.com: "We hope the demolition of the upper parts of the building would remain suspended until the disposition of the review petition." Meanwhile, senior lawyer of the Supreme Court barrister Shafique Sahmed said: "There is no legal bar on demolition. The Appellate Division verdict can be implemented now." The court did not give any rule on the appeal filed by the Rangs Bhaban authorities to stay the order. It means the government can enforce the Appellate Division verdict for demolition." END OF AN ILLEGITIMATE BUILDING? The Rangs Bhaban was originally built during the regime of military ruler HM Ershad. When the BNP was in power from 1991-96, it made an abortive bid to demolish the building. The Awami League during its 1996-2001 rule also took an initiative to demolish the building, but was restrained by a High Court order. Rajuk had approved the design of the building on February 18, 1993, only to cancel the same approval later. Rangs authorities filed a writ petition with the High Court in 1999. The High Court in a verdict handed down on May 2, 2000 declared the Rajuk cancellation illegal. The government appealed on Dec 5, 2005 against the verdict and the Supreme Court accepted it for hearing. bdnews24.com/at/ahd-ehb/wz
