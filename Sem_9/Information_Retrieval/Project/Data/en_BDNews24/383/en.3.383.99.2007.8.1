 Jessore, August 1 (bdnews24.com)  A resident of Jessore town Wednesday filed a case against former BNP minister Tariqul Islam for grabbing land. Lutfor Rahman filed the case with a Jessore court against nine people including Tariqul, his wife Nargis Begum, son Aninda Islam Amit and president of Jubo Dal Jessore district unit Ehsanul Haque Munna. Five other accused are Zahirul Haque Chua Mia, Hasib, Zahangir Alam Tipu, Bulla and Masum. Magistrate Rafiqul Islam ordered the Kotwali police chief to take necessary steps to investigate the case. Lutfor in the case details said that the accused on May 3, 2003 demanded Tk 10 lakh in extortion from him. The accused looted his house in Chourasta Crossing of the town, where he was living, on June 12, 2003 and evicted him from the house as he failed to pay the money. The complainant said he went to file a case with the local police station but police refused to take it. Lutfor said he was indicted in a false case and had to serve a jail term. He filed the case with the court as the police refused to take the case for a second time after he was released, he added. The former minister surrendered to joint forces on Feb 5. He faces a case for misappropriating relief materials. bdnews2
