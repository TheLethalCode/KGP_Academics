 LONDON, Aug 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England forward Alan Smith joined Newcastle United from Premier League champions Manchester United on Friday in a five-year deal. Smith, whose fee was estimated by the British media to be 6 million pounds ($12.21 million), ended a three-year spell at Old Trafford, having joined from Leeds for 7 million. Though popular with the fans, the 26-year-old failed to establish himself as a first-team regular and was at one stage deployed as a defensive midfielder. He made 93 appearances for United, scoring 12 goals, and will link up with two other former Leeds players on Tyneside -- James Milner and Australia striker Mark Viduka, another new recruit. Smith could make his debut in a friendly against Italian club Sampdoria on Sunday at St James' Park, Newcastle said on their Web site (www.nufc.co.uk). Hours later Brazil centre back Claudio Cacapa became new manager Sam Allardyce's second signing within 12 hours after penning a two-year deal at St James' Park as a free agent. The 31-year-old, who left French champions Olympique Lyon at the end of last season, will be handed the No.6 shirt. The defender was Newcastle's sixth pre-season signing after strikers Smith and Mark Viduka, midfielders Joey Barton and Cameroon's Geremi, and Czech defender David Rozenhal.

The 21-year-old is a Spanish youth international
