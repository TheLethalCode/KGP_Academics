 Dhaka, August 5 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division will hear a series of appeals for permission Tuesday to move against the High Court's death sentences in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case. The five appeals, which are jargoned as "petitions for leave to appeal" were filed for as many convicts. The hearing will lift a five-year freeze on the drawn-out, landmark case that involves the killings of the independence leader and most of his family on August 15, 1975. An Appellate Division bench, comprising Justice Tafazzal Islam, Justice Joynal Abedin and Justice Md Hasan Amin, will hear the appeals. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed told reporters: "A special bench was formed with three judges of the Appellate Division to hear the appeals." "All formalities for the hearing have been completed. State defence lawyers have also been appointed to stand on behalf of those still at large." Twelve of the convicts had their death sentences upheld by the High Court's final verdict on April 30, 2001. Four of them who are currently in prison filed appeals with the Appellate Division the same year. They are former army officers: Bazlul Huda, Syed Faruque Rahman, Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan and Mohiuddin Ahmed. An appeal date was originally fixed for the four for August 16, 2001. The appeal hearing was postponed eight times before it was finally dropped from the Appellate Division on March 19, 2002. Another former army officer, AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, filed an appeal through jail authorities on June 24, 2007 following his extradition from the US. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with most members of his family on August 15, 1975. A case was filed on October 2, 199621 years after the killing. bdnews24
