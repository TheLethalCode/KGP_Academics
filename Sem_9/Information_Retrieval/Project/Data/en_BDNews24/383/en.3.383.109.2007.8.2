 LYON, France, Aug 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France goalkeeper Gregory Coupet will be sidelined for four months after damaging a knee ligament in training with his Olympique Lyon club on Thursday, the six-times French champions said. Coupet, who tore a left knee ligament after his foot got caught in the net, will have surgery on Monday. It is a severe blow for Lyon, who start the Ligue 1 season by welcoming Auxerre on Sunday, and also for France. Coupet will miss at least four Euro 2008 qualifiers and notably the next one, a potentially-decisive match against world champions Italy on Sept. 8 in Milan
