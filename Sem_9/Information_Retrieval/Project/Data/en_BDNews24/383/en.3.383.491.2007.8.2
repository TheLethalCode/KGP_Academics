 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Rangs Bhaban will stay but only with six storeys as the government Thursday secured a Supreme Court order to knock down 16 floors of the 22-storey highrise on Bijoy Sarani in the capital. The order came as the Appellate Division in a verdict partially upheld the government's appeal against a High Court order that scrapped city developer RAJUK's cancellation of the design of the controversial highrise. The apex court in the ruling also said the design of the building would have to be corrected. An Appellate Division bench of five justices led by Justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim delivered the verdict at 9:40 am after a five-day hearing. "As soon as the certified copy of the verdict arrives, we'll do our job. The government is prepared," ASM Rashidul Hai, secretary in charge, housing and public works ministry, told bdnews24.com by telephone immediately after the judgment. A high official at the ministry, preferring anonymity, said the occupants had been notified privately to move out. Attorney General Fida M Kamal told bdnews24.com that the government appeal was partially granted and the court said the Rangs Bhaban design should be corrected0 Kamal said the floors on top of the sixth floor up to the 22nd floor would have to be demolished as they were built without approval of the sanctioning authorities. He said the court rejected a plea by the Rangs Bhaban lawyers for filing an appeal against the verdict saying that no appeal hearing would be possible under the emergency rules. Rangs authority was represented by barrister Rafiqe-ul-Haque who was assisted by barrister Shakhawat Hossain and advocate Ahsanul Karim. Barrister Hossain told bdnews24.com that they would file a review appeal on the verdict with the Appellate Division. He said if the court stayed the latest order following their review appeal, the upper floors would not have to be demolished. Rajuk had approved the construction of the building on February 18, 1993, only to cancel the same approval on June 24, 1999. Rangs authorities filed a writ petition with the High Court in 1999. The High Court in a verdict handed down on May 2, 2000 declared the Rajuk cancellation illegal. The government appealed on December 5, 2005 against the verdict and the Supreme Court accepted it for hearing. bdnew
