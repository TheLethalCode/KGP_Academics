<TITLE> Libya close to buying missiles from EADS, others </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European aerospace and defence group EADS confirmed on Friday it was close to selling arms to Libya in what would be the country's firms arms deal with the West since the lifting of an arms embargo in 2004. EADS said its MBDA joint venture with Britain's BAE Systems and Italy's Finmeccanica had finalised an agreement to supply Libya with Milan anti-tank missiles and was in advanced talks on supplying radios. "This (missile) contract is awaiting the signature of the Libyan client, and EADS is happy that the negotiations could be concluded," EADS said in a statement. French President Nicolas Sarkozy clinched an accord on defence and signed a memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy deal when he visited Tripoli last week, after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in Libya. France denies an arms deal was signed in exchange for the release of the medics but Sarkozy's spokesman David Martinon said his visit may have helped the deal. "If French or Franco-German companies manage to negotiate contracts, then good, all the better for them," Martinon told France Info radio. "It's true that President Sarkozy's state visit to Tripoli was very successful because the negotiations for freeing the nurses had gone through just before and, it seems that greatly accelerated things, to the benefit of French companies." EADS made no comment on the value of the contracts. A Libyan source said earlier the missiles deal was worth 168 million euros while the one for communication systems was worth 128 million euros.
