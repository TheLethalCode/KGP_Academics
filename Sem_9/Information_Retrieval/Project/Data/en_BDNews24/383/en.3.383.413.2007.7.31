 Dhaka, July 31 (bdnews24.com) Judge Amar Kumar Roy Tuesday adjourned proceedings in the Huda trial following an exchange of heated words with the public prosecutor. It all happened while a defence witness was giving testimony in the Special Judge's Court on the Sangsad Bhaban premises in the bribery case against former communications Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda. Public prosecutor Mosharraf Hossain Kajal requested the judge to record in the proceedings for display the content of a 1973 gazette regarding the publishing and ownership of newspapers. Judge Roy replied, "This is a law. Reading it will be enough. There is no need to record it for display." The public prosecutor then argued: "It's a public document. It must be recorded. The law also says this." The judge demanded, "Are you challenging the court? Don't make unnecessary argument with the court." However, the prosecutor pressed his point: "You record a photocopy for display supplied by the defendants, but I am giving a public document and you are objecting to it." An angry Roy asked: "What do you mean? The court cannot function in this way." "This court is adjourned until tomorrow," he announced, before leaving the courtroom. After the incident, the public prosecutor told reporters: "I am fighting for truth. As per the law a public document can be recorded for display." bdnews
