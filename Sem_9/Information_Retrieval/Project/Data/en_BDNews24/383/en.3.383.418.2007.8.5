 LOS ANGELES, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - National Geographic Ventures, the media wing of the venerable science and exploration society, is launching a music and radio division to accompany its existing TV, film, magazine and digital units.

On the music front, National Geographic has been working with such artists as former Genesis frontman Peter Gabriel, surfer-turned-rocker Jack Johnson and singer-songwriter Ben Harper.

Until now, the 118-year-old National Geographic Society has been known mostly in the media for its vivid exploration of foreign cultures and the natural world as depicted in its monthly magazine and in film and TV documentaries.
