 Savar, August 1 (bdnews24.com) Firefighters have been struggling for more than 48 hours to douse a blaze that gutted most of Taiwanese-owned garment factory Zong Sine in Savar, an official said Wednesday. Four units of the Fire Service and Civil Defence launched efforts Monday to tame the fire, said Anwar Hossain, stationmaster of the DEPZ fire service. "The fire burnt most of the three-storey factory. Heavy metal-beams of all the floors were scorched. They came crumbling down," he said. The firefighters tried to hose down the fire still burning on inside the mangled remains of the structure, Hossain said. "Factory owners, soldiers and firefighters are now working together on the site," he said. Nazma Binte Alamgir, public relations officer for Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority, differed with media reports that had detailed the devastation. "Only the warehouse of the factory was burnt. No machinery was damaged," she said. "The network system collapsed as there was no power. The Zong Sine authorities will be able to submit details of the damage once power is back on after repair of electric cables," she said. Nazma did not answer questions on apparently contradictory reports on damage when bdnews24.com pressed her for further comment. Two teams have been tasked with investigating the incident, she said, without giving details for the deadline to turn in probe reports. Ashulia police chief Kamrul Islam said a general diary was filed. "There was no mention of the origin of the fire in the GD," he said. bdnews24
