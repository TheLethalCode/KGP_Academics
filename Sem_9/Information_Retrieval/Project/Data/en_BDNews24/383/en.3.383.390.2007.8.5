 Naogaon, August 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Sunday saw renewed bickering between the 'reformist' and 'traditional' factions within the BNP, with Khaleda Zia hitting back at recent comments from the party's secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan. The embattled BNP chairperson held a meeting Saturday by phone with party activists in Naogaon, who she asked to, 'Stay united and face the situation with patience'. "A conspiracy is underway to split the BNP, with Mannan Bhuiyan being chosen for the job. However, this will not succeed," she said. "Don't be misled. If necessary, I will give you direction in this matter. "The BNP is a party of this land and its people. There have been previous attempts to break up the party. They have never succeeded." During the call, the BNP chairperson stressed the need for increased cooperation between the leaders and workers of the party. "Combat the ill-conceived policies of the conspirators so that they do not succeed in splitting the party in the name of reform," she said. Naogaon District Bar Association received the call at their office, the teleconference was organised by the Noagaon branch of the Jatiyatabadi Ainjibi Forum. bdnew
