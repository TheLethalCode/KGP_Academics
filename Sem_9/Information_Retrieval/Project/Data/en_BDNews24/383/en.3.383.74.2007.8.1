 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) - Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury has said that Bangladesh is committed to peace and development, and is pleased to join the Asean Regional Forum at a time when the Asian century is dawning across the global horizon. He made these remarks when he was invited to speak as the head of the delegation of the latest nation to join the Asean Regional Forum, at a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Forum with president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo of the Philippines Wednesday. Earlier, Chowdhury met Arroyo at the Malacanang Presidential Palace. The foreign adviser said: "As all are aware, Bangladesh today is undergoing great changes. Reforms are in motion, setting up institutions that would sustain the pluralist spirit and urges of the Bangladeshi people for a long time to come." "At home and abroad we are a mainstream and moderate voice encouraging bridge-building across faiths and communities. We take great pride in the communal harmony that pervades our society," he said. "It was in this spirit," he further stated, "that a few days ago Bangladesh gifted the sacred hair of Lord Buddha to Sri Lanka, not because we wanted to be seen as generous, but because we wanted to share our heritage with the Sri Lankan Buddhists." Chowdhury praised the Philippines for the measures adopted to establish communal harmony between Christians and Muslims and added that Bangladesh would support and welcome the Philippines as an observer in the Organisation of Islamic Conference. bd
