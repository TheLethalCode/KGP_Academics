 Dhaka, August 1 (bdnews24.com) - The Supreme Court Wednesday closed a full-court hearing on a government appeal against the High Court granting bail to Sheikh Hasina in an extortion case taken under emergency power rules and set Thursday for a verdict. A six-member Appellate Division bench led by chief justice Md. Ruhul Amin heard both sides in the morning before deciding the day for the ruling. Attorney general Fida M Kamal told the court during the hearing that began at 9:25am that Hasina's writ petition has links to the emergency power rules. Justice Mohammed Hasan Amin of the Appellate Division Tuesday held a partial hearing of the government's appeal made in the morning. The Appellate Division chamber judge did not stay the High Court order on the bail and the freeze on proceedings of the extortion case. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Muminur Rahman and Justice Jubaer Rahman Chowdhury granted bail Monday to the former prime minister who was arrested and detained in the extortion case on July 16. The High Court asked the government to remove the extortion case from the jurisdiction of the emergency powers rules. The court also gave the government a deadline of two weeks to explain why the inclusion of the case under the rules should not be declared illegal. bd
