<TITLE> Trade bodies rap IMF for 'unwarranted' diktat </TITLE>

 Dhaka, August 2 (bdnews24.com)  Twelve leading business bodies have harshly criticised the IMF for its "unwarranted" move to influence the country's economic policy, a statement said Wednesday. The influential trade bodies also asked the emergency government to come out of the vicious circle of the prescription mania by the International Monetary Fund and other lending agencies. "We are extremely critical of the interference of the agencies, particularly the IMF, in influencing and trying to impose conditions and dictate terms in every trifle detail of the economic management of a sovereign country," the leaders of the business bodies said in the joint statement. The rare statement came after the government recently abandoned a WTO obligation to impose duties on imported products to safeguard local industry, apparently under pressure from donors and lending agencies such as IMF. A string of criticism has brewed over the past few months that the emergency government has been satisfying the donors and lending agencies. Akbar Ali Khan, former caretaker government adviser, criticised the government in a recent talk show on ETV, saying that he thinks no previous governments followed donors' advice so obediently in such a short span of time as the emergency government. The IMF has recently opposed the imposition of the safeguard measures and recommended a rise in the prices of gas. The government made a U-turn after it posted a gazette on imposition of safeguard measures on the National Board of Revenue website last month. The government withdrew the protection in a last-minute decision apparently to satisfy the lending agencies. The safeguard measures were designed to protect local industry. The rules, according to the document on the website, were expected to come into effect on July 1. The statement referred to a recent IMF letter to the finance ministry that directed further trade liberalisation and opposed the formation of a safeguard body to protect the local industry. It called the IMF's move "uncalled-for and unwarranted". The statement said Bangladesh, like other developing countries, has substantially liberalised its economy, much to the hardship of entrepreneurs and ordinary people. It cited experience of many Asian countries, which gained momentum in economies by framing policies within WTO obligation. They have achieved remarkable progress and transformed themselves from largely agrarian, underdeveloped economies into dynamic export powerhouses, it said. "The experience of these high performing economies provide many useful lessons for countries like Bangladesh in identifying the right policies and strategies to adopt, while reversing or shunning what have proved to be wrong strategies," it said. Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and the Philippines which made progress by coming out of "Bretton Woods prescription" could be models for Bangladesh to show the world that home-grown policies can work effectively, it said. "It is quite interesting to note that following meticulous IMF prescription Bangladesh has been experiencing double-digit inflation," it said. The business leaders took a dig at the IMF for its prescription of raising prices of gas. "It is known that an increase in gas prices automatically lead to the costs of production," it said. "The costs of doing business will also increase, which will have a direct impact on the economy and much needed employment opportunities." They demanded effective support for local industries through fiscal and other measures, including imposition of safeguard measures, to boost export and create solid industrial base for long-term benefits. International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman, Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Mir Nasir Hossain, Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Latifur Rahman, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Hossain Khaled, Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industry acting president MA Latif, Foreign Investors' Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Masih Ul Karim, Bangladesh Garment Manufactures and Exporters Association president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers Association president Md Fazlul Hoque, Bangladesh Association of Banks vice president Muhamed A (Rumee) Ali, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association president Abdul Hai Sarker, Bangladesh Insurance Association president acting chairman Nizamuddin Ahmed, Bangladesh Employer's Association president Kamran T Rahman signed the statement. bd
