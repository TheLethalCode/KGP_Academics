 LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index fell 1.2 percent on Tuesday as credit market fears returned to global equities, but Scottish & Newcastle rose on hopes Carlsberg may bid for the brewer. The FTSE 100 ended down 75.5 points, or 1.2 percent, at 6,143.5 after a choppy session in which European shares oscillated between higher and lower ground in yet another day of high volatility in global markets. The UK benchmark index has lost 2.6 percent week-to-date due to a renewed bout of worries over the health of credit markets. Low volumes in a traditionally quiet summer holiday period also exaggerated market movements in recent sessions. European shares took a downward turn in late trade after U.S. stocks stumbled on disappointing earnings from retailers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc., and as fears over a tightening credit environment worsened. Wall Street juddered after trustees for two Canadian trusts said they were unable to issue new securities to repay maturing commercial paper and that a bank had declined to provide liquidity. "People just run round like headless chickens and everyone's an armchair economist," said Dan Bunting, head of research at Fortis Private Investment Management in London. "Investors get very confused at times like this . It's the chasing tail exercise really," he added. Bruised by global fears of tightening credit conditions, banks gave up earlier gains and all ended in the red. Barclays lost 3.3 percent and Standard Chartered fell 2.6 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) dropped 1.3 percent. An RBS-led consortium seeking to win a bid battle for ABN AMRO said it had built up a 3.25 percent stake in the Dutch bank and may buy more. On the upside, long-mooted bid target Scottish & Newcastle rose 1.3 percent on talk Danish brewer Carlsberg was buying S&N stock in the market as a prelude to a bid for the firm. A spokesman for S&N declined to comment, while Carlsberg spokesman Jens Peter Skaarup said: "There are a lot of rumours in this business among traders, analysts and journalists, but on principle we never comment on this type of thing." But miners, which had dazzled the market with stellar gains in the last session, ended the day lower despite rising earlier in the session. Anglo American lost 1.3 percent, despite an earlier rise following an HSBC upgrade to "overweight" from "neutral". Copper prices, which slipped 1.8 percent, also knocked the sector. Among other individual stocks, Morrison Supermarkets fell 2.8 percent after it said it had withdrawn sliced cold meats from two stores in Scotland after an E.coli outbreak killed an elderly woman and left two people seriously ill. On the UK economic front, Britain's inflation fell below the Bank of England's 2 percent target in July for the first time in more than a year, leading to speculation that interest rates could have peaked. Data showed consumer prices fell 1.9 percent last month, their lowest since March 2006. That compared with a rate of 2.4 percent in June and stunned analysts who had expected only a modest easing to 2.3 percent.
