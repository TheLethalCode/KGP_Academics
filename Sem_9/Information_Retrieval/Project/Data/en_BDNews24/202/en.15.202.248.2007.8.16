 NEW YORK, August 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The New York Film Festival on Wednesday unveiled 28 films debuting at the fall event, including many widely-anticipated US movies and Iranian coming-of-age tale 'Persepolis' on closing night. The festival is celebrating its 45th version this year, and annually it is one of the world's top film gatherings with a range of work from filmmakers around the world. But this year, organizers said the festival features a high number of films from US directors including Joel and Ethan Coen with `No Country for Old Men,' the haunting story of a Texas drug deal gone bad. "I think we're at a moment when American filmmakers are caught up with a certain unease and confusion that is in the culture," said Kent Jones, associate program director for the Film Society of Lincoln Center, which presents the festival. "These are tough films that grapple with questions of violence and evil," Jones said. Among other US films and directors are Wes Anderson's quirky drama 'The Darjeeling Limited,' which opens the festival on September 28. Veteran Brian DePalma brings Iraq war film, 'Redacted,' Todd Haynes has a look at the life of singer Bob Dylan, 'I'm Not There.' Animated 'Persepolis,' which tells of a young Iranian girl growing up repressed under Islamic rule, leads the world cinema entries. It is joined by Julian Schnabel's 'The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,' which tells of a magazine editor who, after being paralyzed, 'writes' his memoir by blinking his eyes. 'Persepolis,' 'Diving Bell' and 'No Country' were among several audience favorites at May's Cannes film festival in France. 'Persepolis' won a jury prize at the Cannes gathering. Spain's Juan Antonio Bayona brings his supernatural drama 'The Orphanage,' to the festival, and Romanian movie '4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,' which won the coveted Palme d'Or at Cannes, also will screen at the New York Film Festival. The 17-day festival opens on September 28 and runs through October
