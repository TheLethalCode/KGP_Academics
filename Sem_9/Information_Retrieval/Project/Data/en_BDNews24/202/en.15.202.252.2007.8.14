 NEW YORK, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- Economic forecasters lowered their estimates for US economic growth in the third quarter, while core inflation will remain steady in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, a survey issued by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank showed on Tuesday. The 49 forecasters surveyed pegged third-quarter growth in US real gross domestic product at an annual rate of 2.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 2.6 percent. Fourth quarter GDP is forecast at 2.7 percent versus a previous estimate of 2.9 percent, the Philadelphia Fed said. Core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, was forecast for the third quarter at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in 2007, down from a previous estimate of 2.1 percent. Fourth quarter core inflation, on a year-over-year basis, was also seen at 1.9 percent. The third quarter unemployment rate was seen at 4.6 percent, with fourth quarter unemployment seen at 4.7 percent. Overall, the year-over-year unemployment rate was seen at 4.6 percent in 2007 and at 4.7 percent in 2008. The respondents in the Philadelphia Fed's "Survey of Professional Forecasters" include economists at major financial institutions and research firms, universities and business groups.
