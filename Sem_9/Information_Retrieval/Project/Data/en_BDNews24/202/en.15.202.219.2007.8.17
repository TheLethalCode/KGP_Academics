<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  Bankers Thursday said a cut in the interest rate on loans for import of essentials could not alone bring down the prices of goods. "The government has to make businessmen accountable for curbing the prices," president of the Association of Bankers Bangladesh M Aminuzzaman told reporters. "If the businesses continue hiking prices, the interest rate cut would do the consumers no good," he said. He made the remarks after a meeting with the executives of commercial banks at the ABB office in Kakrail. The bankers also criticised some recent moves, including pressure from the central bank on banks to cut interest rates. Aminuzzaman said dropping the interest rate for import loans to 12 percent from 14.5 percent would slash the prices of a kilogram of wheat by Tk 0.10 to Tk 0.11. He said consumers did not see a decline in the high prices in the market. "The government has to make the businessmen responsible and find out the reasons for the unrelenting price hike of essentials." In the open market system, Bangladesh Bank cannot put pressure on retail banks to reduce the interest rate, he asserted. But the bankers agreed to comply with the decision keeping the national interest in mind, he said. The bankers also slammed the central bank for raising the rate by 1 percent for maintaining reserves for letters of credit, which they said would force a bank to deposit Tk 25-Tk 30 crore. The central bank directed the retail banks to maintain 1 percent general provision against the LC amount. "The move will have a negative impact on the profit of the banks," Aminuzzman said. For the first time, the ABB chief said, commercial banks would provide farm loans at lower interest rates. "Already some banks have started doing that," he claimed. bdnews
