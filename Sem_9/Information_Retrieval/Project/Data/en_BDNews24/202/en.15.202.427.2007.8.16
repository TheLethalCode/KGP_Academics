 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission has asked all listed companies and merchant banks to send information on any share former communications minister Nazmul Huda and eight others hold with them. The move is meant to assist the Anticorruption Commission in graft probes. "We have requested companies and merchant banks to send information as the Anticorruption Commission has asked for it," an SEC official told bdnews24.com Thursday. Hundreds of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen have fallen foul of the anticorruption drive, since the current administration assumed power in January. The capital market regulator sent a list of nine to the companies and merchant banks. Huda's wife Sigma Huda, former minister Mirza Abbas' son Mirza Arafat Abbas Apan, and brother Mirza Ekramul Hossain, popularly known as Mirza Khokon appear on the list. Also listed are Huda's daughters Antara Selima Huda and Srabanti Amina Huda, Mirza Khokon's wife Masuda Ekram, their children Kainat Mirza Shasha and Kashfa Mirza Bhasha. The regulator particularly sought details about the date of purchasing shares/debentures, number of shares and amount of investment. bdnews24.com has obtained a copy of the SEC letter. The SEC issued its request through a letter to all listed companies and merchant banks, asking them respond by August 23. The letter said: "The Anticorruption Commission asked the SEC to send information on individuals' shares and debentures." In another letter, the National Board of Revenue directed banks to send account details on forest conservator M Atiqul Azam and his family.
