 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  A proposal to pump emergency funds to salvage the cash-strapped Biman did not get the go-ahead from the government over past two months, an official said Friday. A second proposal for four new planes to keep the ailing airline's schedule normal has also hit a snag, said MA Momen, managing director of Biman Bangladesh Airlines. Momen said a huge investment was necessary to pull the airline back into profits. He said unless they received a good fund from the government coffer it would be almost impossible to remain in the air. "A huge investment is necessary to make Biman profitbale. But over past 15 years it didn't get that. Biman runs with its own fund," Momen said. "The government is giving subsidy to other departments including the railway. So why not Biman?" he said. The Biman boss said they placed the proposal for the official fund in June but there was no progress. He said they did not specify the amount but had made it clear that the company needed a good amount to keep it going. "At the same time we asked the government for four wide-bodied aircraft. But we didn't get any response," he said. The emergency government initiated a process to restructure the Biman and a committee was formed in March to make it happen. The committee recommended slashing down manpower by at least half as part of the reforms. Later, the council of advisers approved a proposal to turn the entity into a public limited company (PLC). In June the government took up a "golden handshake" project and sent some 1863 officers and employees into early retirement under the programme. In July Biman became a PLC. Years of unbridled corruption, mismanagement and choosing too many non-profit routes in recent years have made the state-run concern a liability. According to officials, Biman suffered a record loss of $120 million in last fiscal year. It owes Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation Tk 1564 crore until December 31, 2006 in oil bills alone. The officials say it also needs to spend a huge amount of money to repair the older aircrafts in its fleet. Biman last year closed international flights to Tokyo, New York, Paris, Brussels, Frankfurt and Mumbai to cut down on losses. It is now operating international flights to only 20 destinations. Currently it is operating flights to only Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Sylhet after authorities suspended operations on Jessore, Rajshahi, Barisal and Syedpur routes. The national flag-carrier has five DC-10s, four Airbuses and four F-28 planes. The DC-10 aircrafts are at least 20 years old while the airbuses were brought in 1990. bdnews24
