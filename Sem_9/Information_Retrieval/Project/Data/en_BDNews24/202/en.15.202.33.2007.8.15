<TITLE> Growing risk allergy hits equities, buoys bonds </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell for a second day on Wednesday as shockwaves from strained credit markets hit global equities, while government bond yields fell to three- month lows as investors streamed out of riskier assets. Some of the market's most widely-watched gauges of risk appetite signalled there is growing concern that what began as a deterioration in the US mortgage market has now become a widespread financial problem. Overnight, a US fund tried to stop clients from withdrawing capital to avoid having to sell assets at steep discounts and a couple of Canadian financial houses warned of problems with their short-term debt holdings. This stripped nearly 2 percent off Wall Street and sent Japanese stocks to their lowest in eight months. "The general feeling is that this is a Wall Street problem, or a markets problem and not a Main Street problem. And my concern is that what investors are going to have to wake up to before too very long, is that it is absolutely a Main Street problem," said Jeremy Batstone-Carr, head of private client research at Charles Stanley. "What's also significant about last night is that many had thought the problems of Western markets would not feed through so much into Asian markets because Asia has developed a momentum of its own," he said. MCSI's main world stock index fell nearly 1 percent and has shed almost 10 percent from the highs for this year in mid-July as the crisis in the U.S. subprime lending market has claimed a string of victims in the financial sector around the world. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down nearly 0.9 percent at 1,481.5 points, close to a five-month low. Investor nerves were already frayed after UBS on Tuesday unveiled record profits for the second quarter but said a prolonged period of market turbulence would hurt its investment banking business. This followed Goldman Sachs and other investors bailing out one of its hedge funds, and France's BNP Paribas' announcement last week that it had frozen three funds because of the deterioration in the U.S. subprime sector. The European equity market has fallen by almost 9 percent from its 2007 highs in mid-July. Euro zone government bond yields fell to their lowest in three months as evidence mounted that the rapid decline in the value of subprime loans has triggered a widespread credit problem. Yields on the two-year Schatz fell 4 basis points to 4.14 percent, their lowest since May 11. "There's been wave after wave of bad news ... and a continuation of the trend of ongoing risk reduction. There's uncertainty and no-one knows how much further this will go or how bad the situation is," said Martin McMahon, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse. Frankfurt's DAX-NEW Volatility index, often used as a barometer of risk aversion, rose by 4 percent, nearing its highest level in 14 months. Emerging markets were battered, sending equities to their lowest in two months and forcing emerging debt yields up, as the yen rallied in a broad push away from riskier assets. MSCI's emerging market equity index was down 1.7 percent, while JPMorgan's EMBI+ widened by 2 basis points to 217 basis points. "People continue to remain nervous and any strength that you see in the market will be met by selling of illiquid names that you see on portfolios," said Kaushik Rudra, an emerging markets strategist at Lehman Brothers. The Japanese yen rose across the board as currency investors sold the higher-yielding assets they had purchased by selling lower-yielding yen previously in a further unwinding of the so-called "carry trade". The yen rose to its highest in nearly five months against the US dollar, which fell 0.5 percent to 116.97 yen. The euro fell 0.8 percent against the Japanese currency to 157.85 yen, while the Australian and New Zealand -- both high-yielders -- fell by well over 1 percent. Gold prices fell 0.5 percent, while Brent crude oil futures shed 0.4 percent. Central banks made a concerted effort at the end of last week and early this week to pump extra cash into the banking system to keep overnight lending rates from shooting up and creating further problems for borrowers. But corporate borrowing spreads continued to widen. Europe's most widely watched gauge of credit sentiment, the iTraxx Crossover index which is made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, rose 12 basis points to 362 points. The index is down from its high for the year above 500 basis points, but has gained about 7 percent since Monday alo
