<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday heard arguments over the legal basis of some provisions of the emergency powers rules that mainly included confiscation of property and denial of bail during the trial. Counsels for a writ petitioner argued that some major provisions of the emergency powers rules were against the constitution, and the provisions be scrapped. The High Court asked the counsels of the petitioner, Abdul Kuddus Mandal, to turn in a list of such provisions before the court by Thursday. The court also asked them to detail why they think the provisions stand against the constitution. A two-member panel of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zubayer Rahman Chowdhury set Thursday for the next hearing. Mandal is a resident of Natore district and the nephew of former state minister from BNP Ruhul Kuddus Talukder Dulu. The whole thing surfaced after Mandal filed the writ petition Sunday. He moved as he faced extortion charges in a case filed by one Md Selim Reza on April 8. Reza, also a Natore resident, in his case said Mandal had demanded Tk3 lakh last year from him. Mandal's counsel, barrister Rafique-ul Huq, told the court that the High Court as the custody of the constitution has the power to look into the matters if any law stands against the supreme law of the nation. If any law goes against the constitution, the High Court has the power to annul it, Huq said. The judges are oath-bound to protect the constitution, he said. The court responded to the argument and said not only the judges but all citizens were duty-bound to protect the constitution. Huq said that some natural rights including the right to life and individual freedom could not be eliminated or curbed by law. "These rights existed at the beginning of civilisation, when constitutions were not born. Now the constitutions of the civilised world have protected these rights," he said. He said that as per a provision of the emergency powers rules, if any case was included under it, the accused could not seek bail from any court or tribunal during the trial. According to another provision, property could be attached before the formal start of the case or during the proceedings of the case, Huq argued. These provisions were against the right of getting shelter of law and right to life and individual freedom described in the articles 31 and 32 of the constitution, he said. "Nobody becomes guilty if a case is filed against him," he said. The emergency powers rules say the order of any court or tribunal cannot be challenged in the higher courts during the proceedings of the case, which goes against the article 31 of the constitution, Huq said. "If a verdict of a trial court is not right, it curbs the rights of the accused," he said. "Now property is being attached before one is proved guilty in the trial. Besides, the source of the emergency powers rules is the Emergency Powers Ordinance. The ordinance did not give power to attach property. This provision of the emergency powers rules was illegal as it was contrary to the main law," he said. He said that as per article 7 (2) of the constitution, the court could invalidate any law if it was against the constitution and fundamental rights. "No law against the fundamental rights including right to life, individual freedom and right to the shelter of law could be made even during the state of emergency," he said. Huq said that as per the emergency powers rules if anybody gave a false statement of wealth, he could be sentenced to five years in jail. But, the lawyer said, the punishment for the same crime is three years in jail as per the Anticorruption Commission Act. The trial must be held according to the law existing during the occurrence of the crime, he said. "The provision under the emergency powers rules of trying any crime committed before the law is illegal." Advocate Ahsanul Karim assisted Huq while the state was represented by additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed. bdnews24
