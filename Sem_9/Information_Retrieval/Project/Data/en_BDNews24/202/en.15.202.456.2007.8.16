 NEW DELHI, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opponents of a historic nuclear energy deal between India and the United States disrupted the Indian parliament on Thursday, saying the government had misled the chambers on the details of the agreement. Unruly MPs shouted slogans against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and some sought his resignation for "misleading" parliament, forcing both the upper and lower houses to be adjourned for the day. The lawmakers cited media reports that quoted the US State Department spokesman as saying in Washington on Tuesday that the landmark deal would be terminated if India conducted fresh nuclear tests. This, the MPs said, violated India's sovereignty and nuclear security. "Prime minister quit your job", "Stop lying, Stop selling the country", about two dozen opposition lawmakers shouted after they gathered in the centre of both houses. The nuclear deal aims to give India access to US nuclear fuel and equipment for the first time in 30 years to help meet its soaring energy needs, even though it has stayed out of non-proliferation pacts and tested nuclear weapons. First agreed in principle two years ago, the framework deal was approved by the U.S. Congress last December and the pact that governs nuclear trade between the two, called the 123 agreement, was finalised last month. The 123 agreement has to get the backing of the US Congress after India secures other international approvals. Critics in both countries say their governments are making too many compromises in their eagerness to seal it. On Monday, Prime Minister Singh told parliament that the deal was crucial for the country's energy security and did not take away its right to conduct nuclear tests. Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee reaffirmed that India had "sovereign right to test and would do so if it is necessary in the national interest". "The only restraint is our voluntary unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing," he told parliament. But that did not convince the slogan-shouting MPs, some of whom walked out of the house in protest. The fresh trouble came a day before communist allies of the government, whose support is crucial for the survival of the coalition and who have rejected the deal, begin a two-day meeting to decide on their political strategy. Some analysts say the left parties could pull out of a political coordination panel with the government and even make their support to the coalition conditional. "The cooperation will not be the same as today," D. Raja, a senior communist leader and MP, told Reuters. "This is a major issue that has strained relations and caused a major confrontation." "We want to redefine our approach on policies of the government including the nuclear deal," he sa
