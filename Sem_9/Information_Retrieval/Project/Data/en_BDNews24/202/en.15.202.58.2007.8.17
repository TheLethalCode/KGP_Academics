 KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysian men's doubles sixth seeds Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah ousted Chinese defending champions Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng 15-21 21-18 21-19 in their world championships quarter-final match on Friday. Amid tumultuous scenes at the Putra Stadium, the Malaysians trailed 19-16 in the decider but swept to victory, winning the last five points in a row to the delight of a noisy, near-10,000 strong crowd. Under an hour later, the mixed doubles champions from Madrid in 2006, England's Nathan Robertson and Gail Emms, also relinquished their crown, losing 21-13 21-16 to Indonesian sixth seeds Flandy Limpele and Vita Marissa in their quarter-final. But the crowd had come to watch Choong and Lee, seen as Malaysia's back-up to young second seeds Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong, who are in action later on Friday night in their quarter-final. Their victory raises real hopes that after 30 years of waiting since the inaugural tournament in 1977, Malaysia can finally land a world title. Lee told a news conference: "We are just going to do what we have done for the last few days. We are not under pressure, we will just fight." Malaysia also retain aspirations in the women's singles through Wong Mew Choo, who ousted defending champion Xie Xingfang on Thursday, and Commonwealth women's doubles champions Wong Pei Tty and Chin Ei Hui. In the mixed doubles, defeat for Robertson and Emms came hard on the heels of a 21-13 21-10 loss by friends and compatriots Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg, who succumbed to third-seeded Chinese pair Xie Zhongbo and Zhang Yawen. In Madrid last year, England enjoyed a stellar championships, coming home with a gold and two silvers. But medal hopes now rest with Tracey Hallam, who faces Olympic champion Zhang Ning later on Friday, and Emms and Kellogg who have a tough women's doubles quarter-final against three-times champions Gao Ling and Huang Su
