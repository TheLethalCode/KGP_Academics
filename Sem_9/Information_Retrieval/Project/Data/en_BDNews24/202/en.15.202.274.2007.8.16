Musharraf, who is preparing to seek a second term in office, is facing a deepening political crisis that had him on the brink of declaring a state of emergency last week.

US and Pakistani officials said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice discussed the idea of a power-sharing arrangement when she called Musharraf last week to warn him not to declare emergency powers, the newspaper reported.
