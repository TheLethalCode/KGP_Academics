 ANKARA, Aug 16 (bdnew24.com/Reuters) - Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday he was delaying the announcement of his new cabinet line-up after the country's outgoing president asked him to submit the list to the next head of state instead. Erdogan had been due to announce his new ministers after presenting the list to Ahmet Necdet Sezer on Thursday. But Sezer, a secularist critic of Erdogan's ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party, said the next president would now have to approve the list. Turkey's parliament elects a new president this month.
