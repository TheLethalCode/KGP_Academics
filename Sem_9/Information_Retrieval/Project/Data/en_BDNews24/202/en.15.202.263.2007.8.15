 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladeshis mourn Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Wednesday amid twin calls for recognising him as the Father of the Nation by August and declaring his death anniversary a national mourning day. Detained former prime minister Sheikh Hasina will be fasting to mark the 32nd death anniversary of her father, who was assassinated along with most of their family in 1975 by a band of errant military officers. "Sheikh Hasina will pass the day fasting and we have arranged iftar and sehri for her," deputy inspector general (prisons) Shamsul Haider Siddiqui told bdnews24.com Tuesday. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed are set to say prayers at the grave of Bangabandhu in Tungipara. The visit is the first for Iajuddin since he has been installed as the head of the state during the Khaleda administration, although there is no official programme with state honours. The chiefs of army, navy and air force are expected to travel to Tungipara to pay their respects. MASSACRE AND DENIAL The day commemorates the country's biggest political tragedy that massacred Bangabandhu, his wife, three sons, daughters-in-law and other relatives, including children. All happened under the cover of dark. Sheikh Hasina and Sheikh Rehana, two daughters of Bangabandhu, survived as they were abroad. The post-1975 political governments neglected the day and it was never observed with due solemnity until 1995. It was only in 1996, the year the Awami League assumed power, that August 15 was first observed as a national mourning day and public holiday. The practice continued through 2001. The BNP-led government revoked the public holiday for August 15 and prohibited the national flag being flown at half-staff by changing the national flag regulations. This year, the Awami League observes the day on a limited scale, without commemorative discussion or rally, as its chief, Hasina, has been detained in jail in an extortion case. The AL leaders and workers will garland the portrait of Bangabandhu, enshrined outside his home on Road No. 32 in Dhanmondi. An AL delegation will also lay wreaths at the national leader's Tungipara grave. Food will be distributed among flood victims in midday relief efforts. bdnews
