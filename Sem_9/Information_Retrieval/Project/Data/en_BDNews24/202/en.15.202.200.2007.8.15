 DUISBURG, Wed Aug 15,Germany (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six Italian men were shot dead in the German city of Duisburg early on Wednesday in an execution-style killing linked to a mafia feud. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato said the shootings appeared to be the latest chapter in a long-running dispute between two mafia clans in the southern region of Calabria, home to the N'Drangheta organized crime group. German police in the run-down northwestern city said their investigation was "leading in that direction". The shootings took place close to an Italian restaurant called Da Bruno, a police spokesman said. The victims, all shot in the head, were aged between 16 and 39. Investigators said the brazen attack in a foreign country was unprecedented and they feared an equally bloody riposte by relatives of the victims, in keeping with the tradition of vendetta. "We are now trying to prevent a similar tragedy (in Calabria)," Amato told a news conference. The victims were all Calabrese and belonged to one of two rival clans based in the town of San Luca. Their simmering feud began in 1991 and has escalated in the past eight months. Overall 15 people have been killed. The N'Drangheta has outgrown its more famous Sicilian counterpart, the Cosa Nostra, thanks to clan loyalties ensured by blood relationships and arranged marriages, and is now the leading organized criminal group for drug trafficking. "This was an attack to assert power. It is not just the clan that comes out stronger, it is the N'Drangheta as a whole," said Alberto Cisterna, a top mafia national prosecutor. "It shows a strength, a capacity to intimidate that is very worrying." Italian investigators, who are working with German police on the case, said the N'Drangheta was well established in Germany. Police found the six in, or lying next to, two vehicles near the city's train station after a passer-by heard shots at about 2:30 a.m. (0030 GMT). Five were already dead and the sixth died on the way to hospital. German television showed pictures of a distraught middle-aged woman arriving at the scene shouting "Sebastiano!" Police said they were looking at close-circuit television footage from a camera installed at the office block. The cars, one a VW Golf and the other a small Opel delivery van, were registered in German towns. The shootings have stunned Germany, where gang crime on this scale is rare. Police will hold a news conference at 1200 GMT. bdnews24.com/lq/1756hrs Italians are Germany's second biggest immigrant group after Turks. Many from the poor south came to Germany as "guest workers" after World War Two and helped fuel the country's economic boom. About 540,000 Italians live here now. At the end of 2006, about 3,500 Italians lived in Duisburg, a city in Germany's industrial heartland, the Ruhr, that has been hit by h
