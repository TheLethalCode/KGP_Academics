 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks fell for the fourth session in five on Wednesday as fallout from strained credit markets hit global equities, while government bonds rallied sharply as investors streamed out of riskier assets. Some of the market's most widely-watched measures of risk appetite signalled there is growing concern that what began as a deterioration in the US mortgage market has now become a widespread financial problem. But even as the global credit risk storm rolled into emerging markets and currencies, the world's major central banks were gaining in confidence that the worst of the short term credit squeeze might be over -- progressively withdrawing the cash they have injected into money markets. For the first time since last Thursday the European Central Bank, like the U.S. Federal Reserve a day earlier, gave no extra short-term money to keep the financial system operating smoothly and central banks in Japan and Switzerland actively drained cash from their local markets. Corporate borrowing costs continued to rise. Europe's most widely watched gauge of credit sentiment, the iTraxx Crossover index which is made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, rose 15 basis points to 365 points. The index is down from its high for the year above 500 basis points, but has gained about 7 percent since Monday alone. The dollar, sterling, euro and Australian and New Zealand dollars all fell to their weakest points since late March/early April against the yen as investors continued to cut long positions in currencies with attractive yields as financial market turmoil continued to bubble. US stock markets open weaker with the Dow Jones industrial average falling below 13,000 as investors fretted about mounting credit problems. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 had earlier tumbled 2.2 percent to its lowest close this year. "There's been wave after wave of bad news... and a continuation of the trend of ongoing risk reduction. There's uncertainty and no-one knows how much further this will go or how bad the situation is," Martin McMahon, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse said. Government bonds were the main beneficiaries, with euro zone yields dropping across the board as investors sought their relative safety. The two-year Schatz yield was down 7.7 basis points at 4.110 percent and the 10-year Bund yield lost 3.7 basis points to 4.322 percent. Short-dated yields on US Treasuries were pushed to 18-month lows by a combination of equity weakness and investor worries that lending problems that began in mortgage markets were leading to a wider credit crunch. Canada's main rating agency DBRS warned on Tuesday of possible defaults in the C$116 billion ($109 billion) market for asset-backed commercial paper, helping push overnight Canadian dollar deposit rates to 6-1/2 year highs in London on Wednesday. Frankfurt's DAX-NEW Volatility index, often used as a barometer of risk aversion, rose by as much as 4 percent, nearing its highest level in 14 months. MCSI's main world stock index fell 1.2 percent and has shed around 10 percent from the highs for this year in mid-July as the crisis in the U.S. subprime lending market has claimed a string of victims in the financial sector around the world. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 1.0 percent at 1,479.3 points. The European equity market has fallen by around 9 percent from its 2007 highs in mid-July. "The de-leveraging story is starting to spread to more markets," said Laura Ambroseno, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. "We're at important levels; we've had big moves over the last few weeks," she said, referring to psychological levels such as sterling breaking below $2.00, the euro dipping below $1.35 and 115.00 dollar/yen gradually slowly but surely into view. The dollar was down 116.89 against the yen, near its session low of 116.62 yen, according to Reuters data, while the euro was down 1.2 percent at 157.22 yen. The euro was down 0.5 percent versus the dollar at $1.3470, around its lowest since late June. Sterling, already reeling from much weaker-than-expected UK inflation data on Tuesday, fell below $1.99 to a low of $1.9868 after surprisingly weak UK average earnings growth data. Emerging markets were battered, sending equities to their lowest in two months and forcing emerging debt yields up, as the yen rallied in a broad push away from riskier assets. MSCI's emerging market equity index was down 2.1 percent, while JPMorgan's EMBI+ widened by 6 basis points to 221 basis points. U.S. crude oil futures though rose US crude futures was up 53 cents at $72.86 a barrel by 1337 GMT, adding to a 76-cent gain the previous session, as fears that output in the US Gulf could be cut by a gathering storm outweighed growing unease over a global credit crunch. Gold was quoted down at around $665 ounce, though off the day's low of $6
