<TITLE> US housing starts fall to 10-year low </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two key indicators in the struggling US. home construction sector fell to 10-year lows in July and the number of US workers seeking jobless benefits rose, government reports said on Thursday. The housing numbers were worse than expected as home construction starts fell 6.1 percent in July and building permit activity, a sign of future construction plans, sank. The Commerce Department data was another snapshot of the deteriorating U.S. housing industry and weighed on financial markets, which are in turmoil over a tightening of credit and blow-ups in the subprime mortgage market. "It does look as if builders are throwing in the towel, especially in the South which is where the most difficult markets are," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. US stocks opened sharply lower on Thursday, also pushed down by a move by Countrywide Financial Corp., the largest US mortgage lender, to draw down an entire $11.5 billion credit facility. Prices for US government debt rallied, pushing yields, which move inversely to prices, down sharply. "The housing starts number just adds fuel to the fire. You've got financial markets in panic," said Michael Darda, chief economist at MKM Partners LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. A Commerce Department report said housing starts set an annual pace of 1.381 million units in July, lower than Wall Street forecasts for 1.405 million units and the upwardly revised 1.470 million rate for June. It was the lowest pace since the January 1997 rate of 1.355 million units. Building permits fell 2.8 percent in July to an annual pace of 1.373 million, their lowest since October 1996 when they reached 1.358 million. Economists polled by Reuters expected July permits at 1.400 million after 1.413 million in June. July's drop in housing starts was the worst in the South, where they fell 11 percent. Starts also fell in the West and in the Northeast, but they rose in the Midwest. The number of US workers signing up for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly to 322,000 last week. It was the highest level in two months but still pointed to a steady job market, Labor Department data on Thursday showed. Economists polled ahead of the report were expecting the weekly claims level to inch down to a seasonally adjusted 313,000 for the week ended Aug. 11, from 316,000 reported the prior week. Fluctuations are common in this weekly data, particularly in the summer months. A Labor Department official said there were no special factors linked to the latest increase. Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York said the numbers were not worrisome. "Right now I would say this number doesn't mean anything. But it is an upswing, and you watch to keep an eye on that," Brusca said. The four-week moving average, considered a better measure of employment conditions because it irons out the weekly gyrations, edged up to 312,500 from 307,750.
