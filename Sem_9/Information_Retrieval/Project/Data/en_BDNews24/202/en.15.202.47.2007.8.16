 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) -- Progressive Democratic Party convener Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi Thursday claimed that local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal was his friend, a claim Iqbal snubbed. Quarishi met Iqbal at his secretariat office for over an hour and later told reporters, "The adviser is a friend of mine. I came to pay a courtesy call on him." "From now on I will pay a courtesy visit to all the advisers in phases," he added. However, Iqbal saw things differently. He bluntly told reporters: "Quarishi is not my friend." bdnews24.com/
