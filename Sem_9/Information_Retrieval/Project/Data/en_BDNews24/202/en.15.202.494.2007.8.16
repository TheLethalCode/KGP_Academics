<TEXT>
 MADRID, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The start of the Spanish league season is still a week away and yet Real Madrid's new boss Bernd Schuster is already under pressure to live up to his promise of playing a more entertaining, attack-minded style of football. Real have lost five of their eight pre-season fixtures and the club's fans are expecting a more convincing display as the team attempt to overturn a 1-0 deficit against King's Cup winners Sevilla in the return leg of the Spanish Super Cup at the Bernabeu on Sunday. Despite showing signs of improvement, the Spanish champions suffered an almost comical defeat in a pre-season tournament against Real Betis on Wednesday. Anticipating a penalty shootout, Schuster decided to replace keeper Iker Casillas with new signing Jerzy Dudek in the final minute of the game, but Betis were awarded a free kick on the edge of the area and Juan Pablo Caffa fired past the bemused Pole.

"The problem with Madrid is that the team is constantly under scrutiny," Casillas sadi. "But if we beat Sevilla on Sunday no one will remember this defeat (to Real Betis)." Sevilla passed their first major test of the season with flying colours when they claimed a classy 2-0 win over AEK Athens in the first leg of their Champions League qualifier on Wednesday. The team put the distractions over the possible departure of influential defender Daniel Alves behind them and young winger Jesus Navas gave a virtuoso performance as he set up second half goals for strikers Luis Fabiano and Frederic Kanoute. "It was a magnificent result," said coach Juande Ramos, who added that he hoped Alves would be available for the match against Real after ruling himself out of the AEK match for fear it would jeopardise a possible move to Chelsea. "We would be delighted if he plays but it is up to him to make the decision," he said
