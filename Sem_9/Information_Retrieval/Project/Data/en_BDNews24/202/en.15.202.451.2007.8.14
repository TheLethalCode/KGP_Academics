<TITLE> Ford to meet India's Tata, Mahindra: paper </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -Ford Motor Co. (F.N), which is exploring the sale of its Jaguar and Land Rover brands, has contacted India's Tata Motors (TAMO.BO) and Mahindra & Mahindra (MAHM.BO) for management meetings, the Economic Times said on Tuesday. Citing industry insiders, the newspaper said the meetings would be followed by detailed due diligence. Ford, the No. 2 US auto maker, said last month it would continue talks with selected suitors for the marques. A source familiar with the matter said in July that Tata and its local rival Mahindra & Mahindra, as well as US buyout firms TPG (TPG.UL) and Ripplewood, were among those that had expressed interest in a possible bid. A spokesman for Tata Motors said: "We do not wish to comment." Mahindra & Mahindra could not be immediately reached.
