 CASABLANCA, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Moroccan court jailed a journalist on Wednesday for eight months and sentenced his editor to a six-month suspended prison term for publishing leaked intelligence information on an al Qaeda plot. Al Watan Alaan (The Homeland Now) reporter Mustapha Hourmatallah and the Arabic-language weekly's managing director, Aderrahim Ariri, were also fined 1,000 Moroccan Dirhams ($120.5) each, court officials and lawyers said. Journalists and rights activists who jammed the court room to display support for the two newsmen said they were shocked by the verdict. "I came to hear the court judge declare my and my colleague's innocence. But unfortunately the verdict came as shock for me," Ariri told reporters. Ahmed Redha Benchemsi, managing director of the weekly newspaper TelQuel and its Arabic-language sister Nichane said: "Such a verdict is a blow for Morocco." Mohamed Sebai, a lawyer and a leading rights activist, said: "The court did not convict the journalists according to press laws, but based its verdict on charges made against thieves of cows and donkeys in the countryside. "That is very sad and belittles the status of journalists to the low level of thieves of animals," he added. Al Watan, quoting a military intelligence document, said last month that al Qaeda had decided to send 12 Arab and four Pakistani fighters to carry out attacks in Morocco and other North African states. Police detained Ariri and Hourmatallah over the report. Authorities later released Ariri but kept Hourmatallah in custody until Wednesday's verdict by the court in Morocco's commercial capital Casablanca. The court convicted the two for "receiving and concealing stolen documents". Government officials say Morocco is committed to further press freedom but journalists should not feel above the law. Last week, a Moroccan military court sentenced eight army officers to up to five years imprisonment for leaking military intelligence information to Al Watan over an al Qaeda plot. In June, Morocco raised its security alert level to the highest level, suggesting an al Qaeda attack was imminent. The Interior Ministry has said it obtained recent intelligence information on the threat but gave no details. On Monday, 30-year-old civil engineer Hicham Dokkali tried to blow himself up on a bus with foreign tourists at Meknes, 130 km (81 miles) southwest of Rabat, but the gas cylinder he was carrying exploded just before he reached it, officials said. He was seriously injured and in hospital in Rabat. North Africa has been on alert since al Qaeda's regional wing, Algeria-based Al Qaeda Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb, threatened last month to step up its war against "corrupt" regional rulers and their Western allies.
