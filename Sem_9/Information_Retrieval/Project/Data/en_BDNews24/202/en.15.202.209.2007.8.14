 DURBAN, South Africa, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacques Kallis has resigned as South Africa's vice-captain following his omission from the country's Twenty20 world championship squad. He also said on Monday he was considering his playing future in the wake of his non-selection. Selection convenor Joubert Strydom said Kallis was being rested for the tournament, which will be played in South Africa in September, but the all-rounder said he was disappointed to be left out. "I have resigned as vice-captain and I'm considering my options with regard to the rest of my career," Kallis told reporters. "I have been thinking long and hard over the weekend and there is still a lot of emotion involved because I am extremely disappointed. I was very excited about the tournament and hoping to make a huge contribution." Kallis's status as one of South Africa's greatest players is assured, but at times he has been criticised for slow batting. However, the 31-year-old believed he still had much to offer as a player. "I feel I have a lot of good cricket left and my best years might even be ahead of me," he said. "Ideally I would like to play many more years for my country but this weekend caused me to question my future for the first time," added Kallis, who has played 107 tests and 261 one-day internationals
