 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) - The National Sports Council (NSC), the country's apex sports body, Tuesday dissolved three more executive committees of the swimming, athletic and basketball federations to form three separate ad-hoc committees in line with section 20 A of the NSC act (amendment) 1974. The NSC has appointed a 23-member committee each to the swimming and athletic federations and a 26-member one to the basketball federation, keeping all three federation presidents unchanged. "The newly appointed committees will take over charge immediately and take necessary steps to hold the federation election soon," said three separate circulars of the NSC Tuesday. All the three new committees comprise mostly well-known organisers, patrons and former players, including the representatives from the sports control boards of the Bangladesh Army, Navy, Air Force, Rifles, Police, Ansar & VDP. Sports Adviser to the caretaker government Tapan Chowdhury in early July said that they were going to dissolve all 'disputed' sports federation bodies to purge the sports arena of politics. The Fakhruddin Ahmed- led caretaker government on July 29 appointed a 12-member ad-hoc committee to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) after the board's elected members resigned en masse on July 24 and 25. Following those resignations, Bangladesh Football Federation general secretary Anwarul Haq Helal also resigned on July 24, but it came into light on August 6. Both the committees of swimming and athletic federations were elected one and an half years ago while an ad-hoc committee ran the basketball federations for five and an half years. Former chairman of the Navy Sports Council, Commodore MA Kabir (G) ndc, psc (retd) has been appointed swimming federation general secretary in place of Dewan Aminul Haq Sajal, known as 'forum leader.' Former fastest athlete and former BJMC deputy general manager Mosharraf Hossain Shamim has been appointed athletic federation general secretary in place of Advocate Ali Imam Tapan, also known as 'forum leader.' Member secretary of the training and facilities committee of the Bangladesh Olympic Federation, Lt Commander (retd) Avijit Sarkar has been appointed basketball federation general secretary in place of Selim Chowdhury. Navy chief, vice admiral Sarwar Jahan Nizam, M Didarul Anwar and Kazi M Aminul Islam will be continuing their jobs of presidents of the swimming, athletic and basketball federations respectively.
