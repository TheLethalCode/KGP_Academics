 TEHRAN, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards will grow in strength despite US efforts to isolate the force, a Guards official said in remarks published on Thursday after Washington's threat to brand it a "terrorist" group. US officials said on Wednesday the United States might soon name the Guards a foreign terrorist group, a move that would enable Washington to target the force's finances.

As well as being a fighting force, the Guards have a range of business interests, including in energy projects awarded to its engineering subsidiary Khatam al-Anbia. The United States has imposed sanctions on two Iranian banks, a move which international financiers say have further deterred them from dollar dealings, and even other currency transactions, with the Islamic Republic. Some analysts say the Guards have grown in influence since the election in 2005 of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a former commander. They say ex-officers have been appointed to political posts and more may run in the March parliamentary electi
