 Sirajganj/Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  At least 38 more people died overnight in the flood fallout, raising the death toll to 516 Thursday, officials said. Waters have begun to rise again in northern rivers after a brief respite in the flood level. Panic has gripped many areas of Sirajganj where people are still reeling from the recent floods. Sirajganj's deputy commissioner Ibrahim Khalil said: "The possibility of another flood remains until mid-September. We all have to prepare ourselves now." Ariful Islam, an engineer who works for the Flood Warning and Forecasting Centre, said: "Water levels in the Brahmaputra rose where the river enters Bangladesh." "Bahadurabad, Chilmari and Sirajganj may therefore see a rise in water levels for the next three days. But the levels will not cross the danger mark." "Although water levels will increase in those areas there is no possibility of water rising in Dhaka," he said. At least 516 people died from diarrhoea, snakebites and drowning in the 18 days to Thursday, according to official figures. Reuters adds: A doctor at ICDDR,B said the facility had received 1,100 patients Tuesday, the highest single-day admissions in its history. "We suspect the flow will increase further," said doctor Azharul Islam Khan. "The overall diarrhoea situation is grim. Everyday there is a rush of patients," said Ayesha Khatoon, a senior official at the health directorate. "We are trying to cope with it." With floods easing, many people in relief camps are heading back to their homes. "They hardly have a roof on their heads or anything to eat," said an official in northern Kurigram district, one of the areas worst hit by the floods. bdnews24.com/c
