<TITLE> Quitting Iraq no quick or easy task for UK troops </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Wed Aug 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talk is rife in Britain that Prime Minister Gordon Brown could announce a withdrawal of troops from Iraq as soon as October, but ties with Washington and military logistics make such a move unlikely. While popular opinion may be behind a pullout, removing 5,500 soldiers from Iraq is riddled with complications, could expose US forces at a critical time and greatly harm transatlantic relations, defence and political analysts say. There are already plans to pull 500 troops based at a palace in downtown Basra back to a major air base on the outskirts of the city in the coming months, but reducing the total number in the country much below 5,000 could affect overall security. Brown, who met President George W Bush at Camp David for talks last month, has said all British troops in Iraq will soon move to "overwatch" -- meaning they will mostly train Iraqi forces -- but has not commented on a full withdrawal. Yet expectations have grown that he will show his hand after General David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Iraq, reports to Congress on Sept. 15 on how the troop "surge" is going. The Guardian newspaper said Brown could announce a withdrawal in October, and some US experts also expect an announcement soon. Others see that timing as too tight and diplomatically fraught, even if Brown may want to pull out so that Britain can focus attention on its campaign in Afghanistan. "There is a desire to draw down, but there's nothing in it for Brown to overtly publicise a decision for a withdrawal so soon," said Toby Dodge, a political scientist and Iraq expert at Queen Mary, University of London. "If there were any announcement of a British troop withdrawal either side of this Petraeus report, it would be deeply damaging to Bush as he tries to finesse Congress... My hunch is that Brown hasn't made up his mind yet." What's more, such a dramatic announcement, barely three months after Brown took office, might prove too much of a break with his predecessor, Tony Blair, who made much of standing "shoulder to shoulder" with Bush as they invaded Iraq. "The sensitivities of the transatlantic relationship mean that Britain would lose an awful lot of goodwill," said Dodge. That view is echoed by others, who say that while some in the military see the Iraq mission as doomed and want out to raise the tempo in Afghanistan, where 7,000 British troops already operate, the practicalities of politics won't allow it. "There is a head of steam behind the idea that if we are not really doing anything useful in Basra and there is a growing loss of life, there is a reason to pull out," said Claire Spencer, the head of the Middle East programme at Chatham House. "But I think in terms of securing the transatlantic relationship... it wouldn't be the best thing. "It could be ambitious to get (a withdrawal) done by the end of the year, but certainly within the next 12 months." The Ministry of Defence says it plans to keep forces in Basra "for as long as is deemed necessary", even as the death rate increases. Forty-one British troops have died in Iraq this year, on track to exceed the 53 killed in 2003. A ministry spokesman said the intention remained to pull those based at the bombarded Basra Palace to the air base "in the next couple of months", although there is no firm date. Part of the difficulty of pulling out of the palace, which might be an early indication of an overall intention to pull out of Iraq, is that there are no safe hands to hand over to. The intention is to put Iraqi forces in charge, but with the Basra police riddled with militia members, the Iraqi army unable to stand on its own feet, and the provincial government widely viewed as corrupt, none of the candidates is exemplary. If it is handed over only to be stormed and destroyed by militants weeks later, any British withdrawal that followed would have the appearance of fleeing a sinking ship. What's more, once all Britain's 5,500 troops are at the air base, pulling them out of Iraq won't be straightforward. The base is an essential resupply link between Kuwait and Baghdad, handling scores of flights a day. Its sheer size requires a large force not only to protect it but to run it. If British forces pulled out, American troops would have to take over, but they are already overstretched for the "surge" and redeploying south could take weeks or months and mean their supply lines would be stretched and exposed at a crucial time. At the end of the day, an early withdrawal by Britain could look irresponsible and a snub of its ally, Dodge said. Rather than easing Iraq's violence, it would only make it worse. "Although the British role in Basra is faulty, their presence does act as a brake on the violence," he sa
