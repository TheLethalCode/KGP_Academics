 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) -- The first shipment of Saudi Arabia's $50 million flood relief arrived in Dhaka Monday night, an official said. Saudi Arabia is the first country to donate such relief to Bangladesh as floods ravaged major parts of the country. Sadaruddin Ahmed, director general of the Relief and Rehabilitation Directorate, received the relief materials from Saudi ambassador to Bangladesh Abdullah Bin M Al-Obaid Al-Namla at Zia International Airport. The ambassador told bdnews24.com that the relief was a spontaneous gesture from Saudi king Abdullah Bin Abdul Aziz. The Saudi king also allocated 7,000 cartons of grains, 20,000 packets of readymade food, 10,000 blankets, 10,000 bedcovers, 20,000 tents and plastic covers and 10,000 tonnes of medicines and vaccines.
