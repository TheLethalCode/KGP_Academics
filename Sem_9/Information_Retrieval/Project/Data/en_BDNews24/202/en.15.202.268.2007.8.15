<TEXT>
 MILAN, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alvaro Recoba curled in a sublime strike to give Inter a 1-0 win over AC Milan in the final of a friendly tournament on Tuesday which also involved Juventus. The Uruguayan playmaker, who had looked set to leave after being knocked down the pecking order of forwards, reminded Roberto Mancini of his worth with a 25-metre effort midway through the 45-minute match at the San Siro. Champions Inter had earlier drawn 0-0 with newly-promoted Juventus in the first one-half match but won the subsequent penalty shootout after defender Domenico Criscito missed the first spotkick. AC Milan then beat a lacklustre Juve 1-0 thanks to Alberto Gilardino's cool finish but lost their way in the final against a flowing Inter, who face AS Roma in Sunday's Italian Super Cup. Milan play Juve again in the Berlusconi Trophy friendly on Friday with the Serie A season kicking off on Aug. 25
