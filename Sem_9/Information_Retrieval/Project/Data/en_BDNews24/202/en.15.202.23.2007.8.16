<TITLE> Senegal to elect new senate </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAKAR, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senegal's parliament and regional councils will elect around a third of the seats in a new senate on Sunday, in a poll the opposition has branded undemocratic because the president will name the remaining two-thirds. President Abdoulaye Wade, who won a new five-year term in February in polls the opposition said were rigged, has pushed through a reform this year of the West African country's constitution to re-create an upper house of parliament. The senate was abolished in 2001, a year after Wade won power, under a new constitution. The president argued that the abolition of the upper house, which had only existed for three years, would save money. Some 14,000 members of regional councils and members of parliament will elect 35 senate members to five-year terms on Sunday, with the remaining 65 being appointed by Wade. Senegal's vocal opposition will boycott the ballot, in which seven political groups will participate, and has branded the future senate "useless and anti-democratic". The Siggil Senegal (Stand Up Senegal) opposition coalition also refused to participate in parliamentary elections in June. "This is just a way to give public money to political allies," Abdoulaye Vilane, spokesman for the coalition, told Reuters. A member of a regional council from the ruling Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) brushed that criticism aside. "There are countries where all the senate members are appointed but here we have 35 who will be elected, which is a good thing," Mansour Diop said. In Zimbabawe, where veteran President Robert Mugabe has been branded undemocratic for a crackdown on opposition groups, the head of state appoints just under a tenth of the senate. In Senegal, the speaker of the senate is a politically sensitive post because, under the constitution, he would assume the presidency if the octogenarian Wade is incapacitated.
