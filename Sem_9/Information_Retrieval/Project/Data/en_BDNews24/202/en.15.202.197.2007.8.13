 BEIJING, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -US chief nuclear negotiator Christopher Hill expressed optimism on Monday ahead of talks later in the week with North Korea about the next phase in dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear program. Last month, energy-starved North Korea shut its Soviet era reactor and a plant that makes arms-grade plutonium in exchange for 50,000 tonnes of heavy fuel as part of a February 13 disarmament deal struck by the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. The next step of the disarmament deal, hammered out between the six parties, calls on Pyongyang to "disable" its nuclear facilities. But the last round of nuclear talks ended last month without a target date for that. Hill said he had a "business-like" meeting with his North Korean counterpart Kim Kye-gwan in Beijing. The two sides will meet again in the northeastern Chinese city of Shenyang from Thursday in a so-called "working group." "Most of the conversation dealt with the denuclearization working group. The DPRK side gave a preview of what they're thinking about the meeting later this week. We gave a preview of some of our thinking," Hill said, using the North's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "I think it's going to be a very good meeting, a very serious meeting," he told reporters. "I think we have an agreement we're going to try to identify types of disablement and how we can approach it." The following step will be to reconvene the six parties either at the end of August or early September, Hill added. "We would hope to have a good working group at the end of this week such that when we meet again as six parties we should be able to put together a plan for implementation of this next phase," he said. Hill said he would meet Chinese counterpart Wu Dawei on Tuesday, but not Kim, who would be heading back to Pyongyang
