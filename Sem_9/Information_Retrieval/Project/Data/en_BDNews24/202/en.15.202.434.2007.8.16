<TITLE> EC ponders changes to ordinance for expatriate vote </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Voter List Ordinance will be amended to give the voting right to expatriate Bangladeshis, election commissioner Sohul Hossain said Thursday. President Iajuddin Ahmed promulgated the Voter List Ordinance 2007, just a week ago. "Expatriates will be given the right to vote. The matter is now under serious consideration," he said, without making it clear when the ordinance will be amended. "We have talked to the foreign affairs adviser about the issue and will discuss it again. Desks will be opened at every Bangladesh embassy for expatriates to sign up for registration," Sohul said. The Election Commission will send the draft of the electoral law reforms to political parties. "There is still enough time before September. We hope we will be able to hold dialogue with the political parties next month in line with the roadmap," Sohul said. Asked which 'faction' of a political party the EC will sit with, Sohul said: "That's the problem. For the parties that have already split, we will sit with those who will fulfill registration criteria. I don't think there is any problem about a big party." bdnew
