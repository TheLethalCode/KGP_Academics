 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) -- The Anticorruption Commission Tuesday filed four separate cases against former BRTC chairman Taimur Alam Khandakar for allegedly taking bribes, police said. ACC deputy director Md Golam Mostafa filed the cases with Paltan Police Station. Paltan sub-inspector Arshed Ali said the first case involved taking Tk 22.5 lakh in bribe from a transport builder. According to case details, Taimur manipulated his power as the chairman of Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation and threatened not to receive 73 buses from SR Tractors, the agent of Pragati Industries Ltd. Taimur in 2004 struck the deal to purchase the buses of TATA brand for the official transport agency. After the vehicles were ready for delivery, Taimur had allegedly threatened to cancel the deal unless he got the money he demanded. Shamsul Huda, the owner of SR Tractors, paid the amount to Taimur by 12 pay orders from Janata Bank's Abul Hasnat Road branch. According to the second case, Taimur made another deal in 2005 for 135 buses and trucks with SR Tractors. But again he allegedly demanded Tk 16 lakh from Huda and threatened to cancel the contract. Huda again paid the amount in bribe through the same bank. The third case involves a similar deal for 190 buses and trucks, and Huda paid Tk 5 lakh to Taimur through the same bank in 2003. The fourth case involves taking Tk 25 lakh in bribe from the owner of a CNG filling station. According to the case details, Taimur took the amount from the owner of Nikunja Model Service Centre last year. bdnews2
