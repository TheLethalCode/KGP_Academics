<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham is eager to deliver another command performance for Los Angeles Galaxy in a Major League Soccer (MLS) match against New York Red Bulls on Saturday before linking up with the England squad next week. The 32-year-old midfielder showed scintillating form in his first Galaxy start on Wednesday, scoring from a free kick and creating a second goal, and wants to get at least 45 minutes of action at the Giants Stadium in New York. "I did get a knock on my ankle which is slightly swollen but it feels great, a lot better than it did after the previous match," Beckham told reporters after masterminding the Galaxy's 2-0 win over D.C. United in a SuperLiga semi-final. "Hopefully I will get a half a game or maybe more (on Saturday) but we will have to see how it reacts after travelling to New York." Beckham, who was due to fly to New York on Thursday, faces a hectic schedule over the next eight days. After Saturday's match, he will join his England team mates in London for a midweek friendly against Germany before returning to Los Angeles for an MLS encounter with Chivas USA the following day. "Obviously it's going to be difficult travel-wise," Beckham said. "I go straight from New York, if my ankle is fine and I have played some minutes in New York, leaving Saturday night or Sunday and meet up with the (England) team on Monday. "We play Wednesday and then I fly back (to Los Angeles) Thursday morning. I think I arrive at 12 o'clock and we've got a game that evening so hopefully I will be physically ready to play some part in that game as well." INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENTS Beckham, signed by the Galaxy from Real Madrid on a $32.5 million five-year deal, said his new employers had no problem with his international commitments with England. "It's not a conflict for the club," he added. "They have made it well aware they will do anything to help me play for my country. They know how passionate I feel about playing for my country. "So everyone is working together and I think that's important. Everyone has got to be on the same page and that's what they are." Hampered by an injured left ankle for the last two months, Beckham was delighted to play for 63 minutes at the Home Depot Center on Wednesday after wearing the captain's armband in his first start for the Galaxy. "It was important for me to actually get on the pitch and play some minutes," he said. "I think that was the most important thing for me. "Once I am on the pitch, I know that I can play well and help the team, and that's all that was on my mind, helping the team get into the final and getting our season on the way." "That's the first time I've been on the field for eight weeks and done any sort of running like that," added Beckham, who opened the scoring in the 27th minute with one of his trademark free kicks that swung into the top left corner. "Overall, it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be and I felt confident going into tackles. The ankle is good. Physically I felt tired towards the end of the hour but, overall, I felt good.
