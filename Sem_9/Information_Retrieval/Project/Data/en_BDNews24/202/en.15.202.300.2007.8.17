<TITLE> Nokia concealed battery glitch: Ashahi Shimbun </TITLE>

 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Nokia and Matsushita knew about the glitch but neither of them disclosed it until the matter worsened with Nokia recalling 46 million batteries made by the Japanese supplier last week, world's second-largest circulated daily Ashahi Shimbun said. "Matsushita Battery Industrial Co. knew as far back as May that a problem in the manufacturing process could cause its cellphone batteries to overheat, but it decided not to publicise the fact," Ashahi Shimbun reported quoting sources Friday. "Since then, two accidents involving batteries used in cellphones made by Nokia Corp., the world's largest handset maker, have occurred in Japan alone. It was only on Tuesday, however, that Nokia announced a worldwide recall of 46 million batteries made by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. subsidiary." Ashahi Shimbun said Matsushita Battery was first informed by Nokia in December 2006 that its BL-5C lithium-ion battery could overheat. The month before, the company had renovated its production line for batteries used in Nokia handsets at its main factory in Moriguchi, Osaka Prefecture. Matsushita tried to determine the cause of the glitch by recreating the former production line and disassembling old products. By May, it learned that a short circuit in the battery could cause overheating. The problem was traced to the manufacturing process, the sources said. Matsushita Battery apparently did not go ahead and make an announcement on its own. However, Matsushita Battery did inform Nokia, but the Finland-based cellphone maker was apparently reluctant to disclose the fact, the Ashahi Shimbun report alleged. "Of course, it's natural to disclose a problem as soon as we determine its cause. But in this case, we will refrain from making any comments, including when we learned about the cause," a Matsushita Battery representative told the Japanese newspaper. Nokia's headquarters also declined to divulge to Ashahi Shimbun when it determined the cause of the problem. "We started a joint investigation with Matsushita as soon as we were informed of the flaw," a Nokia spokesperson told the newspaper. "We've just found a mistake (in the manufacturing process) that could cause the flaw." In July, a cellphone battery that overheated caused a fire that burned part of the floor of a house in Osaka. In August, a defective battery caused a fire that damaged a bed in Shizuoka Prefecture, according to reports filed by Nokia's Japanese arm to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Nokia Japan, however, failed to report the two accidents to the ministry as soon as it learned of them," the Ashahi Shimbun report concluded. Meanwhile, the battery issue is also getting overheated in America. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is investigating a problem that Nokia Oyj reported with batteries used in some of its cellular telephones, an agency spokesman told Reuters Thursday. "This is an issue that CPSC is looking into and currently investigating. There is no recall that has been announced in the United States," the spokesman said. The U.S. product safety agency is concerned about batteries that could short-circuit if dropped, placed under great pressure, or left inside a car on a hot summer day, the CPSC spokesman told Reuters. "Where there is an internal short-circuit, there is a potential for an explosion or fire, even though it is not a frequent occurrence," he said. bdn
