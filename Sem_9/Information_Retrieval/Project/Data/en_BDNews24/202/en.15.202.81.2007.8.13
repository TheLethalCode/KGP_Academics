 TAIPEI, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States will allow Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian to stop over in Alaska en route to Central America next week, a US official said on Monday, a move bound to anger China which considers Taiwan its own. China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule, by force if necessary, and objects to other countries playing host to its officials. The United States, which switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China in 1979, recognising "one China", is nevertheless the island's biggest ally but says such visits by Taiwan officials must be of a private nature only. "These arrangements are intended only to facilitate President Chen's transit to Central America," Thomas Hodges, spokesman at the American Institute in Taiwan, the de facto US embassy in Taipei, said. "President Chen's transit will be private and unofficial. There will be no public or media events." Chinese officials have previously lashed out at the United States for allowing stopovers by Taiwan leaders. But analysts said Chen himself may also be upset that the U.S. stopover is in remote Alaska rather than on the mainland. Chen may stop over around Aug. 20 en route to Honduras for the Taiwan-Central American and Dominican Republic Leaders Summit and other high-level meetings geared at shoring up relations as China poaches Taiwan's diplomatic allies. The United States will also let Chen transit in Alaska on his trip back to Taiwan after the 10-day visit. In June, Costa Rica cut ties with Taiwan after 63 years and set up relations with China. The switch cut Taiwan's diplomatic allies to 24, mostly small countries in poor regions, compared to China's 170.
