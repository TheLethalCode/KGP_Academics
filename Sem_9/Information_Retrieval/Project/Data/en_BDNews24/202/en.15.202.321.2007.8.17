<TITLE> Bhuiyan asks EC to ready voter list before reform talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 17 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan Friday asked the Election Commission to make a correct voter list first and then hold talks with the political parties. "According to their election roadmap, the Election Commission has 16 months before the elections," Bhuiyan told reporters Friday at his Gulshan home. "They should, therefore, deploy all their resources to list the voters correctly first and then attend to such matters as holding meetings with the political parties and all." Bhuiyan also asked the government to lift a ban on parlour politics before the EC sat with the political parties. The BNP also commented on chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda's recent remarks on beginning reform talks with the political parties in September. "I think most of us will agree with the EC over most of their proposed reforms; only a few might need to be discussed at length." "But those discussions might as well be deferred, since we should first have the voter list. The discussions might very well be held 8 or 10 months before the elections," Bhuiyan said. "The EC should employ all its capacities in drawing up an accurate voter list, and only then should they be able to stick to their 'roadmap'." "That's the reason why I'd request the EC to mind the voter list preparation first and then mind all other business." Asked if his party will respond to the EC's call to participate in the September discussions, Bhuiyan said: "I can't tell you anything about that at this moment. Let's be invited formally and then we'll think about it." "However, I'll stick to my stance that the government should first reintroduce indoor politics and then other things should follow," he added. bdnews24.
