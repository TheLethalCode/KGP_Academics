 Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed has warned people of having to reel under five years of bad governance if they sell their votes in the coming elections. He told a views-exchange meeting at Rangpur Circuit House Thursday if people sold off their votes in the short-term they would be worse off in the long-term, enduring a five-year term of bad government. He reiterated that general elections would be held by December 2008 and said the people needed to consider whether the candidate they would vote for would truly represent them over the next five years. The army chief also stressed an accurate voter list for a fair election. Preparing a national ID card will cost only Tk 3, said Moeen, but if this was done, every voter in the country will also have their nationality as a Bangladeshi on record. He urged officials and representatives of civil society to participate in preparing an accurate voter list. Addressing the country's business community after the flood fallout, he said, "It is not time to make profits. It is time to stand by the flood victims." Speaking of past misappropriations of relief funds, the army chief said: "This time a supervision committee will be formed for every task." "Government officials, departments concerned, army personnel, civil society and media will be involved in monitoring the post-flood rehabilitation work." The army chief added, "Take the army as friends. Don't take them otherwise." Speaking earlier in the day after distributing relief materials among the flood victims in Gaibandha, General Moeen said: "Relief is not a permanent solution to facing food crises. This problem has to be eliminated for good through sustainable and effective planning." bdnews2
