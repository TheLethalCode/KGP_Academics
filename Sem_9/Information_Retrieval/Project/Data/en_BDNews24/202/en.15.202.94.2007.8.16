<TITLE> Oil sheds over $1 as credit fears batter stocks </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil dropped more than $1 on Thursday as credit fears pounded stocks and a threat of storm damage to US Gulf refineries and rigs appeared to recede. Oil had resisted Wednesday's declines on other markets as investors tracked two tropical storms in the Atlantic and reacted to a bigger-than-expected fall in US crude oil stocks. The latest forecasts put the more powerful Dean, now a hurricane, on course for the Lesser Antilles. Tropical Storm Erin's heavy rains were expected to reach Texas later Thursday. US crude fell $1.09 or 1.5 percent to $72.25 a barrel by 5:16 a.m. EDT, after rallying 95 cents on Wednesday. London Brent crude was down $1.43 at $70.21. European shares fell to a five-month low and London's FTSE 100 hit a 10-month low as worries over the credit market continued. "Equity markets are still under pressure and the dollar continues to rise, keeping the global investment profile negative," said Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Swiss-based Petromatrix. "We would expect this to remain true for the balance of the week, until equity markets have a better idea of the level of hedge funds redemptions that have been filed yesterday." September 15 was the deadline for clients to inform most funds if they want to exit by the end of the third quarter. "The grim situation in the bond and stock markets against a backdrop of possible slowing growth will act as the more dominant influence on the energy markets, and should more than offset any hurricane-induced bounces," said Edward Meir, an analyst at MF Global Energy Group. Tropical Storm Erin is a more immediate but less serious threat to oil facilities than Dean, as it is expected to make landfall Thursday evening south of the refining hub at Corpus Christi, Texas, the US National Hurricane Center said. Forecasts said Erin, packing maximum winds of just 40 miles per hour (65 kph), could strengthen further before it comes ashore, but local officials said the greatest risk was of heavy rains and possible flooding. Shell shut down a small natural gas production facility in the path of the storm on Tuesday and began evacuating nonessential personnel. Three oil refineries in Corpus Christi process over 800,000 barrels a day of oil. Prices had also rallied on Wednesday after government data showed US crude stocks fell 5.2 million barrels last week, in part due to lower imports, more than double the forecast decline. However supplies remain above seasonal norms and some analysts detected signs of slowing demand growth for gasoline.
