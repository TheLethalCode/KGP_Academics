 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)-The benchmark subprime mortgage index linked to home loans made in last year's second half fell to a record low on Wednesday, as nervous investors sold risky bonds and liquidity fears rose, traders said. "ABX is lower today. This is both in sympathy with wider corporate spreads as well as the unrelenting negative news in the mortgage market," said one trader. The index, used by investors to hedge subprime mortgage risks, has posted a series of steep declines over recent months as pools of loans in underlying securities experienced a sharp rise in delinquencies and defaults. The ABX 07-1 "BBB-" index fell to a record low 34.66 on Wednesday, versus 36.75 at the prior close and a record low close of 35.14, traders said. "So far everyone that has tried to pick a bottom has been disappointed. Fears of continued liquidations are really pressuring the market. We continue to see large volumes of cash bid lists and bonds trading," the trader said. The weakness traveled up to higher-tier rated segments of the index, as well, traders said. The ABX 07-1 "A" series slid to 45.66, versus 48.06 on Tuesday, traders said.
