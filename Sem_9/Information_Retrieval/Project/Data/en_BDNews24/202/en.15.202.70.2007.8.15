<TITLE> Hubris and hopelessness </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Fazal M Kamal Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Hubris can be and is an astonishingly dangerous thing. It's also self-defeating. This almost axiomatic truth was yet again demonstrated very recently in the so-called Rangs Building episode. It, incidentally, also displayed how, overnight, arrogance can morph, in sheer desperation perhaps, into what appeared to many a simulated state of martyrdom. Sad indeed. Whether accurately or otherwise that one structure assumed, over the years, the status in the eyes of most people of a massive inconvenience; a building that seemed to defy the interest of many for the pleasure of a few; a house that appeared to serve the purposes of some at the expense of thousands. At the end the pleas for "more time" from those who used that building started to look like a mere stratagem. Tragic indeed. Viewed against the long drawn-out background to the entire saga the assumed role of victimhood looks, feels and sounds incongruous. Moreover, when judged against the fact that thousands of commuters everyday were being made to pay for the hubris of one small group, certainly, it shouldn't have come as an enormous surprise -- as it was attempted to be portrayed subsequently -- that a day of reckoning would come at some point. Shameful indeed. Given that backdrop one can well comprehend the feelings as expressed by University Grants Commission Chairman Nazrul Islam who said, "Like me, all the commuters frequenting the roads in front of the Bhaban swore at its builder. The owner too acknowledged the predicaments of the city dwellers  But, for some reason or the other, he never took steps to address the problem." "If the government chose to build the link road," Prof Islam added, "by going around the building there, it would have amounted to encouraging unauthorised builders and public property grabbers. Now it should serve as an example of punishment to the offender when the government builds the road straight through the site where Rangs Bhaban used to stand so brazenly." It was, put simply, a supercilious instance of something unwholesome -- almost as hideous as the structure now looks shorn of its cosmetics -- standing against everything that's decent. Poor policing, poorer sense: For almost thirty years many of us have been underscoring, with as much regularity as is humanly possible, the lack of training -- and common sense, often -- which seemed to guide vehicular traffic management (if one is allowed to be so flexible with the word) in this country and especially in this capital city of ours. But, alas, one has to sigh, to no avail so far. With gut-wrenching anguish this scribe -- having been born and brought up in this city -- has had to endure watching the distinct deterioration on this front particularly over the past two decades. The main causes, if they've to be narrowed down to a few, evidently, included the questionable methods of handing out driving licenses (no prizes for guessing what was happening) and the absence of appropriate training and logical laws and rules for the traffic police officers. Consequently, during these years one has seen many different kinds of strange ways of traffic regulation: motorists being asked by policemen to drive on against the stop light; vehicles being encouraged to block intersections as they waited to make left or right turns; the erring drivers being rewarded by way of being waved on while those obeying the law were kept waiting, and so on and so forth. Amidst all this one also noticed -- and again, this writer, among others, has underlined this fact numerous times on the pages of various publications over the decades -- more often than not reckless, irresponsibly hazardous drivers of especially buses and trucks but now increasingly of other motorized vehicles as well being permitted to carry on with their murderous ways right in front of officers of the law but, for reasons that are rather obvious, vehicles parked "incorrectly"--as judged by the officer -- are quickly penalised. Clearly, it doesn't take a brain of a scientist immersed in quantum mechanics to figure out which of the two, i.e. the reckless driver or the parked car, is presenting a more potent danger. And yet this farce persists unabated. Only the other day I'd the occasion to see, with great bemusement, one police sarge -- in an act reminiscent of Beetle Bailey's favourite and fabled Sarge -- grab the documents of four cars with one just then in the process of disgorging a passenger. The cause: the sarge concluded sagely that the vehicles were "wrongly parked." Of course, another query springs to mind in such circumstances, but to which one will never get an answer even if you beat your head against the wall (when you come to think of it, it is like beating your head against the wall): if the driver of a vehicle has committed an error why should not the driver be penalised instead of the owner? What crime has the owner perpetrated? Would not punishing the errant driver be more productive, appropriate and be more of a deterrent? For some who would question this type of logic, let it be declared here and now that in many countries where traffic laws are, shall we say, more stringently applied, it's the driver who is penalised. It shouldn't be too difficult to understand why. But do we spy any flicker of hope on the horizon yet that laws, rules, regulations as well as training will be made sensible and be modernised? Can we hope -- somewhat desperately -- that in addition to frenetic pr activities something more tangible will be done? bdn
