<TITLE> UK input costs slide but rate hike bets intact </TITLE>

 LONDON, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British firms' costs fell unexpectedly in July while factory gate inflation met expectations, official data showed on Monday, providing some relief for policymakers eager to see inflation pressures ease. Financial markets, preoccupied with concerns over liquidity and credit risks, barely reacted to the figures which did little to change forecasts for one more interest rate hike this year. However, Bank of England policymakers may be relieved that inflation pressures are easing further up the pipeline. "Today's numbers provide marginal evidence that the inflationary background may not be as malignant as some on the Monetary Policy Committee may fear," said David Page, an economist at Investec. The Office for National Statistics said input prices fell 0.5 percent on the month, the weakest reading since January and confounding analysts' forecasts for a 0.7 percent gain. Annual input price inflation eased sharply to stand flat, against expectations for a 1.3 percent rise. Output prices rose 0.2 percent on the month in July for an annual rate of 2.4 percent. That was broadly in line with analysts' forecasts and came after June's upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain on the month and 2.5 percent annual rise. Any further dovish tone to consumer price inflation, retail sales and wages figures this week could fuel bets that the expected rise in borrowing costs will be delayed as policymakers gauge the severity and impact of current market gyrations. "We still expect interest rates to reach 6 percent this autumn, but we feel there is a growing probability that such a move may be delayed until November," said Howard Archer, an economist at Global Insight. "The current turmoil in global credit and financial markets also boosts the case for unchanged monetary policy for now." The central bank has raised interest rates five times since last August to 5.75 percent and signalled in its quarterly inflation forecasts last week that one more quarter-point hike may be needed to bring headline inflation back to target. Policymakers have been particularly concerned about a pick up in companies' pricing power as they seek to repair profit margins while the economy grows strongly. "The fact that these upside risks to output price inflation are not yet materialising is encouraging and may allay some market concerns, even if it is unlikely to dispel all of the Bank of England's lingering doubts," Investec's Page said. Hawkish MPC member Andrew Sentance said in a weekend newspaper interview that financial market instability would only impact on the central bank's inflation outlook if it had a substantial effect on the economy. Central banks around the world -- although not the Bank of England -- have injected cash into the financial system to stave off a liquidity crisis triggered by fears over credit conditions and encouraging some investors to bet that interest rates could be cut. "I wouldn't want to draw any conclusions at the moment," Sentance told the Sunday Times. "Our view is that global economic growth still has a lot of momentum." Consumer price inflation numbers due on Tuesday will give investors a better idea of the future direction of interest rates, with upward pressure seen coming from higher food prices following severe wet weather in the early summer. The ONS said the fall in input costs in July was mainly driven by a decline in metal prices. Nickel costs fell almost 20 percent on the month. However, wet weather boosted prices of wheat, barley and soft fruit. Core output price inflation picked up as expected to 0.2 percent on the month and 2.2 percent on the ye
