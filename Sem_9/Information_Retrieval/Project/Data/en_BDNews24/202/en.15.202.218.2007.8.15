<TEXT>
 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Nokia said it would replace at free of cost the "BL-5C" batteries that are possibly vulnerable to "overheating initiated by a short circuit while charging, causing the battery to dislodge". Nokia's spokesperson Shabnam Haque in Bangladesh told bdnews24.com that the customers having such batteries would receive full replacement without any cost. The Nokia care centres in the country will open helplines for such customers to report the faulty batteries, which the company will ship to them by courier immediately. How many consumers are affected in Bangladesh remains unclear. Meanwhile, Nokia has identified 52 different models of its mobile phones that use "BL-5C" batteries. Matsushita Battery Industrial Co Ltd of Japan supplies them to Nokia. Nokia and Matsushita apologised after the shocking revelation that rocked mobile phone users worldwide. "The companies express their deep apology for any inconvenience caused to the users of the affected products and ask for their cooperation," the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday. Nokia has also opened an advisory website (www.nokia.com/batteryreplacement) to pacify its panicked customers worldwide. The Nokia phones fitted with Matsushita's "BL-5C" batteries are: Nokia 1100, Nokia 1100c, Nokia 1101, Nokia 1108, Nokia 1110, Nokia 1112, Nokia 1255, Nokia 1315, Nokia 1600, Nokia 2112, Nokia 2118, Nokia 2255, Nokia 2272, Nokia 2275, Nokia 2300, Nokia 2300c, Nokia 2310, Nokia 2355, Nokia 2600, Nokia 2610, Nokia 2610b, Nokia 2626, Nokia 3100, Nokia 3105, Nokia 3120, Nokia 3125, Nokia 6030, Nokia 6085, Nokia 6086, Nokia 6108, Nokia 6175i, Nokia 6178i, Nokia 6230, Nokia 6230i, Nokia 6270, Nokia 6600, Nokia 6620, Nokia 6630, Nokia 6631, Nokia 6670, Nokia 6680, Nokia 6681, Nokia 6682, Nokia 6820, Nokia 6822, Nokia 7610, Nokia N70, Nokia N71, Nokia N72, Nokia N91, Nokia E50 and Nokia E60. But Nokia claims all the BL-5C batteries are not faulty. The website said "Nokia" and "BL-5C" are printed on the front of the battery. On the back of the battery, the Nokia mark appears at the top, and the battery identification number consisting of 26 characters is found at the bottom. "If the battery identification number does not contain 26 characters, it is not subject to this product advisory," said Nokia's product advisory website announcement. Nokia has decided to swap 46 million of "BL-5C" batteries in the world's one of the biggest product recalls Tuesday. "The product recall raises further questions about the reliability of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in mobile devices including Apple's iPod and iPhone," commented The Guardian. Nokia's chief financial officer Rick Simonson told The New York Times that Matsushita had agreed to pay a significant portion of recall costs, which he could not estimate. Reuters said Matsushita's share price tumbled 5 percent on the Tokyo stock exchange Wednesday after Nokia announced the realisation of 46 million batteries' replacement cost from its Japanese supplier. bdn
