 FREETOWN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sierra Leone's opposition took an early lead on Monday as results trickled in from polls that international observers judged broadly transparent. Saturday's ballot was billed as a test of the West African country's stability after UN peacekeepers withdrew two years ago following an 11-year civil war fuelled by "blood diamonds" and infamous for its brutality. Partial provisional results released by the electoral commission from five of 14 districts showed Ernest Bai Koroma of the opposition All People's Congress (APC) ahead of the ruling Sierra Leone People's Party's (SLPP) candidate, Vice-President Solomon Berewa, but southern SLPP strongholds were not included. "The APC has so far about 45 percent of the presidential vote, with SLPP trailing with 35 percent," said Ransford Wright, coordinator of the Independent Radio Network. He said the People's Movement for Democratic Change (PMDC), an SLPP breakaway party, had gained 15 percent of the vote. "PMDC has split the SLPP's vote," said Wright. "It looks like we will definitely get into a runoff." Some tallies are being helicoptered to Freetown and full results are expected to take several days. If no presidential candidate wins 55 percent, a runoff will be held in September. Saturday's vote was largely peaceful and foreign observers, who estimated turnout at more than 70 percent, were upbeat. "Election day was well-organised, positive and transparent," European Union mission chief Marie-Anne Isler said on Monday. "If this continues it will mark a significant and positive development in Sierra Leone's progress towards the consolidation of democracy and peace." But the EU's 83 observers also noted several concerns. "The level playing field amongst contestants was undermined due to the partisanship of some traditional leaders and the dominance and advantages of incumbency enjoyed by the ruling party," Isler said in a preliminary EU observers' statement. She said state television coverage of the SLPP was "extremely dominant" and stopped short of endorsing the elections until final results were in. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the poll's success and high turnout. "As the counting of ballots continues over the coming days, the secretary-general urges all Sierra Leoneans to preserve an atmosphere of calm and public order, and to resolve any potential disputes through the established legal channels," Ban's spokeswoman Michele Montas said. President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah is stepping down as required by the constitution amid popular disillusionment at government graft, which many believe has drained away generous foreign aid. Expectations for change are high in a country second from bottom of the UN Human Development Index where unemployment rate is about 60 percent, most people survive on under $1 a day, and the state depends on foreign aid for a third of its budget. "Most Sierra Leoneans saw this election as a historic moment for their country," said Christopher Fomunyoh, senior associate for Africa at the US-funded National Democratic Institute
