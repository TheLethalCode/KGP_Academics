 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign exchange reserves remain strong, running counter to a bleak forecast of the economy by analysts. Bangladesh Bank recorded the forex reserves, one of the important indices of the economy, at about $5.15 billion Monday, a rise from $5.12 billion a day before. Economists fear floods may crimp the economy, GDP growth may be retarded and inflation may reach double digits on government counts. But remittances from expatriate Bangladeshis and the export earnings continued to increase, driving the reserves with occasional slips. In the first week of July, the reserves slipped below $5 billion, paced by the payment of the Asian Clearing Union import bills. A senior official with Bangladesh Bank, on condition of anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "The possibility of the reserves decreasing due to the floods is slim." "Rather, it may increase as expatriates will send more money to their families and relatives to make up for the losses. But the reserves may suffer if imports increase or export earnings fall." Bangladesh Economic Association president Quazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "More than $5 billion reserves mean very good for the country. However, instead of holding all of the reserves, part should be used for different sectors of the economy." A review of Bangladesh Bank statistics showed that the reserves continued to increase as remittance inflows and export earnings have increased in the last two years and a half. Expatriate Bangladeshis remitted about $6 billion in fiscal 2006-07, a rise of about 22 percent from the previous fiscal year. Export earnings grew by about 20 percent. On July 9, the reserves dipped to $4.84 billion after payment of May-June import bills to the ACU. Import bills are paid to the ACU every two months. The bills for July and August have to be paid in the first week of September. bdnews
