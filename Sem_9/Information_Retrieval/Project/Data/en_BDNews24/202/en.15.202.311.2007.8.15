 ISLAMABAD, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US law linking aid to Pakistan to progress in the fight against militancy and some comments from US politicians were detrimental to cooperation between the countries, Pakistan said on Wednesday. The warning on relations between the United States and one of its most important allies in the fight against terrorism came in talks in Islamabad between Foreign Minister Khursheed Mehmood Kasuri and US Assistant Secretary of State Richard Boucher. "The foreign minister ... stressed that certain recent US statements were counter-productive ... (and) also expressed concern regarding the recent US legislation," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The ministry did not elaborate on the statements but relations with Pakistan have become a hot topic in the US presidential election campaign. Democratic candidate Barack Obama said this month that if elected, he would be willing to attack al Qaeda militants inside Pakistan without the approval of its government. U.S. President George W. Bush described talk of such action as "unsavoury" and said he respected Pakistan's sovereignity. But Bush also signed into law a bill on implementing the recommendations of the Sept. 11 commission, which contained the provision tying aid to Pakistan to its progress in cracking down on al Qaeda and Taliban militants. The law and tough talk have cast a shadow on the countries' relations. Kasuri told Boucher the law "was contrary to the spirit of Pakistan-U.S. strategic relationship". He said it was also reminiscent of US legislation, known as the Pressler Amendment, which blocked the sale of paid-for F-16 aircraft to Pakistan because of its nuclear programme in 1989. Boucher, who arrived in Pakistan earlier on Wednesday on his fourth visit this year, was not available for comment. He was due to meet President Pervez Musharraf on his two-day visit. Pakistan dropped support for the Taliban and joined the U.S.-led war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. It provided logistical help to foreign forces who overthrew the Taliban government in Afghanistan weeks later. Pakistan also arrested hundreds of al Qaeda members and supporters. But Afghan and some US officials say both the Taliban and al Qaeda are operating from remote tribal lands on Pakistan's Afghan border. Musharraf, speaking at a gathering of politicians and tribal elders from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Kabul on Sunday, acknowledged that militants in Afghanistan were drawing support from bases in Pakistan. But he has ruled out allowing foreign troops to operate on Pakistani territory and said his forces were fully capable of dealing with the militants. Strained relations with one of his most important allies is one of several problems Musharraf faces as he prepares to try to secure a second term in office. He has also been dealing with a wave of militant attacks and public anger over his attempt to dismiss the country's top judge. He went to the brink of declaring a state of emergency last week. The Bush administration has consistently supported Musharraf while calling for free and fair elections due late this year or early ne
