<TITLE> Australia eye more silverware at Twenty20 World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A full-strength Australian squad is gunning to add next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa to its bulging trophy cabinet, batsman Michael Clarke said on Wednesday. Australia swept to a third successive victory in the 50-over World Cup in the Caribbean this year, won the last Champions Trophy and are ranked the top test side in the world. Despite the retirements of stalwarts Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn, however, Clarke is confident Ricky Ponting's team will continue to enjoy success. "The selectors have shown confidence in all the players from the World Cup and hopefully we will take that form into the Twenty20," Clarke said. "We're all feeling fit and strong and, in such a short amount of overs, one player can win a game. We have a lot of talent in our squad, a lot of guys who can win a game on their own," Clarke told reporters in an ICC conference call from Sydney on Wednesday. Brett Lee returns to lead the attack in place of McGrath in the only change to the triumphant World Cup squad and the Twenty20 tournament will be Australia's first assignment under new coach Tim Nielsen, who has replaced John Buchanan. "Firstly, John Buchanan did an unbelievable job, he's a fantastic coach and I'm certain all the guys are grateful for what he brought to the table," Clarke said. "But Tim Nielsen understands how hard it is to play international cricket and he knows a lot about the game. He's helped a lot of the guys already because he's been assistant coach for the last two years." Clarke said he was confident Australia could absorb the loss of Warne, McGrath, Langer and Martyn. "Some great players have gone, you can't replace stars like Warne and McGrath, but there are a lot of players in Australia who will see it as an opportunity," he said. "That's the game, people come and go and will be missed, but there was a day when Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath made their debuts and no one knew what they could do. "I'm looking forward to seeing how we go without those players and some fresh blood is always good." The 26-year-old Clarke sees England and South Africa as potential rivals for the title because of their experience of playing domestic Twenty20 competitions. "I love how fast Twenty20 is, you've got to be fit and willing to do a lot of running," Clarke said. "It's the same as the last 10 overs of a one-day international, but you get two helpings of it. "You go with the flow, go with your instincts and, as a batsman, you probably have to go for it a bit earlier than you'd like. But I believe we have a pretty good batting line-up." The Twenty20 World Cup starts on Sept. 11 with the final in Sept. 24 in Johannesburg
