 MUMBAI, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)--- Indian shares fell 1.51 percent on Friday, paring most of a fall of as much as 4 percent as they were pushed around by gyrations in offshore markets on worries a global squeeze on credit could lead to slower economic growth. Software service exporters such as Infosys Technologies and Satyam Computer Services fell on concerns the spreading subprime mortgage woes could hit spending in the United States, where they earn most of the revenues. The benchmark BSE 30-share index ended down 216.69 points at 14,141.52, its lowest close in two months, having fallen as much as 4.03 percent during trade to 13,779.88, at which point it was below its 2006 closing level. The index lost 4.9 percent on the week, its fourth successive fall and its biggest weekly loss since in more than five months. It ended 10.9 percent below a record 15,868.85 hit on July 24. "We'll just follow the global trend, I don't think we're going to do anything more than that," said Andrew Holland, managing director at DSP Merrill Lynch. "At the moment, no one's going to say India's a great buy because some of the developed markets are looking cheap themselves." The rupee's fall of around 3 percent from last month's nine-year high against the dollar was another reason for investors to take some profits on Indian stocks, to capture some of this year's currency gains. The rupee hit a high of 40.20 per dollar last month, at which point it was up about 10 percent for the year, with foreign buying of stocks a key driver of its gains. Foreign funds have been net sellers this month, selling almost $750 million in the first two weeks of August to trim their net purchases this year to about $9.5 billion. Shares in software services companies led the losses, with Infosys at one stage down almost 9 percent at an 11-month low. "It's just a large liquid stock and someone's got some large holding they've had to get rid off. Everything gets thrown out - the good, the bad, the ugly," Holland said. Infosys, the second-most heavily weighted stock in the main index after Reliance Industries, ended down 2.9 percent to its lowest close since Oct. 4 last year, and Tata Consultancy Services fell 2.9 percent to its lowest close since Oct. 11. "Most US financial companies use Indian software firms for outsourcing technology services and there is a fear that if the credit problem worsens then there may be a cut back in spending," said K.K. Mital, vice-president at Escorts Mutual Fund. Top private firm Reliance Industries was one of the five stocks in the main index to gain, rising 0.8 percent. In the broader market, losers outpaced gainers by more than two to one on volume of 477.2 million shares. The 50-share NSE index, or Nifty, fell 1.69 percent to 4,108.05, its lowest close since May 11. "We'll just follow the global trend, I don't think we're going to do anything more than that," Holland said. "At the moment, no one's going to say India's a great buy because some of the developed markets are looking cheap themselves." Elsewhere in the region, Karachi's 100-share index eased 0.08 percent to 12,698.04, while Colombo's All-Share index rose 0.39 percent to 2,424.05. STOCKS THAT MOVED Shares in Tata Steel, the world's sixth-largest steel maker, extended Thursday's 10.3 percent loss by 5.4 percent on concerns about the funding of its takeover of Corus. A 1.5 bilion pound tranche of a loan was being restructured as institutional investors had been reluctant to join because of market volatility, a source told Reuters Basis Point last week. The shares ended at 544.30 rupees, their lowest close since late April and more than 25 percent below a record high hit last month. Shares in software firm Zylog Systems Ltd. closed at 431.10 rupees on debut, up 23.2 percent from the issue price of 350 rupees.
