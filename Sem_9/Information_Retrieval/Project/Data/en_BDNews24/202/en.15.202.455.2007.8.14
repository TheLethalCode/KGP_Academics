 TALLINN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Estonian Prime Minister Andrus Ansip said on Tuesday some Russian youth groups reminded him of the Nazi Hitler Youth movement, but said his small Baltic state wanted pragmatic relations with its former Soviet overlord. "We cannot close our eyes when we see what is happening now in Russia," Ansip told Reuters in an interview. "Those nationalist youth organisations, Nashi and Molodaya Gvardiya, they are like the Hitler Jugend in Germany. We have to be worried," he said, referring to two pro-Kremlin groups. One of the groups, Nashi, organised a week-long blockade of Estonia's embassy in Moscow after Estonia moved a bronze statue of a World War Two Red Army soldier from the centre of the capital Tallin to a military cemetery in April. Revered by Russians as a symbol of their enormous human sacrifices fighting Nazi Germany, the monument was viewed by many Estonians as an unwelcome reminder of nearly 50 years of Soviet rule. Its removal -- ordered by Ansip, who said it had become a focus for Estonian and Russian nationalists -- sparked two nights of riots by youths from Estonia's large Russian-speaking minority and fury in Moscow, which threatened economic sanctions and called it an insult to those who fought Nazism. But Ansip, sweeping his arm around a government office with paintings on the wall, said: "Look at those portraits here, those are the heads of government we had here in Estonia before the war, and they were all killed by the Soviet authorities." He was referring to mass repression of Estonians after the country, along with fellow Baltic states Latvia and Lithuania, was incorporated into the former Soviet Union in 1941. "For the Estonian people, Hitler and Stalin, they are both murderers," Ansip added. Ansip said his nation of 1.3 million people did not want to live in the past, however, and sought pragmatic relations with Russia. He urged the European Union, which Estonia joined in 2004, to carry on its negotiations for a new cooperation treaty. "One day, one lovely day, the Russian people will understand it is a big shame when they think such a small country as Estonia or Latvia or Georgia are enemies for Russia," Ansip said, referring to a recent opinion poll giving Russians' views on these countries. "We would like to have good neighbourly and pragmatic relations with all our neighbours." For this reason, he wanted Brussels to pursue its tough talks with Russia over a cooperation treaty, derailed by Moscow's ban on Polish meat imports and worries over democracy. "When EU states have those negotiations with Russia separately, there will be 27 losers and one winner," Ansip said. "When we speak with one voice, there will be a win-win situatio
