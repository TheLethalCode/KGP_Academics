<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England striker Michael Owen has given coach Steve McClaren a lift before September's Euro 2008 qualifiers by returning to action for club side Newcastle after recovering from a thigh problem. Owen played 60 minutes in a friendly on Monday after missing most of pre-season as well as the side's Premier League opener at the weekend. "I feel fine, it was only a small injury, a little niggle," Owen, who declared himself fit to face Aston Villa on Saturday, told the Newcastle Web site. "It had me out for a couple of weeks but I've trained the last four or five days and I was confident I'd be fine and it was good to get back out on the pitch." England, who face Germany in a friendly at Wembley on Aug. 22, will be without Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney for two months after he suffered a broken left foot on Sunday. England also have problems in central defence following injuries to captain John Terry of Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur's Ledley King and Middlesbrough's Jonathan Woodgate. Rooney will definitely miss the two Euro 2008 qualifiers next month -- against Israel on Sept. 8 and Russia four days later
