<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares slid in early trade on Wednesday as the rising number of financial institutions revealing credit-related problems hit bank stocks, while Nestle shares rose after upbeat earnings. By 0734 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares was down 0.8 percent at 1,483.59 points, having lost 1.2 percent on Tuesday. Shares in UBS, BNP Paribas and Banco Santander were among the biggest negative weights on the index, dragging the DJStoxx index of European banks down by 1.5 percent. "It's quite clear (investors) are effectively leaving financials .. which makes a lot of sense," said Heino Ruland, a strategist at German brokerage Steubing. "...Financials will continue to be in trouble but, otherwise, I doubt that the market will be that negative even if the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States will lead to lower growth," he said. European companies depend much more on the reslience of emerging market economies into which to sell their exports, he added. Global equity markets fell as a U.S. fund on Tuesday tried to stop clients withdrawing cash to avoid investments at a discount, while a Canadian trust could not find the funds it needed to repay outstanding asset-backed commercial paper. Investor nerves were already frayed after UBS on Tuesday unveiled record profits for the second-quarter but said a prolonged period of market turbulence would hurt its investment banking business. This followed Goldman Sachs and other investors bailing out one of its hedge funds, and BNP Paribas' announcement last week that it had frozen three funds because of the deterioration in the US subprime sector. The European equity market has fallen by almost 9 percent from its 2007 highs in mid-July as what started as a problem in the US mortgage sector has now spread to other markets. "There's been wave after wave of bad news...and a continuation of the trend of ongoing risk reduction. There's uncertainty and no-one knows how much further this will go or how bad the situation is," said Martin McMahon, a currency strategist at Credit Suisse. London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 percent, while Frankfurt's DAX dropped 0.6 percent and Paris' CAC 40 shed 1.1 percent. Outside the banking sector, shares in Nestle were the top weighted gainer on the FTSEurofirst, rising over 4 percent after it said it would beat its own growth forecasts and as it posted an 18.4 percent increase in first-half net profit, more than expected. The world's largest food group also unveiled a 25 billion Swiss franc ($20.70 billion) share buyback programme over three years. Swedish fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz posted a year-on-year rise in July sales that fell short of expectations, sending the company's shares down by 1.5 percent. Deutsche Telekom was among the few gainers after a newspaper said the company planned to cut 2,000 more jobs on top of the 32,000 it is already slashing. Deutsche Telekom shares rose 0.5 percent, making them one of the top gainers on Frankfurt's DAX. Shares in GlaxoSmithKline fell by nearly 1 percent after US health officials on Tuesday said diabetes drugs manufactured by the British company would carry new, stronger warnings saying they may cause or worsen heart failu
