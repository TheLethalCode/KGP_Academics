<TITLE> Yen extends gains, hits 14-month high vs dollar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, August 17 (bdnews324.com/Reuters) - The yen extended broad gains on Friday, with fears of a global credit crunch taking the low-yielding currency to a 14-month high versus the dollar as investors unwound riskier carry trade positions. The Japanese currency's gains were pared back however as investors took a chance to cash in on this week's rush to cut riskier carry trade positions. Investors are worrying that distress in financial markets -- stemming from credit jitters -- could worsen, knocking growth in the world's biggest economy and possibly inducing the US Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. This concern about slowing economic growth was not confined to the United States, however, with investors slashing expectations of interest rate rises elsewhere including the euro zone. Panicked investors had bought the yen aggressively, pushing the dollar down more than 2 percent at one point to a low of 111.62 -- last seen in June 2006, while the euro dropped below key support of 150 for the first time this year. Risk aversion rippled through other asset classes, with world stocks falling sharply despite attempts at a rebound in Europe. "The currency market is taking cues from stocks and other risk measures and they are moving in lock-step," said Adam Cole, senior currency strategist at Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets. "Investors are very, very nervous and there will be no move back into high yielding currencies until we get a meaningful bottom in equity markets," he added. By 6:39 a.m. EDT, the dollar was down 0.9 percent at 113.15 yen, while the euro stood at 152.21, having fallen below key support at 150 earlier to hit a low of 149.28. The dollar has fallen roughly 10 percent from a 4-1/2-year high just above 124.00 yen hit in June. That leaves it positioned for the worst weekly performance since October 1998, when it plunged about 14 percent on a massive unwind of carry trades after the Russian debt default and near collapse of hedge fund Long Term Capital Management. Implied volatility on one-week yen options, or how much the markets expect a currency pair to move over a given period, hit 30 percent, the highest since 1998. TUMBLING HIGH YIELDERS The high-yielding New Zealand dollar dived again, having dropped nearly 9 percent against the yen over the past two sessions and 5 percent versus the dollar during the same period. Currency traders have used equity markets as a barometer of risk appetite for carry trades, in which market players borrow low-yielding yen to buy higher-yielding currencies. Moves were exaggerated by thin trading conditions, and the Reserve Bank of Australia said on Friday it had intervened to buy the Aussie on Thursday to restore some liquidity. . The New Zealand dollar fell to $0.6643, hitting its lowest level since November 2006. The kiwi shed almost 5 percent to 75.96 yen, having hit its lowest since September last year and falling more than 20 percent from a 21-year high hit just three weeks ago. The Australian dollar fell to $0.7770, its lowest level since March. Japan's top financial diplomat, Naoyuki Shinohara, stuck to the Ministry of Finance's standard line on currencies on Friday, saying he was watching the market carefully but would not comment on specific levels. "We have asset liquidation with institutional investors moving to get hedges done resulting in yen buying," said Hans-Guenter Redeker, chief FX strategist at BNP Paribas. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said there are no plans for a special G7 meeting after speculation had mounted that such a meeting would take place to discuss the current turmoil sparked by problems in the credit markets.
