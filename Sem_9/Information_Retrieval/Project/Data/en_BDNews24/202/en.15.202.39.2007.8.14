<TITLE> US inflation gauge ticks up; trade gap narrows </TITLE>

 WASHINGTON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rising energy costs drove up US producer prices last month, while the trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in June on stronger exports, according to reports on Tuesday suggesting the Federal Reserve may have to remain cautious about cutting interest rates. The Fed in recent days has been pumping liquidity into credit markets roiled by fears over the spreading impact of subprime mortgage defaults. But inflation and a strengthening economy could complicate any future Fed moves, analysts said. Producer prices -- a measure of the prices paid at the farm and factory gate -- rose 0.6 percent in July, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters forecast producer prices would rise 0.2 percent last month. "This report won't alter the Fed's concern about upside risks to inflation. But in light of the growing turmoil in credit markets, the risks to the economy are also piling up," said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. The Fed said last week that inflation remained its predominant concern, although it acknowledged that credit conditions had tightened for some households and businesses. The central bank showed concern over the fragile financial system by pumping billions of dollars of credit into the banking system in recent days. Underlying data suggested that inflation, while still a concern, was in line with recent trends. Stripping out food and energy costs, producer prices advanced 0.1 percent, even less than the 0.2 percent increase that economists had forecast. The core inflation figure "is a good number and probably keeps the Fed happy with where they are now," said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management in Boston. But other analysts called the report a negative inflation surprise, saying it was not enough to keep the year-on-year core rate from rising 2.3 percent. "While it seems so far that higher commodity prices have not been spilling over to prices of other consumer goods, we remain convinced this development threatens a broader pickup in inflation," said Harm Bandholz, economist at UniCredit Markets in New York. A clearer picture will emerge on Wednesday when the Labor Department issues consumer price data for July. US Treasury debt prices initially fell after the report but rebounded later on renewed concerns about losses from the US subprime mortgage market. Market pscyhology was undermined by a report from Toronto-based fund Global Diversified Investment Grade Income Trust that it could not repay outstanding asset-based commercial paper. The US trade deficit unexpectedly narrowed in June as a weaker dollar and overseas growth boosted exports to a new record. The June trade gap totaled $58.1 billion, down 1.7 percent from a downwardly revised May deficit of $59.2 billion, the Commerce Department said. The June deficit was below the median forecast of $61 billion from Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters. Overall goods and services exports rose 1.5 percent from May to a record $134.5 billion, led by a $1.2 billion increase in industrial supplies and materials and record exports of vehicles, auto parts and engines and of foods, feeds and beverages. Rising US exports are contributing to a narrowing of the trade gap on an annual basis and are helping to underpin domestic growth in the face of a steep housing downturn and credit market turmoil. Some analysts said the data would result in an upward revision to US gross domestic product growth for the second quarter, which was initially reported at a 3.4 percent pace. "The weaker US dollar is helping to narrow the US trade deficit, which will continue to add to GDP growth in coming quarters," said Jennifer Lee, economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. The figure suggests "a hearty upward revision to second quarter growth, possibly to over 4 percent," she said. US imports in June rose 0.5 percent to a record $192.7 billion as the US oil import bill edged higher to $19.6 billion and imports from China increased. The average price for crude oil rose $1.59 a barrel to $60.95, the highest since $62.40 in September 2006. Imports from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries, however, decreased 4.6 percent to $13.9 billion. The politically sensitive US trade deficit with China widened 5.7 percent in June to $21.2 billion, despite record exports of $5.9 billion to China. Imports from China rose 6.8 percent or $1.7 billion to $27.1 billion, the highest since November 2006. China last week reported that its own global trade surplus edged lower in July to $24.36 billion from a record $26.91 billion in June as rebates of value added taxes were eliminated on July 1 for 2,800 export product lines. Separately, a survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showed that forecasters trimmed their estimates for third quarter US growth, to 2.5 percent from a pervious forecast of 2.6 percent.
