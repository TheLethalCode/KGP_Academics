 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  Ericsson has set its sights on unleashing the third-generation mobile phone technology in Bangladesh, its chief financial officer Karl-Henrik Sundstrom said Thursday. Sundstrom told a news conference that Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission should issue the Wideband-CDMA or W-CDMA licences to fast proliferate affordable nationwide wireless access to the internet. He said W-CDMA is a natural migration from voice-centric GSM to the world of multimedia in mobility. "The W-CDMA licence should be moderately priced," Sundstrom said, referring to the overpriced European model of licensing in the late 1990s. The west European operators paid over 20 billion euros in licence fees and went broke before investing in the 3G mobile network deployments. "Such licence in Bangladesh should be independent of technology and under a clearly defined spectrum," said Sundstrom, who is on his second visit to Bangladesh in less than a year. He said BTRC should stipulate milestones in the licences to ensure fast rollout of the 3G networks. "Ericsson's W-CDMA provides 7.2 megabits per second (Mbps) data throughout and it will be increased to 28 Mbps next year." Users will plug their W-CDMA handsets with the computers and access to Internet at multi-megabits speed from anywhere. "[Bangladesh] is a very important market for us," said the Swedish telecoms giant's financial chief as well as the executive vice president. "Bangladesh was in Ericsson's top ten market list during the first quarter of this year." He said the country has little over 18 percent mobile penetration and the potential is bright. "On an average a Bangladeshi subscriber talks for 300 minutes in a month and that is nearly the double volume of European mobile traffic." Declining tariff twined with increasing affordability of subscription as well as the availability of low-cost handsets have been spiralling the growth of mobile phone business in Bangladesh, he noted. Sandstrom brushed aside the perception of W-CDMA being expensive than GSM in terms of network and handsets. "We have halved the network deployment costs and significantly reduced other expenses too," said the official of the world's largest mobile-phone networks maker by market share and profitability. He said low-cost handsets have been driving the worldwide growth of GSM mobile. Ericsson has developed the platform of low-cost W-CDMA handsets. "It will help the manufacturers to release affordable W-CDMA handsets." Ericsson supplies handset platforms to the competitors of London-based Sony Ericsson, a 50 percent joint venture of handset manufacturing with Sony. Sundstrom said it took 20 years for the first billion mobile users to sign up and the second billion came in just 40 months. In 2007, within just two years, the third billion mobile users were added. He said his company enjoys 40 percent global market share in GSM and W-CDMA combined. Ericsson's second-quarter pre-tax profit rose to 9.3 billion Swedish crowns ($1.4 billion) from 8.3 billion crowns a year earlier. Sales totalled 47.6 billion crowns in the second quarter and the cash flow rose to 4.2 billion crowns from 0.2 billion crowns a year earlier. Ericsson is celebrating its 10th year in Bangladesh but cancelled all festivities and donated Tk 25 lakh for the flood victims instead. The Swedish telecoms giant currently employs over 800 people, more than 70 percent of whom are Bangladeshi. More than 10 percent of them are female as well, according to the company. Ericsson is the sole supplier of Grameenphone's network. It has also provided the entire core network as well as a large portion of Warid's base stations. Ericsson has been a major supplier of AKTEL and recently it sneaked in to Banglalink. Warid has also outsourced the entire maintenance and operations of its network to Ericsson. bdn
