 LONDON, August 17 (bdnews24.com/amt/Reuters) - Oil rose above $71 a barrel on Friday as Hurricane Dean blew on a course that could take it towards Gulf of Mexico rigs and refineries, countering renewed weakness in European equities. The hurricane threatened to become a dangerously powerful storm as it moved into Caribbean and aimed for Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula or the Gulf of Mexico, home to about a third of US oil output. "Hurricane Dean should not yet be counted off," said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix. "History has shown that a hurricane crossing across the Yucatan can quickly regain strength once it steps back into the Gulf." US crude was up 64 cents at $71.64 a barrel at 1130 GMT. London Brent crude was up 65 cents at $70.42. On Thursday, US crude fell $2.33 as investors sold energy to offset losses elsewhere or out of fear that a squeeze on credit will slow economic growth. It is down 9 percent from its August 1 record high of $78.77. Helping oil claw back some of those losses, Dean was expected to become a Category 4 storm next week as it heads south of Jamaica, aiming either for the Gulf of Mexico or the Yucatan Peninsula. The storm could threaten oil and natural gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico whether it goes across the Yucatan or slips directly into the Gulf. Energy markets have been on edge since 2004 and 2005, when hurricanes Ivan, Katrina and Rita toppled oil rigs and flooded refineries on the US Gulf Coast. STOCKS FALL Oil remains vulnerable to further losses, say analysts. Markets have been hit by fears of financial instability after troubles with risky US mortgages and a squeeze on credit. "We still believe that further liquidation could cause US WTI prices to drop to $67, or even lower, given the large remaining net speculative length in energy," Goldman Sachs said in a report. World stocks took another dive on Friday despite early attempts at a rebound in Europe. Wall Street looked set for a weak opening. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300 was down 0.7 percent in roller-coaster trading, and analysts said a further sharp slide would spill over into oil. "It will be some time before commodity markets decouple themselves from the tumult going on in the financial markets," said Edward Meir of MF Global. "Should we get another sharp drop in equities, energy prices will most likely be swept lower in the downdraft once again." The drying up of mortgage credit will worsen the US housing market slump, cutting deeper into US growth than estimated just weeks ago, economists said. Even so, analysts said the Asian economies driving oil demand remained strong.
