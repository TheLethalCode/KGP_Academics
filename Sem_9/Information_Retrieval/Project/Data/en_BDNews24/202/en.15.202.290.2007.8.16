 BELGRADE, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serbia says the United States must abandon an alleged plan to turn the breakaway province of Kosovo into a "NATO state" if it wants normal relations in future. In the latest attack on Western support for Kosovo's independence, Interior Minister Dragan Jocic on Thursday said Washington "must give up the dangerous experiment that started with (the) illegal and ruthless destruction of our country".
