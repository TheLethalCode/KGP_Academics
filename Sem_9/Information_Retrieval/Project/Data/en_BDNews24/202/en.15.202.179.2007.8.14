<TITLE> Khaleda sacrifices birthday celebrations for flood victims </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has no plans to formally celebrate her birthday Wednesday, considering the plight of flood-affected people, an aide has said. Khaleda turns 63. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com late Tuesday that his party chief had decided not to hold any function. "If any of you had planned any function on my birthday, spend the money for flood victims," Khan quoted Khaleda as saying. There are no formalities even at her cantonment home and the former prime minister sought blessings from people, Khan said. In the recent past, the BNP had celebrated Khaleda's birthday on Aug 15. The Aug 15 is the death anniversary of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as he was assassinated on the day in 1975, along with most of his family. The Awami League had never accepted the joyous celebrations of Khaleda's birthday in recent years and alleged that Khaleda and the BNP chose the day as her "birthday" to stymie people's feelings about the Bangabandhu killing. The BNP denies the allegations. Khaleda was born in Dinajpur in 1945. BNP's student wing Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal said it would organise a milad mahfil at the High Court mazaar mosque. It will also distribute relief among flood victims in the low-lying areas of Dhaka. bdnews24
