<TITLE> UK mortgage lenders face growing funding worries </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's top mortgage lenders may have limited exposure to subprime troubles across the Atlantic, but they are facing growing concerns over the impact of the crisis on their ability to raise funds and on costs. Led by Northern Rock -- the UK lender most reliant on wholesale markets -- UK mortgage banks frequently turn to the asset-backed securities market, where consumer debt is packaged and sold on, to raise funds for loans. But, hit by subprime turmoil and a reduced appetite for risk, liquidity there is drying up. Northern Rock, which analysts say depends on wholesale sources for as much as 87 percent of its funding, has so far felt the brunt of the pain in a UK banking sector battered by credit jitters, losing almost a quarter of its value since the start of July. The shares fell to 4-and-a-half year lows on Thursday, despite reassurances it continued to raise funds and saw conditions improving. The cost of insuring the bank's debt against default has tripled, meanwhile, with five-year credit default swaps trading at 90 basis points from around 30 basis points a couple of weeks ago, traders said on Thursday. Concerns have already spread to other lenders which use capital market funding to fuel growth, including banks with a high loan-to-deposit ratio like Bradford & Bingley, Alliance & Leicester and HBOS. HBOS, for example, has a sizeable deposit base, but analysts say that may not be enough to fund its growth ambitions. "We've moved on -- the issue is not direct exposure to subprime customers, it's the impact that has had on banks' ability to securitise," analyst Mike Trippitt at Oriel Securities said. "Even though Northern Rock does not have direct exposure to subprime lending, it is trying to sell assets, or securitising, into the same market as subprime lenders -- though admittedly on different prices. That's a real threat, not a contagion effect." Northern Rock had already said in June that profit growth would slow this year due to rising borrowing costs after five UK interest rate rises in the past year. "At this point in the game you would rather have customer deposits as they are not as sensitive to financial conditions as say bonds or inter-bank lending," said Corinne Cunningham, a credit analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland, adding the bank could, if the situation worsens, become a takeover target. "The timing is crucial. For Northern Rock the funding issue, while acute, does not look yet insurmountable," she said. Beyond the arithmetic impact of higher funding costs on revenues and the prospects for the asset-backed securities market, analysts said there were also growing concerns over the UK mortgage market, with home repossessions edging up off all-time lows, and over credit quality. Impairment trouble so far has been largely on the unsecured side -- credit cards rather than homes -- but analysts at Credit Suisse said lender B&B, for example, was already suffering as investors moving off fixed-rate mortgages spent less time on more lucrative variable rates. Beyond the mortgage lenders, however, funding worries are hitting even the sector's heavyweights, Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, active in structured credit. Investors are fretting over growth for the rest of 2007 after a booming first half driven by investment banking. Both banks reassured investors over the outlook at the half year, but Barclays shares have dropped over 12 percent since the start of July, while RBS has fallen almost 14 percent. Standard Chartered has been hit by worries a US slowdown could hit its Asian business, dropping 10 percent. So far, the bank least impacted has been HSBC, Britain's largest bank and the only one so far to take a major charge over U.S. subprime lending. One of the biggest players in the segment, HSBC wrote off bad debts of $10.6 billion in 2006 compared to $7.8 billion in 2005, but has since said it is on top of the situation. "They have a very strong balance sheet, funding shouldn't be an issue for them. They have excess capital even compared to their very conservative targets," analyst Bruce Packard at Pali International said. "It could be wrong to sell HSBC on the back of worries about contagion."
