<TITLE> Venezuela opposition slams Chavez reforms </TITLE>

 CARACAS, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition on Thursday attacked President Hugo Chavez's proposed constitutional reforms that would extend presidential term limits as part of his drive for a self-styled socialist revolution. Chavez proposed a raft of legal changes on Wednesday that increase the presidential term from six to seven years, end limits on re-election and strengthen the state's expropriation powers as he consolidates his hold over the OPEC nation. The changes would have to be approved by a popular referendum. Critics of the Venezuelan leader say he has steadily edged his oil-producing nation to a dictatorship but, through use of petroleum dollars, Chavez has secured strong support among the poor majority with free health and education projects. Justice First opposition party leader Julio Borges dismissed Chavez's reforms as a thinly veiled attempt to advance his "continuous re-election, re-election for life, permanent re-election." "The path that should have been taken was to convoke a constituent assembly so the people could participate," Borges said in a morning television interview. Under the current constitution, Chavez is in his second and final term and could not be elected again after it ends in 2012. The reform proposal would allow him to stay as long as he keeps winning elections. Former presidential candidate Manuel Rosales, who lost to Chavez when the president won a landslide re-election last year, was scheduled to hold a press conference on Thursday morning on the proposed reforms. Opposition leaders and US officials frequently accuse Chavez, an anti-US leader with close ties to Cuba's Fidel Castro, of concentrating power and controlling institutions, such as the central bank and oil company PDVSA. But his oil-financed anti-poverty crusade has built up his support among the poor majority that has consistently backed him at the polls since his first election in 1998. He remains overwhelmingly popular while the fractured opposition has been widely discredited, particularly after a bungled coup in 2002 and massive oil strike later that year that nearly shuttered the vital petroleum industry. Chavez already holds a firm grip over state institutions, including the legislature -- where supporters control 100 percent of seats -- courts and state and municipal governments expect for a few where opposition candidates won posts.
