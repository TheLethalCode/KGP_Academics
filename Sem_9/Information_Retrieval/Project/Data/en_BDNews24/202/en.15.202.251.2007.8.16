 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)  Stocks rallied Thursday for a third day as the right share announcement of Summit Power spurred investors into heavy buying. A rumour that the Securities and Exchange Commission will reintroduce the financial adjustment facility also buoyed the market. Summit Power, the mostly traded issue, rallied 3.52 percent to reach a one-year high of Tk 1492. Summit had earlier said it would issue four right shares against five existing shares. The power sector, however, finished mixed due to a fall in the shares of DESCO and the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. DESCO, one of the mostly traded issues, fell 1.68 percent to Tk 961. Power Grid dipped 0.35 percent to Tk 559. Ziaul Haque Khondker, an investment banker, said: "A substantial portion of money is chasing a few good stocks, as fresh funds are coming." "The market appears stable, as long as some new stocks are put in place." "It's a good thing, as this rise helps increase the value of funds," he added. AB Bank share went up 6.09 percent to Tk 1757.25 on speculation of better earnings after it reported a sharp rise in its half-yearly profits. Banking stocks closed mixed as market heavyweights BRAC, Pubali, Prime Bank and Southeast Bank declined due to profit taking. However, buying pressure drove Uttara Bank 4.33 percent higher to end at Tk 2747.5. Padma Oil, one of the state-run petroleum marketing companies that had seen irregular trading, surged 7.87 percent to Tk 925.10 on increased expectation that the government would sell further stakes in the company. The government previously decided to sell a portion of its stakes in Meghna Petroleum and Jamuna Oil. Beximco Pharma advanced 4.33 percent to Tk 51.10, although Square Pharma, the biggest share by market capitalisation dropped. Buoyed by increased demand for shares, the cement sector extended its gains with Lafarge Surma and Heidelberg Cement ending positive. The DGEN or general index added 16.27 points or 0.69 percent to 2361.34. The DSI or all-share price index, gained 16.80 points or 0.86 percent to 1950.70. A loss in Square Pharma shares did however drive the DSE-20 blue-chip index 15.86 points or 0.77 percent down to 2023.65. Gainers beat losers 118 to 76 with 20 issues holding steady. A total of 15,427,381 shares were traded, worth a total of Tk 1.42 billion. All the indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange closed higher. On the CSE, a total of 3,747,982 shares worth Tk 175.21 million were traded. Some 58 issues gained, 44 lost and six finished unchanged on the CSE. bdnews24
