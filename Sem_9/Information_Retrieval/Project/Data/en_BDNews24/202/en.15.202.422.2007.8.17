 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)Two departments under the agricultural ministry hope that the ongoing floods will result in bumper production of all agricultural products in the coming seasons if drought does not hit the country generally. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) and the Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI) also predict that the use of fertiliser in the coming years should be reduced considerably as layers of fine alluvial sediments have deposited on the cultivable lands inundated by the floodwaters of late. Officials said the production of fish in open and natural water bodies will also increase meeting the protein demands of the people, especially the poorer section. "We have got reports from the field level that on average a two-inch thick fine sediments have deposited on lands inundated by the floodwaters in Sirajganj area. This silt deposition will bring forth bumper production of all agricultural products including rice and vegetables," Dr Shahidul Islam, director of field service wing of the DAE told bdnews24.com Wednesday. He said the use of fertilisers must come down to a great extent through at least the next two seasons as on average, all the inundated lands got at least one-inch thick layer of alluvial fine sediment But he could not give an instant estimation as to how much fertilisers would be saved in the process. According to the DAE, the farmers use about 27 lakh metric tonnes of urea fertiliser alone annually. "Most of our farmers don't apply fertilisers as per DAE suggestions. They possess the traditional knowledge that flood sediments increase fertility and so, apply fertilisers accordingly. Therefore, it is not possible to predict how much fertilisers can be saved through the forthcoming seasons," Islam said. A Principal Scientific Officer (PSO) of the SRDI Md Kabil Hossain Dewan agreed with the director and told bdnews24.com Wednesday, "The flooding is like bathing of soil using nutritive elements." "The floodwaters will wash away all the chemical ingredients and insecticides used in the field. So, we can expect a bumper yield of all agricultural products," Dewan said. "One of the main causes of low agricultural production here is that our farmers don't use balanced fertilisers. The alluvial sediments brought in by the floodwaters help strike a balance in the use of fertiliser and manure," Anil Chandra Sarker, a deputy director of the DAE told bdnews24.com Wednesday. Since most ponds and lakes were inundated by the floodwaters, fish production in the coming seasons was also expected to be much higher, said Sarkar. According to the DAE estimates, the 2007 floods inundated 16,25,279.76 acres of land in 262 upzillas under 39 districts, of which crops on 11,42686.22 acres have been totally destroyed by the floodwaters. b
