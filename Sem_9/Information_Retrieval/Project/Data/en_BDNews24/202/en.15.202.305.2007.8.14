 SYDNEY/HONG KONG, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asia's central banks were back to business as usual on Tuesday as the regional fallout from the global credit squeeze abated, at least for the moment. In a clear sign that the scramble for cash was easing, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) drained 1.6 trillion yen ($13.6 billion) from the country's banking system in two operations, reversing two days of injections as surplus funds drove down the call rate. Japan's overnight call rate traded as low as 0.01 percent, way below the BOJ's target of 0.5 percent. "We judged it appropriate to drain funds as market rates were trading low in early dealings, indicating that there are ample funds in the system," a BOJ official told Reuters. In South Korea, top economic policy makers including the finance minister and central bank chief met early on Tuesday to discuss the US subprime mortgage crisis and its potential consequences. Yet they were at pains to play down the importance of the talks, denying media reports that it was an emergency meeting. "It's a kind of regular one, and the subprime mortgage issue was among the main subjects today because that is important," said a finance ministry official, who declined to be named. In Australia, the central bank's money market operations were back to something like normal on Tuesday, although bad news from a mortgage lender kept the mood tense. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) added A$2.6 billion ($2.2 billion) in its regular operation, which was a little higher than average but modest compared to Friday's A$4.9 billion injection. "The central banks acted quickly to keep the banking system ticking over and that's helped avoid a dramatic liquidity squeeze," said Peter Jolly, head of research at nabCapital. "But people are clearly still nervous, wondering where the next body is buried," he added. Australian mortgage lender RAMS Home Loans Group said it could suffer if the volatility in debt markets continued. The market slashed 19.4 percent off its share price, even though RAMS had no direct exposure to the U.S. subprime mess. The yen rose as investors further trimmed positions in risky carry trades due to worries about bank and fund losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector. The low-yielding Japanese currency has been widely used by speculators as a cheap source of funds to buy higher-yielding currencies such as the New Zealand and Australian dollars. The yen jumped against both those currencies on Tuesday. Asian equity markets remained under a cloud and European stocks were expected to open lower. The calmer tone in Asian money markets followed fresh action by the European Central Bank (ECB), which lent out 47.67 billion euros ($65.29 billion) in overnight funds on Monday. That was the third straight session of sizable injections, but half the size of the 94.8 billion euros lavished on the market last Thursday when interbank rates jumped on fears European banks faced huge exposure to risky US mortgage debt. The euro hit a one-month low against the dollar on Tuesday as the volatility in the money markets cooled expectations of an ECB interest rate rise in September. For similar reasons, speculation on a Japanese rate rise this month has also become less intense. The U.S. Federal Reserve added only a modest $2 billion in extra cash on Monday, far below the $38 billion injected to stabilise money markets on Friday. The ECB said markets were starting to return to normal, while the Fed reiterated it was ready to provide cash to the financial system as needed. That seemed to soothe investors and Wall Street steadied after steep falls last week. The stock market was also reassured by news that investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and outside investors would spend $3 billion to prop up a hedge fund that had been hammered by the recent market turmoil. Still, private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. warned that weak debt market conditions could cut into its investment returns and confirmed that the U.S. Department of Justice was probing it for anti-trust violations. "In the context of recent price action, an element of normality seems to have crept back into markets," said Darren Gibbs, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in New Zealand. "Whilst the Fed only injected $2 billion of liquidity, federal funds generally traded at or below the formal 5.25 percent target rate," he added, noting the VIX measure of market volatility also fell 6 percent on Mond
