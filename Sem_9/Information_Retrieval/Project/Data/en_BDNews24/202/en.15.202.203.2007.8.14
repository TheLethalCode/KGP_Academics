<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) A Dhaka court Tuesday set September 6 for verdict delivery in the gold smuggling case filed against former president Hussain Muhammad Ershad. Md Abul Bashar, First Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge of Dhaka set the judgment date at 12:30 pm after hearing the defence arguments in the presence of the accused. Sheikh Sirajul Islam, Ershad's lawyer told bdnews24.com that none of eight witnesses listed in the case admitted to 'Ershad being involved with the alleged gold smuggling'. According to the case details, the airport customs officials arrested four persons including two citizens of England and Germany at Zia International Airport (ZIA) on July 9, 1990. They recovered three thousand tolas of gold from them. Customs and VAT inspector Md. Zakaria filed a case with Dhaka Cantonment police station against the two foreigners, Major (retd) Ashraf Uddin, manager of ZIA and Abu Taher, security officer in this connection. After investigation, the Crime and Investigation Department (CID) of police submitted supplementary charge-sheet, appending Ershad's name as a co-accused in the case. After Ershad filed an appeal with the High Court for cancelling the case, the HC suspended Ershad's trial in connection with the case. The four other accused in the case were, however, convicted on May 14, 1992 to serve various jail sentences. bdnews
