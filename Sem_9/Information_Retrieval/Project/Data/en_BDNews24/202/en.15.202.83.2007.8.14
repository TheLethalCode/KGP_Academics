 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission Tuesday approved a set of rules for merchant banks, saying the regulator will fix a maximum limit on loan disbursement against portfolio accounts. Under the new measure, which came to be known as margin rules, merchant banks will not be allowed to extend credit to own directors, executives or close relatives of its employees and sponsor shareholders. "We have not fixed any margin ratio by law. We will instead determine the ratio required from time to time considering the market situation," said SEC executive director Farhad Ahmed. "The SEC will canvas public opinion prior to publishing the regulation in the gazette. We will try to put the rule in place as early as possible." "Loan exposure in any particular sector will now be no more than 50 percent of the total loans extended to any investor," he said, referring to the Merchant Bankers and Portfolio Manager Regulation, which is awaiting a final vetting. "Sometimes investors borrow from merchant banks and then invest 100 percent of that loan in just one sector." The regulator had previously requested merchant banks to send details on the loans they had extended to the groups. The SEC approved the regulation amid allegations of unrestrained margin loans from those institutions. There are strong suspicions that this is partly responsible for a lingering surge in the price of stocks and excess liquidity in the market. "We have barred loan extensions to directors and employees based on previous experience," Ahmed said. Merchant banks will now only be able to sanction credit to their clients based on stocks, bonds, debenture, mutual funds and various types of government securities. "Merchant banks will also be allowed to sanction credit against the money an investor has deposited with them," Ahmed said. bdnew
