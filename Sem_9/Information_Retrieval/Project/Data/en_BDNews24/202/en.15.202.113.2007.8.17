 NEW DELHI, August 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was China's head of government he would have been shot for "bluffing" to the nation over a controversial nuclear deal with the United States, a former Indian defence minister said. The landmark agreement opens the way for civilian nuclear cooperation between the two countries, but critics say it will eventually hurt India's nuclear security because of US laws on nuclear trade governing the pact. "What has emerged is that the prime minister of the country has betrayed the nation by continuous bluffing, something unbecoming of the head of the government," George Fernandes, who was part of the previous Hindu nationalist-led government, said in a statement. "If it were China, they would have settled it with one bullet in his head," the maverick veteran politician said in the statement sent to Reuters on Friday. The deal aims to give India access to US nuclear fuel and equipment for the first time in three decades despite New Delhi having tested nuclear weapons and not having signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Both the Hindu nationalist opposition and communist allies of Singh's Congress party-led coalition have attacked the historic nuclear deal, saying it was an unfair and unequal pact. Singh has strongly defended the deal, saying it is crucial for India's development and would not impact New Delhi's foreign or security policies.
