 LONDON, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks tumbled in early trade on Thursday as credit market jitters intensified, the yen rose, government bond yields fell and all measures of risk reflected growing investor queasiness. Financial stocks led a 2.7 percent fall in Europe as part of an across-the-board slide fuelled by worries over exposure to the battered US subprime mortgages market. Asian shares outside Japan headed for their worst daily percentage fall since the attacks on the United States in September 2001, tracking a broad U.S. stock slide spurred by rumours of funding trouble at top mortgage lender Countrywide Financial. Analysts said investors were being forced to sell high quality assets to meet margin calls in many cases. "People are selling good stocks for bad, selling liquid assets because they can," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. "The key questions are what levels of margin calls people are facing and whether the carry trade will snap with the rise in the yen and the dramatic falls in local currencies." The yen rose to a five-month high against the dollar and yen carry trades -- purchases of higher yielding, riskier assets using the low-yielding Japanese currency -- unwound. MSCI's main world stock index was down 1.6 percent and has shed 11 percent from a peak hit in July as a credit crunch stemming from a crisis in subprime mortgages has led to fears of a withering in acquisition activity and raised broader questions about the banking system's exposure. Easy credit, which has fuelled leveraged buyout activity, continued to fade on Thursday. The iTraxx Crossover index, Europe's most widely watched index of credit sentiment, widened 18 points. "The effects from U.S. credit on global markets remains consistent with a textbook case unravelling of financial contagion over a week after central banks intervened to normalise conditions," wrote Lena Komileva, an economist at Tullett Prebon. The European Central Bank (ECB) had so far on Thursday announced no plans to inject extra funds into the euro zone money markets, staying away for two days running. Some measures of risk aversion are at their most intense since September 2001 but corporate earnings this quarter have come in broadly strong, leading some strategists to recommend overweight positions on equities. Underlining gold's diminished status as a safe haven, the precious metal fell by $4.10 an ounce, and Brent Crude dropped by $1.66 to below $70 a barrel. Oil shares BP and Total were the top weighted losers on the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 stock index. Strong UK retail sales belied expectations that consumer activity is slowing, leading analysts to conclude that the Bank of England may still raise interest rates again this year. The figures led sterling to pare losses and added to the gloom on Britain's FTSE share benchmark. Data released on Thursday showed that Eurozone inflation eased to 1.8 percent in July, well within the ECB's target area. Eurozone Government bonds rallied as investors sought sanctuary from a broad sell-off. The two-year Schatz's yield fell 5 basis points to 4.05 percent. A Reuters poll earlier this week showed that most economists expect a rate rise next month in Europe but less than half of those polled see another increase by the end of the year. Emerging market equities fell 4 percent and JPMorgan's EMBI+ gauge of bond spreads widened 7 basis points to its widest in three weeks, taking its move over the past three days to 24 basis points. Most emerging market currencies hit their lowest levels in several months. Tullett Prebon's Komileva said that volatility in VIX and bond markets suggested that the repricing of credit risk was not over, and that the market remained underweight in government debt. Carry-trade unwinding had already exceeded a sharp move in February and March, she noted. "Option pricing suggests that we are far from the end of this." The DAX-NEW volatility index, a measure of anticipated volatility in Europe, was up 13 percent, on track for its biggest daily percentage gain since worries over growth roiled markets in March. Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, Nasdaq and S&P500 were all trading lower, indicating a weaker start on Wall Stre
