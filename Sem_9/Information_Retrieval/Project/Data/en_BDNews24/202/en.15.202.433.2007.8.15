 LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Broadcaster ITV increased its adult viewing figures for its main ITV1 channel in July by 23 percent and has maintained a strong performance in August, it said on Wednesday, boosting its shares. Analysts welcomed the figures, which follow the appointment at the end of last year of broadcasting veteran Michael Grade as executive chairman. Grade has pledged to improve the standard of programming after a dismal showing last year when the broadcaster lost viewers and advertisers. A spokeswoman said the number of adults watching ITV1 in July had increased 23 percent compared with a year ago when it struggled against the BBC for World Cup viewers. That follows a 3 percent increase in June and a 4 percent increase in May. The improvement gave ITV1 an adult impact share (number of adult viewers watching) in July of 30.4 percent. The increase at the network is important for ITV as it is locked into a regulatory system called Contract Rights Renewal (CRR) which allows advertisers to cut the percentage of their marketing budgets spent on the channel if ratings decline. CRR is linked to ITV's share of commercial impacts (SOCI) -- one viewer watching one advert -- and this was up 6.3 percent in July compared with the same period a year ago, the spokeswoman said. ITV said the increase was due to popular dramas and weak comparatives last year, as July in 2006 followed the soccer World Cup which the BBC dominated. The channel said it had also achieved its best share this Monday for the key weekday 9pm slot in August since 2004. Figures also improved thanks to new daytime programmes while ITV2 ranked as the best performing digital channel. Analysts at Citigroup welcomed the figures in a research note. They said they had not expected to see such an improvement this early. ITV's shares were up 2.5 percent in morning trading before falling back to close up 2 percent at 106.1 pence.
