<TEXT>
 TOKYO, August 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and most of his cabinet are expected to stay away from a war shrine that has been the focus of past diplomatic strife on Wednesday, the anniversary of the nation's surrender in World War Two. Abe has refused to say if he will visit Yasukuni Shrine while in office, but media reports say he and all but one of his cabinet ministers will stay away, at least on the anniversary. Kyodo news agency said quoted unspecified government sources as saying that Sanae Takaichi, the minister in charge of gender equality, planned to visit the war shrine later on Wednesday. But Abe's predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi, whose previous visits to Yasukuni chilled ties with China and South Korea, made an appearance at the shrine in morning dress on Wednesday to loud cheers from a group of supporters. Yasukuni honours Japanese World War Two leaders convicted by an Allied tribunal as war criminals, along with 2.5 million war dead and many in Asia consider it a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Domestic opinion of the shrine is deeply divided. Relatives of the war dead braved scorching temperatures early on Wednesday morning to pay their respects at the Shinto shrine in central Tokyo. "I don't think Abe should come because of all the trouble it causes," said Kanai Fukuo, 74, who was visiting the shrine early on Wednesday. "Of course he has the right ... But it's just not worth it." Other visitors were keen to see Abe attend. "I hope Abe comes," said Takenori Honjo, 45, who was at the shrine early on Wednesday. "We don't need to worry about China or Korea, because this is our culture. It is common sense to respect our ancestors. It is more than ceremony, this is our foundation. Without Yasukuni, we feel like we lose our base." Abe moved swiftly after taking office last September to mend damaged ties with Japan's neighbours and analysts say he is unlikely to risk the progress made by paying homage on the anniversary. But Abe came under fire earlier this year for saying there was no evidence the military or government were involved in abducting women into forced prostitution for soldiers before and during World War Two. He later apologised to the women, but risked further controversy after saying on Tuesday he would meet the son of an Indian judge who served on the postwar Allied tribunal. Abe denied that his meeting with the son of Radhabinod Pal, who opposed punishing Japanese convicted as war criminals, during a visit to India next week would provoke protests from other Asian countries. Later on Wednesday he paid his respects at a secular memorial mear Yasukuni and attended a government-sponsored remembrance ceremony alongside Emperor Akihito. "Our country inflicted grave damage and suffering on people of many countries, especially Asian countries. On behalf of the Japanese people, I deeply reflect on it and express my sincere condolence to those who sacrificed their lives," Abe told the ceremony. "We must not forget the fact that friendly relations with all countries and regions of the world have ensured Japan's stability in the post-war era." A cross-party group of about 50 pro-Yasukuni lawmakers visited the shrine on Wednesday. bd
