 Dhaka, August 16 (bdnews24.com)The government will buy 48,000 tonnes of rice to meet increasing demand for it, finance adviser Mirza Azizul Islam said Thursday. The government will not import rice directly. Importers will buy it from India and sell it on to the government at prices ranging between Tk 24.99 and Tk 25.97 per kg, he told reporters after a meeting. The finance adviser said: "The cabinet committee on public purchase approved the plan." "Contractors will reach the rice to 12 government silos," he said. "The per capita income for Bangladeshis has increased by 11 percent over the past few years which explains increased demand for food," Azizul said. bdnews24.
