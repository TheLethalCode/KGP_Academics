 TOKYO, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tokyo share prices fell more than 2 percent to hit their lowest in more than eight months on Wednesday as financial shares dropped on rekindled worries about a credit squeeze and exporters were hit by concern about a slowdown in the US economy. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd. tumbled 5 percent to 2,015 yen after Nokia said it would recall 46 million batteries made by Matsushita that are used in its mobile phones. A lower profit forecast by US retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sparked worries about a slowdown in US consumption, which accounts for 70 percent of the gross domestic product, said Norihiro Fujito, general manager of the investment research and information division at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities Co. Ltd. "On top of the ongoing turmoil at financial institutions hit by the US subprime problems, we have now started to see the impact on the US economy as well as corporate earnings," he said. "It's natural that Toyota is sold and so are Japanese digital home electronics makers as they are the ones which supply goods to Wal-Mart." The benchmark Nikkei average declined 2.19 percent or 369.00 points to 16,475.61, the lowest close since Dec. 8, 2006. The broader TOPIX lost 2.64 percent to 1,594.15, the lowest finish since Nov. 29, 2006. Koichi Takatsuka, a senior fund manager at United Investments Co. Ltd., said his main concern is the US housing market. "Unwinding of highly leveraged funds can be salvaged by fund injections by central banks. But as for US housing prices, you don't know how much they will fall," said Takatsuka. Trade was moderate with 2 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section, almost in line with the daily average volume of 2.1 billion shares in July. Declining stocks outnumbered advancers by a ratio of nearly 13 to one. FINANCIALS HIT Major banks and other financial stocks took a beating. Shares in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan's largest bank, lost 5.3 percent to 1.08 million yen. The bank revealed on Tuesday it had an appraisal loss of 5 billion yen ($42.42 million) on its investment in financial products related to US subprime loans. Its outstanding balance of investment in such products stood at 280 billion yen as of July. Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (SMFG) fell 5.9 percent to 920,000 yen after Japan's No.3 bank said it booked a loss of "billions of yen" in the April-June quarter through its sale of 350 billion yen worth of mortgage-backed securities. Although both banks said the impact on their earnings was limited, investors cooled on the sector. Fujito of Mitsubishi UFJ Securities said not only subprime loans but other risk assets are seeing a plunge in their prices, fuelling concern about the financial health of portfolios of banks and other firms. A dimmer outlook for US consumer spending and the dollar's fall to a 4- month low against the yen sent auto stocks lower. Toyota Motor Corp declined 3 percent to 6,850 yen and Honda Motor Co. was down 2.7 percent at 3,920 yen. "US consumer spending has been fuelled by higher US stock prices and a buoyant housing market," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. "We have to assume that Japanese exporters will be sold." Wal-Mart's Japan retail unit Seiyu Ltd. plummeted 10.2 percent to 114 yen after it said on Wednesday it expects to post its sixth straight annual loss in 2007 on sluggish sales, but dismissed speculation that the results would prompt Wal-Mart to pull out of Japan. bd
