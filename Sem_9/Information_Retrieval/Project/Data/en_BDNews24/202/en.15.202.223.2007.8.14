 LONDON, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index fell on Tuesday, led by commodities and banks, after a softer close on Wall Street poured cold water over the previous day's hefty gains. At 0824 GMT, the FTSE 100 was down 0.6 percent at 6,182.4 points after recording its biggest one-day percentage gain in more than four years on Monday. Oil and metal stocks contributed 26 percent of Tuesday's loss. Banking stocks were also weak after Swiss sectoral bellwether UBS warned that market turmoil was likely to hit its investment banking business in the second half. HSBC fell 0.1 percent, HBOS lost 1.2 percent and Lloyds eased 0.6 percent. Royal Bank of Scotland, seeking to win a bid battle for ABN AMRO against Britain's Barclays, said its consortium had built up a 3.25 percent stake in the Dutch bank. RBS was up nearly 0.6 percent and Barclays was down 0.9 percent. The RBS consortium -- which also includes Spain's Santander and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis -- said it had bought 40.8 million ABN AMRO shares on Friday and Monday at an average price of 33.81 euros a share "Yesterday's highly positive move was a reaction to the strength on Wall Street after London closed on Friday so it was almost expected," said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown.

The latest twist in the credit saga was a $3 billion rescue package by Goldman Sachs for a hedge fund hammered by the recent market turmoil. The lack of liquidity has forced major central banks to pump cash into the banking system for four days running, with the European Central bank saying earlier it would add extra cash again this session although it said conditions are now close to normal. Miners, which are particularly sensitive to market volatility, have seen sharp swings in prices as investors remain jittery over the possible implications for growth from the U.S. subprime crisis spilling over into the credit market. After heavy losses last week, and a sharp rally on Monday -- they were back in the red, tracking lower commodity prices. Kazakhmys fell 1.9 percent and Antofagasta was off 1 percent. Morrison Supermarkets fell 2.4 percent after it said it had withdrawn sliced cold meats from two stores in Scotland after an outbreak of E.coli disease in the area that killed an elderly patient and left two seriously ill. Property stocks also struggled this session with one trader citing a Merril Lynch downgrade to the sector. Hammerson gave up 2 percent, Liberty International eased 1.4 percent, and Segro shed 1.8 perce
