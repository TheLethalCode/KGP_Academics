 KABUL, August 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Germans travelling in a diplomatic convoy were killed and one was wounded in a roadside bomb blast near the Afghan capital Kabul on Wednesday, the local police chief said. Baryali Parwani, chief of police of the Bagrami district, southeast of Kabul, said the convoy was hit by a remote-controlled roadside bomb. A white four-wheel-drive vehicle was totally destroyed by the blast, witnesses said. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was aware there had been an incident in the Kabul region and there had been Afghan civilian casualties, but was so far unaware of any foreign military casualties, a spokesman said.
