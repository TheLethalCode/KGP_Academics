 PARIS, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares fell to a five-month low on Thursday as worries over the credit market continued and a drop in oil prices dragged shares of energy companies lower. At 4:21 a.m. EDT, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index (.FTEU3: Quote, Profile, Research) was down 2 percent, at 1,461.34. Europe's benchmark index, which is down 1.4 percent on the year, has lost 10.6 percent since reaching a 6-1/2-year high on July 13, as concerns over a debacle in the U.S. subprime mortgage market and tightening credit conditions sent investors running for cover. "The problems in the subprime mortgage market will linger on for a while. Some days it was a little bit better but then negative news came to the fore, and it will go on like that for a while," said Bart Ingels, an analyst at Fortis Bank in Brussels. Among the worst hit, BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) lost 3 percent, while ING Groep (ING.AS: Quote, Profile, Research) fell 2.5 percent. Northern Rock (NRK.L: Quote, Profile, Research) fell 5.5 percent after losing more than 5 percent on Wednesday on concerns over its funding in the troubled credit market and on speculation of a new profit warning. Oil majors also slipped, with BP (BP.L: Quote, Profile, Research) down 2 percent and Total (TOTF.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) down 2.6 percent. "After the drop on Wall Street and Asian bourses, it's no surprise to see European markets under such pressure again," said Valerie Plagnol, chief strategist at CM-CIC Securities, in Paris. The fall in European shares followed a sharp retreat on Wall Street overnight, with the S&P 500 (.SPX: Quote, Profile, Research) wiping out its year's gains, after shares of Countrywide Financial (CFC.N: Quote, Profile, Research), the No. 1 US mortgage lender, tumbled on a brokerage downgrade and rumors it was having trouble raising money. "The nervousness will prevail today, at least until the US housing data comes out. Better-than-expected figures could ease the worries over the sector, but investors will remain on their guard," Plagnol said. US building permits and housing starts for July, as well as jobless claims are expected later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues on the health of the housing sector and the broad economy. The mining sector was also having a tough day, hit by a drop in base metal prices. BHP Billiton (BLT.L: Quote, Profile, Research) lost 4 percent, while Anglo American (AAL.L: Quote, Profile, Research) shed 3.7 percent and Rio Tinto (RIO.L: Quote, Profile, Research) dropped 4.2 percent. Around Europe, Germany's DAX index (.GDAXI: Quote, Profile, Research) was down 1.9 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index (.FTSE: Quote, Profile, Research) down 2 percent and France's CAC 40 (.FCHI: Quote, Profile, Research) down 2.2 percent. On the positive side, luxury group Hermes (HRMS.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) gained 3.3 percent on market talk that LVMH (LVMH.PA: Quote, Profile, Research) was planning a bid. Both LVMH and Hermes officials declined to comment.
