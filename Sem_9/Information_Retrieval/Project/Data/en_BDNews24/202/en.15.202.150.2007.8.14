 BRIDGETOWN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Left-arm fast bowler Pedro Collins has been recalled to the West Indies squad for the Twenty20 World Cup after a year in the wilderness. The 31-year-old received the news shortly after returning to Barbados from a professional contract in Newcastle, England. "I think my recall was long overdue," Collins told reporters. "I was being overlooked and I was wondering why. "I was waiting my turn to play for the West Indies again and now my turn has come. I'm delighted to be back in the team and I have a point to prove." Left-handed batsman Narsingh Deonarine, who last played two years ago in Sri Lanka, was also recalled. The team will be led Ramnaresh Sarwan, who has recovered from a shoulder injury sustained on the recent tour of England. The West Indies begin the tournament against hosts South Africa at the Wanderers on Sept. 11. The Twenty20 World Cup runs from Sept. 11 to 24. West Indies: Ramnaresh Sarwan (captain), Chris Gayle, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Devon Smith, Marlon Samuels, Runako Morton, Denesh Ramdin, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Sammy, Dwayne Smith, Ravi Rampaul, Daren Powell, Fidel Edwards, Narsingh Deonarine, Pedro Collins
