 Liton Haider bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Interpol 'red notices' for Bangabandhu murder suspects have now lapsed, an official from the Police National Central Bureau (NCB) said Monday. "Interpol red notices for the absconding convicts in the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman murder case are no longer in force," the official said. "We examined the relevant documents and found that the notices had become void in September 2006." An Interpol red notice is not an international arrest warrant, but allows the warrant by the national police to be circulated worldwide with a request that the wanted person be arrested for extradition. Bangladesh Police's NCB does not have up-to-date information about the whereabouts of the six of the 12 people, convicted of killing independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family members in 1975. Under the control of the Police Headquarters, the NCB is the responsible body for all police work involving Interpol. Inspector general of police Noor Mohammad told bdnews24.com Monday: "There is no initiative at present to bring them back to the country." "Currently Bangladesh doesn't have any extradition treaty with any country." According to recent reports, six of the 12 convicts in the Bangabandhu murder case are currently living in different countries in Asia and Europe. Of them, Abdul Aziz Pasha died in Zimbabwe in 2002. Another official with the NCB said: "We cannot specifically say where they are staying now." "When the red notices were issued there was some idea about their whereabouts." bdnews24
