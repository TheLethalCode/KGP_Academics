 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh national football team, a second string squad comprising young and experienced players, are determined to put up a good fight against the opponents in the Merdeka Cup in Malaysia. Bangladesh were drawn in Group B along with Indonesia, Singapore and Zimbabwe in the eight-nation tournament, beginning on August 19 to 29 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. "In the way the boys have practiced for last 10 days, I believe, the boys will put up a good show in Merdeka Cup," said coach Hasanuzzaman Bablu at a press conference at the Bangladesh Football House Thursday. "With my six months' experience with the national team, I can say that Bangladesh have improved a lot as the boys have grown a tendency to bounce back in the match despite going down," the former national booter said, "Except Zimbabwe, the boys will push Indonesia and Singapore hard in group matches." The coach, however, said that his striking and defence positions are not strong as much as the midfield due to lack of quality players. "This squad is by no means a weak one compared with the Nehru Cup squad," said the former defender. The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) has formed two squads for Nehru and Merdeka Cups, picking the top booters for the Nehru Cup tournament. "Though we haven't set any target, we are going there to carry out our responsibilities," said captain Hasan Al Mamun. "Our aim is to play better football and transfer the performance to the SAF Championship in December," said the defender adding that they had shortage of experienced players on their side. Compared with the Nehru Cup squad, Mamun said that his side had dominated over the Nehru Cup squad in the practice matches though the opponents dominated over them in the first two practice matches at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protishan. Merdeka Cup squad: MN Shakil and Majharul Islam Himel (goalkeepers), Hasan Al Mamun (captain), Mostafa Anwar Parvez, Amit Khan Shuvro, Arafat Ali Ronny, Mahmudul Hasan, Akram Khan and Jahirul Islam Jahir (defenders), Motiur Munna, Jumratul Islam Mithu, Arup Kumar Baddya, Mamunul Islam Mamun, Enamul Haq Sharif and Ronny Islam (midfielders), Saifur Rahman Moni (vice captain), Mohammad Ronny and GM Mamun (strikers). Officials  Asaduzzaman Khasru (team leader), Amirul Islam Babu (manager), Hasanuzzaman Bablu (chief coach), Ujjal Chakrabarti Shibu (asst coach) and M Monirul Amin Shammi (doctor).
