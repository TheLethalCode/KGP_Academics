<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Romania, who named their Rugby World Cup squad on Tuesday, will be looking to win two matches for the first time in their six appearances in the tournament. Romania, who have never progressed past the pool stage, face favourites New Zealand, Scotland, Italy and Portugal in Pool C of the tournament starting on Sept. 7. "It's the moment when Romania have to dare more and try to take third place in Pool C after getting two wins," Romanian Rugby Federation (FRR) president George Straton told reporters. Only the top two teams in each of the four pools qualify for the quarter-finals. Team manager Robert Antonin included 17 players from the French leagues, almost all of them backs, in the squad of 30. "The World Cup is a long, tough competition, so we picked the strongest players, able to accomplish more tasks in different places," Antonin told reporters. "Ionut Tofan can play both flyhalf and centre, so he will be a joker in the team," Antonin said. "Our group is stronger than in the three previous World Cups," said centre Romeo Gontineac, a veteran of 71 caps and 17 tries and playing his fourth tournament. "Our team has skilful athletes, reared on Romania's traditional strength." Lock Sorin Socol of French club Pau will captain the team, who leave Bucharest next Monday to finalise their preparations in France. Backs: Lucian Sirbu, Valentin Calafeteanu, Ionut Dimofte, Danut Dumbrava, Ioan Teodorescu, Catalin Fercu, Catalin Marius Niculae, Gabriel Brezoianu, Romeo Gontineac, Csaba Gal Minya, Ionut Tofan, Dan Vlad, Iulian Dumitras, Adrian Florian Vlaicu. Forwards: Petru Balan, Cezar Popescu, Petrisor Toderasc, Florin Balan, Silviu Florea, Marius Tincu, Razvan Mavrodin, Sorin Socol (captain), Cristian Petre, Augustin Petrichei, Valentin Ursache, Florin Corodeanu, Ovidiu Tonita, Alexandru Manta, Marian Tudori, Aurel Rat
