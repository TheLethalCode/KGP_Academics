<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court resumed hearing a petition on Thursday by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif who is seeking to return home after seven years in exile since he was ousted in a military coup. Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, another former prime minister in exile, are both hoping to come home and take part in elections that beleaguered military ruler Pervez Musharraf has promised will be free and fair. President Musharraf overthrew Sharif in 1999 and he was sentenced to life in prison on various charges. Sharif and his family later went to Saudi Arabia after the government says he agreed to 10 years of exile. But Sharif denies any such deal and has filed a petition in the top court seeking to clear the way for the return of himself and his family. The government's top lawyer told the court, headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Sharif had agreed to a deal and documents spelling out its terms would be presented at the next hearing on Aug. 23. "We want to bring before the court an understanding which would show under what circumstances the petitioner and his family went abroad," Attorney General Malik Abdul Qayyum told reporters after the hearing. In an indication of the importance of the case, a two-member bench of the court that presided over the opening of the case last week was expanded to include five judges. Sharif still faces corruption charges in Pakistan, as does Bhutto, who left the country nearly a decade ago but also vowed to return soon. Musharraf has held power-sharing talks with Bhutto but nevertheless said last week he wanted both Sharif and Bhutto to stay out of the country in the run-up to the elections. The New York Times, citing U.S. and Afghan officials, said in its editions on Thursday that Washington was quietly pushing Musharraf to share power with Bhutto. An alliance with Bhutto offered Musharraf the best chance of defusing the political crisis while remaining president, the newspaper said. In coming weeks Musharraf is expected to seek re-election by the national and provincial assemblies before they are dissolved to pave the way for a general election. The elections come as Musharraf is facing a series of problems that have raised questions about his grip on power. As well as strained ties with the United States over complaints Pakistan is not doing enough to tackle militants, Musharraf faces a wave of militant attacks and public anger over his suspension of Supreme Court chief Chaudhry in March. The Supreme Court reinstated Chaudhry last month. Despite his exile -- mostly in Saudi Arabia but more recently in London -- Sharif still leads the Pakistan Muslim League (PML), one of the country's major opposition parties. His brother, Shahbaz Sharif, also a top PML leader, tried to came back to Pakistan in May 2004 but was sent back to Saudi Arabia shortly after arriving on a flight to the city of Laho
