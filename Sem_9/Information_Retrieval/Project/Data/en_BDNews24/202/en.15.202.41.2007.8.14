 BERLIN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A German court upheld a ban on Tuesday on female teachers wearing headscarves in schools in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where almost a third of the country's 3.5 million Muslims live. Seven of Germany's 16 states have banned teachers from wearing Islamic headscarves, a policy Muslim groups say discriminates against them.

The decision follows a similar ruling by a court in the southern, mainly Catholic state of Bavaria which upheld its ban in January. Some of Germany's Muslims, who are mostly Turks, complain they are subject to discrimination in education and in finding jobs, which alienates them from mainstream society. The wearing of headscarves and veils has become a hot political issue in several European states. France triggered a row by banning Muslim headscarves in state schools and some Islamic groups in Britain have accused the government of creating a climate of Islamophobia after a top politician said veils made community relations more difficult. On Wednesday, a court in the western German state of Hesse will hold a hearing on a ban on civil servants wearing headscarves at work, but a decision will take several mont
