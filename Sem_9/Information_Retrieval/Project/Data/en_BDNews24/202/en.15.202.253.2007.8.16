<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com)  The World Bank Thursday made some worrying estimates for the toll unplanned development in Dhaka may take by 2020. Khawaja Minnatullah, an environmental specialist in the WB, said: "The economic and environmental costs as a result of unplanned growth, uncoordinated activities and unabated pollution might amount to 4 percent of the GDP by the year 2020." At a workshop at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel, he said: "Dhaka, now a city of 12 million people, would turn into a place of 20 million by the year 2020 making it the third largest city in the world." According to the report Dhaka is the fastest growing mega-city in the world characterised by traffic congestion and high land prises, among other things. World Bank country director Xian Zhu added: "Greater Dhaka currently represents more than 40 percent of Bangladesh's GDP." The study advised the government to undertake urgent institutional reforms, including strengthening key planning agencies like Rajuk. The reforms they suggested would better ensure a more cohesive urban environment in future. The study also said unplanned urbanisation is increasing air and water pollution, devouring wetlands and burdening communities with unsustainable social and economic costs. Xian Zhu addressed the workshop, which was also attended by officials from the housing and public works ministry and the environment ministry. bdnews
