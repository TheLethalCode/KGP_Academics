 NEW YORK, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stocks rose on Wednesday after rebounding from a sell-off in the previous session as tame inflation and solid industrial production data kept concerns about worsening credit conditions at bay. Deere & Co. shares surged after the farm equipment maker reported earnings that topped Wall Street expectations, making it the top-weighted leader on the S&P 500. Financial shares were the biggest gaining sector on the S&P 500 after the Federal Reserve added $7 billion to the banking system. The Fed has injected liquidity on several occasions to calm nervous markets and has been urged by some to cut interest rates. "The fact that the Fed has inserted money to make sure banks can borrow from other banks .... certainly is a positive," said Al Kugel, chief investment strategist at Atlantic Trust in Chicago. "We've had these little interim days of gains, but they don't last long because investors are spooked to the point they don't have much confidence in putting fresh money in." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 22.68 points, or 0.17 percent, at 13,051.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 6.42 points, or 0.45 percent, at 1,432.96. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7.62 points, or 0.30 percent, at 2,506.74. The Dow industrials have lost nearly 1,000 points in just four weeks, briefly dipping below 13,000 near the market's opening. Shares of Thornburg Mortgage Inc. rebounded after the lender said late on Tuesday it does not plan to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Thornburg shares surged 43.9 percent to $10.95 on the NYSE. Liquidity problems caused the mortgage lender to delay its dividend and sparked a 47 percent plunge in its share price on Tuesday. Shares of Countrywide Financial Corp. were down 1.8 percent to $24.03 after Merrill Lynch downgraded the No. 1 US mortgage lender to "sell" from "buy". The S&P financial index was up 1.1 percent as shares of major investment banks gained. Shares of Bear Stearns Cos. were up 2.1 percent to $108.26 and Goldman Sachs Group stock gained 1.1 percent to $171.59 on the NYSE. Government data showed the Consumer Price Index rose slightly less than expected in July and the gain in core CPI, which excludes food and energy, matched economists' forecast. Other data showed industrial output rose in line with expectations.
