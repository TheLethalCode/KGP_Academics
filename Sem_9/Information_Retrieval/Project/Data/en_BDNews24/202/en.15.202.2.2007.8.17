However, India openers Robin Uthappa (55) and Gautam Gambhir (85 not out) put on an untroubled century for the first wicket in 20 overs, making the revised Duckworth-Lewis target of 209 in 46 overs look something of a breeze. The winning boundary was struck in the 40th over by captain Rahul Dravid, a local favourite from his days as Scotland's overseas player four years ago, in the 40th over. Wednesday's game was the first of 20 one-dayers that India are scheduled to play before the end of the year, including seven against England, beginning next Tuesday at Southampto
