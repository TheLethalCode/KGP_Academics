<TITLE> Beckham to be named in England squad says McClaren </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain David Beckham will be included in England's squad for next week's friendly against Germany despite being hampered by an injured left ankle for the past two months. Beckham has made only two fleeting appearances for the Los Angeles Galaxy since joining the Major League Soccer (MLS) club midway through last month. England coach Steve McClaren, who names his squad for the Wembley friendly against old rivals Germany on Friday, told reporters at FA headquarters on Wednesday: "He (Beckham) will be in the squad. "I want him to come over and play a part against Germany but it all depends on what happens this evening." Beckham, recalled by England in May after being dropped by McClaren after he took charge after last year's World Cup finals, is hoping to figure in the SuperLiga semi-final against D.C. United on Wednesday. "We'll keep in close contact with him and the medical staff at LA Galaxy," McClaren said. McClaren was in the United States last week and watched Beckham play against DC United. "It was important for me to see how he was. He got 20 minutes (on the pitch), couldn't really do much, but he got through 20 minutes," added the England coach. "I spoke to him afterwards, he was very very positive, very bright...enjoying the experience there. "He's frustrated about not being able to play but very very bouyant about playing football out there." McClaren has a host of injury problems, particularly in defence, for the Germany game and September's Euro 2008 qualifers against Israel and Russia, but has not been able to persuade Liverpool's Jamie Carragher to come out of self-imposed international retirement. Carragher, 29, said he was disillusioned with being asked to play out of position as a fullback for England. The centre back has found himself down the pecking order in the national side behind Rio Ferdinand and John Terry, with Manchester City's Micah Richards a bright future prospect in central defence. "Unfortunately he's stayed with his decision not to be involved," said McClaren. "We regret that. Jamie Carragher has been a fantastic servant to England and, as I've said before in the past, I'll never close the door in the future." Asked if Portsmouth defender Sol Campbell, who has not featured since the World Cup finals, would be recalled, the coach said: "Everybody is under consideration because of the injuries we have got. "I'm not ruling out anybody at the moment." England play Germany next Wednesday before hosting Israel (Sept. 8) and Russia (Sept. 12) in two Euro 2008 qualifiers. McClaren's team are fourth in Group E with 14 points from seven games, behind Croatia (17), Israel (17) and Russia (15)
