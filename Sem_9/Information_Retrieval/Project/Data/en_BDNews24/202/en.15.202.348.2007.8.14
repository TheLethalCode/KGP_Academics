 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court bail to Sheikh Hasina will remainat least until Thursday, as the Appellate Division has deferred the hearing of a government appeal. Also, the Appellate Division did not freeze the HC stay order on the efficacy of the Anticorruption Commission's notice on the detained former prime minister, asking her to submit a wealth statement. The Appellate Division announced a further hearing of the government appeal against the HC bail to Hasina in an extortion case brought by businessman Noor Ali. The court extended an earlier stay order on Hasina's bail until Thursday in another extortion case filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. The extension appeal was filed by attorney general Fida M Kamal. The Supreme Court asked the government to file regular appeals relating to the Hasina cases by Wednesday and set Thursday for further hearings for all. In the case filed by Azam, the court asked the attorney general why the government had failed to file a regular appeal by August 14, as had been stipulated. The court said a regular appeal would now have to be filed by Wednesday to challenge the High Court bail order in the case. In connection with Hasina's bail in the Noor Ali case and the stay order on the efficacy of the ACC notice, Fida M Kamal said the government had received copies of the High Court verdicts on Aug 7 and filed stay petitions with the Appellate Division immediately after. The Appellate Division chamber judge Sunday transferred the two appeals for a full-court hearing, he said. MINTOO CASE The Appellate Division did not reject a bail order for former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo. The government had earlier filed an appeal with the chamber judge of the Supreme Court to stay the High Court bail to Mintoo. The Appellate Division asked the government to file a regular appeal in this case too. Of the four government appeals heard Tuesday, the Supreme Court extended its stay order only in the Azam J Chowdhury case until Thursday, Hasina's counsel barrister Rafiq-ul Haque told reporters. bdnews24.
