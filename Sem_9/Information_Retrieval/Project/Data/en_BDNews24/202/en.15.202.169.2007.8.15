 Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com)  The nation is spontaneously observing the 32nd death anniversary of independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman amid a state of emergency on a limited scale. On August 15, 1975, a band of errant, misguided military officers gruesomely assassinated Sheikh Mujib, the architect of independent Bangladesh along with most of his family, close relatives and staff. The mourning day's programme started with paying tribute before his portrait enshrined at the front of the Bangabandhu Bhaban in Dhanmandi. Earlier at dawn, the Awami League hoisted the national flag and party flag at half-mast and raised black flags at the building, once Bangabandhu's home where the assassination had been perpetrated. The AL leaders led by the acting president Zillur Rahman reached the Bangabandhu Bhaban at 8:50am, 10 minutes before the scheduled start of the solemn ceremony. They placed bouquets at his portrait and observed a minute's silence. AL leaders Zohra Tajuddin, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Mukul Bose, Abdul Mannan, Sultan Mohammad Monsur Ahmed and the executive members were present there. "Today is a very disgraceful day in the history of Bangladesh. We only demand that Bangabandhu is awarded the respect he deserves," Zillur told the reporters. President Iajuddin Ahmed and chiefs of the armed forces paid tribute to Bangabandhu at his grave at Tungipara in Gopalganj in the morning. Other political parties and professional organisations also paid homage. Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Jasad-Inu), Gono Forum, Bangladesh Bar Council, Peshajibi Samannay Parishad, The Supreme Court Lawyers' Association, Muktijoddha Parishad and Bangabandhu Parishad, front organisations of AL placed wreaths at Bangabandhu's portrait. TIGHT SECURITY Security was tightened on road no 32in Dhanmondi where the Bangabandhu Bhaban and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum are. People queued up defying rains and a restriction clamped by authorities allowing no more than 20 persons in a group to file through the entrance to the portrait. Barbed-wire barricades were placed at the two sides of the road that was closed to motor traffic. Scores of police and RAB guarded the road. A metal-detection archway was placed in front of barricade on the east side of the road through which people entered. People were not allowed to wait in front of Bangabandhu Memorial Museum once they paid homage. Staffs of the museum worked as volunteers. No party or organisation carried any banner due to emergency. The famous 7th March speech of Bangabandhu could not be heard like previous years as loud speakers were not allowed. JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu said, "Those who assassinated Bangabandhu are enemies of the country. Their trial is yet to be complete. We hope the caretaker government will finish the trial to ensure the rule of law in the country." The Awami League leaders also went to Banani graveyard to pay their tribute to the others assassinated on August 15. Zillur, Zohra Tajuddin, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Motia Chowdhury, Mukul Bose, Sultan Mohammad Monsur Ahmed, Nazma Rahman, Sahara Khatun, Dipu Moni, Rahmat Ali and some 50 other central leaders offered prayers at the graveyard. A prayer was held at 8:15am at the graveyard mosque. "We have not had the trial of the murder of the man without whom the independent Bangladesh was not possible. We hoped the government will finish the trial," Razzak later told journalists. "But there are signs that make us worry whether we will see the end of the trial. We wanted to observe the programmes of the solemn day in an open environment. But it was not possible." "The government should lift emergency and make arrangements for the elections. It is necessary to resume parlour politics for a fair election," Razzak, a member of the party's policymaking presidium, said. Another presidium member, Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, said, "We want trial in the Bangabandhu and four national leaders murder cases. We thought the present government will do the job. But no signs are there." "We are not being allowed to observe the programmes of the mourning day. The police engulfed the surroundings in such a way that leaders and activists could not enter the graveyard. Do we not have the right to mourn?" Sajeda asked.. Some 500 policemen threw a blanket of security in Banani, barricading the two sides of the road fronting the graveyard and allowed people to enter through one side. They searched the mourners before letting them in the graveyard and did not allow AL leaders and workers to stay there for long. Senior officers asked the AL leaders to leave the area concluding the prayers bdnews24.com/ans
