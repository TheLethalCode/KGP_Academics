<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi, coordinator of the fledgling Progressive Democratic Party, Tuesday brushed aside news published in the media on his relief work with a motorcycle rally in Manikganj Sunday saying it was false and exaggerated. "I don't believe in politics of motorcycle rallies. Let aside relief work, I don't support it even in normal political programmes. The politics of PDB in future will prove it," Quarishi said. He was speaking at a press briefing in the Dainik Deshbangla office at Segun Bagicha Tuesday. He said: "The trifling incident of Manikganj was published in a distorted way which was against the ethics of journalism." He sought the cooperation of the news media. On the Manikganj incident Quarishi said: "After distributing relief at two spots in Manikganj, when I reached Aricha Ghat, I found 20/25 motorcycles waiting for me." "I was annoyed. After exchanging greetings with the motorcycle riders, we bypassed them and went away. No procession was held there nor was anyone carrying banners. While distributing relief, some workers tried to chant slogans, but they were stopped," he said. Quarishi, referring to Awami League presidium member Motia Chowdhury's reference to him as "Seven-day-old Rahim Badsha" said: "I have no objection to being Rahim Badsha if my dear leader is ready to become Roopban." He lauded what he termed the government success in relief distribution. He also demanded formulation of a coordinated plan to face the post-flood scenario. The PDB coordinator said: "Leaders from BNP, Awami League and Jatiya Party have joined our party. So far, the culture of those party supporters was to welcome their leaders with motor rallies and arches. We want to change the culture. We want to reduce the cost of politics." He complained that some stalwarts of the collapsed politics of the past had become desperate at the launch of his party. They were continuing propaganda, he alleged. bdnew
