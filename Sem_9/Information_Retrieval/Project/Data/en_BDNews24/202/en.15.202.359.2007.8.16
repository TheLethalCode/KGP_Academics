"Through this game the child can build an idea of some of ... the most prominent battles and the idea that this enemy can be defeated," Daher said.

The 3-D game forces players to think and use their resources wisely, reflecting the way Hezbollah fights, Daher said. "The features which are the secret of resistance's victory in the south, have moved to this game so that the child can understand that fighting the enemy does not only require the gun.
