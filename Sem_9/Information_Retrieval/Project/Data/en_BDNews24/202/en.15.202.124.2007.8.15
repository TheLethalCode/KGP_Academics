 TEHRAN, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Belgian woman kidnapped by bandits in southeastern Iran has been freed, a Belgian foreign ministry spokesman and an Iranian commander said on Wednesday. The Belgian woman and her male companion were kidnapped on Sunday by a group led by a man named Ismael Shahbakhsh, who demanded that his jailed brother be freed in return for their release, Iranian officials said.
