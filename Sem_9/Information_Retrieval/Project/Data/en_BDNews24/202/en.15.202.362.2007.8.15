<TITLE> Henin getting thrills on court, not jumping out of planes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TORONTO, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Justine Henin says she is getting enough thrills on the court this season that there has been no need to jump out of planes to get her adrenalin fix. Back in action for the first time since a semi-final loss to Marion Bartoli at Wimbledon, Henin's appearance at the Toronto Cup this week signals the start of her build-up to the U.S. Open, leaving the Belgian little time to pursue her hobby - skydiving. "I didn't do skydiving for almost a year," the six-time Grand Slam winner told reporters. "I've been busy, I didn't really have a lot of time for me but I love it and I will do it again in the future. "I get my adrenaline on the court the last few months and didn't need it in the air at 12,000 feet." While a return to the courts following a month long layoff hardly qualifies as a leap into the unknown, the Toronto event should provide Henin with some excitement as she tests a nagging wrist injury. FIRST TEST Following her Wimbledon defeat, the 25-year-old took time off to lick her wounds and rest her wrist which she said is now close to 100 percent. Henin will give her wrist its first test on Wednesday against Slovenian qualifier Andreja Klepac, who earned a second-round date with the French Open champion with a 6-3 6-1 win over American Meilen Tu. "Wimbledon seems far off for me now but it is true I have the feeling of the need for a little bit of revenge," said Henin, winner of five titles this season. "My first round is always important, it's the beginning of the tournament especially after a long break of four weeks. "My goal is to try to stay number one player in the world and what is going to help me do that is to win matches. My first opponent here in Toronto is my next goal. "I've proved many times in the past I can play very well on the hardcourt. I won the U.S. Open four years ago so I can play well on this surface.
