 Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com)  A special court Wednesday sentenced former BNP minister Shahjahan Siraj's daughter-in-law to six years in jail for dodging tax and concealing information about tax. The court also fined Farzana Khan Tk 60,000 or she has to serve out nine more months in jail in failure to pay the sum. Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of the Special Judge's Court handed down the verdict in her absence. Senior special judge Mohammad Azizul Haq of the Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court for Dhaka issued an arrest warrant on July 12 against Farzana, wife of Rajib Siraj, before the case was transferred to the Special Judge's Court. Syed Zakir Hossain, deputy tax commissioner of the National Board of Revenue, filed the case. In his complaint, Zakir alleged that Farzana had evaded Tk 80.45 lakh in income tax for fiscal years 2004-2007. Farzana, managing director of Garden Fresh Preservations in Savar, turned in a flawed statement to the income tax department on her income and spending. Nor did she show her income tax returns, according to case details. She also suppressed details about her real income of Tk 2.78 crore, the complainant alleged in the case. bdnew
