<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  The number of people suffering from acute diarrhoea has almost doubled in some areas of the country in the last 24 hours, according to a tally by the Health Directorate. Cases of diarrhoea have shot up as the floodwaters have receded in certain areas. The number of cases reported in Monday's daily count was 2,331 for Dhaka alone, a significant rise from Sunday's daily figure of 1,692. The official nationwide tally until Monday is now estimated to exceed 50,000, although almost all are recovering. According to health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman, the number of deaths from this single cause stood at 11. However, the health directorate said the total was seven. With official figures remaining contradictory, doctors fear the real number may be much more worrying when the number of patients in private hospitals and clinics are taken into account. To reduce pressure on the ICDDR,B patients have been transferred to the Combined Military Hospital. Dr Shahadat Hossain, an expert in cholera from ICDDR,B, told bdnews24.com: "If need be, more patients suffering from diarrhoea may be removed to the CMH." "General Moeen U Ahmed (army chief) has suggested the establishment of a temporary medical centre at the Uttara hajj camp. The army and the ICDDR,B will jointly operate it." Dr Shahadat said: "With pressure on the institution remaining high all staff leave has been cancelled and patients are being treated round-the-clock." "About 60 percent of patients are able to return home within 24 hours of their admission to the hospital." "Along with diarrhea, problems related to pneumonia and malnutrition are visible among the patients, especially the young," he said. Matiur Rahman said: "The situation can still be handled, even if the number of diarrhoea patients increases further." "Specialised units have been set up in all districts, upazilas and medical college hospitals across the country," he said. Corrected bdnews24
