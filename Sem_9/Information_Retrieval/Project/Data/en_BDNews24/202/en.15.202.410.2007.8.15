 MIAMI, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical Storm Erin formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday, causing concern in energy markets, as Tropical Storm Dean intensified in the open Atlantic as it headed toward the Caribbean islands, forecasters said. The US Gulf Coast, where a large part of US oil and gas production takes place, was put under a tropical storm warning from Freeport, Texas southward, alerting residents to expect storm conditions within 24 hours. Energy markets have been on edge since the devastating Atlantic hurricane seasons of 2004 and 2005, when a series of powerful hurricanes, including Ivan, Katrina and Rita, ravaged the Gulf Coast. Roughly one-third of U.S. domestic oil and gas production comes from the Gulf of Mexico. Shell said on Tuesday it was shutting a small natural gas platform off North Padre Island in Texas and had evacuated 188 nonessential workers. Erin was located about 250 miles (402 km) east of Brownsville, Texas, on Wednesday and was headed west-northwest at about 14 miles per hour (23 km per hour), the hurricane center said. Its top sustained winds had reached 40 mph (65 kph). On its current track, the storm would move ashore on the Texas coast on Thursday afternoon and it was not expected to strengthen into a hurricane before landfall. Tropical storms become hurricanes when their winds reach 74 mph (119 kph). A tropical storm watch, alerting residents to possible storm conditions within 36 hours, was in effect for the northeastern Mexico coast from Rio San Fernando northward. Tropical Storm Dean, meanwhile, was still far out in the Atlantic, days away from land, but its top winds grew to 60 mph (97 kph) and it was expected to reach hurricane strength on Thursday. At 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT) on Wednesday its center was located 1,045 miles (1,680 km) east of the Lesser Antilles, the string of Caribbean islands that stretches from Trinidad in the south to the Virgin Islands in the north. It was moving to the west at about 20 mph (32 kph), forecasters said. The hurricane center's long-range forecast had it crossing the Lesser Antilles near St. Lucia and Martinique on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane with top winds up to 95 mph (153 kph). It was then expected to become a Category 3 hurricane with winds topping 110 mph (177 kph) as it headed through the Caribbean Sea toward Jamaica early next week.
