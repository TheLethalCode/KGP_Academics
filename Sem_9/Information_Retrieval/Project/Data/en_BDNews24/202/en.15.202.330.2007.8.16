<TITLE> Hmong refugees go on hunger strike in Thailand </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NONGKHAI, Thailand, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Almost 150 Hmong refugees from Laos, including 90 children, went on hunger strike in a Thai detention centre on Thursday, saying they would rather die than be repatriated to the communist state. "Asking for a free life," said one placard written in Thai and hung on the bars of a cell at an immigration detention centre in the northeastern province of Nongkhai, near the Lao border. The refugees were seen on close circuit television shouting and shaking the bars before journalists were asked to leave. The 149 refugees "decided to starve themselves and die in prison due to the fact that they have been tortured for the last eight months without a date to be released", Laura Lo Xiong of the U.S.-based Hmong International Human Rights Watch said. "The message they sent to the world is, if the Thai and Lao governments desperately want to deport this group, they may take the dead bodies," she said in an e-mail to reporters. Thai government officials were not available for immediate comment on the refugees, who are part of an ethnic group which claims it is persecuted in Laos because many Hmong fought with the United States during the Vietnam War. Laos denies the charges and Lao Foreign Ministry spokesman Yong Chanhthalansy told reporters in Bangkok the two countries had agreed to repatriate 8,000 Hmongs detained at a camp in the northeastern province of Phetchabun to Laos. "They aren't refugees. They are people who have entered Thailand illegally, staying at Baan Huay Nam Khao refugee camp and waiting to be sent back," Yong said. The repatriations would start in mid-September when the Hmong would be sent to a new camp near Vientiane, the Lao capital, Yong said.
