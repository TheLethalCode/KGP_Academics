 Abu Saeed Khan bdnews24.com Technology Editor Dhaka, Aug 17 (bdnews24.com)  Nokia has opened a helpline in Bangladesh three days after its BL-5C model of faulty batteries was detected and 46 millions of them recalled worldwide. The world's biggest mobile phone maker issued a statement Friday asking its customers to call 01819200077 for any help about the troubled batteries in Bangladesh. Customers can visit www.nokia.com/batteryreplacement for further details, it said. "Nokia has identified that in very rare cases the Nokia-branded BL-5C batteries subject to the product advisory could potentially experience overheating initiated by a short circuit while charging, causing the battery to dislodge," the company's public relations agency Adcomm said. But the statement says nothing about the replacement procedure of the faulty batteries. Earlier, Nokia's spokesperson Shabnam Haque told bdnews24.com that the customers having BL-5C batteries would receive full replacement free of cost. She said the "Nokia Care Centres" in the country would open helplines for such customers to report the faulty batteries and the company would courier the replacements immediately. Nokia however is yet to make any public announcement about the crisis in Bangladesh. How many millions of its customers have been affected in the country also remains unclear. Nokia has identified 52 different models of its mobile phones that use "BL-5C" batteries.
