 HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asia's central banks took further steps on Wednesday to smooth trade in the region's currency and short-term interest rate markets, as credit fears slammed stocks and sent the yen to a 4-1/2-month high. The Bank of Japan aggressively drained funds from the banking system for the second straight session as call rates climbed back towards the BOJ's policy target after falling near zero the previous session. On the other end of the spectrum, central banks in Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines were suspected of intervening once again, selling dollars to slow the declines in their currencies. "The overnight money market has normalised a little and the fact that the BOJ is prepared to drain cash seems to suggest that the market has steadied," said David Cohen, economist at Action Economics. "Central banks seem to be implicitly assuming that as long as the credit turmoil doesn't spiral out of control and doesn't interrupt the availability of real sector financing, there is enough momentum in the global economy." Traders said Bank Indonesia had sold an estimated $800 million to $900 million to stop the rupiah from falling beyond 9,400 per dollar. "The central banks are probably able to slow down the speed of either appreciation or depreciation, but it's difficult for them to reverse the trend," said Thomas Harr, currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. "Normally, they have been in a situation where they try to slow down the speed of appreciation. Now it's the other way round." The Malaysian ringgit fell to a five-month low and the Philippine peso to its lowest in more than a month. Asia Pacific central banks last Friday joined a global campaign by monetary authorities to calm panicky credit markets by pouring liquidity into banking systems. Concerns about the credit market flared up overnight after Sentinel Management Group Inc, which oversees about $1.6 billion in assets, sought to prevent clients from withdrawing their cash to avoid having to liquidate investments at a discount. A Canadian rating agency also warned of possible defaults in the C$116 billion ($109 billion) market for asset-backed commercial paper, with one issuer saying it couldn't repay some short-term debt. Australian hedge fund Basis Capital also said on Wednesday that losses at one of its funds may exceed 80 percent because of further credit deterioration. Basis Capital was believed to have had around US$1 billion under management before the blow-up in credit markets. Heightened worries in the credit markets drove the yen to a 4-1/2-month high against the dollar, as investors slashed their exposure to riskier carry trade positions. The low-yielding Japanese currency has been widely used by speculators as a cheap source of funds to buy higher-yielding currencies. Sterling the euro and the Australian and New Zealand dollars all fell to their weakest points in roughly four months against the yen. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet tried to calm investors on Tuesday with a statement that money markets were returning to normal, as central banks worldwide slowly withdrew cash. Japan's central bank joined the global trend, draining a total of 2.0 trillion yen ($17 billion) through two bill-selling operations to start this session and expire on Thursday, following a 1.6 trillion yen absorption on Tuesday. Still, the region's equity markets reacted poorly to the ongoing uncertainty in credit markets, with Japan's Nikkei hitting a 2007 low and other Asian stock markets down as much as 6 percent on Wednesday. European shares slide in early trade, tracking declines in Asia and the United States, as the rising number of financial institutions revealing credit-related problems hit bank stoc
