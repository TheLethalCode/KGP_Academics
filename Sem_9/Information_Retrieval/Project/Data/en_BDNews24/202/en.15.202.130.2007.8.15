 MOGADISHU, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A remote-controlled landmine blew up a government vehicle in the Somali capital on Wednesday, killing at least five police officers and wounding three others, witnesses and a police source said. The blast near a hospital in north Mogadishu -- a stronghold of Islamists waging war against the Ethiopian-backed interim government -- destroyed an armoured vehicle, known locally as a "technical", as it transported officers on duty.

The latest attack on the police officers came a day after heavy fighting between Ethiopian troops and insurgents in Mogadishu killed at least 31 Somalis and wounded 60, according to a local human rights group. In separate attack on Wednesday, an unknown assailant lobbed a grenade at soldiers in a town 30 km (20 miles) west of Mogadishu, killing at least two people and wounding 16, a witness said. "Two grenades were thrown at local council soldiers patrolling the livestock market. One soldier died and a civilian. They wounded 16 civilians," shopkeeper Said Nur told Reuters.
