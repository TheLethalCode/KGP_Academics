 BAGHDAD, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two car bombs struck a crowded market in a Kurdish area in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk on Wednesday, killing five people and wounding 30, police said. The city has been the scene of power struggles between Sunni Arab residents and Kurds. The attack followed a massive multiple truck bomb in another area of northern Iraq, which authorities said killed more than 200 people, making it one of the deadliest attacks in the four years since the fall of Saddam Hussein.
