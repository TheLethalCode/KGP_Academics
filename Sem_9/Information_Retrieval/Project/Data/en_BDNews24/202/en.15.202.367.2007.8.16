<TITLE> France's Sarkozy urges G7 vigilance on markets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy has written to German Chancellor Angela Merkel saying authorities must be vigilant over financial market volatility and urging the G7 to consider steps to improve transparency. In the letter to Merkel, current president of the Group of Eight industrial nations, which includes the G7, Sarkozy said governments must draw conclusions from recent market turmoil, although he did not expect the real economy to be affected. He said G7 finance ministers, central bankers and the International Monetary Fund should discuss ways of improving financial market transparency without impeding growth, including regulatory solutions, when they meet in Washington in October. "It is essential that we keep an eye on the transparency of the functioning of markets and their capacity to finance the world economy in an efficient and stable way," Sarkozy wrote. Dated Aug. 15, and written from Sarkozy's lakeside holiday residence in the U.S. town of Wolfeboro, the letter was released on Thursday. Responding to the letter, a German government spokesman said: "The Chancellor made clear in Heiligendamm (at the G8 summit) that the discussion about greater transparency on the international financial markets must be continued". Sarkozy, usually a vocal critic of the European Central Bank, praised monetary authorities for injecting liquidity into the markets in a timely manner to calm investors' nerves. Equities markets worldwide have made losses in the past month as concerns over the US subprime mortgage market and tightening credit conditions sent investors running for cover. European shares tumbled on Thursday, as worries over credit markets continued to weigh. Europe's benchmark index, the FTSEurofirst 300 has lost 10.6 percent since reaching a 6-1/2-year high on July 13. Sarkozy wrote that increasing securitisation of assets had helped economic development. "But they have, at the same time, transferred bank risks onto a large number of economic players," he said. "Everyone realises that the final holder (of the risk) is very badly identified today, and that this lack of knowledge is in itself a cause of instability." French bank BNP Paribas shocked markets last week when it froze three funds that had invested in US subprime mortgages. Risk aversion in financial markets is at its most intense since the Sept. 11 attacks, according to some measures. European firms are still reporting healthy profits, however, and asset prices are mainly positive this year. Sarkozy said he did not believe recent market volatility would have a lasting impact on "robust" economic growth, and warned that governments must be wary of overreacting. "Naturally, the suggestions for change that I have outlined should not lead to the introduction of measures that would restrict the financing of our economies and hold back world growth," he wrote. The French president also said questions should be asked about the role of credit ratings agencies in identifying risk. "We have to ask ourselves about the exact role that ratings agencies have played regarding this category of risk," he said. A senior European Commission source said on Thursday that the Commission will review a voluntary code used by credit rating agencies as they appeared too slow in warning about problems in the US subprime mortgage sector.
