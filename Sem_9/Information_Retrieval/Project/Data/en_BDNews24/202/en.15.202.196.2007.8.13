 MADRID, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five people were killed on Monday when a coach careered off a motorway in southern Spain and crashed, trapping others in the wreckage, Spain's civil guard said. The bus appeared to have lost control during a series of bends in the road in the province of Jaen, Civil Guard Lieutenant Emilio Garcia told Spanish state radio. "We have to tell you that in principle there are five dead, with an unknown number of injured," he said. Around 50 passengers were on board, travelling from Madrid to Jerez.
