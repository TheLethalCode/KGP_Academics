<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The Supreme Court Thursday extended a stay order on the High Court bail to Awami League president Sheikh Hasina until August 26 in the extortion case, filed by businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury. The same court adjourned the government's twin appeals against another bail to Hasina in the case filed by businessman Noor Ali and the stay order on ACC notice until August 26 as well. The Anticorruption Commission had served a notice on the former prime minister, now detained in a special jail on the Jatiya Sangsad complex, asking for her wealth statement. The hearing on the government's appeal against the High Court bail to former FBCCI president Abdul Awal Mintoo would also be held on Aug 26. The six-member full bench of the Appellate Division, led by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, heard the appeals, which the government filed Wednesday. Attorney general Fida M Kamal told the court that the state of emergency had been enforced and the Anticorruption Commission and the law-enforcement agencies were actively fighting corruption. "In such a situation, the High Court needed to be cautious in granting an interim order." He said the emergency powers rules clearly stipulated that no-one could be granted bail or could even appeal for bail in the case of investigation, trial and appeal. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq argued that the High Court had the right to give an interim order in the extortion case and cited the 10 guidelines on the duty of the High Court. "The attorney general's statement on High Court's interim order was against the 10 principles. As the emergency powers rules were criticised the government relaxed it through amendment. But if the people do not get the benefit, it goes against the spirit of the amendments. "Although the state of emergency has been proclaimed we are not in a state of war. There is no martial law in the country either. We are within the purview of the constitution. There are some fundamental rights in the constitution which cannot be suspended." The court commented, "We are hungry and there is food but we cannot eat." Barrister Huq said, "The judges have taken oath to protect the constitution. They have to protect the constitution on oath. Although I cannot eat, there is food you have to eat. It is your responsibility to see to it that people are not affected. It is the people who hold all powers." The court said, "We are in a very tough situation." Hasina's lawyer said: "The constitution is the highest law of the land. No law can be above it." Barrister Huq later told reporters after the court hearing: "The court gave a patient hearing to both sides. "I took time as I have to go abroad on a personal business. The court fixed August 26 for the next hearing." The attorney general told reporters, "The Appellate Division has stayed the High Court order in Azam Jahangir Chowdhury's case against Sheikh Hasina until August 26. The Appellate Division will also hear the other cases simultaneously and give verdicts." bdnews24.com
