<TITLE> Federer in no rush to hire new coach </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CINCINNATI, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer said on Tuesday that he was in no hurry to get a new coach, three months after he stopped working with Tony Roche. Australian Roche helped Federer to win six of his 11 grand slam titles, but the Swiss decided to go it alone two weeks before the French Open. Since then, he has been doing things his own way and said he had not decided what to do next, adding he was not even sure he wanted a new coach. "That's what I'm asking myself at the moment - what do I want?" he told reporters in Cincinnati on Tuesday. "Do I want a guy running around, picking up balls, do I want someone to give me advice, or do I want someone travelling with me 11 months of the year? "I am not sure. But I am happy on my own at the moment." Federer, who turned 26 last week, said he would not be rushed into making a decision. RIGHT GUY "It's got to be the right guy," he said. "I am not going to just try someone for a month, then get another one. "When you are number one in the world you have to make your decisions more wisely. Maybe by the Australian Open, I'll have someone but maybe not." Federer is just three grand slam titles short of Pete Sampras's record of 14 but the Swiss said should he reach that mark, he hoped to be around at the top long after that. "I'd like to be around for the 2012 Olympics in London," he said. "I'll be almost 31 by then. I think that's definitely possible. "I'm giving myself a schedule that I can play until I am 35. I am hoping to play many generations, like (Andre) Agassi. Tennis generations are five years - I played him, I am playing Nadal now and then maybe I will play the next generation." Federer begins his bid to win the Cincinnati Masters on Wednesday with a second-round match against Frenchman Julien Benneteau
