 Dhaka, Aug 13 (bdnews24.com)  Residents and workers around Gulshan Lake fear severe water pollution has caused a continued rise in fish deaths. However, the Directorate of Environment, officially charged with the lake's care, has so far not reported any problems. DoE's monitoring and evaluation officer Md Abu Sumon, told bdnews24.com: "We weren't aware of the death of fish." "We don't have enough manpower and funds to take care of the lake," he said. The lake is maintained by the Dhaka City Corporation as it did before, although the DoE was meant to take care of the lake after the site was declared an ecologically critical area. Boatmen have reported dying and dead fish floating on the lake's surface since Sunday afternoon. Locals also say some people have been seen collecting potentially rotten fish, which they suspect may be sold on to markets in the area. Gulshan Lake boatman Abdul Khaleque said: "On Sunday they found a lot of dead and dying fish floating on the lake." "Some took the fish home while others took them to the market and sold them." Shah Alam, a local guard, said: "Slum dwellers around the lake had a fishing festival Sunday while they collected the decomposing fish." A government ordinance came into being in 2001, which prohibited all practices leading to the destruction of the lake's environment. The ordinance bans bathing, clothes washing, defecation and encroachment on its defined borders. Penalties for breaking the law run as high as 10 years in jail or a Tk 10 lakh fine or both. Locals blame the problem on unfettered encroachment of the lake by structures without adequate waste disposal. Illegal as well as legal homes and business' now crowd the locality. bdnews24.
