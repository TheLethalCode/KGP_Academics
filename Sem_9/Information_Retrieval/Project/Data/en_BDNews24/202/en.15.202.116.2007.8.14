 MUMBAI Tue Aug 14, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares ended down 0.11 percent in choppy trade on Tuesday, as wary investors avoided building fresh positions ahead of a public holiday on worries about a credit squeeze in global markets. Indian financial markets are closed on Wednesday for the Independence Day holiday. The benchmark BSE 30-share index fell 16.30 points to 15,000.91, with 16 components ending down. The index is up nearly 9 percent on the year, but is 5.5 percent below a record high of 15,868.85 hit on July 24. "Investors are still uncertain about the short-term trend in the market because of high volatility. In the short-term, our market will continue to be swayed by global cues," said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities. The market has been hit by increasing risk aversion and a global equities sell-off in recent weeks on worries about the fallout from problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector. Shares in top mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd. fell 2.1 percent to 1,941.30 rupees as investors took a negative view of the mortgage sector amid the fears of a global credit squeeze, traders said. Brokerage P-Sec said Indian corporates had "virtually nil exposure" to the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, but a low risk appetite globally could see foreign funds selling their holdings in emerging markets such as India. "Any uptick in redemption pressures could see Indian bourses take a nosedive, and this risk increases with every other bank which blows up under the weight of subprime losses," P-Sec said in a research report. Data showed foreign portfolio investors sold $101 million worth of Indian stocks on Friday, taking their net selling in August to almost $600 million. NTPC Ltd. rose nearly 3 percent to 172.75 rupees after the state-run power producer said it was looking to invest in either Indonesian or Australian coal mines as early as next year. The trend was positive in the broader market with gainers outpacing losers 1,572 to 1,112 on volume of almost 341 million shares. The 50-share NSE index, or Nifty, ended down 0.08 percent at 4,370.20. Elsewhere in the region, Colombo's All-Share index fell 0.30 percent to 2,420.16. The Karachi market was closed for a national holiday. HCL Technologies rose as much as 5.2 percent during trade after the No.5 software exporter said its June quarter profit more than doubled to 4.9 billion rupees, helped by a foreign exchange gain of about 2.5 billion rupees. It ended up 0.6 percent at 319.20 rupees. Cinevistaas Ltd. ended up 4.9 percent at 69.05 rupees after it said its board would meet on August 20 to consider a 5-for-1 stock split. Omnitech InfoSolutions Ltd. listed at 183.75 rupees, 75 percent higher than its issue price of 105 rupees per share, but gave up some of its gains to close at 164.55 rupe
