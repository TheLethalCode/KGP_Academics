 LOS ANGELES, August 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The final sequel of the summer to roll into North American theaters, `Rush Hour 3' earned $49.10 million during its first weekend of release, far short of the $67.41 million bow of its 2001 predecessor, according to final numbers issued Monday. The six-year gap between installments in the buddy-cop action franchise -- as well as the fact that co-star Chris Tucker has not been seen onscreen since `Rush Hour 2' -- might have hampered the performance of New Line's latest release. Tucker co-starred with Jackie Chan in the trilogy, with all films directed by Brett Ratner. `Rush Hour 2' finished with $226.14 million domestically, while 1998's `Rush Hour' kicked off with $33.00 million and ended up with $141.15 million. `Rush Hour 3' also had to contend with competition from incumbent champ, `The Bourne Ultimatum'. Universal Pictures' amped-up spy tale took in an additional $32.88 million, raising its domestic total to $131.55 million. The weekend's other new arrivals came up short. Paramount Pictures' fantasy `Stardust', with a lustrous cast that includes Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, didn't spread much enchantment. It opened at No 4 with $9.17 million. Sony Pictures' `Daddy Day Camp' might have been better-suited for a direct-to-video release, as was originally envisaged. A sequel to the 2003 Eddie Murphy hit `Daddy Day Care', the new film -- with Cuba Gooding Jr in the lead role -- debuted at No 10 with $3.40 million. Nevertheless, the overall box office improved compared with the same weekend a year ago, when Sony's `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' topped the list in its second weekend with a take of $22.1 million. The 102 films tracked during the latest weekend by The Hollywood Reported grossed $154.4 million, up more than 19% from the comparable frame in 2006. Meanwhile, 20th Century Fox's `The Simpsons Movie', in third place overall, picked up $11.27 million, bringing its domestic tally to $152.38 million. Showing real staying power, New Line's musical `Hairspray' rebounded one place to No 5 with $6.40 million for a total of $92.14 million. At No 11, DreamWorks/Paramount's `Transformers' became the fourth film this year to cross the $300 million mark domestically as its weekend take of $3.24 million brought its total to $302.87 million. On the specialty film front, Miramax Films added 501 screens to its run of the period romance `Becoming Jane', which came in at No. 12. The film attracted $2.90 million in 601 theaters for a 10-day total of $4.50 mil
