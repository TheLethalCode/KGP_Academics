<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and cut its full-year earnings forecast on Tuesday, saying "economic pressures" like higher fuel prices have depleted shoppers' wallets. "It is no secret that many customers are running out of money toward the end of the month," said Lee Scott, chief executive of the world's largest retailer. The company's shares fell 5.5 percent and helped drag down the overall market. U.S. retail stocks have fallen in recent days as investors fret that turbulence in the housing market and high gasoline prices have curbed consumer spending. Those difficulties appear to be rippling across the globe, and Scott said on a recorded call that higher fuel prices, interest rates, utility costs and "more financial pressure" were hurting sales in markets like Mexico and Canada. Wal-Mart's earnings rose to $3.1 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, from $2.08 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company took a charge for selling its German stores. Earnings per share from continuing operations were 72 cents per share before a gain of 4 cents. Analysts on average were expecting 76 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose nearly 9 percent to $91.99 billion. U.S. sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, rose 1.9 percent. Same-store sales increased 1.2 percent at Wal-Mart stores and 5.9 percent at the Sam's Club warehouse division. At international stores, sales were up almost 16 percent at $21.6 billion. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said Wal-Mart expected many of the trends it saw in the second quarter to continue in the current period, but the retailer was still "feeling pretty good" about prospects for the holiday season. With more than 127 million customers visiting a US Wal-Mart store or Sam's Club location every week, the company is considered a barometer of the health of the nation's retail sector. But Wal-Mart has been struggling with slowing US sales growth and announced plans earlier this year to cut the number of US supercenters it will open. It has also returned to emphasizing its low prices after efforts last year to play down its discount roots backfired with its core low-income shoppers. For this back-to-school shopping season, which began in July, it has slashed prices on thousands of items by as much as 50 percent to boost sales at its U.S. stores. The retailer said last week that while the price cuts attracted shoppers, they also hurt margins. "While we still think Wal-Mart is taking the appropriate steps to 'right the ship,' we think the turnaround has been extended and today's unfavorable macro backdrop is creating a slippery slope for Wal-Mart to climb," wrote JP Morgan analyst Charles Grom. He downgraded the company's shares to "neutral" from "overweight." Schoewe said the back-to-school season had gone "OK," but more consumers were waiting until closer to the first day of classes to make their purchases. "We're pretty encouraged by back-to-school, but surprised by how late it's coming," he said. On the recorded call, Eduardo Castro-Wright, CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. operations, said the company still faced poor clothing sales and was cutting prices to move out merchandise. He also said strong sales of low-margin items like groceries and weak sales of higher-margin goods like clothes were hurting profit margins. In addition, Schoewe said Wal-Mart was contending with higher levels of "shrink" -- inventory that is lost employee theft, shoplifting, errors in paperwork or vendor fraud. "If you think about the macro environment, where customers are under pressure, there's generally a correlation between theft and macro economic pressure," Schoewe said. "Unfortunately, that's what we're seeing." For its third-quarter, Wal-Mart forecast earnings per share of 62 cents to 65 cents from continuing operations, while analysts on average were expecting 68 cents. For the full year, the company said it expected earnings of $3.05 to $3.13 per share from continuing operations, down from an earlier view of $3.15 to $3.23. Analysts were expecting $3.16. Schoewe said the company had some "very aggressive marketing and sales plans" for the fourth quarter to help spur holiday sales. Separately, Wal-Mart's Japanese retail unit, Seiyu Ltd., said it now expected to post its sixth straight annual loss on sluggish sales. For more information, please click on nT131652. Wal-Mart stock was down $2.53 at $43.64 in late-morning New York Stock Exchange trading. Through Monday, the company's shares were nearly unchanged year to date, while close rival Target Corp. was up almost 11 percent and the S&P Retail Index had fallen more than 5 percent. Wal-Mart posts higher quarterly profit (Corrects second paragraph to say $2.08 billion, not $2.08) NEW YORK, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , the world's largest retailer, on Tuesday reported higher quarterly profit than a year earlier, when it took a charge for selling its German stores.
