 Dhaka, August 14 (bdnews24.com)  For 12 years, trial of the Bangabandhu murder case has been runningon and off, without a conclusion. For 12 years, the trial of the Bangabandhu murder case has been runningon and off, without a conclusion. The trial has staggered along although 32 years have gone by since independence leader Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in a military putsch. This August, six years into the delivery of the High Court verdict, the Supreme Court started hearing a "leave to appeal" petitionin plain language it means whether the highest court would allow an appeal against the High Court verdict. The case was filed 21 years after the assassination of Bangladesh's first president along with much of his family on August 15, 1975. The trial was halted with the judge falling sick for four months. The judges of a number of High Court benches felt embarrassed in hearing the appeal in the case. The trial slowed down as the proceedings at every stage, and even the charge framing, were challenged in the High Court. During the BNP-Jamaat government's tenure, the trial was stalled on a shortage of judges as well the embarrassment of judges after the "leave to appeal" petition was filed in the Supreme Court. As many as six judges of the High Court and the Supreme Court felt disinclined to hear the case. Since incumbent chief justice Md Ruhul Amin and senior judge Fazlul Karim of the Appellate Division had handed down the High Court verdict, they could not take part in the appeals court hearing. The previous government did not take any initiative to employ any ad-hoc judges to form a bench to hear the appeal. The latest makeshift government took the initiative to resolve the hearing of the petitions for 'leave to appeal' in the Bangabandhu murder case. On August 2, the chief justice formed a special bench of three Appellate Division judges to hear the "leave to appeal" petition filed by the convicts. No case was allowed to be filed immediately after the Bangabandhu assassination on August 15, 1975. Bangabandhu's personal assistant Muhitul Islam had attempted to file a case but had to retreat following a death threat. No case could be filed and no trial procedure started in 20 years as the Khondokar Moshtaque government in 1975 enacted an ordinance indemnifying the assassins from trial for the gory murder. The Awami League government led by Bangabandhu's elder daughter Sheikh Hasina repealed the indemnity ordinance on coming to power in 1996 and moved to open trial. Muhitul Islam finally filed a case on October 2, 1996 with Dhanmondi Police Station against 20 people21 years after the assassination. Police pressed charges in the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on January 15, 1997. The trial started on March 12, 1997, in the Dhaka Sessions Judge's Court, which on April 7 framed charges against the 20 accused. During trial, police arrested Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruque Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahrier Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed. On November 8, 1998 Dhaka sessions judge Golam Rasul handed down death sentences to 15 of the 20 accused. Convict Major (retd) Md Bazlul Huda brought before the court from Bangkok on a special plane on the day of the verdict. Four convicts appealed in the High Court against the trial court verdict and the court awarded a split judgement in the case on December 14, 2000. Justice Md Ruhul Amin upheld the death sentence of 10 convicts, but Justice ABM Khairul Hoque upheld the execution order of 15 convicts. On April 30, 2001 the final verdict was delivered with Justice Md Fazlul Karim upholding death sentence of 12 convicts and setting three others free. Detained Maj (retd) Bazlul Huda, Lt Col (dismissed) Syed Faruque Rahman, Lt Col (retd) Sultan Shahrier Rashid Khan and Lt Col (retd) Mohiuddin Ahmed submitted the "leave to appeal" petition to the Supreme Court the same year. Deported home from the United States on June 17, 2007, Lancer AKM Mohiuddin Ahmed, who also received the death sentence, filed a petition from the Dhaka Central Jail on June 24 against the verdict. On August 5, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the "leave to appeal" petition and an Appellate Division bench of justices Taffazal Islam, Jainal Abedin and Md Hasan Amin started hearing it on August 7. bdnews24.com/a
