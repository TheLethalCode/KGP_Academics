<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Thursday completed a partial hearing of a writ petition that challenged some provisions of the emergency powers rules. The court is expected to issue an order Monday after hearing the government side in the case. The High Court bench of Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Justice Zobayer Rahman Chowdhury held the hearing for a second day Thursday. The court also extended the stay order on the trial-court proceedings of the extortion case against the writ petitioner, Abdul Quddus Mondal, until Monday. The writ petitioner's counsel barrister Rafique-ul Huq presented a list of the provisions of the emergency powers rules which he said were against the constitution and the Emergency Powers Ordinance. On the state side, additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed said the emergency powers rules did not identify anything as crime, which was not crime earlier. "But the new rules were meant to approve only the provisions relating to the trial and bail in some cases," he said. The writ petition challenged the inclusion of the extortion case against Mondal of Natore in the emergency powers rules. The appeal raises questions about the constitutional legality of some provisions of the rules. bdnew
