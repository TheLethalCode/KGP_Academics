<TEXT>
 Dhaka, August 15 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Krishi Bank will charge an 8 percent interest rate, instead of 11 percent, on farm loans, it said in a statement Wednesday. The BKB, the biggest farm loan provider, made the disclosure to help farmers in the aftermath of floods that damaged a farm output of about Tk 600 crore on 1.10 lakh hectares. The BKB had earlier said that it would charge an 11 percent interest rate on the loans, effective from July 1. "In view of the devastation across the country from flooding, the BKB has put the interest rate rise on hold," the statement said. The BKB also raised its loan disbursement target to Tk 1,800 crore from Tk 1,500 crore to help farmers recoup the losses from flooding. The BKB move follows a government announcement earlier that targeted to disburse Tk 7,698 crore in post-flood agriculture rehabilitation loans. Loan disbursement dropped 9.31 percent to Tk 4,691.54 crore during the July-May period of fiscal 2006-07 from Tk 5,172.99 crore in the same period a year ago. The statement said the BKB alone would disburse Tk 3,550 crore of the total targeted amount of Tk 7,698 crore. bdnews24.com
