 ANKARA, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul looks set to become Turkey's president this month, after his first bid was blocked by the military and secular elite because of his Islamist past. His ruling centre-right AK Party, buoyed by a decisive win in July parliamentary polls, is confident the mild-mannered diplomat will win this time despite opposition from powerful army generals and the threat of legal challenges. Parliament holds a first round of voting on Monday. Gul is unlikely to muster the required two thirds of votes then, but is expected to win in the third round on Aug. 28 when he needs only a simple majority. The AK Party holds 341 of the 550 seats. Gul is so far the only candidate to register. "Mr Gul will be elected Turkey's 11th president and I predict he will be one of the most successful presidents in Turkish history," AK Party lawmaker Egemen Bagis told Reuters, underscoring the party's enthusiasm for Gul's candidacy. Gul and his close ally Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan say their party's July landslide win, with 47 percent of the vote, gives the foreign minister a strong popular mandate to run. But the secular establishment, which includes powerful army generals and the main opposition party, the CHP, remain implacably opposed to Gul's candidacy because of his Islamist past and the fact his wife wears the Muslim headscarf. The CHP has said it may take Gul to court over alleged financial improprieties in the 1990s in the Islamist-oriented Welfare Party to which he belonged. Gul denies any wrongdoing. The army, which ousted the Welfare-led coalition government in 1997 over its perceived Islamist bias, has made no comment on Gul's latest bid for the presidency, though it helped derail his first attempt with a stern Internet statement in April. RESPECTED STATESMAN Secularists say Gul, though internationally respected as a calm, urbane statesman, has a secret agenda to erode Turkey's separation of state and religion. He strongly denies such claims and says people should judge him by his record in office. "If elected, I will support the government's efforts towards greater democratisation and liberalisation," Gul told foreign reporters at his residence this week. Over the past five years of AK Party government, Gul has championed Turkey's European Union membership bid, securing the historic launch of entry talks in October 2005. He says he would continue to support that difficult process as president. Unlike Turkey's outgoing president, Ahmet Necdet Sezer, an austere, reclusive former judge, the affable Gul speaks English and has warm relations with many international leaders. "He has the political experience that Sezer lacked. He understands the basic problems facing Turkey both domestically and internationally," said Metin Heper, dean of the social sciences faculty at Ankara's Bilkent University. Heper said it was also important that Gul has a good working relationship with Erdogan, allowing for greater harmony between the government and the presidency. Sezer, an arch-secularist, often vetoed government laws and appointments. "But equally important is the fact that Gul is his own man, able to stand up to Erdogan if need be," Heper added. Gul has been number two in the AK Party and briefly served as prime minister after the party first swept to power in November 2002 before handing over to Erdogan. Gul says he will quit the party and be politically impartial as preside
