 Dhaka, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has recently suspended 12 municipal chairmen, as they are facing criminal cases, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Thursday. "Earlier, 19 chairmen and 11 members of Union Parishads had been removed or suspended or some of the posts had been declared vacant," he said. The chairmen and the members were running up against the allegations of financial corruption, abuse of power, torture of women, illegal migration and absence from three straight meetings. In the Union Parishads where the chairmen were removed or suspended, one among the members would take the reins, officials with the LGRD ministry said. "Necessary steps are underway to investigate all the allegations," an official said. bdnews24.c
