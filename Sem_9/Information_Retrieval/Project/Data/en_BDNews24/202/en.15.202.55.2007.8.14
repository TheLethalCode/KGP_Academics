<TITLE> Poll to test Kazakhstan on democracy </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ALMATY, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kazakhstan holds a parliamentary election on Saturday, a test of its leader's commitment to democratic reform but one that he may have already undermined by seizing the right to remain in office for life. The vast Central Asian state's economy is booming on crude oil and metals exports while its well regulated banking sector has attracted emerging market investors. But in politics, shedding Soviet practice has come much slower. President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in power since 1989, tends to win elections with between 80 and 98 percent of the vote. The last parliamentary poll awarded the opposition just one seat. There is widespread doubt that Saturday's election will allow in any genuine opponents of Nazarbayev. The vote is being held two years early, partly to embed constitutional reforms that added seats and powers to parliament but also gave Nazarbayev the right to be re-elected indefinitely and did little to move major decision-making out of his hands. "Investors understand that most decisions that affect their interests are not made in parliament," said Tanya Costello, an analyst in London for political risk consultancy Eurasia Group. Seven parties are contesting the vote but the two to watch are the runaway favourite, Nur Otan, chaired by Nazarbayev, and the All-National Social Democratic Party (ANSDP), the party of Nazarbayev's most outspoken critics. The nearly total defeat suffered by the leaders of ANDSP, then grouped in a party called Ak Zhol, in the 2004 parliamentary vote has produced an opposition campaign fluctuating between populist pledges and predictions of vote rigging. Potentially confusing voters, Ak Zhol will again be on ballots but in a form now much less critical of Nazarbayev. "In the last 16 years, concepts like the people and democracy have lost their true meaning," said Bolat Abilov, an ANSDP leader. "Enough fraudulent elections." Highlighting the nuanced reality of Kazakhstan's politics he was free to make that point in a televised debate with Nur Otan, but other parts of the recording were censored, his party says. "There's real uncertainty as to whether the opposition parties will get in at all," Costello said. A Western diplomat in Kazakhstan said he believed the ANSDP could poll 15 to 20 percent in a free vote but would not reach the 7 percent hurdle to get into parliament in official tallies. Instead Ak Zhol would gain seats as a token opposition. The opposition's principal hope may be the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, a 56-member body that deals with human rights and security and monitors elections. A cleaner bill of health on electoral conduct would weaken US and British opposition to Nazarbayev's frequently expressed desire to chair the organisation in 2009. The Western diplomat said domestic politics might take priority, noting a docile parliament would ensure Nazarbayev, 67, had room to manoeuvre if he decided to anoint a successor. Historically the opposition has failed to summon big crowds of protesters after flawed votes and, given Kazakhstan's huge and partly untapped oil wealth, foreign criticism is usually muted. "Even if there's a degree of criticism from the US it's not actually going to change the relationship," Costello said. OSCE election monitors have already noted Nur Otan's dominance of favourable media coverage ahead of the election. Bakytzhan Zhumagulov, Nur Otan's first deputy chairman, said he expected to win all seats. Asked how he would react to a negative assessment by the election monitors, he said: "As for the OSCE's opinion, I couldn't care les
