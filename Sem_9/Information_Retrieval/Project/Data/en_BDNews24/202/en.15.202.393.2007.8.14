 Dhaka, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali Tuesday visited the Jalalabad cantonment in Sylhet to see the Tigers in special training. It was the first official meeting with the cricketers for the BCB president since his takeover on July 29 following en masse resignations of members of the BCB elected committee. The president also had lunch with the cricketers. Tanjib Ahsan Saad, manager of national team, told bdnews24.com the new BCB boss was pleased to see the training sessions. Saad said the cricketers showed the board president that they were capable to adopt the army training despite their unfamiliarity with such training. The former national cricketer said Alok Kapali would resume training on Wednesday as he was cleared by the physio. "Alok has no problem according to his X-ray report, but he has been kept away from Tuesday's training as an extra caution and he will join the camp Wednesday," said Saad. Alok sustained an injury in his left toe Sunday during the training. The cricketers passed their fourth day of a six-day training under the 'special warfare wing' at the School of Infantry and Tactics in Sylhet in a bid to strengthen their mental and physical capabilities ahead of next month's Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa.
