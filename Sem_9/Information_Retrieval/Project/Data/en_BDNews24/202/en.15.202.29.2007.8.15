 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani Limited observed the 32nd death anniversary of its founder Sheikh Kamal in befitting manner Wednesday. Kamal, son of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was killed on August 15, 1975 when a band of errant and misled military officers had brutally massacred Sheikh Mujib, the architect of independent Bangladesh along with his family, close relatives and personal staff. Abahani directors, officials, former national players and members of the Abahani Samorthak Ghosthhi paid tributes offering flower wreaths before his portrait enshrined on the Abahani tent front in Dhanmondi early Wednesday. The day's programme included food distribution among the poor and the flood affected, holding a milad mahfil, Quorun recital at club tent and offering prayers for the salvation of the departed soul at his grave in Banani graveyard. "Sheikh Kamal would be happier than anybody present among us today to see Abahani progressing as he had envisaged while founding the Club back in 1972," Abahani director Haroon-ur-Rashid Wednesday told bdnews24.com in remembrance of the club's founder. He said the day was specially significant this year and the club missed its founder more acutely as it was Abahani this season who clinched all three major trophies in football, cricket and hockey for the third time in its history. The popular club had brought the football, cricket and hockey trophies home also in 1974 and 1984. Haroon, the former general secretary of the Bangladesh Football Federation, said Abahani holds record of winning almost all the introductory football tournaments or league trophies immediately after their inception, such as, the Liberation Cup, the Independence Cup, national football league and professional football league. b
