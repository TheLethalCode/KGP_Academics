<TITLE> Shuttle crew awaits word on heat shield work </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HOUSTON, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shuttle Endeavour astronauts on Thursday prepared tools to fix a small gouge in their ship's heat shield in case NASA decides the damage needs to be repaired before the shuttle's return to Earth next week. Mission managers may decide that Endeavour is safe to fly with the 3-inch-by-2-inch (7.6-by-5 cm) gash on its belly and decision on which course to take is expected later on Thursday. If a repair job is deemed necessary, two astronauts will go on a spacewalk and coat the cut with a black wash then apply a heat-resistant filler that hardens like caulk. "We've been talking to the engineers who have been analyzing this far more than we have in space and they seem to feel that the biggest danger is more to just being able to re-use Endeavour once it gets back on the ground," Endeavour astronaut Alvin Drew told Reuters in an in-flight interview. "They seem to be confident and I trust their confidence that we can get home safely even with the divot that we have in the belly," he said. The fourth and final spacewalk of Endeavour's construction mission at the International Space Station is scheduled for Saturday. The shuttle is due to leave the outpost on Monday and land at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Aug. 22. Earlier Thursday, teacher-turned-astronaut Barbara Morgan fielded an emotional televised linkup with June Scobee Rogers, the widow of the Challenger commander Dick Scobee, and schoolchildren gathered at the educational center she and other Challenger family members set up to honor the crew lost in the 1986 shuttle accident. Morgan trained as a backup for Challenger crew member Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire high school teacher who had planned to conduct lessons from space. "Barb, we've been standing by waiting for your signal from space for 21 years," Rogers told Morgan, who joined NASA's astronaut corps nine years ago so she could fly in memory of McAuliffe and spotlight education. Rogers moderated a question-and-answer session with children gathered at the Challenger Center for Space Science Education in Alexandria, Virginia. "It made me so happy to know the Challenger Center was there, that we had a chance to speak with the kids this morning, that June was there leading the charge as always," Morgan told Reuters after the event. "It's in our hearts and it's wonderful." Despite the loss the Challenger crew and the 2003 Columbia disaster, Morgan, ever the teacher, said she'd give the shuttle program high marks for its performance in the past 26 years. The remaining three ships are to be retired in 2010 after NASA finishes building the International Space Station. "I think the shuttle program is an A-plus," she said. "Once we don't have the shuttle any more I think it's going to be something that we all look back on with great nostalgia and we're really, really going to miss it."
