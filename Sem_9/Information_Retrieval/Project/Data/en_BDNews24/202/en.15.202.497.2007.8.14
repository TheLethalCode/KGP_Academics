In another statement, the military said a US soldier was killed in Baghdad during combat operation. No other details of the incidents were available. US and Iraqi forces launched on Monday an offensive across the country against al Qaeda and "Iranian-supported" Shi'ite militants in an apparent attempt to thwart an expected surge in violence.
