 Biplob Rahman bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Keraniganj, August 15 (bdnews24.com)Thousands of people displaced by floods have been waiting at the Keraniganj end of the second Buriganga Bridgefor food. The homeless flood victims crowd expectantly around 'people coming from the capital'. Men, women and children begin begging and pleading in desperation: "Fatherbrothersistergive us somethinganything to eat. Help our children please." Although homeless and destitute, the flood victims said the scarcity of food and drinking water was their most acute crisis at the moment. Alo, 45, a domestic worker since she was abandoned by her husband recently, has to provide for her six children amid the ongoing flood situation in Keraniganj. The youngest of Alo's children, only six months old, has been drinking only small quantities of low-grade flour mixed with water, instead of milk, over the past few days. Alo demanded of bdnews24.com only one thingand that was a little milk for her youngest child. Asma is a student of class one at Islamabad Primary School. She is the eldest of four, her father a rickshaw-van driver. Asma said her school was closed due to the floods. She had moori (puffed rice) for breakfast and a handful of rice and potatoes at lunch. Her father said they would have rice at night if he could manage it, but hunger was the only thing he could offer his children. The flood victims said they had been sheltering under the Buriganga bridge for two weeks. Most of those huddled there were day labourers and low income earners. Arriving from the flood-hit Aganagar, Kadamtala, Golapnagar, Shuvaddya and Nayeem Ali localities, they have received relief on only two occasions over the past fortnight, and that was organised by locals not the government. Ibrahim, a student of class ten of Jinjira pilot high school told bdnews24.com that it was the locals who also helped provide some sort of shelter. They volunteered to assist in erecting the small shanties under the bridge. One neighbouring local supplies them with daily drinking water from his own house using a plastic pipe, which is greatly appreciated, said Ibrahim. Sitting at the open-air medical team's office set up by Keraniganj upazila administration, Shahin Miah, Aganagar UP member, told said the scanty relief they have been able to muster so far was inadequate compared with the real needs there. Some doctors had volunteered their services for the flood refugees, but stocks of oral saline and essential medication was insufficient, Shahin said. The UP member told bdnews24.com that about 3,779 people of 848 families have taken shelter under the bridge. None of them could yet venture back to their homes because the floodwaters were receding so slowly.
