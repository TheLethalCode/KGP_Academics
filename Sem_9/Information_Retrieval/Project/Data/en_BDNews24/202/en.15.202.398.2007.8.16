 TEHRAN, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Belgian woman kidnapped with her partner by bandits in southeast Iran was freed on Wednesday, Belgium's Foreign Ministry said, but it was unable to confirm a report from Iranian media that her partner was also released. The Belgians were abducted on Sunday by a group led by a man named Ismael Shahbakhsh, who demanded that his jailed brother be freed in return for their release, Iranian officials had said. It was not clear if Shahbakhsh's demand was met. The woman's release was confirmed early on Wednesday by a Belgian foreign ministry spokesman.

On their blog, they said they were aware of the dangers in southeast Iran and intended to return to Belgium via Africa. "Poverty and drug dealers will be the ingredients for the coming week," they said on their blog in Dutch. Southeastern Iran is notorious for clashes between the military and well-armed drugs smugglers. Tourists visiting the region are advised not to travel at night.
