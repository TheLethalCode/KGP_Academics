<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Leaders of 14 business organisations Wednesday denounced the government's "donor-prescribed" move, which they said was meant to charge an 11 percent interest rate on farm loans, up from 8 percent. The denouncement came hours before Bangladesh Krishi Bank, the country's biggest farm loan provider, backtracked on its rate hike decision. "We don't know they (BKB) have already withdrawn the decision," Mir Nasir Hossain, president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry and one of the signatories to a statement that had criticised the lending rate rise proposal. "We welcome the new decision," Mir Nasir told bdnews24.com in his reaction Wednesday night. The BKB had earlier said that it would charge an 11 percent interest rate on the loans, effective from July 1. The statement of the 14 business chambers said the decision to increase the interest rate came at a time when devastating floods cost seven lakh farmers Tk 600 crore in damaged crops and vegetables. "It is our opinion that the impending decision by BKB and RAKUB to charge higher interest rates for farm loans reportedly under pressure from the World Bank will backfire," the statement had said. It said charging higher interest rates would increase the costs of production and fuel soaring inflation. "It may also be recalled here that Bretton Woods prescriptions for upper adjustment of gas as well as fuel prices will lead to a further increase in production costs, including major farm inputfertiliser," the statement said. Business community termed the move "unfortunate" and "self-defeating" and urged the government to withdraw it immediately. Besides Mir Nasir Hossain of the FBCCI, the statement was signed by Mahbubur Rahman, president of ICC, Bangladesh, Latifur Rahman of MCCI, Hossain Khaled of DCCI, Saifuzzaman Chowdhury of CCCI, Masih Ul Karim of FICCI, Anwar-Ul-Alam Chowdhury of BGMEA, Fazlul Hoque of BKMEA, Muhammad A Rumee Ali of Bangladesh Association of Banks, Abdul Hye Sarker of BTMA, Samson H Chowdhury of Bangladesh Association of Publicly Listed Companies, Kamran T Rahman of Jute Mills Association, Nizamuddin Ahmed of Bangladesh Insurance Association and Amjad Khan Chaudhury of Agro Processing Association. bd
