 WASHINGTON, August 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Despite President George W Bush's campaign to improve the United States' image in Latin America, very few Americans seem to know what is going on in the region, a new poll showed. A recent Zogby International poll showed that the large majority of Americans did not know the names of the presidents of Brazil and Mexico, the two biggest economies in the region.

Three of the four free trade deals waiting for approval in the US Congress are with Latin American countries -- Peru, Panama and Colombia. The Zogby poll showed that about 48 percent of Americans think the United States should have more trade agreements with Latin America while one in three were opposed.

More than half those polled said the United States should be talking to the Cuban government, which for decades has been its fiercest rival in the region, and 56 percent said the increasing influence of communist China in Latin America is a serious threat to US influence. The online poll was conducted between July 27 and 30th and has a margin of error of 1.2 percentage po
