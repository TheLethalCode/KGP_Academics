<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com)  The emergency government has yet to think about officially declaring Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the Father of the Nation, the law adviser said Wednesday. "There's been no discussion about the matter (inside the government). The proposal must come from the chief adviser. But he didn't say anything about that. Even no hints," Mainul Hosein told bdnews24.com by phone. Asked to comment on any immediate plan to declare the Bangabandhu death anniversary a national mourning day, he said: "It's more appropriate for a political government to declare the day a national mourning day. You should put the question to political leaders." Referring to the Aug 15, Mainul said the president and the chief adviser had visited the grave of Bangabandhu in Tungipara. The High Court on Aug 6 asked the government to explain why the Aug 15 would not be observed as national mourning day and why the day would not be a public holiday. The government has yet to respond although the court asked for the explanation by last Sunday. On why the government did not reply to the court by the deadline, Mainul said the attorney general was the best person to answer. Deputy attorney general Razik Al Jalil said they did not get answers from various ministries that are respondents to the case. "We'll give answers to the court after we get them from the ministries," he said. The Awami League Tuesday demanded the government announce Sheikh Mujib as the father of the nation by the end of this month. The then Awami League government in 1996 had announced Aug 15 as the national mourning day and a public holiday. The BNP-led four-party coalition government in 2002 scrapped the previous decisions. Earlier, the emergency government said it would correct the academic textbooks and include the provisions calling Sheikh Mujib as the father of the nation. Army chief general Moeen U Ahmed on March 28 at a function regretted that the nation was yet to recognise the nation's father unlike many other nations across the world. "Think about it, we haven't even given recognition to the father of the nation," Moeen told freedom fighters at a tea party referring to Bangabandhu. bdnews24.com/e
