<TITLE> Illegal immigrant to depart Chicago sanctuary </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CHICAGO, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An illegal Mexican immigrant who became a voice for families facing deportation by taking sanctuary in a Chicago church a year ago said on Wednesday she will leave her refuge to take her fight to Washington. Elvira Arellano, 32, has stayed within the cramped walls of the storefront Adalberto United Methodist Church for one year, invoking the ancient medieval protection of sanctuary. With her 8-year-old son, Saul, by her side, she said she planned on departing the safety of the church to participate in a Sept. 12 immigration march aimed at reviving proposals in the US Congress to change immigration laws. "I will go to Washington, D.C. I will go to pray and fast in front of Congress," Arellano told reporters in halting English. Legislation that failed to pass in June would have given illegal immigrants an avenue for remaining in the United States and eventually gaining citizenship. In recent months, immigration authorities have increased enforcement efforts with raids on workplaces and fines levied against employers who hired illegal immigrants. Arellano has said she acted on behalf of her son who does not want to live in Mexico, a country he has only seen in the past year when he went to Mexico City to lobby the government to come to his mother's aid. Saul is among some 4 million US-born children in 2 million immigrant families who have undocumented members and who face the prospect of being split up. Arellano entered the United States illegally in 1997, was returned to Mexico, then recrossed the border and was working a menial job at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 2002 when she was arrested in an immigration sweep. She was convicted of working under a false Social Security number and, after several delays, was ordered deported. Immigration authorities have not tried to arrest her, although the church does not provide any legal barrier to entry. In a statement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it "has the authority to arrest illegal aliens in all locales."
