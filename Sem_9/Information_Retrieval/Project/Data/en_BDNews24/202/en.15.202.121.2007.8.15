 Abu Noman Sajib bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka residents faced rain and heavy traffic jams Wednesday morning. The gridlock was created as police and security agencies made tight security arrangements and stopped vehicle movement on Dhanmondi Road No. 32, and several roads of Banani on the death anniversary of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The city's vehicles were at a standstill from Russell Square to Gabtali and Mirpur-1 of Mirpur Road, as well as Farmgate to Banani Railgate via the old Airport Road. Office goers faced trouble: they were waiting much longer than usual at many of the bus stops. Md Jasimuddin, joint commissioner (traffic) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, told bdnews24.com: "I am surprised. There are a lot of vehicles on the roads. All the roads of the capital are full of vehicles." Asked if the number of vehicles was greater than expected because of the day's programme, Jasimuddin said: "I don't know why. Generally on a Sunday morning and Thursday evening, there are a lot of vehicles on the roads. But I don't know why there are so many vehicles today (Wednesday)." The traffic police officer said: "About 2,200 traffic police and 200 Ansar members on each shift control vehicle movement at different points." "When there is a special programme, we withdraw forces from less busy points and deploy them to the more important places. Similarly additional traffic police have been guarding the major roads for the 15th August programme," he said. Liton, a student of philosophy at Jagannath University, told bdnews24.com that he had been trying to get on a bus for an hour since 10am, at Asad Gate, but had been unable to do so. The government has enforced tight security in Dhaka Wednesday to avoid any kind of disturbance. About 4,000 police officers have been deployed throughout the city, although Awami League was permitted to observe the day on a limited scale amid a state of emergency. Additional police were deployed at significant points including airport, railway stations and bus stands. bdne
