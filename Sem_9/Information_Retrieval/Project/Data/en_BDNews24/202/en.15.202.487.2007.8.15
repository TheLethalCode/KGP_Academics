 Dhaka, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com) - The head of the price monitoring committee has said he cannot understand why the prices of essentials have not come down, despite the withdrawal of duties. "I am not a fortune teller," the commerce ministry's additional secretary Golam Mostakim, who heads the committee, said in response to queries Wednesday. The official briefed reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting. "The government is making every effort to solve the problem including the withdrawal of import duty to curb the market prices," he said. "Why the market prices are not coming down is a mystery to me," he added. The official did however say some recent steps including government-run open market sales and more involvement from the BDR in the marketplace would help the situation. "We will be successful in the end," Mostakim said. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed's interim administration has so far withdrawn the duty on rice, wheat, pulses and a limited number of other essential items. In order to combat the annual rise in food prises around Ramadan the Department of Food will sell 1.14 lakh tonnes of rice in the OMS from September 9 to October 11. The government has also planned to import some essential items, including pulses and gram prior to Ramadan. It was also announced that the OMS would cover the Chittagong Hill Tracts area for the first time this year. Some 15,000 dealers will be engaged to operate the rice OMS. Each dealer will receive 510kg of rice on alternate days. "With the assistance of the Local Government Division, the BDR is establishing five wholesale and 48 retail markets in the city, to be operational in a month," Mostakim said. "Uttara and Jatrabari wholesale markets are already 70 percent complete." Another three markets will be built at Gabtoli, Kamrangir Char and Uttara Dipu Market. bd
