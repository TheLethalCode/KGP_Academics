 BAGHDAD, Aug 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraqi Kurdish and Shia leaders formed an alliance on Thursday to support Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government but failed to bring in Sunni leaders who are crucial to national reconciliation. Maliki is facing a political crisis after the main Sunni Arab bloc, the Accordance Front, pulled its six ministers out of his Shi'ite-led national unity government saying it had ignored their demands. The new alliance includes the two main Kurdish parties in the government, the powerful Shi'ite Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council (SIIC) and Maliki's Shia Dawa party. But it failed to bring in the Islamic Party, the biggest single Sunni Arab party in parliament. Talks to form an alliance began last year with the Islamic Party but broke down over its demand that it be given a greater say in security matters. The same demand triggered the withdrawal this month of the Accordance Front which comprises three parties, including the Islamic Party. But President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, and Maliki left the door open to other groups to join their alliance. "This agreement is open for everybody and for all who believe in the principles and the political process," Talabani said at a ceremony to announce the new alliance. The agreement was signed by Talabani, Maliki, the president of the Kurdish region Masoud Barzani and Shi'ite Vice President Adel Abdul-Mahdi. It was not related to a leadership summit, which is expected soon with Sunni Arab participation. "This agreement came to shake the paralysis in the political process. It is not an alternative to the blocs (in parliament)," Maliki said. The three-page agreement did not mention details of how the alliance would help the government. It did include plans to form a follow-up committee and to continue talking with Sunni Arabs. Maliki's government is made up of competing ethnic and sectarian blocs, whose infighting has paralysed decision-making and resulted in a failure to push through key issues, such as disbanding militias, which are critical for stability in Iraq. Sunni Arab officials said the alliance marked a new phase for Iraq in which parties would be divided in parliament into pro-government and opposition blocs. "A new phase has started. This encourages the other sides to look for the option of forming an opposition front," said Saleem Jubouri, a senior member in the Accordance Front. "The opposition front has not taken shape yet," he said. He said powerful Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's movement and the small but influential Shi'ite group Fadhila could join such an opposition front. Maliki's weak government had promised much but has achieved little since it was formed fifteen months ago. Twenty ministers from three political blocs have either quit or stopped attending cabinet meetings. Sadrist ministers left several months ago and Maliki has yet to replace them after parliament rejected several of his candidates.
