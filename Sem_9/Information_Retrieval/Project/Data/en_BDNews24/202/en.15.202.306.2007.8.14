 Dhaka, August 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks posted the highest gains Tuesday in the past seven and a half months, buoyed by rumours that the regulator would withdraw its suspension order on financial adjustment facilities. Hopes for approval of margin rules for merchant banks by the Securities and Exchange Commission partly contributed to the rally. "We didn't change our position. Investors should not take an investment decision based on rumours," Anwarul Kabir Bhuiyan, executive director for SEC, told bdnews24.com. The SEC on July 30 suspended the financial adjustment facility for 'A' shares to rein in a consistent surge in the prices of stocks and liquidity. The DSE on July 29 withdrew the similar facility, through which investors could have purchased another share with the proceeds of the sold one without waiting for four days, for B, G and N shares. The benchmark DGEN or general index secured the highest gains in about eight months to August 14 adding 70.81 points or 3.16 percent to 2310.58.
