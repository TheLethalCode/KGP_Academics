<TITLE> Moral revolution backfires on Polish ruling twins </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WARSAW, Aug 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's ruling Kaczynski twins appear likely to pay a heavy price in a coming snap election for striking a "deal with the devil" to pursue their dream of a moral revival in the ex-communist nation. Opinion polls suggest their Law and Justice party will lose to the pro-business Civic Platform, a conservative party with a liberal economic outlook that wants to speed up the process of joining the euro currency zone. The best scenario the brothers might hope for is that their party will play a junior role in a cabinet led by their rivals. The alternative is being left in opposition. "We are reconciled to the idea that we will lose power in the election," a senior Law and Justice politician told Reuters. "The Platform will have more flexibility with whom to partner." The tough-talking Kaczynskis won unprecedented power in the European Union newcomer in 2005 elections, promising Poles a "Fourth Republic" -- a just society, free of corruption and oligarchic networks they accused of controlling the country. But instead of forming a coalition with the Civic Platform as promised, they stunned ordinary Poles and Western partners by forming a government with radical, anti-EU parties. After two years of infighting within a government that had taken on a strong populist tone, their coalition with the rural leftist Self-Defence and far-right League of Polish Families collapsed in irreparable acrimony this week. LITTLE OPTION Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski and his look-alike brother Lech, the president, had little option but to agree to opposition demands for a snap vote, most likely in October. Analysts say that despite the fastest economic growth in a decade, the Kaczynskis face a tough battle as their ex-partners had undermined the touted moral revolution. They are accused of sex scandals, patronage and incompetence while in government. "The alliance with populists robbed Kaczynski...of the aura of uncompromising honesty," Robert Krasowski, editor in chief of right-wing daily Dziennik, sympathetic to the brothers, said in an editorial on Tuesday. "An alliance with people of crummy reputation, as (Jaroslaw) Kaczynski himself once described them, has attached a stigma of the grotesque to the moral revolution slogan," he wrote. The election could also end the efforts of the Kaczynskis to purge Poland's elite of those they accuse of having benefited from the post-communist transformation. Among those targeted, in what critics call a witch-hunt for those who do not share the twins' vision, have been top judges and members of the business and professional elites. Such approach means the Kaczynskis have burned most bridges to the Civic Platform, the only remaining potential partner in parliament. Many analysts expect the Platform to form a government with mainstream leftists and centrists rather than Law and Justice despite their shared roots in the Solidarity movement that helped bring down communism. Although the president does not face re-election until 2010 and could in theory veto all legislation from an unfriendly administration, to do so would endanger the future electoral prospects of the Kaczynskis. The sidelining of the twins would be a relief for many EU leaders. Despite massive support for the bloc among Poles, the Kaczynskis have isolated Poland after clashing over historical grievances, gay rights and the new EU treaty. Their ideological battles with domestic opponents and internal squabbles with the coalition partners have also sapped government energy and distracted it from reforms needed to keep the nation of 38 million on track to catch up with the West. Despite EU funds being available, motorway construction has made no headway while preparations to host the Euro 2012 soccer championship have made such a slow start that some Poles joke Poland should auction the right to stage the contest. Even the fight against corruption has been mired in controversy and could backfire in the autumn poll. Several highly publicised arrests were reversed by courts on the grounds that prosecutors were producing inadequate eviden
