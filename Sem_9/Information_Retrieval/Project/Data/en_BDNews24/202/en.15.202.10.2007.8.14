 PATNA, India, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Angry flood victims looted food from relief camps, assaulted officials and held them hostage in eastern India on Tuesday, as fresh rains brought more misery to tens of thousands of people in South Asia. The death toll in eastern India rose to 83 and thousands more were marooned as rains lashed the region. Authorities across South Asia, where nearly 800 people have drowned in the past month, or died from snakebites, hunger or water-borne infections, said they were struggling to keep diseases at bay. In the impoverished Indian state of Bihar, hundreds of villagers clashed with police demanding more food in over a dozen places, officials and witnesses said. Incidents of flood victims looting food and taking officials hostage until victims were given food and other supplies, were also reported. "The fear of losing whatever little food we have has even robbed us of our sleep," villager Ram Uday Singh said at a relief camp in Bihar's Begusarai district.

At least five people were swept away by surging rivers and hundreds of houses collapsed in overnight storms. "We have not eaten anything for the last two days as the market is under water and our homes are gone," said R K Sahoo, a villager in Bhadrak district. In the northern Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, five more people were killed since late on Monday as the death toll caused by landslides and flash floods rose to 31. Officials in neighbouring Bangladesh, which has also been hit by bad weather and rising rivers, said 38 new deaths were reported overnight, taking the toll in the flooding to 443. "The number of diarrhoea patients in some flood-affected areas have almost doubled in 24 hours," a doctor said. So far, more than 50,000 people have been treated for diarrhoea and dysentery in the flooded districts, of which 18 have died, health officials sa
