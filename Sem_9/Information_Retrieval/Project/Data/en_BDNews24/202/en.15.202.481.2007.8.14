 Rajshahi, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Tuesday reaffirmed his faith in the Election Commission that it would hold free and credible general elections by 2008. The military-backed makeshift government head said the work of preparing a voter list with photographs would be complete by October 2008. Fakhruddin said there was a clear-cut roadmap to national elections by December 2008, which left no scope of doubt about holding of parliamentary election by the pronounced timeframe. He made the remarks at the inauguration of the work on preparation of a final voter list with photographs in areas under the Rajshahi City Corporation. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, divisional commissioner Shafiqul Alam and deputy commissioner Khalilur Rahman were present at the function at Rajshahi Medical College auditorium. "Since taking over power we have been giving highest importance to the reforms and reconstruction of the relevant institutions for the interest of development of democracy. "As part of the process the Election Commission was reconstituted with persons acceptable to all. The administrative independence of the Commission is being ensured," the chief adviser said. President Iajuddin Ahmed Thursday approved the Voter List Ordinance 2007, removing the legal bar to preparing the voter list with photographs. Election officials Saturday started taking photographs and thumb impressions of eligible citizens at designated centres in Rajshahi City. The officials had earlier made door-to-door visits to distribute voter-listing forms. The voters are being given national ID at the same time, with which they would be able to access 22 types of service facilities. bdnews24.com
