 TEHRAN, Aug 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran signalled on Tuesday it would not give in to the demands of kidnappers holding a Belgian couple and it had tightened border controls to prevent them from being taken out of the country, Iranian media reported. The couple went missing in southeastern Iran at the weekend and an official was quoted on Monday as saying they had been abducted by a bandit group led by Ismael Shahbakhsh which demanded that his brother be freed in return for their release. Southeastern Iran is notorious for clashes between the military and well-armed drugs smugglers. "The kidnapper's motive is to put pressure for the release of his brother from prison," Iranian police chief Ismail Ahmadi-Moghaddam said, according to Fars News Agency. "In the past these people have experienced that no one in the history of Iran can escape justice by using pressure and such actions will only taint his record more," he said. Iranian news reports said the married couple were tourists travelling by car in an area between the city of Bam and Iran's border with Afghanistan and Pakistan and had been taken to an undisclosed location. Tourists visiting the region are advised not to travel at night. In the past, European and other tourists have been abducted there. Kidnappers held some for weeks in a bid to secure detained relatives' release from jail. Ahmadi-Moghaddam said police were cooperating with Iran's Intelligence Ministry on the case. The Fars News Agency also said borders were being monitored closely, citing what it described as an informed source. "In order to prevent the transfer of these two Belgian tourists ... the borders of this province and all entrance and exit roads are under tight control," the source told Fars, in an apparent reference to Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province. The Belgian embassy in Tehran said the mission was following up the reports but had no further information.
