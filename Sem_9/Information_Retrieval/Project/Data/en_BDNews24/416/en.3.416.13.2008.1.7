<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)The committee on economic affairs Monday allowed Bangladesh Rifles to import another one lakh tonnes of rice in the face of price hikes of food grains. The committee also exempted BDR from government restrictions to complete import of 90,000 tonnes of rice for which they were earlier given approval. The decisions were taken Monday at a meeting of the committee held at the finance ministry, chaired by finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam. BDR has been given the permission to import one lakh tonnes rice as they have showed success in importing rice and delivering it to the people at fair prices, Azizul told reporters after the meeting. Out of the 90,000 tonnes that they were permitted to import, they have imported 71,000 so far. Out of this amount they sold 51,000 tonnes to the food ministry and BDR themselves sold the remaining 20,000. The adviser also said that BDR has been exempted from government restrictions in importing the 19,000 tonnes rice for which they had been given permission in the earlier phase. They would import the additional one lakh tonnes under the same process. The meeting also gave permission to the food ministry to buy two crore pieces of sacking and relax the import policy on them, for the ongoing process of foodgrain procurement. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation has been approved to supply the sacks. Azizul also informed reporters that the Rural Electrification Board has been given permission to buy 6,000 transformers to keep the irrigation pumps operational over the next season. To ensure quick import and supply of these transformers the rules of international tender have been relaxed to make the tenure 10 days instead of 21 days. The meeting was attended by other members of the committee, including communications adviser MA Matin, food and energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury and health adviser ASM Matiur Rahman. bdnews
