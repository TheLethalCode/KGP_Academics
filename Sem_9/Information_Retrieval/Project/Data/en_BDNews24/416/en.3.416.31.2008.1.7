 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Khulna clinched on Monday the National Cricket League four-dayer championship after four seasons with a convincing 63-run defeat of Barisal in the final round tie at Birshreshthho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. Rajshahi, who clinched the one-day title, emerged runners-up despite losing by three wickets to Dhaka, who finished third, at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket League. Rajshahi could have finished on top despite their third loss had Khulna drawn against Barisal. Chittagong slipped to the fourth place even though they picked up a seven-wicket win over bottom-placed Sylhet in the final round at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Khulna, who clinched their first four-day title in 2003-04 season, secured 108 points from three wins, six draws and one loss in 10 outings.

Barisal secured 80 points with three wins, six losses and one draw followed by Sylhet, who have 61 points from four draws and six losses.

Barisal opener Nasiruddin Faruque converted his overnight 16 to 60, but his partner Hannan Sarkar (18) fell cheaply, triggering a mini collapse, after Barisal resumed the day on 20 for no loss. Middle order Rakibul Hasan defied the Khulna bowler with 53 before tail-ender Shaheen Hossain (29) and Tarikul Islam (32) raised the slim hope of reaching the target. However, the Khulna bowlers stopped the visitors 63 runs short, sparking off wild celebrations on the home ground on their second title in nine editions. Dhaka vs Rajshahi Chasing a paltry target of 130, Dhaka made suffered a jolt at the start against Rajshahi losing opener Anwar Hossain (8) in the seventh over.

Pacer Shahazada dismissed Mehrab and Mehrab Hossain Opee in two consecutive deliveries to reduce Dhaka to 68 for three, raising chances of an upset. Left-arm spinner Saqlaine Sajib removed three batsmen to boost Rajshahi's hopes as Dhaka slipped to 91 for seven. However, Mahmudullah Riad (25) and skipper Mohammad Sharif (23) remained unbeaten to steer Dhaka home. Earlier, Rajshahi resumed the day on 59 for seven to finish their second innings on 77, setting Dhaka an easy target to chase. Spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel, who Sunday took four wickets for nine, was the chief wrecker, returning six for 13 and was named man of the match. Chittagong vs Sylhet Chasing 237, Chittagong never seemed in danger against Sylhet after openers Gazi Salahuddin (42) and Masumuddowla (32) gave the port city outfit a rollicking start, racking up 79 runs for the stand. Nayeem Islam dismissed both openers to reduce Chittagong to 85 for two, but Rezaul Haq and Nazimuddin added 109 runs for the third wicket.
