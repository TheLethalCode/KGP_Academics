<TITLE> New Jersey legislature expresses regret for slavery </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Philadelphia, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Jersey became the fifth US state to apologize for its role in slavery when lawmakers voted on Monday for a resolution expressing "profound regret" for the enslavement of up to 12,000 blacks before the Civil War. The resolution, which does not have to be signed by Gov. Jon Corzine, was approved by the state Assembly by a vote of 59 to 8, with eight abstentions. The Senate voted for it by a margin of 21 to 9. Expressing its "deepest sympathies and solemn regrets" to slaves and their descendants, the resolution urged citizens to teach their children about slavery "to ensure that these tragedies will neither be forgotten nor repeated." Assemblyman Bill Payne, a Democrat who sponsored the measure, said it would help to address modern problems such as unequal access to housing and education that he said were the remnants of slavery. "Many of the social problems we have in this country are directly related to the fact that this country was involved in slavery," he said. Four Southern states have so far offered official apologies for slavery: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama and Maryland. New Jersey is the first Northern state to do so.
