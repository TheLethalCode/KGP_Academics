 Paris, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks were mostly flat in morning trade on Monday, taking a breather after the previous session's sharp drop following disappointing US jobs data that fuelled US recession fears and hit global equities. Shares of miners and automakers -- among those most hammered on Friday by concerns over the economic outlook for the United States -- extended losses, with Xstrata down 2.6 percent and Fiat down 1.8 percent. Shares in aerospace group EADS fell 3.6 percent, hit by a report in Germany's WirtschaftsWoche magazine that cited a high-ranking manager at EADS as saying the group's A400M military transport aircraft faces fresh problems which may delay its first flight. A spokesman for Airbus Military had no comment on the report. By 0915 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,459.9 points. Europe's benchmark index lost 1.8 percent on Friday, after data showed U.S. monthly jobs growth was the worst in over four years and the unemployment rate hit a two-year high in December, sparking new worries the U.S. economy may slip into recession. "We've had a huge barrage of very bearish statistics last week from the U.S. and it's obviously weighing on the market," said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas, in Paris. "The question this week is: 'are we ready for a short-term bounce, or are we going to crack through the support levels and go further down?' My view is that we'll get a small bounce because we're getting oversold on a number of indices," he said. INTEREST RATES The FTSEurofirst 300 index has already lost 3.2 percent in 2008, after ending 2007 with a thin gain of 1.6 percent, its worst annual performance since 2002. "People seem shocked by the statistics, but we know the economy is slowing down, so where is the surprise? The Fed will cut interest rates, and if the Bank of England cuts rates on Thursday, that could also help." According to a Reuters poll, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point this month, with a growing number of Wall Street firms seeing a greater chance of an even bigger cut following Friday's dismal employment report. Interest rate decisions by both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England are due on Thursday. Around European markets, Germany's DAX index was up 0.06 percent, UK's FTSE 100 index up 0.1 percent and France's CAC 40 up 0.1 percent. Energy shares bounced after Friday's drop, helped by an upbeat note from ING, and steady crude oil prices. BP was up 1.4 percent, Royal Dutch Shell up 1.2 percent and Total up 1.5 percent.
