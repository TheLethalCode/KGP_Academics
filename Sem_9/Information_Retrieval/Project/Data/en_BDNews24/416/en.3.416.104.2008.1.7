<TEXT>
 The Hague, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor on charges of directing atrocities in Sierra Leone resumed in The Hague on Monday with prosecutors due to call their first witnesses to the stand. Taylor, once one of Africa's most feared warlords, faces charges of rape, murder, mutilation and recruitment of child soldiers at the U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, set up to try those most responsible for the 1991-2002 conflict. The 59-year-old has pleaded not guilty to all charges. His trial was delayed for six months after opening in June 2007 after he appealed for more resources to fund his defence.
