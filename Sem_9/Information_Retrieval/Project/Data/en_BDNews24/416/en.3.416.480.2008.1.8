<TITLE> Asian shares steady; oil rebounds </TITLE>

 Hong Kong, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Most Asian shares edged up on Tuesday following recent falls, with oil rebounding from a nearly 3 percent tumble the prior day, but investor worries about a US recession persisted with Japan's Nikkei at an 18-month low. The dollar steadied from last week's decline, while the price of gold was firm but remained below a recent record. "Usually if the market falls this much you can expect a rebound, but the fact that we don't have this yet shows just how tough things really are," said Norihito Fujito, general manager of the investment research and information division at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "Now the whole issue of the U.S economy is starting to shift from a fear of recession to recession itself, and this is depressing the market." MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stock excluding Japan rose 0.7 percent by 0304 GMT after hitting a two-week low in the previous session. The index has dropped 3 percent this year, weighed down by data that raised investor fears of a U.S. recession, including a weak employment report out last Friday. But some analysts played down the wider impact of a U.S. slowdown, pointing to strong growth elsewhere, especially Asia. "When you look around the world, even if the U.S. slows, there's a lot of people who can pick up the baton," said Michael Heffernan, Austock Stockbroking senior client adviser. South Korea crept up 0.1 percent, after falling to a six-week low on Monday, with Hyundai Motor up 1.6 percent on expectations for its new premium car model and after the won currency has recently slid against the dollar. Taiwan stocks gained 1 percent reversing a 4 percent tumble in the previous session, as financial shares jumped on media reports that financial holding companies may soon be permitted to invest in China-based banks. But Tokyo shares fell 0.3 percent -- down more than 900 points since the start of the year. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index gave up earlier gains to fall 0.4 percent, dragged lower by the big mining stocks such as BHP Billiton on worries about slowing global demand. OIL EDGES UP The price of oil -- which hit a record above $100 a barrel just last week -- edged higher in Asian trade after ending down almost $3 overnight on concerns about the health of the economy in the United States and and unseasonably warm weather there. U.S crude futures were quoted at $95.55, while Brent Crude was at $94.89. Prices of commodities from energy to grains and metals have come under pressure as investors take profits on last week's record highs. The dollar steadied against the yen at 109.25 yen getting some respite after hitting a six-week low last week, with some traders viewing the currency as oversold. Traders also trimmed bets against the dollar on speculation that U.S. inflation may prevent aggressive interest rate cuts. Spot gold was little changed at $860.70/861.50 an ounce, drifting further away from recent record levels on a rebound in the dollar and falls in oil prices, although analysts said sentiment was still positive.
