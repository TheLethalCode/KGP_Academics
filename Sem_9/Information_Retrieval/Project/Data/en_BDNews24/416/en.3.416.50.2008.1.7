<TITLE> Tranquil golf club rides out Kenya`s conflict </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Eldoredt, Kenya, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Days of road blockades and destruction may have convulsed Kenya's Rift Valley -- but the Eldoret Club hasn't run out of tea, toast or marmalade. Sporting an immaculate nine-hole golf course lined with ancient trees, the club has been an oasis of calm in a week of political turbulence that saw at least 90 people killed and tens of thousands displaced in clashes in the Eldoret area alone. Eldoret has suffered some of the worst of the ethnic violence that erupted in Kenya -- normally seen as a stable country in a troubled region -- after President Mwai Kibaki was pronounced winner of an election the opposition says was rigged. A wave of riots, looting and in some cases ethnic-based killing has followed, turning the once sleepy town into a war zone, with U.N. staff rushing food supplies to refugees in scenes more normally associated with other parts of east Africa. Visitors to the town's tranquil club, however, could be forgiven for not noticing the chaos -- a reminder that even in the worst crises, it is rarely the rich who suffer most. "We're playing golf to relieve the stress," sighs a Kenyan businessman, as he tees off. "We only had to close shop but not everyone is lucky enough to still live normal lives." With its swimming pool and terraces overlooking spectacular greenery, the club could be Kenya in the 1950s -- except for the signs warning of a penalty for using mobile phones and the fact most members are now middle class indigenous Kenyans. "ANOTHER BEER?" Polite waiters in bow ties scurry about like worker ants. "Another Tusker, sir? That's your fourth. Are you thirsty or is it just that you love beer?" quips one with a smile before rushing off to wait on a woman snapping her fingers. It is this Kenya, with its colonial golf courses and luxury safari lodges in game parks housing the 'Big Five' animals that most visitors dream of -- a sharp contrast with the scenes of bloodshed that hit the headlines in the past week. Long a favourite Africa destination, Kenya draws more than a million tourists each year, but the industry faces an uncertain future as the election chaos is likely to scare many away. Golf green keeper Natu Lakhani, a Kenyan of Indian descent, remembers the club as it was in the stuffy old colonial days. Attitudes have improved immeasurably since then, he says. "They started letting Africans and Asians join in 1969. I've been a member since 1974. We have 80 golfers now, 60 regulars," he says, after putting his ball into the 9th hole. Two wooden tablets on a wall list the names of every club chairman since it was founded in 1924 -- all of them European until 1987, when the first Kenyan name crops up. Only occasional shortages of eggs or drinks belie the conflict that has hurt Rift Valley's businesses. "We stocked up for New Year, so we're OK. Things will settle down -- then hopefully we have a competition this weekend," Lakhani said. Kenya's relatively big economy has enabled many Kenyan and foreign professionals to grow rich, but because of this it also houses some of Africa's worst inequalities, analysts say. The youths torching homes of Kibaki's relatively prosperous Kikuyu ethnic group said they felt left out of Kenya's wealth, bolstered by an average 5 percent economic growth in five years. "We're tired of being sidelined," said Kilma Arap, 26, unemployed. "We want development, not just for rich people."
