 Monterrey, Mexico, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mexican troops and police shot dead three suspected drug hitmen armed with grenades in a fierce gun battle in a town near the US border on Monday. Soldiers fought around 20 armed men after being attacked with grenades following a search of a suspected drug safe house in Rio Bravo, across the border from McAllen, Texas, witnesses told Reuters. Three gunmen died in the battle and 10 soldiers and policemen were injured, the security forces said. Ten people were arrested. "The aggressors threw dozens of grenades and there was a lot of blood on the street. Some civilians were badly hurt and taken to hospital," said local journalist Ely Enriquez. The powerful Gulf Cartel and its notorious armed wing, the Zetas, are influential in many areas on the border north of the industrial city of Monterrey. Suspected drug gunmen killed a well-known local politician in Rio Bravo in November, turning the quiet agricultural town into a flashpoint in President Felipe Calderon's military assault on drug gangs. Calderon has mobilized some 25,000 troops and federal police to fight powerful organized crime gangs and drug cartels since he came to power a year ago. He sent 3,000 troops and federal police to Rio Bravo in December following the murder of politician Juan Antonio Guajardo. Calderon swore to "close down crime" in a televised New Year's address to the nation on Monday. He urged Mexico's local authorities, often accused of corruption and links to drug gangs, to help federal forces. "I invite all municipal and state governments to unite forces in this fight," he said. In 2007, more than 2,500 people were killed nationwide in drug-related murders despite the military clampdown on traffickers. The Bush adminisitration says Mexico is having success in the anti-drug war, disrupting cocaine routes to the north and forcing the price of the drug up in U.S. cities last year due to shortages.
