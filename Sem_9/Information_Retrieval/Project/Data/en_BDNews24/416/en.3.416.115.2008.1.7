 London, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US stock index futures pointed to a recovery on Wall Street on Monday after sharp falls seen on Friday when weak jobs data heightened fears of a recession. Banks might be in focus after shares in Swiss bank Credit Suisse fell 2.5 percent after a Swiss newspaper reported the bank faced writedowns in its commercial mortgage and leveraged-finance business. By 1055 GMT, S&P futures were up 0.6 percent and both Dow futures and Nasdaq futures rose 0.5 percent. Asian stocks fell to a two-week low while European equity markets traded higher. US stocks tumbled on Friday, dragging the Dow to its worst three-day start to a year since the Great Depression. The losses came after the US Labor Department reported job creation nearly ground to a halt in December and unemployment rose to a two-year high of 5 percent. US employers added only 18,000 jobs in December and the unemployment rate kicked up to its highest in more than two years, underlining a dramatically slowing economy. The national jobless rate jumped to 5 percent from 4.7 percent in November -- the largest monthly rise since October 2001. "One month's payrolls is not to be taken at face value, but with a rise of only 18,000 in December, the odds of the sort of employment weakness that could take the US into recession have certainly shortened," ING's economists said in a note. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 1.96 percent lower at 12,800.2, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index lost 2.46 percent to 1,411.6 and the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 3.8 percent to 2,504.6.
