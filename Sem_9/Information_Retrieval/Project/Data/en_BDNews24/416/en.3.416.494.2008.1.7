 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Monday dismissed sedition charges a freedom fighter had pressed against Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mujahid and two others. Chief metropolitan magistrate for Dhaka Md Emran Hossain Chowdhury dismissed the case, which also involves Jamaat's assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Molla and former Islami Bank chairman Shah Mohammad Abdul Hannan. Fazlur Rahman, a freedom fighter from Keraniganj, filed the case on Dec 5 against them for making disparaging statements about the nation's War of Independence and freedom fighters. The same court had accepted the case and asked Tejgaon Police Station to record the case. Police later returned the case to the court, saying they did not get approval from the government to do so. On Dec 11, the magistrate set Dec 18 for a decision about the fate of the case. But the court did not do so and set Dec 22 for the decision. Again, it reset the date for Jan 7. The complainant and his lawyers rejected the court decision Monday and said they would move the High Court to challenge the order. According to case details, Mujahid on Oct 25 said in an interview aired on different TV channels that there were no anti-liberation forces or war criminals in the country. On Oct 26, Hannan cited the liberation war as a 'civil war' in an interview with a TV channel. Kader Molla at a discussion on Oct 31 said the freedom fighters joined the war to protect the interest of India. He also made other controversial statements about the freedom fighters. bdnews2
