 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Robbers in an overnight heist swept clean 60 lockers of BRAC Bank's Dhanmondi branch in the city, bank officials and police said Monday. The thieves Saturday night cut open the roof of the top floor of the bank, made an easy foray into the locker room, broke open 75 lockers and looted valuables from 60. It was not clear how much goods were stolen and exactly at what time the heist had occurred. The top floors of the building house a hotel, Nidmahal and room 103 of the hotel is directly atop the bank. Police said the robbers cut a hole on the floor of the room to enter the bank. They have detained four workers of the hotel but have no major clue about the robbers. The bank concealed the incident from the clients until Monday. Nidmahal receptionist Wasim Chowdhury said three people rented room 207 on the third floor on Dec 1. A day later they shifted to rooms 103 and 104 on the second floor. They stayed in the two rooms for more than one month, he said. They left the hotel Sunday morning. The boarders in the register said they were from Hathazari, Chittagong. According to the hotel register, they are Salam, Abdul and Jalil. Wasim said they were aged between 40 and 45 years. Salam sported beard and all of them used to say their prayers five times a day. They had told hotel authorities that they would make a long stay in the hotel on business purposes. They said they were trying to get tickets of Saudia, the Saudi Arabian airlines. On Sunday morning a subscriber went to use his locker and told the bank of the matter. Abidur Rahman Shikder, head of marketing and corporate affairs of Brac Bank, said they later stopped the subscribers from accessing the locker room. Shikder said the robbers broke 75 of the132 lockers and that 60 lockers had goods. Mohammadpur police chief Shibli Noman said they were interrogating the detainees. He, however, would not say anything about the progress of the investigation. bdnews24.co
