<TITLE> Abbas to prod Bush on WBank settlements, Jerusalem </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bethlehem, West Bank, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday he would ask US President George W. Bush, who visits the Middle East this week, to curb Israel's West Bank settlements for the sake of peace. Bush has called the expansion of Jewish settlements on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood an "impediment" and said he would discuss it with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert during his trip to the region, which begins on Wednesday. Olmert last week ordered a de-facto halt to new Israeli projects in the West Bank but disputes remain over Jewish homes to be built in East Jerusalem, another territory captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians see as their future capital. Abbas made clear that Israel's measures fell short of the clean sweep that Palestinians demand for diplomacy to work. "We wish for him (Bush) first to ask the Israelis to stop the settlement building and ... guarantee once more the ending of the occupation that happened in 1967," Abbas told reporters after attending Orthodox Christmas services in Bethlehem. He said a future Palestine should be founded alongside Israel, with "Jerusalem as capital of the two states: East Jerusalem for Palestinians and West Jerusalem for the Israelis". The remarks cut to the heart of a decades-old conflict which Bush, having formally launched talks between Olmert and Abbas at a U.S.-sponsored conference in November, hopes to bring closer to resolution before he leaves office next year. Israeli and Palestinian peace negotiators were to meet later on Monday to agree on a plan for tackling Jerusalem and other "core issues" -- future borders and Palestinian refugees. STICKING POINTS Olmert and some of his closest confidants have indicated a willingness to give up swathes of the West Bank and mainly Arab areas of Jerusalem under an accord that would allow Israel to hold onto major settlement blocs. Israel calls Jerusalem its "eternal capital", a status not recognised abroad. But Olmert has conditioned any handovers on Abbas, who lost Gaza to Hamas Islamists in June, first proving his mettle against militants. Both Olmert and Abbas are hobbled at home. The Israeli prime minister is beholden to right-wing coalition partners which want to keep hold of land seen as a Jewish birthright. Bereft of Gaza and with Israeli forces and settlers having the run of the West Bank, Abbas has a credibility problem among many Palestinians. Olmert, in his meeting with Bush, is expected to pledge to scrap West Bank outposts erected by settlers without approval. A U.S.-led peace "road map" from 2003 obligates Israel to remove the outposts and halt all settlement activity as a first step. It also requires the Palestinians to dismantle militant groups behind more than seven years of fighting with Israel. While Olmert and Abbas have set the goal of trying to reach a statehood agreement next year, Bush, in an Israeli television interview aired on Monday, left vague what that might entail. "There will be an agreement on what a (Palestinian) state would look like, in my judgment," he told Channel Two, adding that he thought Olmert and Abbas should try to resolve their differences under his auspices. "(It's) not that I'm a great, you know, heroic figure, but they know me and they're comfortable with me and I'm a known quantity, and therefore the question is will they decide to make the effort necessary to get the deal done while I'm president?"
