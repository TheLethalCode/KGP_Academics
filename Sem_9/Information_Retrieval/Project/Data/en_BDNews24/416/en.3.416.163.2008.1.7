<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Monday that the visit of the Qatari labour minister was "most successful". Iftekhar said he expected "enhanced cooperation" with the Middle Eastern nation on manpower export. Qatari minister Sultan Bin Hasa Al Dhabit Al Dosari Monday ended a three-day visit to Dhaka when he signed a "protocol" with the government that would facilitate exports of more workers to his country. Qatar is one of the lucrative destinations for Bangladeshi workers --- skilled and unskilled. Currently about 70,000 Bangladeshi workers are employed in Qatar, a booming economy. Iftekhar said the visit was important since the penned protocol would lead to a "greater flow" of Bangladeshi workers into Qatar, according to a statement. He said the protocol was also meant to protect the rights of the workers in Qatar since many Bangladeshi workers reportedly face harassment and discrimination by their overseas employers. "Qatar is a prosperous country with huge gas resources and an expanding economy. Their need for skilled professionals is increasing. In Bangladesh we have a supply of such skills and we are also taking measures to upgrade them," the statement quoted Iftekhar as saying. The statement, quoting the Qatari minister, said that he was also positive. "We are happy with our Bangladeshi brethren who are helping us in Qatar and we hope to increase their numbers," the statement quoted the minister as saying. Iftekhar said the government was trying to export more workers abroad through various channels and efforts. "This is very much in line with our policy that has led to our success in sending over 600,000 workers abroad and earning over $6.5 billion," Iftekhar said. b
