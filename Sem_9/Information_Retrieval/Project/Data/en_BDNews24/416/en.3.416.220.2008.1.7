<TEXT>
 Brussels, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana congratulated Georgia on Monday for staging what he called a competitive presidential election but urged full investigation of alleged irregularities. "I should like to congratulate the Gweorgian people on the peaceful conduct of truly competitive presidential elections on January 5," he said in a statement. "As a matter of priority, the vote count should be concluded as soon as possible, and all allegations of irregularities should be properly investigated," he said of opposition accusations that Georgia's incumbent leader Mikhail Saakashvili had rigged Saturday's vote in his favour. "All political forces should maintain a dialogue in order to deal with the challenges ahead, including those identified by international observers, before the parliamentary elections in the spring," he added. Elections officials said Saakashvili won the vote outright with 52.8 percent, almost twice as much as his nearest challenger Levan Gachechiladze. Western monitors said there had been violations but that the vote was a true expression of Georgians' will. However on Sunday Gachechiladze urged supporters to protest against the result. Georgia is keen to join NATO and hopes to get encouragement from an alliance summit in April. However EU membership is a much more distant goal, with no specific timeframe identified.
