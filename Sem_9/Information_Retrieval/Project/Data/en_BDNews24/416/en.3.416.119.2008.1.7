<TITLE> Bush gets room with a view for Mideast peace push </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When US President George W. Bush gazes out of his sumptuous Jerusalem hotel room this week, the conflict that has confounded generations of politicians will be literally staring him in the face. Bush's hotel suite -- which goes for $2,600 a night before diplomatic discounts -- overlooks Jerusalem's fabled Old City and its holy sites, which are cherished by Jews, Christians and Muslims and cut to the heart of the Middle East conflict. Looking beyond the ancient city walls, Bush will spot Israel's snaking West Bank barrier -- viewed by Palestinians as a land grab and a hated symbol of occupation and by Israel as a vital buffer against suicide bombers. After shunning Middle East peacemaking for most of his tenure, Bush will make his first presidential visit to the Holy Land this week to try to shore up efforts for a deal on Palestinian statehood before he leaves the White House. The view from his room testifies to the hurdles he faces. Sceptics say Bush's previous hands-off approach and the fact Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas both lack political clout won't help. But Bush is the first US president to visit Jerusalem since Bill Clinton a decade ago and the Jewish state is rolling out the red carpet for a man many see as the best friend Israel has ever had in the White House. "This is a president who is very friendly and supportive of Israel, and Israel will certainly afford him the respect which he deserves during this visit," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said. City officials have unfurled thousands of U.S. and Israeli flags along Jerusalem's main arteries and planes at the country's Ben Gurion airport will be grounded when Bush arrives. Some 10,500 police -- more than a third of Israel's total police force -- have been drafted in to secure the streets of Jerusalem, including snipers and bomb-sniffing dogs. During the 3-day visit, Bush's entourage will take over Jerusalem's King David hotel, made famous when Jewish militants opposed to British rule in Palestine blew it up in 1946. "It's safe to say the hotel and the surrounding area will be like Fort Knox," said Director of Delegations Sheldon Ritz, adding security officials had already spent weeks securing the area and had even sent robots to check the sewers. An American al Qaeda militant urged Islamist militants to welcome Bush with bombs but Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said there had been no specific security warning in connection with the visit. Bush first visited Israel in 1998 as governor of Texas, when he flew over the country in a helicopter with hawkish former prime minister Ariel Sharon -- then foreign minister -- in a ride many believed cemented the bond between them. This time, Bush is expected to meet Olmert and Abbas, although his plans are under wraps. Not everyone has welcomed Bush's visit. Right-wing activists are planning protests against ceding occupied West Bank land they believe God gave to the Jews, while Islamist group Hamas, which opposes U.S. policy and any peace deal with Israel, dismissed the visit as a "photo opportunity" for a has-been president.
