<TITLE> South Korea names counsel to probe president-elect </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Seoul, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's president appointed a special counsel on Monday to probe securities fraud allegations levelled against the president-elect, which could undermine the new government's authority but not derail the transition. Former judge Chung Ho-young will investigate whether Lee Myung-bak was linked to a securities firm suspected of cheating investors out of tens of millions of dollars, making the former Hyundai Group executive the first president-elect to face a criminal probe. Lee will be inaugurated on Feb. 25, at about the same time the probe finishes, meaning there will not be enough time to bring formal charges before he takes office, legal experts said. Lee is immune from prosecution while in office under local laws. He has denied any links to the investment firm known as BBK. Lee, a conservative who stormed to a landslide victory in the Dec. 19 vote with pledges to revive an economy he said faltered under the left-leaning government of President Roh Moo-hyun. A few days before the election, Lee's liberal rivals released a video, which they said indicated he lied about his role in BBK. They then approved a bill calling for a special counsel. Liberals are likely to use the character issue as they face an uphill battle to keep control of parliament in an April general election. Separately, the justice ministry is likely to state its opposition to the special counsel, which could help Lee, saying parts of its mandate are unconstitutional, Yonhap news agency on Monday cited ministry officials as saying.
