<TITLE> New ASEAN chief upbeat on charter's full ratification </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new Association of Southeast Asian Nations chief expressed confidence on Monday the grouping's landmark charter aimed at paving the way for an EU-style economic bloc will be fully ratified within a year. The future of the ASEAN charter, which was signed at a summit in Singapore in November, was thrown into doubt after the Philippines Congress threatened not to ratify it unless democracy is restored in military-ruled Myanmar, an ASEAN member. Myanmar's prime minister, Thein Sein, will hold talks with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono during a visit to Jakarta next week. The charter needs ratification by all 10 members before an economic and security bloc encompassing 560 million people can be established. "I'm sure it will come around to the full ratification," Surin Pitsuwan told a news conference after officially assuming the post of ASEAN secretary general in a ceremony in Jakarta. "I think the end of the year is not too distant a target." The charter calls for a regional human rights body and economic integration, but critics say it lacks provisions to punish member states such as Myamar, which conducted a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in September and continues to keep opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest. Surin, a former Thai foreign minister known as a critic of Myanmar's military junta, said ASEAN stood ready to help Myanmar in its dealings with the United Nations on human rights. "We certainly will not interfere. We certainly will not impose, but we stand by ready, exploring ways and means to help," he said. "Our wish is that Myanmar can get over its own internal problems as soon as possible." ASEAN's policy of non-interference in members' internal affairs has come under fire from some quarters. The United States has said a free trade deal with ASEAN was impossible because of the political situation, and the EU has also called for more progress on Myanmar. Both have slapped sanctions on Myanmar's junta members and associated firms. Surin, a 58-year-old Thai Muslim with a doctorate from Harvard University, praised Singapore for being the first ASEAN member to ratify the charter. The Thai diplomat said he would travel to other member countries to appeal to their leaders to ratify the charter as soon possible. He called on member countries to immediately draw up a blueprint for the ASEAN security community.
