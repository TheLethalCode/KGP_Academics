 London, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell on Monday, extending the previous session's decline, as the market mulled over gloomy US economic data and the impact on demand should the world's top energy consumer slip into recession later this year. US light crude for February delivery eased 54 cents to $97.37 a barrel by 0955 GMT, extending Friday's $1.27 decline. London Brent crude fell 12 cents to $96.67. Oil has eased from a record peak of $100.09 a barrel last Thursday after a government report showed the US unemployment rate up 5 percent in December, its highest in more than two years. The bleak unemployment report was the latest signal that top energy consumer the United States could fall into a recession later this year. "Concerns about the US economy are clearly putting some pressure on oil prices. Some market players are also using this opportunity to take profits," said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst from the National Bank of Australia. Burg said that while OPEC rumblings over the weekend had not given any clear signal on what action the cartel might take at its next meeting, there were growing expectations that the group would increase output to rein in prices. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Sunday that the rise in oil prices had been determined by market forces, but declined further comment on what action the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would take at its next meeting on Feb. 1 in Vienna. Separately, OPEC president Chakib Khelil said on Saturday he expected oil prices to keep rising during the first quarter of this year before stabilising in the following quarter. Goldman Sachs, the most active investment bank in energy markets, also believed oil will stay strong and kept its average 2008 price forecast unchanged at $95. "We maintain that the combination of tighter short-term fundamentals and escalating costs will continue to provide strong support to oil prices in 2008, with the risk skewed to the upside from current levels," it said. Crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange boosted net long positions to a near two-month high in the week ended Dec. 24, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday. The increase in bullish sentiment came just before oil prices hit last week's peaks.
