 Kabul, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber severely wounded five Afghan policemen in an attack in the southern province of Kandahar on Monday, a provincial official said. Taliban insurgents killed hundreds of civilians in suicide raids targeting Afghan and international troops across the country in 2007, the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since their ousting in 2001. Border police official Razaq Khan said the bomber had approached the vehicle on foot in the Spin Boldak area bordering Pakistan, a hotbed of Taliban activity. Two soldiers from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), meanwhile, were killed in a vehicle accident also in Kandahar, a military statement said on Monday. "Two ISAF soldiers died ... when their vehicle rolled over during a move across difficult terrain in Zhari District," ISAF statement said. ISAF does not ordinarily release the nationalities of its casualties, but other sources said the two soldiers were Canadians serving with their country's 2,000 strong contingent in Afghanistan. Some 74 Canadian soldiers and one diplomat have died since the Canadian mission began in 2002.
