 Hong Kong, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks slumped to a two-week low on Monday, extending a poor start in 2008, after weak US jobs data heightened fears of recession in the region's top export market, while bond prices rose as investors sought safety. Oil prices -- which hit a record above $100 barrel just last week -- fell on concern global demand would suffer from a US-led slowdown, but the dollar edged higher from a six-week low on Friday as some saw the currency as oversold. "The sluggish jobs data is reinforcing concerns that the subprime mortgage crisis is pushing the US economy towards a recession," said Kim Young-gak, an analyst at Hyundai Securities. "Now it looks like the US Federal Reserve will almost certainly cut interest rates by at least a quarter percentage point this month." MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan lost 2.3 percent by 0618 GMT. Earlier, the index hit its lowest since Dec. 21. The index has dropped 3.3 percent this year, weighed down by concerns about the world's top economy. European stocks are also forecast to fall on Monday according to financial bookmakers, with Britain's FTSE 100 seen down between 10 to 18 points and the German DAX expected 27 to 33 points lower. Tokyo shares dropped to a 17-month low at one point, ending down 1.3 percent, after slumping 4 percent on Friday, their first trading day of the year. Taiwan stocks shed 4.1 percent, while other markets such as Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore were down more than 2 percent each. Exporters such as South Korean auto maker Hyundai Motor Co were hit hard after the US non-farm payrolls figures showed US job growth skidded to a near-halt in December and unemployment rose to a two-year high. Chip-related shares were also among the day's biggest decliners, extending recent falls following downgrades of the sector by a couple of US brokerages last week. Japanese microchip equipment maker Tokyo Electron fell 2.8 percent, while South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd was down 3.7 percent. Taiwan's TSMC, the world's biggest contract chip maker, dropped 7 percent. But bucking the trend, Chinese infrastructure-related stocks rallied following news of contracts won in the sector, with China Railway Group up 3 percent. DOLLAR REBOUNDS Commodity-related shares, such as miners BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals, also fell on concerns a slowdown in global demand growth would dent a recent boom in prices for resources such as oil and metals. US crude futures retreated 61 cents to $97.30 a barrel, while London Brent crude eased to $96.31. The dollar edged up to around 108.9 against the yen from a six-week low hit on Friday, but remained steady against the euro. "The market is still adjusting its view of how a US slowdown is going to affect Asia," said Gerrard Katz, head of North Asia currency trading at Standard Chartered in Hong Kong. "As long as Asian stocks are weak, fund managers are buying US Treasuries and selling positions in a traditional safe-haven play." SAFE HAVEN Japanese government March bond futures hit a one-month high on Monday as fears of a US recession grew and investors bet the Fed will cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points during its Jan 29-30 meeting. US short-term interest rate futures jumped on Friday, pricing in as much as a 70 percent chance that the Fed would cut rates by 50 basis points The Fed has lowered its benchmark lending rate by 100 basis points since September to 4.25 percent. Spot gold edged down to $855.80/$856.60 as energy prices fell, but stayed within reach of a record high of $869.05 traded last week, as a weak dollar makes the precious metal cheaper in other currencies
