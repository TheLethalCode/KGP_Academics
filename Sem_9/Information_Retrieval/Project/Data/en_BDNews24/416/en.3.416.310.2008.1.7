 BAGHDAD, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Two suicide bombers struck in a Sunni Arab district of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 14 people including the leader of the area's neighbourhood patrols, an Interior Ministry source said. Two other security sources gave a death toll of 10 people killed but said it could rise. Baghdad security spokesman Brigadier-General Qassim Moussawi told Iraqiya state television that six people had been killed and 26 wounded. One of the bombers wore an explosive vest, the other struck with a car bomb. Among the dead was Riyadh al-Sammarrai, head of neighbourhood security volunteers in Adhamiya, a mainly Sunni Arab area in northeastern Baghdad. A spokesman for the Sunni Endowment, a religious organisation, said a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest had struck near the entrance to its building in Adhamiya and the second bomb struck nearby after crowds gathered.
