 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)The High Court Monday issued a contempt of court rule upon fisheries and livestock secretary Syed Ataur Rahman. It also directed him to appear in court on Feb 11 and explain why he should not be punished for committing contempt of court. The HC bench of justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam gave the ruling on a petition filed by Abdul Mazid and 77 other project workers under the fisheries and livestock ministry. In the petition they claimed that on Aug 28 last year, the HC ordered the ministry to pay within 45 days their salaries in arrears for four years. But the secretary had not complied with the order even 80 days after the judgement. Barrister Salauddin Dolan moved the contempt petition. bdn
