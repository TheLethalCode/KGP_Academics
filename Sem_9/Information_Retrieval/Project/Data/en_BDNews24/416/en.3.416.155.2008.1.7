<TITLE> Key trade ministers to meet in Davos late January </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Geneva, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Key trade ministers will meet in Switzerland later this month to take stock of the long-running Doha round of trade talks, officials said on Monday. The informal meeting, at a lunch hosted by Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard on Jan. 26, will be an opportunity to discuss some of the major issues holding up a deal in the talks, launched at the end of 2001 to bolster world trade. "It's not an informal mini-ministerial conference. It's a simple lunch," said a spokesman for Leuthard. Leuthard is holding the lunch on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, an annual gathering of political and business leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos. Trade ministers have often met during the forum in recent years. Officials said it was not yet certain who would attend the lunch, but at least three of four major players were expected -- U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab, EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. Whether the fourth key player, Indian Commerce Minister Kamal Nath, attends is unclear. French President Nicolas Sarkozy may visit India that week which would keep some Indian participants in the meeting in Delhi, a Swiss official said. Schwab, Mandelson, Amorim and Nath have been invited to take part in a World Economic Forum panel discussion later that afternoon on threats to the global trading system. The other panelists are also likely to attend the lunch. Besides Leuthard herself, they are Japanese Trade Minister Akira Amari, Indonesian Trade Minister Mari Pangestu and World Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General Pascal Lamy. Other ministers have also been invited, but the informal nature of the lunch means the organisers do not need to follow the careful balance of major players and countries representing groups and alliances characterising WTO meetings. Trade officials said the ministers are likely to focus on the broader political issues dividing developed and developing countries, and food exporters and importers, rather than engage in detailed negotiations. Lamy has told negotiators a trade deal can be clinched this year. But the next major stage is when the chairman of the key agriculture talks issues a new draft negotiating text, followed by his counterparts in industry and services. That is not expected until the end of January or early February -- after the end of the Davos meeting.
