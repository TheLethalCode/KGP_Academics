<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The health of former Indonesian president Suharto, rushed to hospital in critical condition last week, deteriorated again on Tuesday as his haemoglobin level dropped and fluid entered his lungs, a doctor said. Suharto, 86, was admitted to Jakarta's Pertamina hospital on Friday suffering from anaemia and low blood pressure due to heart, lung and kidney problems. "Suharto's condition deteriorated this morning," Mardjo Soebiandono, the head of the medical team treating the former five-star general, told a news conference. "More fluid infiltrated his lungs and some blood was seen in his faeces and urine that prompted his haemoglobin to drop," he said, adding that Suharto had been given a blood transfusion.
