<TITLE> Polish PM hopes Russia will drop import ban </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Warsaw, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk expects Russia to lift the remaining ban on imports of Polish agricultural products during his visit to Moscow in February, he was quoted as saying on Monday. Russia imposed an embargo on Polish food in 2005 but meat imports resumed in December in a gesture towards Warsaw's new centre-right government. "I have the right to expect that during my visit to Moscow the embargo on plant products will also be lifted," Tusk told weekly Newsweek in an interview. The two-year-old row added to deteriorating relations between Poland and Russia under previous conservative government. Tusk has sought to improve the strained relations with its two largest neighbours, Russia and Germany. One of his first actions since taking office in November was to lift Poland's objections to Moscow's efforts to join the OECD. Other issues also on agenda of the Feb. 10 meeting will include Russia's objections to the U.S. plans to host anti-missile defences on Polish soil and Russian-German Baltic gas pipe project, which omits Poland and the Baltic republics.
