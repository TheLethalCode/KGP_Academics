<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Monday sent back a writ petition meant to challenge the term "fugitive" for Sheikh Rehana in an extortion case. The bench of Justice ABM Khairul Haque and Justice Md Abdul Awal asked her counsels to re-file the petition putting their arguments in detail. Police showed Rehana, who lives in London, is a fugitive from justice in the case. Barrister Ajmalul Hossain who argued the case for Rehana told the court that Rehana was the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and no fugitive. "She has long been living abroad. She owns a home and her children study there. She is not a fugitive," he said. Another counsel, barrister Rafiqe-ul Huq, said the case mentioned that Rehana lived in England and the US. "So an order on her to be present in the court must be notified through the embassies of those countries. But it has not been done," Huq told the court. The court said those details had not been included in the petition and returned it to the counsels for the addition. "We'll correct the holes and file the petition again," barrister Hossain told reporters later. Rehana's elder sister and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, both detained, face charges of taking Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury during Hasina's term in 1996-2001. Jahangir, who filed the case, said he was forced to pay the amount because the accused threatened him to cancel a power project by his firm. Hasina and Rehana have denied the charges. bdnews24
