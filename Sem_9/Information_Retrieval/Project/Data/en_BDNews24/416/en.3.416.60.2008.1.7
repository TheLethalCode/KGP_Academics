<TITLE> Oil shrugs off Iran-US bounce, falls below $97 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell more than $1 to below $97 a barrel on Monday, handing back gains triggered by reports of fresh tensions between Iran and the United States. Iranian speedboats swarmed three U.S. warships in the key Strait of Hormuz at the weekend and made threats via radio, Pentagon officials said on Monday, confirming a CNN report. The officials said a U.S. captain was in the process of giving an order to fire, but the order was not carried out as the Iranian boats moved away from the U.S. ships. Relations between the two countries are already tense over Iran's nuclear programme and traders said the news had helped put the focus back on geopolitical risks in the oil market. U.S. light crude for February delivery rallied briefly to a session high of $98.40 a barrel, but by 1530 GMT, it was down $1.35 to $96.56, extending losses from its previous session when it fell $1.27. London Brent crude was $1.15 down at $95.64. "We rallied off the Iranian headline, but when floor trading opened we gave back those gains as we have temperatures warming, the dollar showing some recovery and concerns about the economy," said Eric Wittenauer, analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. Oil has eased from a record peak of $100.09 a barrel last Thursday after a government report showed U.S. unemployment rate up 5 percent in December, its highest in more than two years. The bleak unemployment report was the latest signal that top energy consumer the United States could fall into a recession later this year. U.S. ECONOMY "Concerns about the U.S. economy are clearly putting some pressure on oil prices. Some market players are also using this opportunity to take profits," said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst from the National Bank of Australia. Burg said that while OPEC rumblings over the weekend had not given any clear signal on what action the group might take at its next meeting, there were growing expectations that it would increase output to rein in prices. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on Sunday that the rise in oil prices had been determined by market forces, but declined further comment on what action the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would take at its next meeting on Feb. 1 in Vienna. Separately, OPEC president Chakib Khelil said on Saturday he expected oil prices to keep rising during the first quarter of this year before stabilising in the following quarter. Goldman Sachs, the most active investment bank in energy markets, also believes oil will stay strong and has kept its average 2008 price forecast unchanged at $95. "We maintain that the combination of tighter short-term fundamentals and escalating costs will continue to provide strong support to oil prices in 2008, with the risk skewed to the upside from current levels," it said. Crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange boosted net long positions to a near two-month high in the week ended Dec. 24, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday. The increase in bullish sentiment came just before oil prices hit last week's peaks. U.S. heating demand will be 38.5 percent below normal this week as temperatures rise well above normal in most parts of the country, the National Weather Service forecast in its weekly report. Demand for heating oil -- the favored heating fuel of the Northeast region -- is expected to average about 40 percent below normal this week, the report added.
