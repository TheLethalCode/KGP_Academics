<TITLE> `Blood diamond` expert called in Taylor trial </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 The Hague, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prosecutors called an expert on Sierra Leone's illegal diamond trade that funded one of Africa's bloodiest wars when the trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor on war crimes charges began in earnest on Monday. Taylor, once one of Africa's most feared warlords, faces charges of rape, murder, mutilation and recruitment of child soldiers at the U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, set up to try those most responsible for the 1991-2002 conflict. The 59-year-old, the first former African head of state to face an international court, has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He looked relaxed in court, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles, a dark suit and tie. More than quarter of a million people were killed in intertwined wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone which shocked the world with stories and images of child soldiers high on drugs, killing, raping and looting. Prosecutors want the trial to set a precedent worldwide and end decades of impunity for African strongmen. Taylor is accused of trying to gain control of Sierra Leone's mineral wealth, particularly its diamond mines, and seeking to destabilise its government by supplying the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels. Prosecutors called as their first witness Ian Smillie, a Canadian expert on the trade in conflict diamonds or "blood diamonds", smuggled out of Africa and used to fund wars. Smillie said diamonds had a history of destabilising Sierra Leone, describing his time as a teacher in a diamond-producing area in 1967-68: "It was very volatile. Almost like a Wild West town ... There were thousands of illicit diamond diggers." He will be followed by a victim of the violence in Sierra Leone, and then an insider once close to Taylor's regime. FEARS OF INSTABILITY In Sierra Leone, a generation of civilian amputees -- their hands or legs hacked off by rebels -- are a painful reminder of the cruelty of the conflict, in which drugged rebels and militias, often child soldiers, killed, raped and maimed. The trial is being held in The Hague because of fears it could spur instability if held in Sierra Leone. Prosecutors intend to call 144 witnesses but hope half of them can submit their testimony in writing, allowing the prosecuting team to wrap up their case in around eight months. They expect a judgment by the end of 2009, though an appeal would be likely to stretch into 2010. Taylor boycotted the opening of his trial last June in a dispute over the resources allocated to his defence, prompting legal wrangling and repeated delays. More funds were eventually made available to Taylor and a new defence team was appointed in July. The former strongman is receiving legal aid despite suspicions he amassed a considerable personal fortune. In the past, ousted African dictators have often fled overseas to live out their days unpunished. Taylor found exile in Nigeria after being overthrown in 2003, but was later handed to the court under international pressure.
