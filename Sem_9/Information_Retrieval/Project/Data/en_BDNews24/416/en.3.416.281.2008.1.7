<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission Secretariat will be accountable to parliament for its job once it is freed from the Prime Minister's Office, a commissioner said Monday. "The prime minister or a representative will reply to the questions related to the EC secretariat in parliament," commissioner Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com. Asked what facilities the EC secretariat would enjoy once the separation gets through, the commissioner said: "The work speed of the secretariat will multiply." "The commissioners will be able to do their jobs such as recruitment and transfer of employees. The allocation of the budget is another vital thing," he said. Sohul said he was hopeful that people's confidence in the commission would increase. He made the comment after reports that the government almost finalised the draft law on separation of the commission secretariat. "The legal infrastructure for an independent Election Commission secretariat has been prepared," law adviser barrister Mainul Hosein told reporters at his Baridhara home. "A few amendments are yet to be finished," he said. bdnews24
