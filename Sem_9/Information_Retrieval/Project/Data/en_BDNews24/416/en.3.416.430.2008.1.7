<TEXT>
 Norman, Oklahoma, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leading US moderates who blame political partisanship for the country's woes will gather in Oklahoma on Monday in a meeting widely viewed as further laying the groundwork for a presidential run by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The group of mostly former public officials from both parties is expected to urge Republican and Democratic candidates to forsake what they view as political extremism and partisanship in favor of more centrist policies. "Partisan polarization is preventing us from uniting to meet the challenges that we must face if we are to prevent further erosion of America's power of leadership," lead organizers former US senators David Boren and Sam Nunn said in a statement. Despite their high-minded pronouncement, speculation is rampant that the meeting's primary purpose is to put the spotlight on Bloomberg. The billionaire mayor has denied it, but he is said to be considering running for the president as an independent and has fed the rumor mill by traveling around the country making speeches on national issues. Bloomberg was a Democrat for years, became a Republican to run for mayor in 2001 and in June dropped his ties with any party. His entry into the race would shake up an election in which no clear favorites have emerged. The Oklahoma meeting follows surprisingly strong victories by Democrat Barack Obama and Republican Mike Huckabee in the Iowa caucuses last week and comes a day before the closely-fought New Hampshire primaries. In his weekly radio interview on Friday, Bloomberg lambasted the 2008 presidential candidates for their failure to address problems such as national health care, foreign policy and the fading US economy, blaming their supposed reticence on partisan politics. "They're unwilling to face the big issues, and take the risks and give it straight to the public," he said. PREPARING TO LAUNCH BLOOMBERG? The attendees of the Oklahoma meeting, Bloomberg said, "would probably agree with me to say that there's been too much partisan bickering." One veteran Democrat who will attend Monday's event, but asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters there had been no suggestion to him that the meeting was aimed at launching a Bloomberg presidential bid. "All I know is that no independent candidacies were part of the deal, or expected. My motivation was purely to try to reduce the bitter partisan and 'gotcha' maneuvering by both sides," he said. Boren, who is president of the University of Oklahoma where the meeting will be held, told the New York Times last week that if the current candidates do not show improvement, he would "be among those who would urge Mr. Bloomberg to very seriously consider running for president." Some other prominent attendees expected on Monday include Democratic former US senators Chuck Robb and Gary Hart and Republicans Sen. Chuck Hagel and former Sen. John Danforth. About 16 participants are expected for what will be a morning-long private meeting, followed by a panel discussion and news conference
