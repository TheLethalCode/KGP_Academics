<TITLE> China scurries to contain mice on US flight: reports </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Beijing, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States, concerned about tainted imports from China, has exported its own batch of potentially harmful goods to Beijing in the form of mice on a flight from Washington, state media said on Tuesday. Chinese inspectors found eight mice, dead and alive, on a United Airlines flight to Beijing after the airline reported the stowaways to local quarantine officials upon landing on Sunday afternoon, Xinhua news agency said. The report prompted an "emergency team" to rush to the aircraft, Xinhua said, to "put rat poison and mice traps at every possible corner on the aircraft, including the cockpit". "Eight mice, dead and (alive), were found at last ... hidden in pillows," the agency said. The surviving mice were sent to labs for testing, it said. The incident was reported in most newspapers on Tuesday, citing experts warning of dozens of fatal viruses that the mice could spread, and the risk of fatal accidents from them chewing through the plane's wiring and circuits. A United Airlines spokeswoman said the company could not provide an immediate comment. China has been rocked by a number of quality scandals involving food, toys and drugs in recent months, but has repeatedly accused foreign media of biased reporting, while making a point of naming foreign companies it claims have substandard product problems.
