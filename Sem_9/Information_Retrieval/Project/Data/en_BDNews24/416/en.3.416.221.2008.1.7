 Savar, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)Universe Knit Garments in Savar Monday laid off 2,300 workers after they went on strike demanding pay hikes. The factory workers had observed work stoppage for the last few days for different demands. A meeting was scheduled for Monday with the company's managing director Mohammad Javed to settle the issue. When the workers came to the factory around 10am, they found the main gate of the factory locked and police deployed there. The workers found a notice hanging at the gate which announced the shutdown of the factory. The authorities pledged to pay the dues to workers on Jan 10. The sudden notice prompted the workers into protests, witnesses said. Many workers were seen crying. The workers tried to block the road through the area, but the police foiled the attempt. The factory's general manager Hafizuddin said the factory had been closed for an indefinite period. Ashulia police chief Kamrul Islam said the police had been deployed to maintain order. bdnews2
