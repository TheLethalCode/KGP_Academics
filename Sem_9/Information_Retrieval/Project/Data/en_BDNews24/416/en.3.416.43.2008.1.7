 London, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Free screening for stroke, diabetes, heart and kidney disease is to be introduced over the next three years under plans for the National Health Service unveiled by Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Monday. Diagnostic procedures such as blood screening, electrocardiograms and ultrasound will become available in family doctor surgeries rather than hospitals in a drive to promote preventative health care. "Over time everyone in Britain will have access to the right preventative health check-up," Brown will say in a speech marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the NHS. Renewal of the health service will be the government's highest priority. He will promise a more personal and preventative service that "intervenes earlier, with more information and control put more quickly into the hands of patient and clinician." In a series of media interviews ahead of the speech, Brown said the screening would start with vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, who need it most.
