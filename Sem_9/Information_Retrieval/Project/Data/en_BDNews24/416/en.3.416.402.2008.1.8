 Colombo, Jan 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Sri Lankan minister was admitted to a hospital emergency unit on Tuesday after his car was targeted by a roadside bomb north of the capital, a hospital official said. The Sri Lankan military said the condition of the minister and four other people caught in the blast was not serious. Nation Building Minister D.M. Dassanayake's car was targeted by a blast, which bore the hallmarks of a Tamil Tiger rebel attack, in the town of Ja-Ela, 12 miles (19 km) north of Colombo. "He is in the emergency unit," a hospital official said, asking not to be named. The military said the minister and four other people were admitted to hospital, but none of them were seriously injured. The blast is the latest in series of attacks on government officials and the military in recent months, and comes just days after the government said it was formally scrapping a tattered ceasfire which degenerated into renewed civil war in early 2006. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who want to carve out an independent state in north and east Sri Lanka, were not immediately available for comment, but routinely deny involvement in such attacks. "This is definitely by the LTTE," said a military spokesman, declining to be named in line with policy. The Colombo stock market deepened losses following the news of the blast, and was down 2.54 percent at the midsession. The military says it has killed nearly 100 Tiger rebels since advising mediator Norway last week it was pulling out of the pact, a move that has shocked the international community and is seen ruining any hope of resurrecting peace talks to end a 25-year civil war any time soon. Just minutes before the blast, which took place on the main road between the island's only international airport and the capital, Deputy Tourism Minister Faizal Mustapha impressed on reporters that Sri Lanka was a safe tourist destination.
