 Dhaka, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court dealing with extortion charges against Sheikh Hasina sits Tuesday, but it is not clear whether she will be able to appear in court. Lawyers said Monday that they were not sure about Hasina's physical condition. "We don't know anything about the health of Sheikh Hasina. What we have learned about her is from the statement of her personal physicians. I can't say anything other than that," defence counsel Syed Rezaur Rahman told bdnews24.com. DIG (prisons) Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui said Monday that a medical team had examined Hasina in the afternoon. "Her blood pressure was 120/80. We hope to take her to the court tomorrow (Tuesday)," Siddiqui told bdnews24.com. Hasina fell sick on Dec 31 when she was in the dock. Later, the court of metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque ordered that she be sent back to the special jail. Since then, she has not attended court proceedings. Four personal physicians Sunday appealed to the chief adviser and the home secretary to send Hasina to the United Sates for better treatment. They said in the appeal that Hasina was suffering from high blood pressure, headache and trouble in the ear and kidney. They also mentioned gynaecological problems. Hasina is faced with charges of extorting Tk 3 crore from businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury during her term in 1996-2001. Hasina's sister Shiekh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. They have denied the charges. Jahangir, who filed the case, said that he was forced to pay the amount because the accused had threatened to cancel a power project of his firm. bdnews24.
