<TITLE> UN atomic watchdog chief to visit Iran Jan 11-12 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Vienna, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International Atomic Energy Agency director Mohamed ElBaradei will visit Iran on Jan. 11-12 to help resolve outstanding questions about Iran's disputed atomic programme, an IAEA spokeswoman said on Monday. ElBaradei would be making the rare trip at the invitation of the Islamic Republic, following diplomatic reports late last month that Iran's staged plan for transparency agreed with the UN watchdog agency was getting bogged down. "The Director-General will visit Tehran on Friday and Saturday. During the visit he will meet with a number of high officials," IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said. "(ElBaradei) hopes that the visit will develop ways and means to enhance and accelerate implementation of (nuclear) safeguards in Iran, with a view of resolving all remaining outstanding issues and enabling the agency to provide assurance about Iran's past and present nuclear activities," she said in an emailed statement. Iran said on Dec. 30 its first atomic power plant will start operating in mid-2008, despite UN sanctions aimed at making it stop nuclear activity over concerns that it secretly seeks atomic bombs, not nuclear-generated electricity as it maintains.
