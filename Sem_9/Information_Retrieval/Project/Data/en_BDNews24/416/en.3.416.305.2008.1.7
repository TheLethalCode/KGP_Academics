<TITLE> Uganda announces oil refinery plans </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kampala, Jan 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Yoweri Museveni has announced plans to construct an oil refinery, a first step toward lessening Uganda's reliance on foreign fuel. "We intend to construct a mini-refinery, in Hoima, using the petroleum products there," Museveni said on state-owned television, late on Sunday. "This refinery will commence its operations in mid-2009, with the production of Heavy Fuel Oil, paraffin and diesel." Last year, Uganda discovered oil deposits at Hoima, 250 km (150 miles) north western Uganda near Lake Albert. Museveni has come under strong criticism as the country has no fuel reserves. The political crisis in neighbouring Kenya highlighted Uganda's exposure to fuel disruptions as election-related violence choked off supplies of fuel and petroleum products from Kenya's Indian Ocean port to landlocked countries such as Uganda, Burundi, Rwanda and south Sudan. Rwanda has been forced to announce fuel rationing and in Uganda, vehicle owners have had to abandon their cars by the roadside when they ran out of fuel. In the capital of semi-autonomous south Sudan, swarms of motorcycles and cars crowded around petrol depots on Monday trying to catch the last of Juba's fuel supply. Museveni said work on a pipeline between the Kenyan border and Kampala would begin in five months. "Work is slated to start in May. It will also involve expanding on storage capacity at Jinja, as well as constructing a terminal and storage facilities for Kampala and Western Uganda," he added.
