Ballack, the Germany captain, had the brief surgery in an Augsburg clinic after consulting with his Premier League club, the DFB said. The surgery went "well and without complications". "Michael Ballack complained again of strong pain in both feet after the World Cup qualifying game against Wales on Wednesday," German team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Mueller-Wohlfahrt said in the DFB statement.
