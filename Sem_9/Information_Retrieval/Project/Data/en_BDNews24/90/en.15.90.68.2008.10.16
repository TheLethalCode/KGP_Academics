 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  The government, in an official notice Thursday, advised people against eight foreign makes of powdered milk until further notice, after the products tested positive for melamine content at a Dhaka University lab. The eight brands are: Australian brands Diploma and Red Cow, Danish brand Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2 and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. The handout came after tests in a DU laboratory showed positive for melamine in the eight imported products being sold in Bangladesh. BSTI director general Md Azmal Hossain had told bdnews24.com of the results earlier in the day, and added that the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution and private laboratory Plasma Plus also tested all eight brands but found only onethe Chinese brand milk formula Yashili-1to contain melamine. Hossain said results of the tests at the three laboratories were sent to the ministry of commerce and a number of recommendations were made in line with the tests results. The government in its handout said, of the eight brands, five will be further tested at the National Science Laboratory and at the laboratory of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission,. The BSTI head said: "So far milk powder of 36 brands has been collected from markets for testing. Tests of 15 brands, including these eight, have already been completed." "It is not mandatory for BSTI to test powder milk imported for consumption by adults," he added. "BSTI tests powder milk for consumption by children from 0 to 10 years." Azmal Hossain said they sent a proposal to the government so that all milk powder was tested in the BSTI laboratory. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the ministry received a number of recommendations from the BSTI. He said a coordination committee comprising experts on the matter would be formed by Sunday to take a decision in this regard. He said a final decision would be taken by next week on the basis of the recommendations of the coordination committee. In reply to a question as to whether the imported milk powders are tested before marketing, and whether the brands in which tested positive for melamine have have been banned for sale, the secretary said: "The issue of contamination by melamine was not known to us in the past." "After the recent discovery of melamine in milk powder in China, testing the products became urgent." He said, so far no brand has been banned and no company has been asked to withdraw milk powder from the market on the basis of test findings. The meeting on Sunday is likely to discuss these issues. The melamine milk powder scare, originating in China, has spread panic worldwide over the past month as more than 60,000 babies fell ill in China after drinking milk of two local brands. Four infants died. bdnews24.com
