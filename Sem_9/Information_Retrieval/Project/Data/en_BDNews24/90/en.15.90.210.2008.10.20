<TITLE> Financial crisis may end boom for Suez Canal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ismailia, Egypt, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Winding through this small Egyptian town like an artery, pumping cash into its hospitals and schools and beyond into the wider economy, the Suez Canal has flourished as a shipping shortcut. Now the faltering global economy, coupled with a rise in piracy to the canal's south, looks set to end the high times for the waterway and the town Egyptians call its bride. The canal, versions of which were first built by pharaohs more than three millennia ago, has helped the world's most populous Arab country to its fastest growth in decades, contributing 3.3 percent of gross domestic product in the 2007/2008 fiscal year. A near "perfect storm" of world trends has lifted revenue from the 190-km (110-mile) waterway to record levels: a surge in global trade powered by China and India, higher global shipping costs, capacity problems with the Panama Canal and higher oil prices forcing shippers to take shorter routes. Those factors made it possible to hike canal transit fees from April by an average 7.1 percent while August revenues hit another monthly record of $504.5 million. Samah Afafa Yousof, a lawyer at one of the canal's subsidiaries and a member of Ismailia's council, said her annual salary had tripled to about 1,500 Egyptian pounds ($270) as the fortunes of the canal have risen. "This is the best age for the canal, in all its history," said Yousof, 28, whose father recently won an award for 25 years of service to the canal. But some are predicting tougher times ahead. Cairo-based investment bank EFG-Hermes says the canal may earn a record $6.1 billion this fiscal year, up about 18 percent from the fiscal year that ended in June. But it sees revenue growth slowing to 10 percent in the 2009/2010 fiscal year, with declining European demand presenting a significant downside risk. "The big boom in world trade and the rise in oil led to a big rise in our daily operations," Suez Canal Authority Chairman Ahmed Fadel said in July. "(But) we are a part of the global economic situation, and we expect any decline in growth to have an effect on sea trade." BOOSTING GROWTH Egypt's government said this month it was maintaining its growth target at 6-7 percent for the current fiscal year, after growth of 7.2 percent in 2007/08. However, as well as contagion from the global financial crisis, the country is struggling with a fiscal deficit and popular discontent over inflation, which was running at 21.5 percent in urban areas in the year to September. Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said this month that the global downturn could impact the canal, as well as tourism and exports -- all important sources of foreign currency. Demand for Chinese consumer goods from Black Sea countries such as Russia and Turkey and from Europe for Asian cars were main drivers of canal use, said Mark Page, director of liner shipping at Drewry Shipping Consultants in London. The United States, the world's largest energy consumer, imported a record 738 billion cubic feet of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2007, much of it through the canal from Qatar, the world's largest LNG exporter. Surging global shipping costs have also been a boon for the waterway, discouraging shippers from taking longer routes. But the Baltic sea freight index, which tracks sea freight prices to haul commodities like coal, iron ore, cement and grains on some key routes, fell to its lowest level in more than five years this month on fears a recession would slow trade. The index had hit record highs in June. "The shipping industry has already started to see a slowdown and a fairly dramatic fall in freight rates," said Emily Comyn, spokeswoman at the International Chamber of Shipping in London. "Coupled with falling steel prices and the seeming reduction in Chinese demand for iron ore and coal, the industry in general can probably expect a significant slowdown in the coming months, and this will of course be reflected in Suez Canal transits." STORMY WATERS The canal is a source of Egyptian pride: the government nationalized it in 1956 and then defended it against coordinated attacks by Britain, France and Israel. Egyptian families love to visit Ismailia, which houses canal headquarters, to sit on shaded benches in parks lined with date palms and watch giant tankers pass by. The town's best hospitals and schools, as well as much of its land, is owned by the authority which manages the canal. Residents call it a state within a state. But the canal is also a source of controversy for a government that is friendly with the United States. The political opposition has demanded President Hosni Mubarak's government close it to US warships, especially during the Iraq war, and has tried to use that issue to rally public discontent with Egyptian foreign policy. In March, a cargo ship on contract with the US Navy shot at Egyptian merchants after they approached the ship, killing one and reopening the controversy. The threat of piracy also hangs over future growth. Just south of the canal, heavily armed Somali pirates have stepped up attacks, with one almost every day. Chatham House, the international affairs group, says piracy could drive some ships out of the Gulf of Aden, cutting canal traffic. Other factors will help offset slower trade. The canal has benefited from capacity problems at the Panama Canal, an alternative transit route between the United States and China. Waiting times at the Panama Canal, which is operating at near full capacity, jumped 56 percent in the second quarter of 2008 from the previous year, with ships averaging about 38 hours in the 50-mile (80-km) waterway. "Capacity problems have meant that some cargoes for the eastern United States have come around through the (Suez) canal and the Mediterranean," said Simon Kitchen, senior economist at EFG-Hermes. b
