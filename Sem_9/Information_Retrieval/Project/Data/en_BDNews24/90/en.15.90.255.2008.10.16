 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)The government has edged closer to finalising a comprehensive new traffic control policy for the capital, which is likely to include stricter parking laws and greater regulation of privately-run commuter buses. A home ministry meeting on Thursday, chaired by home adviser MA Matin, focused on elimination of traffic gridlock and development of traffic systems. Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, secretary of the roads and railway department, told a press briefing after the meeting that the traffic policy would be finalised within a month. "We are formulating a set of parking regulations. Those violating the new rules will face a fine," said Rahman. Home secretary Abdul Karim, mentioning various decisions of the meeting, told newsmen the ministry has marked 65 points where the worst traffic jams occur. Senior officials as well as traffic police have been posted in those hotspots during rush hours. Karim added that bus bays and bus stops as well as 259 parking points have been marked as potential traffic pile-up points. He said rules are also being formulated to park cars at an oblique angle instead of at right angles to the footpaths of Dhaka's major thoroughfares. The secretary said truck movement would also be banned in the city from 6:00am to 9:00pm, except for government holidays. "There are around one lakh cars in the city. Of them, around 15 percent do not have a license or are unfit vehicles," said the secretary. The ministry will establish mobile courts to remove unfit and unlicensed vehicles in addition to removing shops illegally set up in bus shelters. Karim said some 500 new large buses would be introduced in the city, to replace smaller-sized buses operated by private companies, thus reducing the overall number of buses. Some 138 bus routes in the capital were already being reduced to 40, he added. bdne
