 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com) The Awami League-led 14-party alliance has decided to expand its electoral partnership with other "democratic, non-communal and anti-war criminal parties", keeping the core alliance intact, party leaders said Thursday. The 14-party alliance leaders met Thursday evening for the first time, since the emergency, with just elections in mind. Chaired by acting AL chief Zillur Rahman at his Gulshan home, the meeting that lasted two and a half hours did not welcome Gano Forum led by Dr Kamal Hossain. "Today's meeting discussed the coming election and issue of strengthening the 14-party further. The 14-party is an ideology-based alliance. We will keep it intact at any cost," AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed told reporters after the meeting. "But we'll welcome any other party with democratic, non-communal and anti-war criminal credentials," the AL presidium member said. He said the meeting did not discuss seat distribution among the alliance partners for the Dec 18 parliament election. Tofail, echoing rival BNP leaders, urged the government to withdraw the state of emergency. "Free, fair and neutral election is not possible with the state of emergency in force. The emergency has to be withdrawn immediately." On uncertainty regarding the election, he said, "Election has to be held on Dec 18. If that doesn't happen, the country will face disastrous consequences." On Upazila polls immediately after the national election, he said, "It is not realistic. We want Upazila election at a realistic time." Replying to a question Tofail Ahmed said, "Gano Forum has not been invited to the meeting." Explaining why Gano Forum, a 14-party component, was not invited Tofail said, "There is some reservation (inside our party) about the party. We will take a decision later." Asked whether Jatiya Party is a democratic party, he said, "Ask them (JP)." Tofail condemned removal of a sculpture near the Airport and the meeting of the advisers with wanted Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid. Speaking at the press briefing, JSD president Hasanul Haque Inu demanded arrest of Mojahid. "This is unprecedented and unfortunate. The government has to prove its neutrality by arresting him." AL presidium members Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chodhury and Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Workers Party president Rashed Khan Menon, Ganotantri party leader Nurul Islam, coordinator of 11 party and Gano Azadi League president Haji Abdus Samad and NAP general secretary Enamul Haque were present. bdn
