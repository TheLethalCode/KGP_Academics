 COLOMBO, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN convoy carrying food and aid to more than 230,000 refugees in northern Sri Lanka was forced to turn back on Thursday due to artillery shelling and fighting, officials said. The convoy was only the second to enter the war zone since the government last month ordered most aid agencies out, saying it could not guarantee their safety. The 50-truck convoy had left Vavuniya, 250 km (155 miles) northeast of the capital Colombo, at noon carrying 750 metric tonnes of food to a growing number of people trapped by fighting between government forces and separatist Tamil Tiger rebels. "There was fighting close to the convoy and we decided to turn them back. Right now we are trying to get security assurances from both sides so we can start the process again tomorrow," UN spokesman Gordon Weiss in Colombo said. The clashes came as the vehicles passed Pullyankulam, where it was due to turn east toward refugee camps that aid workers and diplomats say are increasingly at risk of disease outbreaks with the onset of monsoon rains. Growing numbers of people in the last month have fled an intensified military drive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and are now trapped between rebels who will not let them leave and an army whose offer of safe passage they distrust. The army says it is 2 km (1 mile) outside of the LTTE's defacto capital of Kilinochchi, and is increasingly confident of defeating the separatist rebels and ending the 25-year-old war. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said a claymore mine attack and artillery rounds struck near the convoy. UN security officers on the convoy could not determine the source or exact type of weapons used, "but it was more than light arms fire," Weiss said. Nanayakkara blamed the rebels: "I think they didn't want these food items to be given to the civilians." The rebels could not be reached for comment. Sri Lanka routinely accuses the Tigers of hiding behind civilians and amplifying humanitarian crises to their military and propaganda benefit. Diplomats and aid workers say that is often the case, and that the government makes an effort to provide aid to its civilians through government agents who manage distribution. But it is often overwhelmed by the scale of the problems. This is the second aid convoy to enter the war zone in as many weeks. Both were allowed in after diplomats lobbied the government to make an exception to the aid ban because of the scale of the refugee crisis
