 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)Thousands die in Bangladesh every year of oral cancer, a disease doctors say can be prevented with little awareness among patients, who number nearly 200,000 annually. "These patients who lack awareness come to us at a stage when we cannot do anything about it. We watch them die, helplessly," said Prof Dr Mohiuddin Ahmed of Dhaka Dental College Hospital at a scientific seminar at LGED auditorium in city Friday. "Oral cancer is more common in the Indian subcontinent than in other parts of the world. This disease can be prevented with a little awareness. It starts on a small scale and later spreads." Bangladesh Oral Cancer Foundation (BOCF) organised the national conference and scientific seminar to increase awareness about the disease. Chaired by BOCF president Dr Rafique Ahmed Bhuiyan, National Prof MR Khan attended the conference as the chief guest. "Now oral cancer is a big problem. Of the total cancer patients in Bangladesh , 30 per cent suffer from oral cancer," said Prof MR Khan. "Bidi, cigarette, paan, jarda, tobacco leaf and gul are responsible for the disease. Increasing awareness is key to prevention." According to a WHO report, some 76 lakh people died of cancer in 2005 throughout the world. "If proper steps are not taken in the next 10 years 8.04 crore would die of oral cancer," Dr Tanjina Afrin Banna said in a presentation. The report also said 70 per cent of such cancer patients are in the poor and low income countries. "If treatment starts at early stage 40 per cent of cases can be cured." Earlier a colourful procession was brought out from the Central Shaheed Minar. Business leaders and senior journalists joined the procession that ended at the National Press Club.
