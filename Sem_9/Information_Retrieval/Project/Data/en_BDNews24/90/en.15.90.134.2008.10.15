 PREAH VIHEAR, Cambodia, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai and Cambodian troops fired rockets and small arms at each other on a disputed stretch of border on Wednesday, wounding at least six and prompting Bangkok to tell its citizens to get out of Cambodia. The clash comes against the backdrop of huge political instability in Bangkok, with protesters in a long-running street campaign urging the army to launch a coup against the elected government. Both Thailand and Cambodia accused each other of firing first in the clash, the most serious incident in four months of tension around the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, a stunning Hindu ruin sitting on an escarpment right on the border. A Reuters photographer on the Cambodian lines said one rocket flew over his head, forcing him to scurry for cover. Thailand said four of its soldiers were hurt and Cambodia said two of its soldiers were wounded in the exchange, which lasted for around 40 minutes. Cambodian forces had captured at least a dozen Thai soldiers, the official added, without giving more details. In Phnom Penh, Prime Minister Hun Sen huddled in an emergency meeting with government and military chiefs to determine a response to the fighting around the monument, a source of tension between the two southeast Asian nations for more than a century. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, a ruling that has rankled in Thailand ever since. However, it failed to determine ownership of 1.8 square miles (4.6 sq km) of scrub next to the ruins. This small parcel of land became highly politicized in July when the Thai anti-government movement adopted it as a cause, whipping up a torrent of nationalism. Within days, 2,000 soldiers were facing off only yards apart in trenches dug into a hillside that until 10 years ago was under the control of remnants of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot's guerrilla army. Thai Foreign Minister Sompong Amornvivat urged Thais in Cambodia to leave at once, mindful of the 2003 torching of the embassy and Thai businesses in Phnom Penh by a nationalist mob incensed by a row over Angkor Wat, another ancient temple. "Thai businessmen who have no need to be in Cambodia now, please rush back to Thailand," he told reporters, adding that the military had an evacuation plan ready if needed. In 2003, Thai commandos and military transport planes landed in the middle of the night at Phnom Penh airport to oversee the evacuation of 600 Thais during the riots. Security was beefed up outside the embassy on Wednesday, with 20 military police armed with assault rifles standing guard. ACCUSATIONS FLY As with other less serious clashes along the border in the past four months, each side accused the other of aggression. "I can confirm there was fighting between Cambodians and Thais. The Thais fired at us first," Preab Tan, governor of Cambodia's northern Preah Vihear province, told Reuters. Thailand's Foreign Ministry issued a flat denial. "We have confirmation of the shooting incident involving light firearms or RPG (rocket-propelled grenades). Thai troops insisted they did not start the incident, and we're following the prime minister's policy of exercising restraint," a spokesman said. On Monday, Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge soldier, accused a small group of Thai soldiers of an incursion, and threatened to turn the area into a "death zone" unless they withdrew by midday on Tuesday. The Thai stock market ended down 3.8 percent and traders said the border clash was partly responsible. A government adviser said on Wednesday Thailand risked sinking into recession in the first half of 2009 if its protracted political crisis did not end soon. Singapore and Indonesia have asked both sides to show restraint
