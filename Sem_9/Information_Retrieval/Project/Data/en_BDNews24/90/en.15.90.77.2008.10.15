 Dhaka, October 15 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the stays on proceedings of two graft cases against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, after the government withdrew its appeals filed against the High Court stays. A four-member Appellate Division bench, headed by justice MM Ruhul Amin, upheld the stays on the two graft cases involving installation of barge mounted power plants and a deal with Canadian oil-gas exploration firm Niko Resources Ltd. Attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed told the bench that the government filed two appeals with the Appellate Division against the HC stay orders, which were extended by three months on Aug 27. Since a hearing on Hasina's appeals to quash the cases in question are due before a HC bench, the government has decided to withdraw its appeals, Salahuddin said. The court resolved the issue on the motion that the appeals were not raised for hearing. Hasina's counsel barrister Rafique-ul-Huq told bdnews24.com: "The government withdrew the appeals it had submitted challenging the HC verdicts, so the HC can hear Hasina's appeals to cancel the cases." The HC deferred the hearing on Hasina's twin appeals on Tuesday, saying the matter was sub judice as long as the government appeals against the HC stay orders were filed with the Appellate Division. bdnews
