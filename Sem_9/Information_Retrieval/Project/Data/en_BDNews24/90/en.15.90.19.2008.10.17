 Chittagong, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) RAB members early Friday seized a light machine gun (LMG), a SLR and more than 100 bullets from the residence of an alleged gangster in Raujan area. But they could not arrest anyone during the raid on the house of Moslem Khan, who allegedly leads a gang styled "Moslem Bahini", in Kodolpur area. "Acting on a tip off, the RAB members encircled the residence of Raujan's notorious criminal Moslem Khan and recovered these weapons and bullets from the drain of the house," major Sheikh Ruhul Amin, RAB-7 deputy commander, told bdnews24.com Friday. The RAB team found two magazines of LMG along with 51 bullets and a SLR magazine with 66 bullets. The commander said Moslem was also involved in illegal arms smuggling. Major Amin said RAB-7 chief Lt Col Hasinur Rahman led the raid that began at around 3.00am. "They all fled the house," the RAB official said. He said the Rauzan area was home to three other groups led by by Azim Uddin Mahmud, Fazal Haq and Aziz, who also had some automatic weapons. RAB would continue such drive in future, said Amin. b
