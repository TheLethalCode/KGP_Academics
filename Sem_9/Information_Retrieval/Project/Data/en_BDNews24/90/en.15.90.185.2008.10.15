<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union will defer its polls observation mission until the government restores certain civil and political rights by relaxing or lifting the state of emergency, the European Commission's mission head in Dhaka said Wednesday. EC mission head Stefan Frowein told a meeting of the Diplomatic Correspondents' Association of Bangladesh at Lake Shore hotel in Gulshan that the EU did not in principle send polls observers to monitor elections held under a state of emergency. "We have problems with the state of emergency. Because, we have not ever in other country so far observed elections under the state of emergency. In principle, you cannot hold free and fair election under emergency. "Because, state of emergency takes away certain rights" Frowein said. He added that though the EU in principle could not observe elections under emergency, the state of emergency in Bangladesh was not like that of Pakistan. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that the caretaker government was still negotiating with the European Commission to send a EU observation mission to Bangladesh. The EC mission head said the EU was preparing an observer mission, but conditions should be met for their arrival. "We are looking for convincing restoration of civil and political freedoms. It does not mean the lifting of the state of emergency." "It can be relaxation that makes reference to the convincing restoration of the civil and political freedoms which means the right to gather, campaign and access to media." Commenting on the US position on sending polls observers under any situation, Frowein said: "If the US ambassador says, they will come anyway. I say we are not coming anyway. We are coming when conditions arrive". He mentioned that the foreign adviser met the EC commissioner for external relations Benita Ferrero-Waldner in New York on Sept 22, and assured her that the state of emergency would be relaxed for holding free and fair polls. He said the EC had asked the government to clarify the relaxation of the state of emergency. Frowein said the government would have to meet the EC's conditions by the end of October and early November to see EU observers. The mission head said the European Commission welcomed the present engagement between the parties and the government and the Election Commission. The European Commission's decision on dispatching election observation missions begins with an "exploratory" mission to weigh the political situation and judge whether an election-friendly atmosphere exists in the country. The EC's commissioner for external relations takes a final decision on the basis of a report made by the exploratory mission. The EC's exploratory mission came to Bangladesh on June 15 for 7 days, to meet with government officials, political leaders, officials of the Election Commission, journalists, civil society and NGO representatives. The exploratory mission submitted its report to the EC in August. bdnews
