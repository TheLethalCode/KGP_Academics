<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Progressive Democratic Party chief Ferdous Ahmed Quarishi on Saturday lashed out at the caretaker government for its meeting with Jamaat-e-Islami leader Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojahid, after he was named by police as 'fugitive' in the high-profile Barapukuria graft case. "The Fakhruddin-led caretaker government does not have any right to stay in power after this," Quarishi said at a press conference at the party headquarters in Segunbagicha. He asked the president to assign a new and efficient caretaker government that would be able to create a congenial atmosphere and hold the national election in three months. The activities of the present caretaker government are like a "strange political striptease" the PDP president said. "The government and the Election Commission are not keeping their words. Stepping back from promises one after another is really unfortunate," he said. PDP will observe a 'Referendum Day' on Oct 20 at district level and on Oct 21 at upazila level to garner support for holding referendums on national issues. The party will submit memorandums to the president through deputy commissioners and Upazila Nirbahi Officers on Oct 20, 21, 22. Quarishi also announced a national convention of the party on Oct 28. bd
