 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - Eight foreign milk powder brands, reported by at least one laboratory to be contaminated with melamine, are to be re-tested by two more local and one foreign laboratory, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed said Sunday. The government advised people to stay clear of the eight brands last week, after tests by a Dhaka University laboratory indicated the presence of the contaminant. A 12-member panel of experts has been formed to make recommendations as well as supervise and interpret the new test results, the commerce secretary told reporters following an inter-ministry meeting in the afternoon. The eight brands under scrutiny are Australian brands Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashili-1, Yashili-2 and Sweet Baby-2, and New Zealand's Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. "Three different reports were received from three laboratories regarding the presence of melamine in the milk powder of eight brands," the commerce secretary said. "The Dhaka University chemistry department laboratory reported melamine was detected in all eight brands." "The Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute and private laboratory Plasma Plus, however, said melamine was found only in the Yashili-1 brand," he said. Meanwhile, the milk powder companies themselves have claimed their products do not contain the potentially deadly contaminant. The secretary said the company that manufactures Nido brand milk products submitted to the government the results of tests performed in laboratories in India, Thailand and Singapore. Dano submitted test results conducted in a German laboratory, he added. "Under these circumstances, the government is unable to make any decision at the moment. This is why the expert committee has been formed," said Feroz Ahmed. "The committee has been asked to submit its recommendation to the government within the next seven working days. We will make a final decision based on their recommendations," the secretary said. The committee comprises two teachers from Dhaka University's chemistry department, three members of the Atomic Energy Commission and three members of the Bangladesh Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Also on the panel will be two representatives of BSTI, an employee of private lab Plasma Plus and a representative of the health ministry. bdnews24
