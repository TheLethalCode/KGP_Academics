 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - A European Union team will arrive in Bangladesh early next month to assess the pre-election situation of the country, European Commission mission chief Stefan Frowein said on Sunday. A core team will arrive at the beginning of November and a 12-member delegation will follow shortly after, Stefan told reporters after a meeting with commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. He said experts in law, democracy and election logistics would come to Bangladesh ahead of the national polls. The Euro mission chief also said the Bangladesh government would in addition have to take some initiatives for a free and fair election. The EU had earlier said it would not send any observers to Bangladesh if certain civil and political rights were not ensured ahead of the elections by relaxing or lifting the emergency. Asked if the EU had reconsidered its stand, Stefan said the decision to send observers would depend on reports of the situation assessment team. He stressed the need to ensure free voting and freedom of media. He hoped the government would take proper initiatives to hold the election in a free, fair and credible manner. Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said the government was trying hard to create a congenial atmosphere in the interests of the country and its people. "Nothing is being kept secret. Everyone can see what we are trying to do," the adviser said. bdnews
