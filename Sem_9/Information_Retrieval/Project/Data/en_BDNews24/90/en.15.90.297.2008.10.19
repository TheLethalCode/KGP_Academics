<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)- The Election Commission has filed a fresh appeal with the High Court to quash the stay order on a gazette of redrawing of Jatiya Sangsad constituencies, after the petition failed to come up for a final hearing on Sunday. Advocates Mahmudul Islam and Dr Shahdeen Malik filed the appeal on behalf of the EC with the High Court bench of Justice Mir Hashmat Ali and Justice Shamim Hasnain. The appeal has been included in the cause list of the court for hearing on Monday, the lawyers said. A final hearing on the writ petition challenging the gazette, on which the stay order was given, was scheduled to be heard Sunday. But, an EC lawyer said, the case was near the bottom of the cause list. The EC's lawyer Shahdeen Malik told bdnews24.com, "The writ petition challenging the legality of the gazette re-demarcation the JS constituencies was included in serial no 176 for Sunday." "With that serial number, the hearing of the writ petition is not likely to be held soon." "We therefore appealed again on behalf of the Election Commission for quashment of the order staying the effectiveness of the gazette. The appeal should be included in the court's cause list for Monday." The stay order on the gazette is effective up to Nov 6, but the EC has said it will announce the schedule for parliamentary polls by Nov 2. bdnew
