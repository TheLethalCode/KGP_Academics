"It seemed like there were 15 of them against 11 of us. We thought they would get tired in the second half but they kept going very well.

"We missed him and without Riquelme we couldn't play the way we always play," said Basile. He denied that the game had been a personal battle against Chile coach Marcelo Bielsa, who was in charge of Argentina from 1998 to 2004. "They have a great coach," said Basile.
