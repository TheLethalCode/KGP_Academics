 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League Thursday told visiting UK foreign office minister Lord Mark Malloch Brown that party chief Sheikh Hasina must be fully released and allowed to take part in the upcoming polls. The party also said the courts would decide whether any of its leaders convicted on corruption charges could take part in the Dec 18 general election. Presidium members Abdur Razzaq, Tofail Ahmed and Matia Chowdhury and former diplomat Faruque Ahmed Chowdhury met the British minister for Asia, Africa and the United Nations at the British High Commission. "We briefed the minister about the country's suffocating condition. We have not accused anyone," Matia Chowdhury told bdnews24.com after the meeting. "We asked him why Sheikh Hasina should be banned from participating in the elections as the case against her is false," said Matia. At a press conference in the afternoon, Brown told reporters that there was no legal basis for placing restrictions on Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to contest the general elections. "The minister asked us whether we would give nominations to those persons convicted of corruption charges. But Abdur Razzaq replied that the issue would be decided by the court," said Matia. The British minister stated those convicted of corruption should in no way be allowed to contest the parliamentary polls. "The Awami League wants the state of emergency to be lifted for a meaning poll. We reiterated the same," said the former agriculture minister. "Owing to the state of emergency, Bangladesh lost membership of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association," Matia quoted Tofail Ahmed as telling the British minister. She said Brown praised the AL for its decision register with the election commission. bd
