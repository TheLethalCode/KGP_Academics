 NEW YORK/BRUSSELS, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European leaders pressed on Wednesday for an overhaul of global financial structures, building on trillion-dollar bank bailouts announced this week, as signs of global recession mounted. The United States reported its biggest monthly decline in retail sales in more than three years, along with other negative economic data, and markets around the world fell. EU leaders called for financial reforms as they arrived in Brussels for a meeting, after committing 2.2 trillion euros ($3 trillion) this week to rescue European banks and break a logjam in money markets that has choked off lending, in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The US government followed with similarly radical action to stem the crisis, which began with a US housing market collapse and now threatens economies worldwide. "The IMF has got to be rebuilt as 'fit for purpose' for the modern world. We need an early warning system for the global economy," British Prime Minister Gordon Brown told reporters in Brussels. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also told her parliament that new international financial rules were needed with the International Monetary Fund taking on a bigger supervisory role. The United States on Tuesday offered to take up to $250 billion worth of equity in its banks, an astonishing move in the home of free market capitalism. President George W. Bush stressed that the move was temporary. "I'm confident in the long run this economy will come back," he told reporters before a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was scheduled to give a speech at 12:15 p.m. RECESSION THREAT Even if a banking sector collapse has been averted, a recession has not, a fact markets seized upon. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3 percent and the S&P 500 index was down 3.5 percent. US bank JPMorgan Chase said third-quarter profit plunged 84 percent, while Wells Fargo reported a drop in earnings of 25 percent. Coca-Cola said quarterly profit rose as strong international demand offset falling volume at home. European shares shed 4 percent. Oil fell more than $3 toward $75 a barrel. In addition to a 1.2 percent drop in September retail sales in the United States, wholesale prices dropped 0.4 percent and manufacturing in New York state fell in October. British unemployment rose the most in 17 years in the three months to August as the jobless rate increased to 5.7 percent, its highest level in eight years, official data showed. German economic growth will only be slightly above zero in 2009, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said. And two U.S. Federal Reserve officials noted risks to the world's biggest economy. World governments have pledged about $3.2 trillion to shore up banks and revive bank-to-bank lending -- that on top of open-ended central bank commitments to inject funds into money markets and a coordinated round of interest rate cuts last week. Lending rates fell, but traders said there was no real evidence of lending between banks for anything but short periods, even with so much central bank cash on offer. In London, Libor interbank rates for overnight dollar deposits fell to 2.14375 percent from 2.18125 on Tuesday. Three-month dollar rates dropped to 4.550 percent from 4.635. Southeast Asian nations, backed by $10 billion from the World Bank, were the latest to join the rescue effort, agreeing to create a multibillion fund to help banks. The fund will buy up toxic debt and support banks in the region, Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said. Iceland, driven close to bankruptcy as frozen credit markets caused its banks to fail, cut interest rates by a staggering 3.5 percentage points as its officials pursued efforts to get help from Russia via a multibillion-euro loan. NEW BRETTON WOODS The economy is dominating the US presidential campaign, which sees a final debate between the candidates on Wednesday. Democrat Barack Obama has accused Republicans of presiding over unfettered financial deregulation while John McCain has sought to regain his footing on economic issues after drawing criticism for saying US fundamentals were strong. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Britain's Brown say post-World War II financial architecture is no longer adequate. As current European Union President, Sarkozy will seek the backing of the other 26 EU states to hold an international conference as early as next month on reforming the world financial order put in place by the 1944 Bretton Woods conference. Brown is also advocating a "new Bretton Woods." Measures could entail a rethinking of supervisory rules on markets, banks, mortgage firms, hedge funds and private equity. The European Commission will also propose higher guarantees for bank deposits and guidelines on executive pay
