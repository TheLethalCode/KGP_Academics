<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh and New Zealand will be banking on their spinners when the sides square off in the Test series opener in Chittagong Friday. Both sides have declared their starting line-ups. The Tigers have pinned their hopes on specialist left-arm spinners Abdur Razzak and Shakib Al Hasan, alongside spinning all-rounders Mehrab Hossain Jr and uncapped Nayeem Islam. Meanwhile, the Kiwis have added off-spinner Jeetan Patel and left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori to their winning squad. "We expect the wicket to be slow. If it behaves accordingly, our spinners will play a decisive role in the match," said Mohammad Ashraful. Mehrab has previously played only one Test, while off-spinner Nayeem will make his debut following a successful ODI series. New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori was full of confidence on the eve of the game, saying he had faith in his spin department. "Our spin options are well covered, and if we play on the same pitch we played the last ODI, it will be slow," said Vettori. "We know spinners would bowl more overs in such conditions, so Jeetan and I will be ready," said the left-arm spinner, who took 12 wickets against Bangladesh in the last Test in Chittagong in 2004. Vettori ruled out any concern over not playing in the subcontinent for some time. "We have played a lot of ODIs, but not a test in the subcontinent for four years. But that is not a concern," he said. Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons, however, said New Zealand might face some problems, which Bangladesh could exploit. New Zealand came from behind to clinch the ODI series 2-1, and Vettori warned the hosts that his side remained hard to beat. "If we can play to just 50 percent of our ability we should not have a problem in winning this test series," he said. Bangladesh have been out of Test matches for seven months, although Ashraful said it would not hamper their performance as most of his boys were still involved in the longer version of the game. "It's true, we did not play Test matches for the last seven months, but eight players of the Test squad played longer version matches for the Academy team and the A team," said Ashraful. The Bangladesh captain said they were focusing on their own game, ahead of the match. Bangladesh - Mohammad Ashraful (capt), Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Zunaed Siddique, Rajin Saleh, Mehrab Hossain, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain.
