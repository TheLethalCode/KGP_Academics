The judge took seat at 10.45 am and told the chief of the lawyers' panel, Syed Rezaur Rahman: "I have prepared a written charge sheet against the accused persons. I am now reading it out before you. If both sides have anything to say in this regard I will give time for hearing however many days it takes." Syed Rezaur Rahman replied: "We are not yet prepared for the hearing on charge-framing.
