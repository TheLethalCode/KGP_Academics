 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) Dr Kamal Hossain Friday launched into yet another tirade against the current caretakers, calling one of them, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, a "mini Kissinger." "One of the advisers of Mr Fakhruddin is 'Mini Kissinger'. He is the commerce adviser. What have you done for commerce?" the president of Gano Forum said, speaking to reporters at his Bailey Road home in the capital. "There is so much to be done to increase exports. Instead, he is busy haggling with the political parties. But there is no post of 'mini Kissinger' in our country." Henry Kissinger is a former US secretary of state, who served the Nixon administration in the 1970s and was known for his diplomatic skills. The former law and foreign minister advised Hossain Zillur to focus on developing trade and commerce in the country. Dr Kamal also shot salvos at law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, whom he advised not to assist the 'mini Kissinger'. "In only 100 to 150 working minutes, 206 of the accused got bail. This cannot be the way of doing the legal business. We have been demanding investigation into this." On prospective polls partners, the Gano Forum president said Jatiya Party chairman HM "Ershad and religious conservatives cannot join" the 14-party alliance. "Those who have flaws in their party constitution and questionable past cannot be part of the 23-point programme," he said. "The 23-point programme belongs to people. It calls for a non-communal and democratic society." Referring to Ershad, he said: "Is it rational to bring him into the alliance just because he can get you a few seats?" The Awami League-led 14-party alliance announced the 23-point programme from a rally at Paltan maidan on Nov 22, 2005. Gano Forum, a component of the 14-party combine, was not however invited to an alliance meeting as recently as Thursday. A top AL leader said Dr Hossain's party was not asked to join because of "reservations within the party" about the former AL presidium member.
