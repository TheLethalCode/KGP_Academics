 MOHALI, India, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sachin Tendulkar eclipsed Brian Lara's world record for most test runs on Friday to help India reach 311 for five on the first day of the second test against Australia. Tendulkar reached the milestone on 15, surpassing the 11,953 runs Lara scored before he retired from international cricket in 2007. Tendulkar hit 88 after Australian left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson led a splendid fightback on a good batting pitch. India, who began well after winning the toss, wobbled after Johnson's double strike before tea saw three wickets tumble for 17 runs. Tendulkar added 142 runs for the fifth wicket with Saurav Ganguly until he fell short of his 40th test hundred. Ganguly was 54 not out at stumps with Ishant Sharma on two. Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir scored 67 and added 70 runs with Virender Sehwag (35) for the first wicket and 76 with Rahul Dravid (39) for the next. Johnson ended the day with three for 68. The first match of the four-test series ended in a draw
