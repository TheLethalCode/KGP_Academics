<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) A four-member BNP delegation met the visiting British minister Lord Mark Malloch Brown at the British high commission Wednesday afternoon. The delegation, led by its secretary general Khandakar Dewlar Hossain, discussed polls-related issues with the visiting minister. "We have discussed the political issues especially holding of the next general elections," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, who was a member of the delegation, told bdnews24.com. Former foreign secretary Shamsher Mobin Chowdhury and the party's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were the other two in the team. The British high commissioner, Stephen Evans, was also present at the meeting. The BNP and the UK foreign office minister for Asia, Africa and the United Nations, have had contrasting views on holding of the next parliamentary polls under the state of emergency. The BNP has already demanded complete withdrawal of the state of emergency as a pre-condition for BNP's participation in the upcoming general elections. Lord Brown, after his meeting with the foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Wednesday, told journalists that the election could be held under a "relaxed state of emergency". The minister, who came to Dhaka Wednesday on a two-day visit, is scheduled to have a similar meeting with the Awami League leaders Thursday.
