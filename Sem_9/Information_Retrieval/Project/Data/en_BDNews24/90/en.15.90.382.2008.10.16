 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)In a historic departure from past procedure in Bangladesh, the newly formed Supreme Judicial Commission was set to name judges for the higher courts on Thursday. The nine-member SJC, headed by the chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, was meeting for the first time to appoint the judges to the Appellate Division and the High Court after scrutiny of nominations and recommendations. Sitting in two afternoon sessions starting 2:30 pm in the Supreme Court judges' lounge, the SJC will address judges' recruitment to the upper courts in the two separate sessions. The move to recruit more judges to the Supreme Court comes in a bid to clear the huge backlog of cases pending disposal. The Appellate Division at present has only five judges; the High Court has 61. The appointment of upper court judges has long been the preserve of the executive, with the head of state rubberstamping nominations from the prime minister. The current caretaker government moved quickly to complete the formalities to create the commission, a longstanding demand from the Bar and the public. "Recruitment of upper court judges through the SJC will allay the controversies raised in the past over such appointments," Barrister Shafique Ahmed said of the commission's role. "The chief justice will propose the names and we'll discuss in as much detail as possible. We don't know yet how many judges will be recruited this time," he added. The nominees for the judge's appointments included: barrister Kamal Ul Alam, Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Azizul Huq, former registrar of the Supreme Court Iqtedar Ahmed, former additional attorney general Hassan Faiz Siddiqui, deputy attorney general Dr Naeema Haider, Mohammad Ali Akand, Mubina Asaf, advocate Deen Mohammad Rana, Obaidul Hassan Shaheen and Tamizuddin. Two senior High Court judges may also be appointed to the Appellate Division. The most senior HC judge should automatically be elevated to the Appellate Division, but the tradition has been breached on several occasions in the past. The most senior incumbent HC judge is Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman. Justices Md Abdul Kuddus, Md Abdul Aziz, BK Das and ABM Khairul Haque follow him in seniority. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin heads the Supreme Judicial Commission, with members law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, three senior Appellate Division judges Md Fazlul Karim, Tafazzal Islam and Jainul Abedin, High Court senior judges Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Md Abdul Kuddus, attorney general Salauddin Ahmed and Supreme Court Bar Association president barrister Shafique Ahmed. bdnews24.
