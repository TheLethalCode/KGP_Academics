 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Thursday granted six months' bail to former state minister Lutfozzaman Babar in an arms case, in which he was sentenced to 17 years in prison. The bench of justices Tariqul Hakim and Sheikh Abdul Awal awarded him the bail on medical grounds. A Dhaka special judge's court sentenced Babar to 17 years on Oct 30 for illegal possession of a firearm. Babar appealed to the High Court on Nov 27, challenging the verdict against him. Former state minister for home during the BNP-led alliance government, Babar was arrested on May 28 last year. bdnew
