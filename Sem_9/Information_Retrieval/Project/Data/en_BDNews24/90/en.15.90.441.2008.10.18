 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)A leading exporters' group has blasted the government for taking "no initiative" to face the likely crisis that could stem from the current global economic recession. "Though we, the exporters, are very much worried, no preparation to face the crisis is visible," Fazlul Hoque, president of Bangladesh Knitwear Manufactures and Exporters Association or BKMEA, said Saturday. Hoque warned of "inevitable crisis" for Bangladesh if the ongoing global recession prolonged. "A meeting has been called which will be presided over by a joint secretary of the commerce ministry. It proves that the government is not attaching due importance to the matter," the BKMEA president said. "The negative impacts of the economic downturn have already been felt in our knitwear export sector," he said. "Knitwear export orders dropped by about 10 percent over the last one to one and a half months," Hoque said at a press conference ahead of the Knit Exposition 2008. He cautioned the country's export trade would take a direct hit from the economic recession if the depression lingered. The Knit Exposition 2008 will be held at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel from October 20 to 22. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to open the exposition on Oct 20. "Some advisers are saying that a new prospect will open up for Bangladesh's export trade due to the crisis in world economy. But their assumption is not right," said Hoque. "In view of the stiff competition in the world market, the government and the exporters must formulate a coordinated plan just to try to hold on to the present trend of export. "Otherwise we will face major losses." He asked the commerce adviser to call a high-level meeting urgently to discuss the overall situation and to devise a strategy. The BKMEA president advised not to increase the prices of gas and electricity for next six months. "If the gas and electricity prices are hiked production cost will go up," he said. He also stressed diversification of export goods and efforts to find out new markets. This year, he said, the Knit Exposition will focus on Japan, a US$ 9 billion knitwear market. China provides 97 percent of Japan's knit imports. Bangladesh exports a meager US$ 6 million worth of knit products to the world's second largest economy. "We want to expand our presence in Japanese market," Fazlul Hoque said, "and at least 10 big buyers from Japan will participate in the fair." There will be 56 stallsof which only two are from foreign exporters. Buyers from 10 countries including the USA, Canada, Brazil, Spain and Germany will visit the fair, BKMEA leaders said. bdnews2
