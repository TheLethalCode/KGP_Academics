 PARIS, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Fabio Grosso saved leaders Olympique Lyon from a second consecutive Ligue 1 defeat with a late equaliser in a 2-2 home draw with Lille in Ligue 1 on Saturday. The seven times French champions, who had lost 3-0 at Stade Rennes in their previous league outing, trailed 2-1 with 13 minutes left when Italy fullback Grosso, returning after a rib injury, volleyed home from a corner. Defender Adil Rami had headed Lyon coach Claude Puel's former side Lille in front after 14 minutes. An own goal by Lille midfielder Aurelien Chedjou brought Lyon level when he deflected a Juninho free kick into the net 10 minutes later but Brazilian midfielder Michel Bastos then put the visitors back in front with a 63rd minute freekick. Lyon, chasing an eighth consecutive title, have 20 points from nine games. Girondins Bordeaux climbed to second, three points off the pace, by beating surprise package Toulouse 2-1 with France playmaker Yoann Gourcuff scoring one goal and setting up the the other. Gourcuff, who joined Bordeaux on loan from AC Milan during the close season, put the home side ahead with a splendid goal after 29 minutes before feeding forward David Bellion for Bordeaux's second five minutes from the break. The gifted 22-year-old's goal was a masterpiece, Gourcuff setting himself up with a backheel flip before twisting through two defenders to beat keeper Cedric Carrasso from close range. Bordeaux, last season's runners-up, have 17 points like Toulouse, who pulled a goal back in added time through midfielder Etienne Capoue and drop a place to third on goal difference. There was plenty of action at Parc des Princes, where Paris St Germain twice fought back from a goal down to beat Lorient 3-2 with a late header by substitute forward Loris Arnaud. The team from the capital, who narrowly escaped relegation last season, climb three spots to eighth in the 20-strong table. Olympique Marseille, in fourth place four points off the pace, will move up to second spot with a win at struggling Valenciennes on Sunda
