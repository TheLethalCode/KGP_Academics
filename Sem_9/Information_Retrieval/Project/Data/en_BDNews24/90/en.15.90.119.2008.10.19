<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, facing an arrest warrant in the Barapukuria graft case, appeared at the High Court Sunday for a bail hearing with a tight police cordon secured around the court premises. His lawyers appealed to the High Court for bail earlier in the day in the high-profile case. Mojaheed's lawyer barrister Abdur Razzak placed the appeal to the HC bench of justices Mohammad Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub. Barrister Razzak told the court at the time his client could not appear in before the bench as police "had surrounded his home". "The hearing on the bail appeal might take place this afternoon," he later told bdnews24.com. Security measures were heightened in and around the High Court premises as lawyers submitted the bail appeal, with law enforcers checking all vehicles on entry while huge numbers of Jamaat and Shibir activists thronged the area. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on Oct 5 accusing 16 people in the case, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former ministers of her government. The court issued arrest warrant against several accused the following day, including Mojaheed. The commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of incurring losses of Tk 158.71 core to the state due to an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). bdnew
