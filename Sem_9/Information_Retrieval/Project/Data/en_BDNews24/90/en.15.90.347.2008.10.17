<TITLE> Cambodian PM says Thai border clash won't get worse </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PHNOM PENH Fri Oct 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday this week's border clashes with Thailand around the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple would not escalate into a more serious, wider conflict. "People should understand that there won't be any large-scale war taking place," he told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting, adding that people living near the border need not worry. Thai and Cambodian army commanders ended five hours of talks on Thursday with no agreement to withdraw their forces after heavy fighting near a disputed 900-year old temple left two Cambodian soldiers dead. But agreed on joint border patrols to ease tensions after Wednesday's 40-minute gun and rocket battle, the worst clash in years between the historic enemies. The Hindu temple has stirred nationalist passions in both countries for generations, but officials on both sides have toned down their rhetoric since the fighting on Wednesday. "Our policy to resolve this conflict is through negotiations," Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat told reporters in Bangkok. "We need to defend our land. We must not lose to the Thais," said security guard Bun Roeun, 36, flicking through newspaper reports of the clashes. "If the Thais continue their attempt to cross our border, I am ready to join the army to fight back." The confrontation comes amid great political instability and an economic slowdown in Thailand, as protesters in a long-running Bangkok street campaign urge the army to launch a coup against the elected government. "It's hard to see how Cambodia gains from starting a war with Thailand at this point," said Tony Kevin, a former Australian ambassador to Phnom Penh. "But if you look at the very tense and riven state of Thai politics, it's easy to see how a Cambodian war could be of interest as a distraction," he said. China and the United States expressed concern over the violence and urged both sides to use restraint. DECADES-OLD DISPUTE Preah Vihear, or Khao Phra Viharn, as the Thais call it, sits on a jungle-clad escarpment overlooking northern Cambodia but has been accessible mainly only from Thailand. The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962, a ruling that has rankled Thais ever since. The court failed to determine the ownership of 1.8 square miles (4.6 sq km) of scrub next to the stunning but remote Hindu ruins, which have been off-limits to tourists for months. The dispute over this small parcel of land became highly politicized in Thailand in July when protesters trying to overthrow the Bangkok government adopted it as a cause. Bangkok has urged its citizens to leave Cambodia, mindful of the 2003 torching of its embassy and Thai businesses in Phnom Penh by a nationalist mob incensed by a row over Angkor Wat, another ancient temple. In 2003, Thai commandos flew into Phnom Penh airport in the middle of the night to help evacuate 600 Thais during the riots. Security was beefed up outside the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh, but there were no crowds outside and it was operating as normal, a Thai official told Reuters. Several big Thai companies have operations in Cambodia and some have pulled out Thai nationals, but they said operations were normal. Thailand's political crisis has damaged consumer confidence and consumption at a time when exports are sluggish due to the global economic slowdown
