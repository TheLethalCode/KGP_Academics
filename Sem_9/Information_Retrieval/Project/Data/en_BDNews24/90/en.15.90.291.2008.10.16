<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Tests in a Dhaka University laboratory have found contaminant melamine in the milk powders of eight overseas brands being sold in Bangladesh, a senior BSTI official said on Thursday. The laboratory of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution and a private laboratory called Plasma Plus also tested the milk powder of all the eight brands but they found melamine in only one brand, Yashili-1 milk formula, BSTI director general Md Azmal Hossain told bdnews24.com. The other seven brands in question were: Diploma, Red Cow, Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2, Nestle's Nido Fortified Instant and New Zealand brand Anlene. Azmal Hossain said results of the tests at three laboratories were sent to the ministry of commerce and a number of recommendations were made in line with the tests results. The BSTI DG said: "So far milk powder of 36 brands has been collected from markets for testing. Tests of 15 brands, including these eight, have already been completed." "It is not mandatory for BSTI to test powder milk imported for consumption by adults," he added. "BSTI tests powder milk for consumption by children from 0 to 10 years." Azmal Hossain said they sent a proposal to the government so that all milk powder was tested in the BSTI laboratory. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the ministry received a number of recommendations from the BSTI. He said a coordination committee comprising experts on the matter would be formed by Sunday to take a decision in this regard. He said a final decision would be taken by next week on the basis of the recommendations of the coordination committee. In reply to a question as to whether the imported milk powders are tested before marketing, and whether the brands in which tested positive for melamine have have been banned for sale, the secretary said: "The issue of contamination by melamine was not known to us in the past." "After the recent discovery of melamine in milk powder in China, testing the products became urgent." He said, so far no brand has been banned and no company has been asked to withdraw milk powder from the market on the basis of test findings. The meeting on Sunday is likely to discuss these issues. The melamine milk powder scare, originating in China, has spread panic worldwide over the past month as more than 60,000 babies fell ill in China after drinking milk of two local brands. Four infants died. bdnews24.com
