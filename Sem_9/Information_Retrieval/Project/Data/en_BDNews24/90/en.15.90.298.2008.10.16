 MUMBAI, Thu Oct 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's central bank said it was too early to say if more steps were needed to ease cash conditions in its strained financial markets, after freeing up 1 trillion rupees ($20.5 billion) of funds in a series of measures. Indian shares and the rupee, which tumbled steeply in early trade as investors across Asia sold on growing concerns of global recession, pulled out of their troughs as European markets pared losses and futures pointed to a positive start on Wall Street. Cash and bond markets reacted positively after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) slashed 100 basis points off banks' reserve requirements to 6.5 percent on Wednesday, hot on the heels of a 150 basis point cut on Saturday to release funds into the system. Authorities pledged a host of other measures to get credit flowing, and the overnight interbank interest rate fell to 6.90/7.10 percent, between the central bank's short-term borrowing rate of 6 percent and 9 percent lending rate, having hit 23 percent last week. "As I said several times before, we are monitoring the situation on a continuous basis," RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao said after a board meeting in Goa. "We will continue to monitor the situation and as of now everything is under control." The 30-share index pulled back from a two-year low and losses of more than 7 percent to end down 2.1 percent. The rupee has suffered as foreigners have pulled a net $11.1 billion from shares this year, helping push the index down 48 percent this year, with the currency hitting a record low of 49.30 per dollar last week. Dealers said state-run banks sold dollars, probably on behalf of the central bank, to halt the rupee's slide, helping it from a low of 49.05 back to 48.82 to stand down 0.6 percent on the day. Wednesday's cash reserve cut came alongside a pledge by authorities to disburse 250 billion rupees to banks for a farm debt waiver scheme, a hike in the amount foreign investors can invest in corporate bonds and other measures to attract funds from overseas and ease selling pressure on the rupee. LAYOFFS But in signs that India's once-booming economy was also seeing signs of strain, the oil secretary said local airlines were defaulting on jet fuel payments. The country's top private carrier, Jet Airways, has also said it is laying off nearly 2,000 workers as high fuel prices and the global financial crisis take their toll, and analysts warned the stock market may see more turbulence. "There is still ample downside left in the Indian market and investors should trade cautiously even if there is a pullback," said V.K. Sharma, head of research at Anagram Stock Broking. Indian policy makers have said they expect Asia's third-largest economy to avoid the worst of the turmoil suffered in developed economies and markets, and still see growth of about 8 percent this year after 9 percent in fiscal 2007/08. Managing liquidity has topped their short-term priority list as the sharp cash squeeze spread from financial turmoil overseas. But Suresh Tendulkar, the head of the prime minister's economic advisory council, told Reuters policy could now be focused towards growth after annual inflation, which hit 12.9 percent in August, appeared to be easing. Data showed wholesale price inflation, the most widely watched measure, slowed to an annual rate of 11.44 percent on Oct. 4 from 11.80 percent the previous week. The rate was the lowest since late May, as aggressive rate hikes and falling oil prices took effect, helped by easing commodity and manufactured product prices. The rate was lower than expected and helped keep the 10-year government bond yield down 20 basis points on the day at 7.71 percent, with the market also benefiting from the greater supply of cash in the system stemming from the cash reserve cut. The RBI meets next week to review rates. Some economists said it still might be too soon to lower the key repo lending rate while inflation remains in double digits, but others say the chance of a rate cut on or before Oct. 24 is rising
