<TITLE> Canada's PM faces market crisis as minority govt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 OTTAWA, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A re-elected Canadian prime minister found himself back at square one on Wednesday, facing a potentially fractious Parliament as he tries to steer the economy through the global financial crisis. Conservative leader Stephen Harper won a renewed mandate on Tuesday but fell short of a coveted majority government, gaining a stronger minority. He will need the support of at least one of the three opposition parties to govern. "The fact that Mr Harper was restricted to another minority government, albeit a marginally stronger one, means that this campaign can only be viewed as a personal defeat," said an editorial in the influential Globe and Mail newspaper, which had endorsed Harper before the vote. Other pundits bet that Harper and his chief opponent, Liberal leader Stephane Dion, would be forced to make a rare show of unity on economic issues as the U.S. financial crisis spreads north. "The House of Commons might look pretty much the same as it looked five weeks ago, but the world certainly doesn't," wrote the Montreal Gazette, referring to the credit woes. Harper is returning to Ottawa on Thursday and is expected to swear in his cabinet soon after attending a Francophonie summit in Quebec on the weekend. He recognized the seriousness of the economic challenges when he made his acceptance speech late Tuesday. "This is a time for us all to put aside political differences and partisan considerations and to work cooperatively for the benefit of Canada," Harper, 49, told a victory celebration in his home town of Calgary late Tuesday. "We stretch out a hand to all members of all parties asking them to join together to protect our economy and to weather this world financial crisis." One of the first orders of business for Harper might be to offer public money to guarantee borrowing between banks, analysts said. Harper had run on providing a steady economic hand but was sideswiped by severe market volatility toward the end of his campaign as the Liberals accused him of having no plan for tackling the crisis. "Near-term, the House will probably act in unison on defense economics, while big plans by the Conservatives will likely be shelved rather than force a non-confidence vote and another election," said Andrew Pyle, wealth advisor at ScotiaMcLeod. Markets were not expected to react strongly to the election results, with economists suggesting the outcome was marginally positive for the Canadian dollar. After conceding defeat, Dion said the Liberals would cooperate at least for now. "We stand ready to work with all political parties to make this Parliament work, because we have serious work to do," Dion said. Under Dion, the Liberals kept the Conservatives in power over the past year by refusing to vote against him in Parliament. The Liberals are likely to start looking for a replacement for Dion, who led them to their worst electoral showing in terms of seats since 1984 and their lowest percentage of the vote since the 1860s. Provisional results showed Harper's party rose to 143 seats from the 127 they held before the election while the Liberals dropped to 76 from 95. The separatist Bloc Quebecois rose two to 50 seats, the leftist New Democrats jumped seven to 37 and two independents were elected. In percentage terms, the Conservatives won about 37 percent of the vote against 27 percent for the Liberals
