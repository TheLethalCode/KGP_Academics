<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)The Bijoy Sarani link-road is still on track to be opened to the public on Dec 16, a senior government official said Thursday. A housing and public works ministry meeting discussed progress on the extension of the Bijoy Sarani link-road, focusing on problems relating to the dismantling of Rangs Bhaban. ASM Rashidul Hye, the public works secretary, told reporters following the meeting that the extended portion of road, due to be built over the dismantled Rangs Bhaban, would be opened on Dec 16. Hye said the high-rise building was now almost completely dismantled, although the job had taken time due to the risky nature of the work. Hye said construction of the road had also been delayed for four months due to legal wrangling over the controversial high-rise, although it had now resumed following a favourable court ruling. "The new road requires 70 feet out of around 150 feet occupied by the building," said the secretary. "Constructing four lanes, with five-foot wide footpaths on either side, will only possible by freeing up at least half the land of the building," he said. The secretary said total costs for the road, including compensation for the owners of Rangs Bhaban and other buildings, would come to Tk 130 crore. "The government is obliged to compensate the owners of Rangs Bhaban alone up to Tk 17-18 crore," he said. "This amount has been handed over to the deputy commissioner. The building's owners have in the past sold different parts of the building to other parties." "After documentation of ownership is established, the compensation money will be duly distributed," said Hye. bdne
