 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission is making moves to revive a number of high-profile graft cases, a lawyer said on Wednesday. ACC lawyer Advocate Anisul Huq said the anti-graft body had petitioned the High Court bench of Justice Anwarul Haque and Justice Farah Mahbub for final hearings of appeals to cancel some 10 separate corruption cases. Among the accused 'VIPs' in the cases are former BNP lawmakers Salauddin Quader Chowdhury, Lutfozzaman Babar, Nasir Uddin Ahmed Pintu, Salauddin Ahmed and Ruhul Quddus Talukder Dulu, former AL lawmaker Salman F Rahman and former bureaucrat ANH Akhter Hossain. "Initiatives have been taken to revive the cases that have been halted by stay orders," the lawyer told reporters in his office on the court premises. The cases were included in the HC bench's cause list, Anisul Huq said. bdnew
