<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday as strong international demand offset falling volume at home, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent. The world's largest soft drink maker said net income for the third quarter ended on September 26 rose to $1.89 billion, or 81 cents per share, from $1.65 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 83 cents, topping the analysts' average forecast of 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.39 billion as sales by volume increased 5 percent. Volume fell 2 percent in North America, but rose 7 percent internationally. Coke said it was on track for its productivity initiatives to deliver $400 million to $500 million in annual savings by the end of 2011. The results from Atlanta-based Coke come a day after its biggest rival, PepsiCo Inc, posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on weak beverage sales and cut its full-year outlook because of a recent surge in the value of the US dollar. In trading before the market opened, Coke shares were up 5.8 percent at $46.25
