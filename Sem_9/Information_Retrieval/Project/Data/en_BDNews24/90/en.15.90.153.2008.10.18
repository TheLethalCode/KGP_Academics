 LOS ANGELES, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie intends to keep up her nomadic, Earth-wandering lifestyle alongside partner Brad Pitt, with all six of her children in tow, and hinted in a TV interview that they may adopt a seventh. Jolie, who in July gave birth in France to twins, a girl named Vivienne Marcheline and a boy named Knox Leon, said during an appearance on NBC's morning news show "Today" that she sees no reason to slow down despite her growing brood. "One day (the children) are probably going to want to stay in one place for a very long time as they get certain friends," she told "Today" co-host Matt Lauer Thursday in an interview to promote her new film, the period drama "Changeling." "But, you know, so far we've just moved them a lot, and they like moving. They like packing their bag before the next adventure, and they like making new friends wherever we go," Jolie said. "And I think part of it, we'd like to maintain that," the 33-year-old actress said. "We'd like them to be those kind of adults where they can find home wherever they are in the world and they can find friends wherever they are in the world." In addition to the twins, Jolie and Pitt are parents to four other young children -- adoptees Maddox, Pax and Zahara, and their first biological daughter, Shiloh. Responding to questions from Lauer, Jolie said she and Pitt were considering adopting still more. "It depends," she said. "I mean it's important ... you can't adopt, you can't even start the process until any new children are 6 months old to understand how the new family has settled." But Jolie said that her children were now getting used to new arrivals and "are not really stunned anymore when kids come home". "You know, somebody asked how (7-year-old) Mad was doing and you know he's just, he's a professional big brother, he's done it so many times," she said. "And we prepared them, we talked to them about it, they knew it was coming, and they are all just at that great age that they aren't threatened, that they are independent enough not to need mommy and daddy all the time," she said. Jolie, who won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her 1999 role as a young psychiatric patient in "Girl, Interrupted," stars in "Changeling" as a single mother whose 9-year-old son is kidnapped in 1928 Los Angeles.
