 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)A group of madrasa students vandalised the offices of the Dhaka University vice chancellor Saturday afternoon, to protest "illogical" admission rules, making the incident the sole agenda of a scheduled syndicate meeting running to late night. The students under the banners of 'Committee for protection of madrasa students' rights' and 'Bangladesh madrasa students movement council' marched thorough the DU campus and vandalised furniture, windows and property inside and outside the VC's room at around 4.15pm. The students said they were protesting rules that barred students who failed to study English and Bangla for 100 + 100 mark exams at HSC or equivalent level from seeking admission to new departments. The rules affect madrasa students. This year, linguistics and women and gender studies have been added to the list of departments, which already included Bangla, English, journalism and mass communication departments. The addition of two more departments angered students of madrasa origin. The public administration, international relations and economics departments had also decided to bar such students this year but later relented. "We have this rule to ensure admission of qualified students who have a high degree of literacy in English and Bangla," said linguistics chairperson Dr Firoza Yasmin. Munsi Shamsuddin Ahmed, assistant registrar of DU, told bdnews24.com that a group of madrasa students arrived on campus at about 4.15pm during a meeting of the deans' committee and wanted to submit a memorandum. Two memorandums were handed over to the vice chancellor, Shamsuddin said. The assistant registrar said the students left only to return a short time later demanding to meet the VC. The VC duly met with them after the dean's committee meeting had ended. But the discussions failed to convince the agitated students. "Some students came to me and told me that the new rules were aimed at depriving madrasa students. If the rules are not cancelled, they said the would not let the university sell admission forms and continue their movement," VC SMA Faiz told reporters. The VC warned them against any disorder on the campus. "I told them the rules were final as they were already published in the guidelines for admission," he said. As the students left the VC's room, they went on a rampage, the VC said, describing their behaviour as "unbelievable". "We never thought that such incidents could happen on the campus," Faiz said. Asked if the attackers were the students of the university, the VC said, "I do not know them. They are not fit to study at the university. They might have been influenced by someone." The VC said photos were taken during the incident and would be given to police. Proctor AKA Firoz said a complaint was lodged with police. He said urgent meetings of the provost committee and the proctorial committee would be convened. The DU authorities later deployed police at the VC office. According to the memorandum of the 'The committee for protection of madrasa students' rights', the conditions for admission to the university that barred madrasa students were "illogical". They demanded the rules be withdrawn immediately and sale of forms be kept suspended. The VC said it was up to the department to decide the admission criteria. bdn
