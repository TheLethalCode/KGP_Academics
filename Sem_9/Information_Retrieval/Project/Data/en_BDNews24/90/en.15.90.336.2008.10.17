 HARARE, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks on forming a Zimbabwean cabinet deadlocked on Thursday with political parties still fighting over who should control key ministries but negotiators said they would try again on Friday, the opposition MDC said. President Robert Mugabe voiced optimism a deal could be reached but said both sides were digging in their heels and compromise was needed on all sides. Mugabe and the heads of the Movement for Democratic Change's two factions, including its main leader Morgan Tsvangirai, have held three days of talks aimed at resolving a dispute over cabinet posts which is threatening a power-sharing deal. Former South African president Thabo Mbeki is mediating. "We have reached a deadlock over the issue of the allocation of ministries. We have referred the matter to the facilitator," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said, referring to Mbeki. Tsvangirai threatened to pull out of the agreement on Sunday after Mugabe allocated ministries, including defense, finance and home affairs, which oversees the police, to his ZANU-PF party. Chamisa said 10 ministries, including home affairs, defense, foreign affairs and information, were still in dispute. Tsvangirai left the talks without speaking to reporters. Mugabe emerged later. Asked if he was still optimistic over a breakthrough, he said: "Yes. There is need for compromise on all sides. They (MDC) maintain their position as we do." Talks will resume at 0930 GMT on Friday. Analysts say the power-sharing deal signed last month is Zimbabwe's best hope to end an economic and political crisis marked by the world's highest inflation at 231 million percent, biting fuel and food shortages and widespread poverty. "Yet another day of discussion and deliberation over cabinet positions in Zimbabwe when Zimbabweans are starving," Mutambara said as he left the talks. "We have a leadership problem in this country. We have to move on as Zimbabweans." A senior government source said earlier the parties had agreed the MDC would control the finance ministry, which is crucial for reviving Zimbabwe's ruined economy and attracting foreign investment. "I understand the Ministry of Finance has been settled in favor of the MDC, but that proposals on how to handle the Ministry of Home Affairs are still being discussed behind closed doors. We have no details on that," the source told Reuters. A Western diplomat also said Mugabe had agreed to the MDC controlling the finance ministry. "What they are still going hammer and tongs at is the ministry of home affairs," he said. Mugabe's party lost its majority for the first time since independence from Britain in 1980 after a March 29 election. The parties are under pressure to reach a settlement and international donors have pledged to pump money into the once prosperous southern African nation if a democratic government is formed and economic reforms implemented
