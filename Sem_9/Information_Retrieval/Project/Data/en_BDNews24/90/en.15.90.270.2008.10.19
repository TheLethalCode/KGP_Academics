<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka University lab has reaffirmed that its recent tests, detecting melamine in eight foreign milk powder brands, are "absolutely correct". Chemistry department professor Nilufar Nahar told a press conference on Saturday: "I have assessed and reassessed the test results. I have no doubts whatsoever the tests results are correct." Prof Nilufar pointed out: "The tests were done on samples sent to us by BSTI." "If BSTI had asked us, we would have informed them of the details of our test procedure," she said, in reference to newspaper reports on Saturday that BSTI had cast doubt on the DU test results. Calling the tests flawless, the professor added: "These tests are very expensive." The presence and ratio of melamine in the milk products were initially detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), she said. The results were confirmed using gas chromatograph-mass spectrography (GC/MS) at the DU chemistry department's Centre of Excellence, Prof Nilufar added. bdnews
