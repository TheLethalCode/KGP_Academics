When telephony was split from the Post Office, the tunnels passed to British Telecom, now privatised and known as BT. In the 1980s the government used part of the complex as a temporary backup for its top secret Pindar war control bunker. Sales agent Farebrother said there had already been a lot of interest in the now disused property. It has a total floor area of around 7,100 sq metres (76,420 sq ft) but can only be reached by two street-level lifts, restricting its potential use.
