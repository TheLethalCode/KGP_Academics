 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said Saturday the government would hold fresh dialogue the political parties for "qualitative improvement of electoral environment and politics". "The dialogue is a continuous process. The necessity of dialogue does not end with the registration of the political parties with the Election Commission," the education adviser said after a seminar in Dhaka on "Quality of Education" organised by an NGO. "Without any conditions attached, dialogue will be held on important and logical issues. "We will hold dialogue with the political parties for improving electoral environment and politics." On the timing of fresh dialogue, the adviser said the talks would take off "in quickest time." He said: "The process of talks with the political parties has to be continued as it is necessary. The election-oriented parties also feel the need for dialogue." On his meeting with Khaleda Zia recently the adviser said, "I went to meet the BNP chairperson in a flag car and I was escorted by police guards. So such confusion has been created over the visit (unnecessarily)." Hossain Zillur said: "Some people are saying why we were shuttling (between political parties). Our aim is to hold a fair election. "To reach our goal we will have to shuttle. It doesn't matter much who says what about it. The big thing is whether we succeed in taking the country to its aim." On scepticism regarding the election, he said, "Everthing will be clear on the day after the election." Primary and mass education adviser Rasheda K Chowdhury, Prof Anisuzzaman, JSD president Hasanul Haq Inu, Awami League education affairs secretary Nurul Islam Nahid and DU teacher Dr Muhammad Ibrahim also spoke. bdn
