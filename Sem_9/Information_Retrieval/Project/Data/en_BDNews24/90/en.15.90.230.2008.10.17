 CANBERRA, Fri Oct 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Indonesian fishing crew picked up in Australian territorial waters with 14 refugees on their boat were charged Friday with people smuggling, Australian police said. A 58-year-old captain and one other Indonesian crew member were in charge of a boat intercepted near an oil platform in the Timor Sea on October 6 with 14 mostly Afghan asylum seekers on board and one other crewman. "It will be alleged in court that the captain and crew member were part of an attempted people-smuggling venture that originated in Indonesia," police said in a statement. The pair, who follow another Indonesian skipper charged over a similar but separate incident last week, were to appear in a Perth court Monday. If found guilty they face a maximum jail sentence of 20 years. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd last year dropped a tough policy of sending asylum seekers to Pacific island nations for refugee processing. The policy had been adopted by his conservative predecessor, John Howard, and criticized by the United Nations. In July, Rudd's center-left Labor government also ended automatic detention for asylum seekers who arrived in the country without visas, prompting warnings from Jakarta that a softening approach could prompt a surge in asylum arrivals. Two asylum boats arrived within weeks of one another in September, the first carrying 12 Afghans and Iranians who were also taken to Christmas Island, located in the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and Australia. They were the first to arrive this year. In 2007 five such boats arrived in Australia. In 2006, six boats landed, and in 2005, four. The number has reduced to a trickle since Howard's so-called Pacific Solution was put in place in 2001
