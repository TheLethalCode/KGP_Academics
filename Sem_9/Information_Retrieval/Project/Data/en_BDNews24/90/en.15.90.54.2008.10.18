 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)Development of infrastructure and improved communication between SARRC countries were key to the region's growth, a seminar was told Saturday. Speaking as chief guest, Truth and Accountability Commission (TAC) chairman Habibur Rahman said movement of goods between the South Asian countries suffered due to poor transport infrastructure. Saarc Chamber Women Entrepreneurs Council (SCWEC) hosted the seminar, attended by leading businesswomen and business leaders from the region, at the capital's Westin Hotel. He recommended adoption of "open skies" policy and modern telecommunication system to boost trade and business. The former Supreme Court judge said a more simplified visa procedure would promote both business and exchange of knowledge. Banking services could be better, he said, and Indian entrepreneurs were in a good position to invest in Bangladesh's rural IT infrastructure. Mir Nasir Hossain, a former FBCCI president, echoed the TAC chairman and pointed out that not all Saarc capitals were linked by air traffic and that regional trade figures were not encouraging. He said Bangladesh needed investment in power and should explore if Bhutan's hydro-electric project could be emulated. Kamal Uddin Ahmed, chairman of Board of Investment, said foreigners were being asked to invest in energy, power, garments, information technology, pharmaceuticals but infrastructure remained a bane. World class infrastructure was at the top of the South Asian agenda, said SCWEC chairperson V L Indira Dutta, stressing mutual cooperation to reach the targets. Nasreen Awal Mintoo, a former chairperson of SCWEC, Harish Chandra Prasad, chairman of Malaxmi Energy Ventures, Naaz Farhana Ahmed, vice chairman of SCWEC spoke at the seminar. bdn
