<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government is set to sue five companies for importing milk powder without proper registration, a senior government official said Thursday. Health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali told bdnews24.com that the government had initiated proceeding against the unregistered milk powder importers. Mou Enterprise, Renown Associates, Zess International, Maisha Health Care and Always Trading all allegedly imported milk powder manufactured by various brands without registration. There are currently seven companies registered to import milk powder into the country. In a separate move, deputy director of the Institute of Public Health Nutrition Abdur Rahman said mobile courts had been directed to withdraw Yashili-1 powdered milk from the market due to contamination with melamine. An official of the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution said tests conducted in a Dhaka University laboratory had found the contaminant melamine in eight foreign brands of milk powder currently sold in Bangladesh. However, the BSTI's own laboratory and private laboratory Plasma Plus also tested the eight milk powders, but detected melamine in only the Chinese Yashili-1 milk formula, BSTI director general Md Azmal Hossain said. The other brands under scrutiny are Australian Diploma, Red Cow, Dano Full Cream, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2, Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. Hossain said the test results from the three laboratories were sent to the ministry of commerce, and a number of recommendations were made in line with the results. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed confirmed to bdnews24.com that the ministry had received the BSTI's recommendations, adding that a panel of experts would convene Sunday to discuss the matter. bdnew
