 DONGGUAN, China, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of workers gathered outside a shuttered toy maker in southern China on Friday demanding unpaid wages as factories in the region, hit by falling demand and now the global crisis, struggle to survive. Manufacturers in the once-booming southern Chinese province of Guangdong have suffered over the past year and a half from tight curbs on loans, rising labor costs and China's stronger currency, which makes their products more expensive. Hong Kong-listed Smart Union Group had tried to beat the downturn, by taking on more orders as smaller factories closed, local media said. It over-extended, even as demand was hit further by the global credit crisis which could drag rich western consuming countries into recession. "The main reason for the closure is that we are too dependent on the U.S. market, which has become sluggish," the China Daily said, citing Smart Union human resources staffer Xu Xiaofeng. Smart Union, a supplier to Mattel, had not paid its 6,500 employees in the export-oriented southern city of Dongguan for two months, the China Daily reported. About 1,000 workers gathered at the factory in Zhangmutou, before moving on to local government offices guarded by about 100 policemen. Many said they had worked for the company for years. "I feel very agitated. I have waited for a few days now, we need money to pay for our housing and food," said worker Huang Luohui, 33, who is owed two months' wages. "Some people say the company has folded and that the boss has fled... The government said they'd resolve the problem in three days. Today is the third day and we've seen no reply from them." Riot police with batons and shields stood in front of the factory gates, where a notice read "because business is bad, we are unable to give you your salaries." DARKENING PROSPECTS Smart Union was an aggressive toy maker that counted some of the biggest U.S. brands among its clients. It went public in September 2006, but hit hard times as raw materials prices rose while summer flooding caused millions of dollars in damages. In late September, it reported a loss of more than HK$200 million for the first six months of the year. Its debt totaled over HK$500 yuan at the end of June, exceeding its assets. Its shares closed at HK$0.099 a share on Wednesday and did not trade on Thursday. They have lost 94 percent of their value since the beginning of the year. Smart Union could not be reached for comment on Friday. Dongguan earlier this month set up a 1 billion yuan ($146.4 million) rescue fund for small and medium sized businesses hurt by the global economic crisis. The number of Chinese firms exporting toys overseas halved in the first seven months of 2008, compared to the year before, the General Administration of Customs said on Monday. The Canton Fair, the top trade fair which is a barometer for China's foreign trade, saw visitor numbers down sharply this week, indicating stiffer competition for export factories in months to come.
