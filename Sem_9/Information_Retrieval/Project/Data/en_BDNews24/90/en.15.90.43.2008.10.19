 PRAGUE, Sat Oct 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leftist Czech opposition has trounced the ruling center-right in regional elections, sending shock waves through the cabinet of Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek ahead of the country's EU presidency next year. Analysts have said poor results could trigger a revolt within the ruling Civic Democrats that could even topple Topolanek, possibly at a congress in December, weeks before Prague takes the reins of the EU amid global financial crisis. The Social Democrats beat the Civic Democrats in all 13 regions, wiping out their control of provincial politics. The Czech Statistical Bureau said that with 99.6 percent of votes counted, the Social Democrats had won 35.9 percent and the Civic Democrats just 23.6 percent in the weekend poll. Topolanek conceded defeat and said his party would have to consider how to proceed at the December convention, but refused to say if he would consider resigning as party chief. "One has to know how to win and one has to know how to lose, and this is a defeat," he said on Czech Television. "I of course see this as a very big loss, however not as big as the Social Democrats suffered when they were in government." He added the Civic Democrats could still revive their fortunes in a run-off election for one third of the upper house of parliament, to be held next week after an inconclusive first round held alongside the regional polls on Friday and Saturday. Topolanek's main party rival, First Civic Democrat Vice-Chairman and Prague Mayor Pavel Bem, said the party leadership should offer to resign at the congress. Analysts have said that if Topolanek quit as the head of party and government, the Civic Democrats might agree with the opposition to form a caretaker cabinet to lead the country through the EU presidency and hold a parliamentary election in late 2009, instead of mid-2010 when it is due. INFIGHTING Topolanek's cabinet, which includes two small coalition partners, has won praise from economists for cutting income taxes and raising sales levies, keeping budget deficits low, raising the retirement age and adopting measures to slash abuse of the welfare system. But its plans to host a US missile defense base, introduce a 30 crown ($1.62) fee to see a doctor, and constant infighting have hurt its standing in the eyes of ordinary Czechs. Such infighting has reduced the cabinet's support in the lower house of parliament to 98 seats out of 200. The Social Democrats have called a no-confidence vote for next Wednesday, but the government is expected to survive that with the help of a handful of independents unlikely to join forces with the opposition. Opposition chief Jiri Paroubek said the cabinet should quit. "I cannot see how this government could want to rule further and go into the EU presidency with this low level of support," he said
