 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  In a historic departure from past procedure in Bangladesh, the newly formed Supreme Judicial Commission has sent names of four senior High Court judges to the president on Thursday for appointment of two new justices to the Appellate Division. Eight members of the nine member commission, led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, held their first session at the CJ's private chamber from 2.30pm to 3.30pm. The judges named were Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman, Md Abdul Quddus, Md Abdul Aziz and BK Das. The ninth member, Justice Md Fazlul Karim was not present in the meeting. After the meeting member of the commission and Supreme Court Bar Association president Shafique Ahmed said in a briefing that seniority of the judges was considered in proposing the names for appointment to the Appellate Division "The commission discussed the appointment of justices to the Appellate Division. Names of four judges were finalised from the High Court division on the basis of seniority and sent to the president." "Today's meeting did not discuss the appointment of judges to the High Court Division," Shafique informed reporters. "The commission will discuss it in its next sitting." "However, the law adviser has been given the responsibility to draft a proposal on which system the judges would be appointed in the High Court," he added. The move to recruit more judges to the Supreme Court comes in a bid to clear the huge backlog of cases pending disposal. The Appellate Division at present has only five judges; the High Court has 61. The appointment of upper court judges has long been the preserve of the executive, with the head of state rubberstamping nominations from the prime minister. The current caretaker government moved quickly to complete the formalities to create the commission, a longstanding demand from the Bar and the public. "Recruitment of upper court judges through the SJC will allay the controversies raised in the past over such appointments," Barrister Shafique Ahmed said of the commission's role. The most senior HC judge should automatically be elevated to the Appellate Division, but the tradition has been breached on several occasions in the past. The most senior incumbent HC judge is Justice Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman. Justices Md Abdul Kuddus, Md Abdul Aziz, BK Das and ABM Khairul Haque follow him in seniority. Chief justice MM Ruhul Amin heads the Supreme Judicial Commission, with members law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, three senior Appellate Division judges Md Fazlul Karim, Tafazzal Islam and Jainul Abedin, High Court senior judges Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Md Abdul Kuddus, attorney general Salauddin Ahmed and Supreme Court Bar Association president barrister Shafique Ahmed. bdnews
