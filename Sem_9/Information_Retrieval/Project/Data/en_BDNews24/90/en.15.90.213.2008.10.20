 RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three players were sent off as Palmeiras came from two goals down to hold Sao Paulo 2-2 in a Brazilian championship match between two bitter rivals on Sunday. The draw moved Palmeiras within one point of leaders Gremio, who lost 2-0 at struggling Portuguesa, although they dropped from second to third after Cruzeiro beat Atletico Mineiro 2-0 to overtake them on games won. Sao Paulo, two points behind Palmeiras in fourth, were making their first visit to the Palestra Italia stadium since April when they were forced to flee their dressing-room after it filled with a mysterious gas. The game got off to an explosive start with a goal and two red cards in the first seven minutes.

The hosts finished with nine players after Roque Junior was sent off for a second bookable offence. With eight rounds of matches to play, only four points separate leaders Gremio, who have 56 points, from fifth-placed Flamengo. Gremio fell behind in the 55th minute at Portuguesa when Edigle headed in from a corner and Edno rounded the goalkeeper to add the second in stoppage-time.

Johnathan opened the scoring in the Belo Horizonte derby with an angled shot in the 42nd minute and Guilherme added a stoppage- time penalty for the Foxes. Flamengo kept their chances alive by beating Vasco da Gama 1-0 in a Rio de Janeiro derby with an own goal by Jorge Luiz in the 43rd minute. Flamengo are fifth on 52 points and Vasco stayed botto
