 Chittagong,October 17 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury left for Bangkok Friday noon to see his ailing daughter Fawzia Sultana Tumpa, declared clinically dead by doctors, his family said. Tumpa, a student studying English at Premier University, Chittagong, is under treatment at a Bangkok hospital for cancer. The mayor's nephew Mesbahuddin Chowdhury Nobel told reporters that a few minutes before Mohiuddin's flight left, news arrived that Tumpa had been put on a life support machine. "Just before the Bangkok flight left, uncle Mohiuddin received news that Tumpa had been clinically dead and put on a life-support system," said Nobel. "A totally shattered soul, he still asked Bangkok to keep Tumpa on the life-support system and left." Carrying the mayor, the Thai Airways flight left Shah Amanat International Airport at around 2:30 pm, said the mayor's lawyer Ibrahim Hossain Babul to bdnews24.com. Mohiuddin was accompanied by his wife Hasina Mohiuddin and son Noufel. Awami League leader Mohiuddin Chowdhury was released on October 8 after being bailed in all the 15 cases cases against him. He had been detained for a year and seven months. Following a formal petition, the government gave him permission on Oct 15 to go abroad. "I'm going to Bangkok. I don't know if I'll be able to see my daughter alive," Mohiuddin told reporters before departure. Calling upon the government to release all political leaders, Mohiuddin said, "Nothing can be gained by persecuting the politicians." "I've instructed the Chittagong City Corporation councillors to discharge their responsibilities duly, though I heard that a lot of irregularities had occurred at the CCC while I was away." Though freed on bail, Mohiuddin was not allowed to return to his mayoral office. He wrote to the government, asking for a reason. The government, meanwhile, is weighing the legal options. "The mayor's letter has been forwarded to the law ministry for comment," local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal told reporters. "The local government ministry take steps based on the comment from the law ministry," the adviser said. CCC councillor Manzur Alam has been the acting mayor in absence of Mohiuddin. The mayor faced as many as 22 cases, of which three were quashed by the court and final reports have been submitted for four. bdnews
