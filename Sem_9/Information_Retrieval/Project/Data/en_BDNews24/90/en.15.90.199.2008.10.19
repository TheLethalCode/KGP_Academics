 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)Sales of Dhaka University admission forms resumed Sunday after a blockade was withdrawn by students protesting an increase in price of the forms. The protestors, calling themselves the 'progressive students alliance', withdrew the blockade after leaders of the alliance met with the university authorities in the afternoon. Later at a press conference at Dhaka University Journalists Association they said they withdrew the programme on assurances by the university. Chhatra Union central general secretary Manobendra De told the press conference the forms would remain on sale at the new price of Tk 300, but the price of forms would not be increased for the next 10 years. "We withdrew the programme on such assurance from the authorities." In addition,subscriptions taken from students by different departments after admission would now be controlled centrally by the authorities, so that the departments cannot demand extra fees, he said. On the price of admission forms, vice chancellor Prof SMA Faiz said the price of forms had been raised by just Tk 50, from Tk 250, after a gap of 10 years. The sale of admission forms was halted earlier after police clashed with several groups of students demanding changes in admission rules. The VC, proctor and other top-level university officials were forced to sit in an emergency meeting, DU security officer Quamrul Ahsan told bdnews24.com. The 'progressive students alliance began a demonstration from Modhur Canteen in the morning pressing for cuts in admission fees. As they also approached the TSC, police charged them leaving three students injured, said witnesses. After the incident the 'progressive students alliance' set up a blockade at the TSC. They also declared that they would not allow sale of any admission fees of B and D units until fees were lowered. A number of students who came to buy forms were also injured during the police chase, said people on the scene. Sales of A unit forms at Curzon Hall were also halted amid the demonstrations. A separate group of madrasa students also began demonstrating on campus shortly before 9am protesting rules that barred them from seeking admission to new departments. As the students, under the banners of 'committee for protection of madrasa students rights' and 'Bangladesh madrasa students movement, tried to hold a rally in front of the TSC police barred them from gathering there. They again tried to rally and police charged them. Witnesses said some 10-12 students were injured. Large numbers of police were deployed at the TSC gate after the incident. bdnews24
