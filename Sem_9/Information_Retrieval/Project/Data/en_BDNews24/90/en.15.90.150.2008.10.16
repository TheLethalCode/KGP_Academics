<TEXT>
 New Delhi, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has no immediate plans to cut fuel prices despite crude oil's fall to a 13- month low near $72 a barrel, oil minister Murli Deora told reporters on Thursday. He said a cut in prices would not be considered unless the price of crude oil imported by Indian refiners fell to $61 per barrel. "The new break-even level is $61 a barrel and oil companies are still making losses," Deora told reporters.
