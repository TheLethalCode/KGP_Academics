 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court has ordered the trial proceedings of the Barapukuria graft case, filed against former prime minister Khaleda Zia and others, to be held in a special court on the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. Dhaka metropolitan session judge Md Azizul Haque gave the order Thursday, on 'security grounds'. The appearance of Khaleda and other accused at the session judge's court for a hearing in the high-profile case, caused chaos at the court premises and surrounding areas of the old city. The BNP chairperson arrived at the court premises to be met by intense crowds of supporters jamming the streets and breaking into demonstrations. Thousands of BNP supporters thronged the approach to Old Dhaka's session courts since morning as word had it that the party chief was on her way. Chief political correspondent Sumon Mahmud reports, the crowds brought traffic to a standstill and security men were forced to virtually close the court premises allowing only lawyers to enter. Others accused in the case, M Shamsul Islam, Motiur Rahman Nizami and MK Anwar, also arrived for the hearing. Her one-time confidante Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, whom she fired as BNP secretary general for his alleged links to the current government, was among others on the list of accused ordered to appear Thursday morning. Former finance minister M Saifur Rahman, Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid have also been summoned by the judge, Azizul Haque.
