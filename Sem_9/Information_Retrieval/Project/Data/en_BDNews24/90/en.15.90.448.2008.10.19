 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed appealed to the High Court for bail Sunday in the high-profile Barapukuria graft case. Mojaheed's lawyer barrister Abdur Razzak placed the appeal to the HC bench of justices Mohammad Anwarul Haque and Farah Mahbub. Mojaheed would have to appear before the bench to secure the bail, but he had not appeared with his lawyers in the morning. Barrister Razzak told in court his client, could not appear in the court as police had cordoned him. "The hearing on the bail appeal might take place this afternoon," he later told bdnews24.com. Security measures were beefed up in and around the High Court premises after the bail appeal, as huge numbers of Jamaat and Shibir activists thronged the area. Law enforcers were checking every vehicle at each entrance. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges on Oct 5 accusing 16 people in the case, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former ministers of her government. The court issued arrest warrant against several accused the following day, including Mojaheed. The commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of incurring losses of Tk 158.71 core to the state due to an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). bdnew
