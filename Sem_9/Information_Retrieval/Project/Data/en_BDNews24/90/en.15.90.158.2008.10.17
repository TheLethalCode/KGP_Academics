 Mumbai, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan was discharged from hospital on Friday, almost a week after he was admitted to a Mumbai hospital for abdominal pain. "Doctors attending to him did their final check up this morning so that they could prescribe whatever medication he has to take and allowed him to go home," Dr Naredra Trivedi, vice president Lilavati hospital told Reuters over telephone. However, Trivedi refused to give details about the diagnoses and whether Bachchan would require any further treatment. "I do not have any details on that as yet. I will know only in the evening once I have consulted with doctors attending to him," he said. Television visuals showed Bachchan waving to the crowd outside the hospital with his son Abhishek besides him before leaving in a car. Bachchan, 66, was rushed to Lilavati hospital on Saturday, which was also his birthday, after complaining of abdominal pain. The actor has also spoken out on the illness for the first time, mentioning anxiety, pain and sleepless nights, in a post on his blog. Bachchan, who has been a meticulously regular blogger ever since he started keeping an online journal more than 5 months ago, posted as many as five blog posts on Thursday night, but didn't give away too many details of his health. "These days are spent in hospital. In investigation and treatment and anxiety and sleepless nights and pain and So much more.. But now the nurses exclaim at the time I spend in front of this screen and start pulling plugs out," Bachchan wrote in his first blog post since he was hospitalised on his 66th birthday. "I shall fill in these days. Perhaps later when I have the solitude of my convalescence.. My love for you remains steadfast and strong.." he had written. Bachchan also posted a couple of interviews that he had granted to Indian publications as well as a speech he had prepared for a function he was supposed to attend this week. His fans also posted messages on his blog, cheered by the news that he was on his way to recovery. "Good to hear from you. Are you recovering well? Please take lots of rest. You are always in my prayer," one such commentor on the blog identified as Varsha wrote. Bachchan has acted in more than 170 films in a glittering career and is easily one of Indian cinemas most recognisable faces. His son Abhishek and daughter in law Aishwarya too are Bollywood actors. Currently, Bachchan has three projects on the floors, and was in talks for some more
