<TITLE> Shakib puts Tigers on top </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan's six scalps put Bangladesh on top against New Zealand at the close of the second day of the two-match Test series opener in Chittagong on Saturday. The visitors ended on a paltry 155 for nine at stumps, trailing by 90 runs in their first innings after Bangladesh wrapped on 245 at the Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium. The 21-year old Shakib produced his career best of 6 for 31, almost certain to ensure New Zealand's lowest total against Bangladesh in an innings. The Black Caps' previous lowest against Bangladesh was 375 in Dunedin early this year. The visiting batsmen were almost hapless against Shakib on the turning wicket. Things could have been even worse for them had Kiwi skipper Daniel Vettori not remained unbeaten on 48 along with Iain O'Brien on four. Shakib, taken on as a specialist spinner in the match and batting at number eight, was put in to play in the 13th over in place of paceman Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, with the left-arm spinner justifying Ashraful's decision by his second over. The young all-rounder, in an unbroken 24 overs, began his devastating spell by having opener Jamie How (16) caught by Rajin Saleh at silly point, then removing debutant Jesse Ryder (one) in the same fashion in the first delivery of his next over with Rajin taking the left-handed batsman at short leg. Razzak then joined the attack, trapping Ross Taylor leg before for 12, with Shakib claiming his third scalp Aaron Redmond, who scored 19 off 65 balls with the help of two boundaries. After being reduced to 52 for four, Brendon McCullum and Daniel Flynn began repairing some damage before Ashraful brought in debutant off-spinner Nayeem Islam for another breakthrough. Nayeem broke the 47-run fifth-wicket partnership to send back Flynn, who was just settling in, hitting one six and two fours in his 46-ball 19. Shakib then dismissed McCullum (25 off 37 balls) and Jacob Oram (duck) in one over to leave the Black Caps at 100 for seven, before Kyle Mills became the bowler's sixth victim. After eight wickets down, it seemed a sure bet that Bangladesh would be batting again on the second day, but Vettori grimly stuck it out to the end to deny the hosts their second innings start on Saturday. Bangladesh captain Ashraful, desperate to get another breakthrough by smashing the eight-wicket partnership of Vettori and Kyle Mills, changed bowlers several times, but his efforts went in vain. Finally, the Bangladesh captain took the ball in his own hand in the 61st over, removing Mills in his third delivery with the umpires calling it a day on Mills' dismissal. Earlier, Bangladesh, having resumed the second day on 183 for four, added only 62 runs for the remaining six wickets before the lunch break, as Daniel Vettori raised his wicket toll to five for 59 from the first day's two for 50. Overnight batsmen Mehrab Hossain Junior and Mushiqur Rahim resumed their partnership on an unbeaten 139, with Mehrab striking Kyle Mills for four in the very second delivery of the day, but were separated in the fourth over of the day by pacer Iain O'Brien, who returned three for 36. O'Brien had Mehrab caught by Aaron Redmond at short cover to end Bangladesh's fifth-wicket record 144-run partnership. Mehrab took his overnight 79 to 83 off 179 balls studded with 11 fours. Mushfiqur along with debutant Nayeem Islam showed signs of another resistance, but the debut batsman (14 off 46 balls) came down the wicket against off-spinner Jeetan Patel to be stumped by Brendon McCullum, leaving the side at 229 for six, triggering a low order collapse. On that total, Mushfiqur and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza were successively dismissed by Vettori, and Bangladesh collapsed to 229 for eight. Mushfiqur added 20 runs to his overnight 59 to finish on 79 off 210 balls featuring a dozen fours and one six, while Mashrafee played a three-ball duck. Abdur Razzak played a 22-ball 11 to take the side near the 250-mark, before left-spinner Vettori had Razzak caught by Jesse Ryder to complete his fourth five-wicket haul against Bangladesh and overall 16th in his Test career. Off-spinner Patel wrapped up Bangladesh's first innings having Shakib Al Hasan caught by Vettori, and returned two for 67. b
