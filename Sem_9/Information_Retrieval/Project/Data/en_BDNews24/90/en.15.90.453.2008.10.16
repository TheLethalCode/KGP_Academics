 LONDON, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker David Villa maintained European champions Spain's perfect start to 2010 World Cup qualifying with a late winner to sink Belgium 2-1 on Wednesday. England, who overcame Belarus 3-1, and the Netherlands, 1-0 winners over Norway, also kept their 100 percent records. Greece, the only other European nation to begin the evening with maximum points, lost 2-1 at home to Switzerland. Midfielder Alberto Aquilani scored twice for world champions and Group Eight leaders Italy who edged out plucky Montenegro 2-1 in Lecce. Germany also found it tough going at home against Wales, the Group Four favourites taking the points and a 1-0 win thanks to a long-range strike from Piotr Trochowski. Spain stretched their unbeaten run to 27 matches and made it four wins from four in Group Five but they had to come from behind to defeat Belgium in Brussels. Vicente del Bosque's team had won their first three games without conceding a goal but their net was breached by Wesley Sonck after just seven minutes, the striker beating Iker Casillas with a looping header. Spain striker Fernando Torres then limped out of the game and his replacement Cesc Fabregas created the 36th-minute equaliser for Andres Iniesta who neatly rounded keeper Stijn Stijnen and scored from a tight angle. Spain enjoyed a let-off in the second half when Carles Puyol cleared off the line to deny Anthony Vanden Borre, before another substitute, Daniel Guiza, crossed for Villa to head in the winner two minutes from time. HOTSHOT ROONEY Striker Wayne Rooney's two second-half goals carried England to a 3-1 win over Belarus in Minsk, continuing their fine form under coach Fabio Capello. Rooney took his tally to five in three games after a double against Kazakhstan on Saturday and one in the 4-1 win over Croatia last month. England, who took the lead with Steven Gerrard's fine strike from distance before Pavel Sitko equalised, had never previously won their four opening matches in a World Cup qualifying campaign dating back to 1949-50. They top Group Six with 12 points, five ahead of Croatia and Ukraine. "I said before the game Belarus were a very hard team to beat and this win was very important for us," Capello told Setanta Sports. The Netherlands maintained their 100 percent record in Group Nine with a 1-0 success over Norway in Oslo. Midfielder Mark van Bommel volleyed in a 62nd-minute winner for the Dutch who have nine points from three games. Italy's victory over Montenegro meant boss Marcello Lippi, over his two spells in charge, has equalled 1934 and 1938 World Cup-winning coach Vittorio Pozzo's record of 30 games without defeat. The Italians have 10 points from four games in Group Eight, three ahead of Ireland who defeated Cyprus 1-0 with a Robbie Keane header. Solid Welsh defending frustrated Germany for long periods in Moenchengladbach before Hamburg SV midfielder Trochowski swept in his first international goal with around 20 minutes to go. "I've had a lot of shots and one had to go in some time," Trochowski told German TV. Germany top Group Four with 10 points, four more than Wales and Russia. Switzerland appear to have put last month's shock loss to Luxembourg firmly behind them as Ottmar Hitzfeld's team followed up Saturday's win over Latvia with an impressive 2-1 success over Greece in Athens. Blaise N'Kufo's quality finish 13 minutes from time kept the Swiss third in Group Two, a point behind Israel and two behind leaders Greece. A second-half goal from Libor Sionko secured a first Group Three win for the Czech Republic who edged past Slovenia 1-0 in Teplice. The Czechs remain fourth in the group, five behind surprise pacesetters Slovakia who deposed previous leaders Poland thanks to two late goals from Stanislav Sesta
