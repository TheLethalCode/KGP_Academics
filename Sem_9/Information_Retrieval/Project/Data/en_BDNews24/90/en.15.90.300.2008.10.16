 Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected US drone fired a missile on Thursday into a Pakistani region on the Afghan border regarded as a haven for al Qaeda and Taliban militants, a Pakistani intelligence agency official said. The missile hit a house in South Waziristan, in an area known as a stronghold of Baitullah Mehsud, head of Pakistani Taliban militants.
