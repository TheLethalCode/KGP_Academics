<TITLE> We'll cope without Clark, says Australia skipper Ponting </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOHALI, India, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting said his side would cope with the loss of injured seamer Stuart Clark when they tackle India on a pace-friendly second test track on Friday. Australia will give a debut to 23-year-old Peter Siddle after Clark failed to recover from an elbow injury suffered in the drawn first test in Bangalore while India sweat over a shoulder problem for skipper and spinner Anil Kumble. "I'm very impressed with everything he (Siddle) has done on the tour so far," Ponting told reporters. "He keeps things very simple. He is always there and thereabouts with the ball and he is a good exploiter of the reverse swing as well." Ponting also backed off-spinner Cameron White, who took just one wicket on his debut in Bangalore, to adapt quickly but said the visitors would look to further lift their game. "We know what is going to work for us," he said. "What we do is adapt and adjust to conditions very well quickly. If this wicket here tomorrow morning happens to offer a bit for the fast bowlers, I think our guys will use those conditions well." Kumble, India's main spinner who turns 38 on Friday, bowled in the nets after the injury flared up during the first test. "It's (shoulder) better," Kumble said. "We'll take a call, there's still 24 hours before the match. We will wait and see how it responds. It's a lot better than what it was yesterday." Kumble hoped his frontline batsmen would fire on a pitch of true bounce after only one among the top six made a fifty in Bangalore. Ponting said the team had discussed Kumble, whose absence would give fellow leg-spinner Amit Mishra his test debut or third seamer Munaf Patel a place in the eleven. "We have spoken about the fact that he (Kumble) might not play with his shoulder injury," Ponting said. "We've to prepare as if he is playing and as if he is not playing.
