 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - BNP and its political ally Jamaat-e-Islami have picked up registration forms from the Election Commission on Sunday, a day before the deadline ends. "BNP has advanced a step toward registration by collecting the application form. But the chairperson will decide whether we will submit the form tomorrow," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan told reporters at the EC Secretariat after collecting a registration form. "We have talked with the government and the Election Commission on overall issues," he said. There was still time to reach an accord with the government on certain sticking points, he added. Jamaat central committee member Jashimuddin Sarker, also collecting a form Sunday, said: "We are ready for registration. The work on amending the party constitution is underway." Replying to a query from reporters, he said: "There are no anti-liberation clauses in the party constitution." The distribution and collection of registration forms started on Aug 26. As many as 189 parties have collected application forms, with some 40 parties submitted the applications up to Sunday afternoon. The EC stretched the registration deadline to Oct 20 from Oct 15, responding to appeals of the four-party alliance led by BNP. bdnews
