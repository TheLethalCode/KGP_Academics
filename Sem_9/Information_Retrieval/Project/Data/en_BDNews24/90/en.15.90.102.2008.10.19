 Chittagong, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury returned from Bangkok to the port city Sunday with the body of his daughter after she succumbed to cancer in the Thai capital earlier in the week. Fawzia Sultana Tumpa was laid to rest in the family graveyard at Chasma Hill in Sholoshohor following Namaz-e-Janaza at Laldighi in the city. Before the Janaza, Mohiuddin in a brief speech said: "As a father I wanted to be with my daughter in her crisis. She also expressed her earnest desire to see me at the end of her life. But I was not allowed to fly to Bangkok. I seek justice from God." "My girl, gravely ill but thinking nothing of herself, advised my relatives to save money for my treatment," he said, breaking into tears. Mohiuddin's youngest son, Borhanul Hasan Saleheen told bdnews24.com that the body was brought to the family residence for family members to pay their last respects prior to burial in the afternoon. "My father failed to see Tumpa for a final farewell. He brought her body from Bangkok, but he himself did not undergo any treatment there," said Saleheen. The CCC mayor learned of his daughter's death on Friday as he was about to embark a flight to Bangkok to visit her. bdne
