 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)A visiting British minister says both former prime ministers, now charged with corruption, can contest polls due on Dec 18, because there is no legal barrier. "Neither of the two ladies (Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina) have been convicted of corruption. And therefore from my point of view as an outsider: I see no basis on which they could be appropriately in a banned from participation," said Lord Mark Malloch Brown, a UK foreign office minister, on Thursday. Wrapping up a two-day trip to Bangladesh, Lord Brown stressed the state of emergency should be lifted before the election if the military-installed interim government and the political parties could settle two key issuespublic safety and disqualification of graft convicts. He said the army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, who he met earlier on the day, assured him that Bangladesh would return to democracy after the parliamentary polls on Dec 18. "The only effective way to fight corruption anywhere in the world is full respect for the rule of law which is why I say that it would be inappropriate for people convicted of corruption charges to stand as candidates," Lord Mark Malloch told journalists at a press conference at the residence of the British high commissioner. The UK minister for Asia, Africa and the United Nations said the BNP and the Awami League would have to decide whether the two former prime ministers should run the elections. He said the caretaker government had played its part through reforming some democratic institutions. Now, the political parties would have to do their part, said the minister. On holding the elections under the state of emergency, Lord Brown said, "An election without the state of emergency will enjoy greater legitimacy and credibility at home and abroad. So, that's the ideal point." "But I think one has to recognise that the government has real issues the political parties will have to help them solve if the state of emergency is to be lifted. "One is with regard to the people who have been convicted of corruption. They just quite simply should not be allowed to stand for parliament. "I think it is perfectly a reasonable demand of the caretaker government that this issue, which is dealt with under the state of emergency which might not be when the state of emergency is lifted, is addressed," he said, backing plans to enforce state of emergency on a limited scale. "And the second is off course concern about the public security during the conduct of the election campaign when there is always the risk of volatility and violence. "And I hope these two issues could be addressed through discussion between political parties and the caretaker government and the election commission," he said. He, however, stressed that the political parties must be given the chance to campaign effectively ahead of the elections. The minister said the next government would have to continue the positive reforms initiated by the military-backed government. "Whoever the new government is, the kind of thing we the donors will be anxious to see is there is no loss of momentum in this anti-corruption drive," he said. The minister left Dhaka in the afternoon for Delhi on a Jet Airway flight. b
