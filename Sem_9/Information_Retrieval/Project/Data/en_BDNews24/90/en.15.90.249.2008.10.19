 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League will not take part in the national elections without party chief Sheikh Hasina's freedom, or under emergency, acting president Zillur Rahman said on Sunday. The AL leader, taking part in a rally at the auditorium of the Institution of Engineers, said: "We will not take part in polls under emergency." "We will not take part in the polls without Hasina. There will be no council of party without her." The rally was held to press for unconditional release of Hasina and withdrawal of all cases against her. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said the government must ensure unconditional release of Hasina and withdraw all cases against her for a free and fair election, with participation of all political parties. "People are not abiding by the emergency rules. There is no need for rules that are not abided by people. He warned the government against any move to arrest Hasina on her return. Presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said, "We must call a different type of programme if Hasina is not freed by Oct 30." He said the party's electoral activities would begin only after the release of Hasina. Presidium member Motia Chowdhury raised questions about the freedom of the judiciary. "One gets bail only if the government wants it." bdnew
