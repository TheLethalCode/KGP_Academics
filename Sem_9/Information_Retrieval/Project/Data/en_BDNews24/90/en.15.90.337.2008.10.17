 MOHALI, India, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The rebel Indian Cricket League's (ICL) bid to get official recognition failed on Thursday after talks with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), officials said. ICL players are barred from official matches by national boards and it had been hoped an agreement could be reached to lift this ban. But a resolution could not be reached. "There was a meeting at Delhi between officials of BCCI and ICL to see if there was any common ground," board secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement. "The talks failed and there are no plans for any further meeting." Senior ICL official Himanshu Mody blamed the board. "They (BCCI) were not serious about resolving the issue," he told Reuters. "I doubt anything can come out in the future." The Indian board president Shashank Manohar is due to submit a detailed report on the talks to the International Cricket Council. The ICL, promoted by India's biggest listed broadcasters Zee, was launched last year and has signed up many internationals from countries like New Zealand, South Africa and Bangladesh
