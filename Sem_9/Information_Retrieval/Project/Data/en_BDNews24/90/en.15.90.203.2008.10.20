 LONDON, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hull City gatecrashed the Premier League's top four again on Sunday with a 1-0 home defeat of West Ham Unitedtheir fifth win in eight league games in their debut season in the top flight. Stoke City, another of the promoted clubs, beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 later to leave the London club rooted to the bottom of the table with just two points. Tottenham ended the game with nine men after Gareth Bale and Michael Dawson were both sent off while a third Spurs defender, Vedran Corluka, suffered a head injury and was carried from the field unconscious. Michael Turner headed Hull's winner from an Andy Dawson corner after 51 minutes to make it three consecutive wins against London clubs after away victories at Arsenal and Tottenham before the international break.

The visitors played some tidy football in response and Darren Bent equalised six minutes later. Stoke went back in front after 53 minutes when Rory Delap converted a low cross and things soon unravelled for Spurs. Corluka was caught in the head by the knee of his own goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and was carried off after a seven-minute stoppage. Ricardo Fuller then missed another penalty for Stoke before Dawson was harshly sent off for a tackle on Mamade Sidibe. Stoke remain in the relegation zone with seven points while Tottenham are now five adrift of safety. Chelsea thrashed Middlesbrough 5-0 away on Saturday while Liverpool kept pace when they beat Wigan Athletic 3-2 at hom
