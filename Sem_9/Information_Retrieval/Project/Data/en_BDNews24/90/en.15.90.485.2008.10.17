 ANKARA, Fri Oct 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A shadowy right-wing group goes on trial in Turkey on Monday on charges of trying to topple Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government. Eighty-six people, including retired army officers, the head of a small nationalist party and journalists, have been indicted in an investigation that has highlighted a power struggle between the ruling AK Party and the secularist establishment. The case has also brought some elements of the armed forces under scrutiny although the military, which has unseated four elected governments in the last 50 years, denies any link. Judges will convene in the heavily guarded Silivri prison outside Istanbul for the first hearing. The defendants are accused of planning assassinations and bombings to trigger a military intervention and the overthrow of the government. The indictment targets the ultra-nationalist group called Ergenekon, which first came to light last year when a cache of explosives was discovered in a police raid on an Istanbul house. Charges in the 2,500-page indictment include armed insurrection, aiding a terror group and possession of explosives. Most of the 100 or so detainees are open critics of the government. The arrests of two senior retired generals in July has shattered taboos in Turkey, where the military have enjoyed virtually untouchable status. An additional indictment will be made for them. Several serving officers were also detained. Political analysts say the case shows Turkey is becoming more transparent. Social and economic changes and reforms inspired by the European Union, which Turkey hopes to join, mean the Turkish state is held more accountable. "The case has been politicized and that could have undermined its potential ramifications, but there is no question that there is a fundamental change operating in Turkey," said Fadi Hakura, from the London-based Chatham House think tank. "The political and social influence of the military has been diluted and its status is being questioned," Hakura said. BATTLEFIELD Turkish courts are now the battlefield of a class conflict between the AK Party, whose roots are in political Islam, and the secularist elite that has ruled much of modern Turkey. The case has caused concern in financial markets in Turkey, where a shrinking global liquidity is expected to slow growth after years of strong economic performance. The government is also under pressure to show the trial is not a witch hunt against critics who accuse his party of harboring an Islamist agenda. Erdogan's opponents call the case revenge for a separate court case that sought but failed to ban the AK Party on charges of Islamist activities. Erdogan denies any Islamist agenda. Turkish liberals hope the case will unearth the existence of a "deep state" establishment -- code for hardline nationalists in the security forces and state bureaucracy. They say a rupture with the "deep state" would allow Turkey to push ahead with democratic reforms and join the EU, which hardline nationalists in Turkey's state apparatus resist. Plots attributed by the media to Ergenekon have included a plan to kill Nobel laureate writer Orhan Pamuk, among other intellectuals and reformers, for views deemed anti-Turkish. Turkish media has reveled at the Ergenekon case, reporting the organization was engaged in secret operations with codenames such as The Glove, Blonde Girl and Moonlight
