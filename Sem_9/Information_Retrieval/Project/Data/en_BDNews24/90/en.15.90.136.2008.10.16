 CHENNAI, Thu Oct 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of the opposition in Tamil Nadu said threats by lawmakers to bring down the central government unless India stopped an escalating war in Sri Lanka were farcical. "It's a farce ... to call for a ceasefire, as India cannot stop a civil war in another country," J. Jayalalithaa said in a statement late on Wednesday that reflected a common view that the threat would not be carried out. M. Karunanidhi, chief minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam party (DMK), a key national ally of the ruling Congress party, said this week around 39 lawmakers would quit in two weeks unless India intervened in Sri Lanka. His comments echoed increasing concern from the government's southern allies in Tamil Nadu, where the mainly Tamil population takes the view that Sri Lankan government troops are wiping out Tamils on the island. The lawmakers' resignation could force a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government, but with an election due by May 2009, analysts said the threat may be more about making political noise for their local constituencies. "There will be a lot of pressure put on the government but the members of parliament are unlikely to resign and I don't see the government falling over the issue," C. Uday Bhaskar, a strategic analyst said. Under pressure from his allies, Singh already said this week that India was concerned at the rising hostilities in Sri Lanka and called for a negotiated political settlement. More of the same may be enough to appease the lawmakers. "The government will tide over this crisis and we could see more strong statements from the government on the conflict in Sri Lanka," Bhaskar said. Sri Lankan troops stepped up their offensive against Tamil Tiger rebels fighting for a separate homeland this year and the government says its forces have killed thousands of the rebels since January. India sent peacekeepers to the Island nation in 1987, only to withdraw them after losing more than 1,000 men in battle and facing allegations of human rights violations. India has since said it does not want to get involved in Sri Lankan politics. The Tigers have waged war since 1983 to create a homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamil people, and in doing so landed on US, E U and Indian terrorism lists for widespread bombings and assassinations of rivals, including Tamils. In 1991, they were charged with killing India's former Prime Minister and Congress party leader Rajiv Gandhi
