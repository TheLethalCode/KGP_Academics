<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Miroslav Klose struck four minutes from time to give Bayern Munich a much-needed 1-0 win at Karlsruhe on Saturday while promoted Hoffenheim took over at the top with a cracking 5-2 victory at Hanover 96. Bayern were handing for another disappointing result before Klose nipped in to convert a Massimo Oddo cross and give them a first Bundesliga win in more than a month, a result that should make life a lot more comfortable for coach Juergen Klinsmann. Hoffenheim were trailing 2-1 in the second half against Hanover but four goals in a 13-minute spell took them top with 16 points from eight games. Hamburg SV, who trail them on goal difference, will reclaim the league leadership if they get at least a draw at home to Schalke 04 on Sunday. Bayer Leverkusen rose to third on 15 points with a 2-0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt, with Hertha Berlin fourth on 14 points after a 2-1 victory at home to VfB Stuttgart. Bayern stay down in 11th on 12 points after claiming what was their third win only of the league season. Werder Bremen are also in bad shape, ahead of Bayern on goal difference only, after a frantic 3-3 draw at home to Borussia Dortmund. Bremen were trailing 2-1 with the clock ticking down before Claudio Pizarro struck twice from close range to set them up for what looked like being a fortunate win. There was one final twist, however, as Dortmund rescued a point they deserved when Mohamed Zidan cracked in from the edge of the box deep into added time. CONTRASTING FORTUNES In terms of history, there could hardly be a greater contrast between Bayern, 21 times champions, and Hoffenheim, who are playing in the Bundesliga for the first time. Yet while Hoffenheim, coached by the experienced Ralf Rangnick, are enjoying their football, Bayern under Klinsmann look nervous in defence and with few ideas of how to break down teams like Karlsruhe who pack players behind the ball. Franck Ribery did manage to skip through the defence once in the first half to force a save and Bastian Schweinsteiger followed his lead soon afterwards, with the keeper turning his weak show round the post. There was precious little else in terms of invention, however, before Oddo finally injected some pace into the situation, chesting down a crossfield pass and firing over a low cross for Germany striker Klos
