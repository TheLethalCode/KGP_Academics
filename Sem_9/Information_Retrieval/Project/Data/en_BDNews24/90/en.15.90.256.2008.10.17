<TITLE> Thai PM scotches resignation, election talk </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Fri Oct 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat scotched speculation on Friday of his immediate resignation or a snap election, saying he intended to host a regional summit in Bangkok in December. "The government has a duty to carry on the policies and tasks that are coming up," he told a news conference after a hastily convened meeting of the five other parties in his beleaguered coalition government. As well as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) heads of government meeting in mid-December, Somchai cited the funeral in November of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's sister and the revered monarch's 81st birthday on Dec. 5. The coalition meeting was triggered by army chief Anupong Paochinda saying on Thursday that Somchai should step down to take responsibility for bloody clashes between police and anti-government protesters last week. With the heads of the Navy, Air Force and police sitting next to him in a live television interview Anupong said: "If I were prime minister, I would have resigned". He also stressed that the army was not about to take over only two years after its removal of Thaksin Shinawatra. But analysts read his remarks as an attempt by the army, which is under heavy pressure from the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) street movement, to undermine Somchai so much that he jumps without the need for a full-blown putsch. "The generals know another coup will isolate Thailand from the rest of the world, so they had to come out on TV to heap pressure on the government," political analyst Boonyakiat Karavekphan of Bangkok's Ramkhamhaeng University said. Somchai, Thaksin's brother-in-law and a political novice, came to power in September after a court removed his predecessor, Samak Sundaravej, for hosting a cooking show on commercial television while in office. Few analysts expected him to last more than a few months, and Anupong's comments are only likely to hasten that demise although the tactic appears not to have worked -- for now. PLEASE GO, SAYS ARMY CHIEF Somchai is due to fly to eastern Thailand on Saturday to visit troops involved in this week's clash with Cambodia around the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple, a source of tension for decades. Some analysts link the eruption of fighting on the border to the political instability that has roiled Thailand for the last three years, and which appears to be reaching another climax. "I somehow doubt that the Thai action is more than a reflection of the intense nationalism which the army feel they must demonstrate to keep the population on their side," Derek Tonkin, a former British ambassador to Thailand, said. The political crisis dates back to 2005 when the PAD, which has the explicit backing of Queen Sirikit, launched street protests against Thaksin. It has meandered through a coup to elections and back to protests and shows no signs of resolution. Even if Somchai did call a snap election, lingering rural support for Thaksin would be likely to return a broadly pro-Thaksin government, putting it on a collision course once again with the royalist and military elite in Bangkok
