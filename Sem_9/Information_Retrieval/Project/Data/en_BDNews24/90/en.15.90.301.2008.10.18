<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.c0m)  Bangladesh's hopes for the Mardeka Cup semifinals were dashed when they went one goal down to Myanmar in their second Group B match at Shah Alam Stadium in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on Saturday. Myanmar striker Soe Myantmin struck the all-important goal in the 23rd minute, said Bangladesh Football Federation. BFF added that striker Jahid Hasan Emily came close to levelling the margin, but the striker squandered an open net in the dying minute. In the other match of the same group, the Vietnam U/23 team handed a comprehensive 4-0 defeat to the Mozambique U/20 side to move up to the semifinals. Bangladesh suffered an earlier lone-goal loss to Mozambique in their opening match on Thursday. With the crucial win, Myanmar raised their hopes of qualifying for the semis, even after they conceded a 3-1 defeat to the Vietnam U/23 side in their first match, as they face Mozambique on Tuesday. Bangladesh will play their last match against Vietnam on Oct 20. Bangladesh squad: Aminul Islam, Ariful Islam, Rajani Kanta Barman, Hasan Al Mamun, Mohammad Sujon, Wali Faisal, Arman Aziz, Enamul Haq Sharif, Motiur Munna, Hedayetul Islam Robin and Jahid Hasan Emily. b
