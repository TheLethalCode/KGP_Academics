 LONDON, Fri Oct 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose back to over $70 on Friday, but unable to build on earlier gains that saw prices up more than $3 at one stage in a broad rally across financial markets. Prices drew support from OPEC's decision to bring its emergency meeting forward to next week, which has raised expectations of a supply cut. US crude for November delivery rose $0.86 to $70.71 a barrel by 9:29 a.m EDT. It touched a low of $68.57 on Thursday, its lowest since June last year. London Brent crude gained 66 cents to $68.50. "The market is up in line with other asset classes," said Thomas Stenvoll at UBS. "Oil is dependent on strength in the economy but in order to have a sustainable rally we need to have proof that it has really improved or at least it is not collapsing," he said. "And right now we are not getting that proof." Investors digested more bad news on the US economy on Friday as construction starts on US home fell to a new 17-1/2 year low in September, according to The Commerce Department's support. The news wrecked any hopes the financial markets may have had that the US housing crisis was on the mend. Analysts said oil traders were also betting that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will reduce supply to support prices when it meets next week. The producer group said on Thursday it had brought forward to Friday next week an emergency meeting to discuss the impact of global recession on oil markets. Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said he expected OPEC to cut oil production by one million barrels per day (bpd) or more at the meeting. Nigerian Oil Minister Odein Ajumogobia said the meeting was an opportunity to consider options regarding the world oil price but that no course of action had yet been proposed. Oil prices have fallen more than 50 percent from their peak above $147 a barrel hit just three months ago, depressed partly by falls in demand in the United States and other industrial countries as the credit crisis has started to affect the wider economy
