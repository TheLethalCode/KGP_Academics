<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 15 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, recently released on bail, has enquired in writing to the local government ministry why he has not been handed back charge of the mayoral office. Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, contacted for clarification on the matter, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "The mayor's letter has been sent to the law ministry for their comments. Once the local government ministry receives the law ministry's feedback on this, necessary steps will be taken in this regard." The adviser pointed out: "The higher court granted bail to the mayor on medical grounds, not to facilitate his taking over the Chittagong mayor's office again. The next steps in this regard should be taken keeping these considerations in mind." A senior ministry official told bdnews24.com: "The Chittagong mayor released on bail would like to take back charge of the mayoral office. But the acting mayor isn't obliging him because of some pertinent government restrictions." The rebuffed mayor wrote to the ministry for an explanation into the situation, the official said. Mohiuddin was released on bail at BSMMU Hospital on Oct 7, after 19 months in detention. Arrested on Mar 7 last year, the mayor returned to his home in the port city Tuesday afternoon. He flew in to Chittagong to be met by thousands of Awami League supporters as he reached his Chashma Hill residence. Speaking to reporters there, he said he intended to go abroad to visit his ailing daughter if the government permits. He also told reporters, "Awami League should take part in the national election even under emergency." He claimed the party would be victorious in any election, under emergency "or even under martial law". He nevertheless urged the withdrawal of emergency for elections, saying: "The people demand it". "So we hope government shows good sense," added the AL leader. bdnews24
