 SRINAGAR, Fri Oct 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 20 people, including six policemen, were wounded in Kashmir's main city on Friday when police clashed with hundreds of demonstrators in fresh protests against Indian rule, police and witnesses said. Police used teargas and batons to disperse hundreds of stone-throwing demonstrators shouting "We want freedom," and "La ilaha illalah" (There is no god, but Allah) in several parts of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital. The disputed Himalayan region has seen some of the biggest pro-independence demonstrations in the past two months since a separatist revolt against Indian rule erupted in 1989. At least 42 people have been killed by government forces and at least 1,000 wounded. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made a a two-day visit to Kashmir last week, when he expressed sadness over the deaths of protesters and offered fresh dialogue with the separatists to end the violence. Officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed in Kashmir in nearly two decades of violence between Indian troops and Muslim militants. Human rights groups put the toll at 60,000. The Jammu-Kashmir Coordination Committee, a new alliance of Muslim separatists and representatives of businesses and lawyers, called for the protests after Friday prayers. "I appeal to people not to indulge in violence, and protest against Indian occupation peacefully," said Yasin Malik, a senior separatist leader who led a peaceful march in the heart of Srinagar. The latest round of protests, which have become an embarrassment for New Delhi, come at a time when violence involving Indian troops and separatist guerrillas has declined significantly after India and Pakistan, which both claim the region, began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. On Thursday, a group of 19 businessmen from Pakistani Kashmir returned home after a week-long trip to the Indian side to discuss boosting trade across the frontline, parts of efforts to find a solution to the dispute. The rivals have agreed to start bilateral trade across the Line of Control, a military frontline dividing Kashmir, from Oct. 21
