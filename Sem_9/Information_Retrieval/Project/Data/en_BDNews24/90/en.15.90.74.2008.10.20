 Seoul, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's ministry responsible for ties with the North said on Monday there were no signs of unusual activity in North Korea on the day media said Pyongyang may make an important announcement. Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun said on Saturday North Korean diplomats had been told to stay close to their missions and await an important message, which could be about the health of leader Kim Jong-il, 66, or ties with the South. "We have nothing to confirm regarding Chairman Kim Jong-il's health," Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Ho-nyeon said at a news briefing. "All of the North's domestic broadcasts, its international events and domestic events are being conducted normally." South Korean media on Monday quoted informed sources as saying the reports from Japan could be inaccurate. Kim's health had been the subject of speculation after he failed to appear last month at a military parade marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the communist state. North Korean media earlier this month reported Kim's attendance at a soccer game and later released photographs of him inspecting military units. These were the first reports in the North's state media of Kim making a public appearance in about 50 days. The pictures fuelled more questions about his health because experts in the South said they appeared to be taken at least a few months ago and before the August date when US and South Korean intelligence officials said he may have suffered a stroke. Last week, the North threatened to cut all ties with the South, a major source of aid and cash, in anger at the hardline policies of the conservative president in Seoul. A sharp increase in tensions between the two Koreas could cause problems for the South by increasing its perceived political risk and making it more expensive for its companies to raise funds internationally at a time when the economy is already wobbling in the global financial crisis
