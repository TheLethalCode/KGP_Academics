<TITLE> Unhappy Frings may quit German national side </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany midfielder Torsten Frings is considering his international future after being left out of the starting line-up for two recent World Cup qualifiers. "Certainly I'm thinking of quitting," Frings told Friday's Bild newspaper after playing just six minutes as a substitute against Russia and not getting on at all against Wales. "That's not because I'm offended but because over the last few days I've had my eyes opened." Frings could become the second disgruntled player to quit Germany in a week after striker Kevin Kuranyi walked out on the team while last weekend's Russia game was still in progress. Frings would be a greater loss. The 31-year-old Werder Bremen player made his debut for Germany in 2001 and has won 78 caps and scored 10 goals. Respected for his hard work in central midfield, his good understanding with Michael Ballack and a fierce shot, he helped Germany reach the 2002 World Cup final, the semi-final in 2006, which he missed through suspension, and the final of Euro 2008. Competition for his place in the team grew during the latter tournament, after Simon Rolfes came in to replace him when he was injured and produced a memorable performance in the quarter-final win over Portugal. Frings was recalled for the semi-final and final but further injury problems kept him out of the first two World Cup qualifiers this season and coach Joachim Loew preferred Thomas Hitzlsperger for the recent wins over Russia and Wales
