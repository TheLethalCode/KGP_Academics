 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - BNP has informed a UN delegation that it will not participate in the Dec 18 national polls under the state of emergency. "Holding a free and fair election is not possible amid the state of emergency. If the government wants to stage elections under emergency, BNP won't take part in them," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after a meeting with the delegation on Saturday. "We have stated our position to the UN delegation as they wanted to know," he said. A visiting UN team on political affairs for South Asia, Asia and the Pacific region, headed by Hitoki Den, is meeting with stakeholders ahead of the December elections and in preparation for UN chief Ban Ki Moon's tour at the start of November. The delegation met with the BNP secretary general at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. UN resident coordinator in Bangladesh, Renata Dessalien told reporters after the meeting that they were still optimistic a free and fair election would be held in time with the participation of all parties, to restore a democratic government. Winning and defeated parties would work together for the sake of the country, she hoped. In reply to a query, Delwar said: "We want to hold another dialogue with the government before Oct 20. But we are not getting any response from the government." "We hope they will let us give us a date very soon," he said. BNP would decide on registering with the Election Commission after an accord was reached in talks with the government, Delwar reiterated. He also remarked that the foreign diplomats in Bangladesh should not make any remarks that may spoil the electoral atmosphere. "We hope that they will follow diplomatic etiquette and rules in line with Vienna convention," he said. BNP standing committee members AR Goni, Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui, M Shamsul Islam, vice president MK Anwar and joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan also attended the meeting. The UN team also met with Awami League on Friday. bdnew
