 MUMBAI, Oct 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 200 employees fired by top Indian private carrier Jet Airways staged a noisy protest on Thursday, while politicians weighed in on their side, demanding an inquiry into job losses in the struggling industry. Jet Airways said on Wednesday it would lay off 1,100 staff in the next few days, on top of the 800 flight attendants already retrenched, as part of efforts to cope with slowing demand, high fuel prices and the global credit crunch. The job losses and protests have struck in an industry at the heart of India's economic modernisation, with millions of middle-class Indians taking to the skies and carriers employing thousands of young men and women in glamorous jobs. The airlines are asking for the government to bail them out, but the government, already facing a fiscal squeeze, has so far done nothing to help. Nevertheless, Petroleum Minister Murli Deora said it was the wrong time for Jet to be laying off employees, while Labour and Employment Minister Oscar Fernandes asked for a urgent report. A spokeswoman for Jet Airways, which had a total staff of around 13,000 people, declined comment. "We want our jobs back," shouted Jet employees, dressed in the airline's canary yellow and navy blue uniform, pumping their fists in the air, outside the office in Mumbai. Analysts and activists said the sudden layoffs left the employees, who were mostly on contract or probation, with few options. "They have been terminated without notice, and they have little by way of legal recourse now," said Vinod Shetty, a lawyer and consumer activist. They have found support from local party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, which reported by local media to be in talks with Jet officials for the reinstatement of employees from the state. An analyst said job cuts were necessary, as airlines bloated by recent expansion adjust to the new reality of falling demand. "When the industry is going through a tough time and the airline is posting losses and has no access to capital, it needs to do everything possible to cut costs," said Kapil Kaul, chief executive in India for the Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation. MORE LAYOFFS Archaic labour laws that make it hard to lay off employees have led to a policy of hiring more contract workers in India, which has sparked protests at the Indian units of Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co in recent years. Last month, sacked employees beat to death the India head of an Italian industrial gear manufacturing company near Delhi. The Indian aviation industry, which had grown at an average annual pace of more than 25 percent in the past few years in a booming economy, is forecast to post combined losses of nearly $2 billion in the year to March 2009. That would be the biggest loss outside the United States, the International Air Transport Association has said. Jet Airways, which has said it expects to break even in the full year to March 2010, has struggled to raise money, with the turbulent market delaying a planned $400 million rights issue as well as a stake sale by founder Naresh Goyal. Jet, which on Monday announced a code-sharing alliance with No. 2 carrier Kingfisher Airlines to cut costs, has put its international expansion plans on hold and trimmed capacity
