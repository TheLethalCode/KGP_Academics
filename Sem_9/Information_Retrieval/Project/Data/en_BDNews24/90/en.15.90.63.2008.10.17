<TITLE> Zimbabwe MDC says UN, AU mediation needed in talks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HARARE, Fri Oct 17, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's opposition MDC said on Friday the United Nations and African Union should step in to mediate between the country's rivals if talks aimed at rescuing a power-sharing deal remain deadlocked over cabinet posts. "They (the UN and AU) are the guarantors of the (power-sharing) agreement. If ZANU-PF continues to be intransigent, then those institutions should step in," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said. President Robert Mugabe, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara of a splinter MDC faction have failed to reach a deal on forming a cabinet in three days of talks and were due to start another round of negotiations on Friday. Supporters of Mugabe earlier accused the MDC of "bad faith" and of stalling to try to bring about UN mediation, while the MDC blamed the delay on ZANU-PF's "inflexibility." The power-sharing deal, brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki a month ago, is seen as Zimbabwe's best hope for rescuing an economy where fuel, food and foreign exchange are scarce, and inflation stands at 231 million percent. Tsvangirai threatened to pull out on Sunday after Mugabe allocated powerful ministries such as defense, finance and home affairs -- which controls the police -- to his ZANU-PF party. Chamisa said the MDC was ready to compromise, but "not to the point of betrayal," and would not settle for being the junior partner in a Mugabe-led government. "Once they start to show they are willing to show sensitivity to the suffering of the people, I have no doubt we will be able to pull through," he said by telephone when asked about the prospects for a deal. Asked when he arrived for talks if he was expecting a breakthrough on Friday, Tsvangirai told reporters: "We all have to have hope, don't we?" "PRAGMATISM" Mutambara said "flexibility and pragmatism" must force the rivals to end the impasse. "We share the pain and suffering of our people. Surely, this must force us to agree on this debate on cabinet and move on to the core business of running our country," he told reporters. The official Herald newspaper quoted ZANU-PF sources on Friday as saying Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) -- which it calls MDC-T -- had a hidden agenda. "Insiders privy to the discussions told the Herald it appeared as if the MDC-T was negotiating in bad faith and angling for a deadlock in the hope that the mediation would be taken out of the hands of comrade Mbeki and assumed by the African Union and the United Nations," it said. The paper's sources said Tsvangirai was acting under pressure from the United States and Britain. The MDC has accused Mbeki in the past of favoring Mugabe. It has toned down its criticism since Mbeki brokered the power-sharing deal
