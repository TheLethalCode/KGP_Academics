 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission welcomed Awami League's application for registration, along with a draft of its amended constitution, on Wednesday. AL office secretary advocate Abdul Mannan Khan and deputy office secretary ABM Mozammel Haque submitted the application form to deputy secretary to the EC Secretariat Jasmine Tuli shortly before 3 pm. "We have submitted the application along with the party constitution, including draft amendments, and other necessary documents in line with new electoral law," Abdul Mannan told bdnews24.com. Election commissioner Muhammed Sohul Hussain said AL's registration with the EC was an important step towards the elections. "The commission has extended the deadline for registration by five days in response to the appeals of the four-party alliance." "We hope the major parties will ensure their participation in the elections by registering with the commission." Fellow commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain also welcomed the application for registration by AL as very encouraging. He told bdnews24.com: "We are happy that Awami League, one of the major parties of the country, has applied for registration." "We hope the other parties, including BNP, will apply for the same within the new deadline," he said. On a much-debated subject, Sakhawat said that the EC did not have any problem with associated organisations of parties. "But if a party wants to get registered it cannot mention its associated organisations (students, labour and professionals) in the party constitution," he said. AL's presidium has approved amendments to its constitution keeping associate organisation and overseas units. Party leaders have said the associate organisations will run according to their own constitution and AL's central working committee will have no control in running them. Jatiya Party, National Awami Party, Forward Party, Gono Oikyo Front are among the 25 parties have applied for registration since Aug 26. The deadline for registration is Oct 20. bdnews
