The BNP chairperson arrived at the court premises to be met by intense crowds of supporters jamming the streets and breaking into demonstrations. Thousands of BNP supporters thronged the approach to Old Dhaka's session courts since morning as word had it that the party chief was on her way. Chief political correspondent Sumon Mahmud reports, the crowds brought traffic to a standstill and security men were forced to virtually close the court premises allowing only lawyers to enter. Others accused in the case, M Shamsul Islam, Motiur Rahman Nizami and MK Anwar, also arrived for the hearing.
