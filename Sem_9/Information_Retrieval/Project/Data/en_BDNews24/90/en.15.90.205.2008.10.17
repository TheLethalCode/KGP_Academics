<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)Powdered milk of different brands which have tested positive in at least one laboratory for the contaminant melamine are being sold in the city, as traders have yet to receive any guideline regarding sale of the products. The sellers Friday said neither the company nor anybody from the government gave them any directive on whether to take the brands off their shelves. The government, in an official handout Thursday, advised people against eight foreign makes of powdered milk until further notice, after the products tested positive for melamine content at a Dhaka University lab. The eight brands are: Australian brands Diploma and Red Cow, Danish brand Dano Full Cream, Chinese brands Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2 and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. However, out of the eight only one brand tested positive for melamine at two other labs, including the BSTI laboratory. The brand that tested positive in all three labs was Yashili-1 of China. On a visit to the kitchen market adjacent to New Market Friday morning, a bdnews24.com correspondent found that powdered milk of five different makes from the suspected eight were being sold at Tazbid Store. Seller Abdus Salam said: "We have heard that the government has advised not to consume powdered milk of some companies. But the companies have not yet to tell us anything. If the company does not take back the goods, what can we do  we have to survive." Ahsan Habib, owner of another shop, said: "No one came or gave us any instruction, verbally or in writing. "We have been selling these brands for long and never heard of any complaint or any harm caused to anybody." Asadul Islam and wife Mariam Tabassum were seen buying Dano milk powder at New Market. They said they had not seen the morning newspaper, and so had no knowledge of the government advice. Asadul said, "We have been using this brand for long. We never faced any problem." Modasser, a grocer at Topkhana Road, said Friday noon: "People are buying and we are selling. Since morning, we have sold four 400-gram packs of Red Cow and Nido." At Atish Dipankar Road at Basabao, these brands were being sold at the shops. Salesman Ibrahim at Ratul Store said, "People are asking and we are responding. Nobody told us not to." These brands were also being sold in different shops at Dhanmondi and Sat Masjid Road. Aziz, a shopkeeper at Shankar, said in the evening that he sold the brands all day Friday. "However, the sale of milk powder has dropped significantly." Some of the big superstores in Dhanmondi were seen offering these brands. Some shop staff, speaking on condition of anonymity, said these brands were kept on the shelves but sale was much less than normal. "If anyone objects we advise them not to buy," said one. "Our authorities have informed us that they have not received any directive."
