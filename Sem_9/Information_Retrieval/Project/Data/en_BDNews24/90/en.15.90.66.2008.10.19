 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday rejected a bail petition by Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed in a high-profile corruption case, and ordered him to surrender to trial court within two weeks. The High Court bench of Justice Mohammad Anwarul Haq and Justice Farah Mahbub also ordered law enforcing agencies not to arrest or harass him during the time. The Jamaat leader, facing an arrest warrant in the Barapukuria graft case, appeared before the High Court Sunday afternoon for the bail hearing with a tight police cordon secured around the court premises. The bench in its ruling said the High Court and the Appellate Division had rejected earlier bail petitions by Mojaheed. The court also mentioned that the trial court had declared him a fugitive in the case since an arrest was issued. In this situation the court is not willing to grant him bail. His stance is not fit for considering bail prayer. So he has been ordered to surrender at the trial court in two weeks. The law enforcing agency has been directed not to arrest or harass him during the time. His lawyers had submitted the bail petition in the morning. Mojaheed's lawyer barrister Abdur Razzak told the court at the time that his client could not appear in before the court as police "were surrounding his home". Security measures were heightened in and around the High Court premises as lawyers submitted the bail appeal, with law enforcers checking all vehicles on entry while huge numbers of Jamaat and Shibir activists thronged the area. Mojaheed's lawyer barrister, Abdur Razzak said after the hearing: "The court has ordered Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid to surrender in two weeks. He cannot be arrested or harassed during the time." Anticorruption Commission lawyer Khurshid Alam Khan told bdnews24.com: "The court has rejected the bail prayer. Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed will have to surrender to the trial court in two weeks." The ACC pressed charges on Oct 5 accusing 16 people in the case, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and former ministers of her government. The court issued arrest warrants against several accused the following day, including Mojaheed. He has since been named 'fugitive' in the case by police who have failed to arrest him so far. The commission filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of incurring losses of Tk 158.71 core to the state due to an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). bdnew
