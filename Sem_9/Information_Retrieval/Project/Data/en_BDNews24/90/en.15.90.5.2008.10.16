<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)The country's top taxman has warned those failing to declare undisclosed income by the Oct 31 deadline will suffer a constant thorn in their side. "The government gave four months to disclose undeclared earnings. The deadline will not be extended under any circumstances," NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Mazid said Thursday. "NBR officials will start their drive from Nov 1 against those who miss this opportunity," Mazid told a programme designed to motivate doctors. "They will face questions everywhere .. not just from NBR officials, people from other government agencies will ask questions," Mazid said at the Dhaka Medical College and Hospital. The chairman said the most NBR cases last year involved "undeclared income" while others were about false statements on wealth and property and tax evasion. "NBR is considering introducing a fixed amount of VAT for each patient," Mazid told doctors, calling upon them to pay tax. The government introduced a 4.5 percent VAT on the fees of a doctor in 2007-08. The rate remained unchanged for 2008-09. The views-exchange meeting was held at the lecture gallery-1 of DMCH. The Dhaka Tax Zone-8 organised the meeting addressed by Director of Dhaka Medical College Hospital brigadier general Abdus Shahid Khan, principal of Dhaka Medical College Prof Qazi Deen Mohammad, NBR income tax policy section member Parsa Begum, and commissioner of tax zone-8 Rahela Begum.
