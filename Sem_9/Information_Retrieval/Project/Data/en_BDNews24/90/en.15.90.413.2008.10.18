 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed hopes the newly opened Asian University for Women in Chittagong will help spread the 'Asian Miracle'experienced so far in a few Asian countriesmore widely throughout the region. "Here in Asia, the most successful new economies in the world today exist side by side with the largest concentration of the poor in the world. A new Asian identity, I believe, can help this region turn the extraordinary economic strides made by a few Asian countries, known as the 'Asian Miracle', into a truly Asian phenomenon," he said Saturday. Fakhruddin addressing a programme of the university at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, lauded the university's commitment to be open to students of all backgrounds, and in particular its decision to reserve one-half of its places for those who are the first in their families to enter higher education. "As higher education runs the risk of becoming a purview of the economically well-off and the socially privileged  the AUW can help a new pathway for families to break the vicious cycle of social exclusion." "The results will be not just fairness of opportunity but also the ability to harness new talents in the service of our communities," said the CA, who is also chief patron of the university. Grameen Bank founder and Nobel laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus, AUW acting vice chancellor Dr Hoon Eng Koo, chairman of the AUW Support Foundation Jack Meyer, and AUW Support Foundation president and CEO Dr Kamal Ahmed were among those who also spoke. Prof Yunus said the AUW would be a melting pot for Asia, bringing together languages, religions, nationalities, attitudes and values. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate said AUW students would be "problem-solvers, not castle-builders", adding that he hoped that the daughters of common people would get access to higher education through the university. AUW, established with the aim of providing higher education to poor and meritorious students of South and Southeast Asia, began formal educational activities in April, with 131 students enrolled from seven countries. Its temporary campus on Mohammad Ali Road is being run with direct supervision of volunteer organisation AUW Support Foundation, and is being financed by funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID among others. Construction of the permanent campus on a 200-acre site, at Jangal Salimpur on the port city outskirts, is in progress and is expected to be completed by 2010. Students from Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and Nepal rounded off Saturday's event with a culture programme.
