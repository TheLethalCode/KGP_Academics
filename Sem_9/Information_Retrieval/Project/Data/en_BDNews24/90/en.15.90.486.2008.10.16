 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Marking World Food Day 2008, in a year that has seen food security threatened worldwide, the chief adviser stressed boosting domestic output in hand with ensuring availability for all as the twin challenges to overcoming the threat in Bangladesh. "Food security does not only mean increased production of food grains. It also means people having access to adequate, safe and nutritious food within their means for a sound life," Fakhruddin Ahmed said, addressing the inauguration of a two-day agriculture fair to mark the day at the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre. This year's World Food Day theme is: 'World Food Security: the Challenges of Climate Change and Bio-energy'. "Many countries are now cultivating bio fuel crops for alternative energy due to volatility in availability and price of oil in the global market," the CA said of the global food crunch. Mentioning the key domestic threats, the CA said: "Food security is threatened by loss of grains and crops due to climate change and by growing demand." "The impact of climate change is most vivid in our country. Last year's consecutive floods and cyclone Sidr ravaged our agricultural sector and crop production," Fakhruddin said. "Immediately after Sidr, we faced a further crisis in import of rice, as rice exporting nations started banning exports." "The government has since moved to increase internal food production." "To ensure food security we have to in turn ensure unhampered security of farmers," the CA said. But, Fakhruddin stressed: "We can only say that we have achieved food security when there is sufficient food supply at national level so that every family is able to procure sufficient and nutritious food as per their requirements." Fakhruddin mentioned various government initiatives, including cash and food for work programmes, VGD, VGF and OMS programmes. He pointed out that government stocks of food grains now stand at about 13 lakh tonnes, the highest in the span of the last eight years. The chief adviser also announced that one day in the year will be declared 'national agriculture day'. In his speech as chair on the occasion, agriculture adviser CS Karim said about 17 percent of the country's landmass may go under water as global sea level rises affect Bangladesh through this century. As evacuated populations will be settling on higher grounds, the population density may reach 2,000 people per square kilometre, he said. "Droughts and floods affect our agriculture seriously," the adviser said, stressing the need for adapting agriculture modes to changing environments based on appropriate knowledge and technologies. Karim cited the BR-33 paddy variety as an example of technological innovation which is expected to curb the winter 'monga' (income and food scarcity) in future. "The bumper Boro harvest last winter was a phenomenal," he said. "As was the Aus harvest, and the Aman crop carries similar promises." "And behind all these successes, our farmers' hands were instrumental," the adviser said. Ad Spijkers, FAO representative in Bangladesh, said World Food Day should be marked by every country commiting to do its best to alleviate global hunger and poverty. Climate change induced adversities will necessitate higher levels of investments in agriculture, Spijkers said, toward which all must lend a hand in creating global frameworks for substantial investments for agriculture in poorer, food-deficit countries. The government has chalked out various programmes to mark World Food Day on Thursday. The agriculture ministry is hosting the two-day agriculture fair at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. The fair is being supported by the FAO, the ministries of food and disaster management, environment and forest, livestock and fisheries, and water resources and private companies. bdnews24.c
