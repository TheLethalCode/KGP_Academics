 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)The number of political parties participating in the 9th Jatiya Sangsad election is likely to fall to around one quarter of the parties that contested the previous election, estimates election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain. The commissioner told bdnews24.com Saturday the number of parties in the fray looks to come down significantly with compulsory registration, hinting at efforts to eliminate rubber stamp parties. Candidates will also be fewer this time round, he said, as there is no scope for 'dissident candidates' and strict conditions have been imposed on those willing to run as independents. More than 2,000 candidates, nominated by around 75 parties as well as independents, submitted nomination papers ahead of the general election scheduled for January 2007, later-cancelled. EC officials say a record 81 parties contested the 1996 general election, while the seventh 1991 parliamentary polls saw the record of 3,855 candidates submitting nomination papers. Says commissioner Sakhawat: "The political parties' applying for registration have proved that they want to establish and practice the democratic process within their parties." "We hope all those wanting to participate in the election will complete their registration by October 20." He said the committee for scrutiny of registration applications has been reviewing the papers of those parties which have already applied. Some 150 political parties collected registration forms , with 30 parties applying to date. EC officials estimate the number of applications will not exceed 40 by the Oct 20 deadline. Sakhawat believes no more than 25 will qualify for registration meeting all the conditions. The number of candidates may be little over 1,500, he added. An official of the scrutiny committee told bdnews24.com the application of Awami League would be reviewed on Sunday. They will have completed scrutiny of papers submitted by 25 parties, who applied before AL, by Sunday, they added. Information is being collected from field level to scrutinise the information supplied by parties in their applications. The committee has already recommended rejection of some, they added. The 9th Jatiya Sangsad election has been announced for Dec 18. The schedule for the election is set to be given by Nov 2. bdnews
