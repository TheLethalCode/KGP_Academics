 CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand will bank on spin to beat Bangladesh in the two-test series starting in Chittagong on Friday, said skipper Daniel Vettori. "Our spin options are well covered up and if we play on the same pitch where we played the third ODI, it will be slow. But we will wait and see. It may dust up a bit and crumble at the later stage," Vettori told reporters on Thursday. New Zealand have added off-spinner Jeetan Patel to the starting line-up alongside left-arm spinner Vettori while uncapped batsman Jesse Ryder was also included. Vettori took 12 wickets when New Zealand last played test match in Bangladesh in 2004. "We have played a lot of ODIs, but not a test in subcontinent in four years. But that is not a concern," Vettori said. "If we can play to 50 per cent of our ability we should not have a problem in winning this test series." New Zealand came from behind to win the one-day series 2-1, thanks to 79-run victory in the third match. Bangladesh, who have won just one of their 53 tests, also named two spinners -- Abdur Razzak and Shakib Al Hasan -- beside spinning all-rounders Mehrab Hossain and Naeem Islam. Mehrab has just played one test and Naeem will make his debut. "We expect the ball to come slowly onto the bat on this wicket. If it happens our spinners can do a trick for us," said Bangladesh skipper Mohammad Ashraful Bangladesh - Mohammad Ashraful (capt), Mashrafe Mortaza, Tamim Iqbal, Shakib Al Hasan, Zunaed Siddique, Rajin Saleh, Mehrab Hossain, Naeem Islam, Mushfiqur Rahim, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain. New Zealand: Daniel Vettori (capt), Daniel Flynn, Jamie How, Brendon McCullum, Kyle Mills, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Aaron Redmond, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor
