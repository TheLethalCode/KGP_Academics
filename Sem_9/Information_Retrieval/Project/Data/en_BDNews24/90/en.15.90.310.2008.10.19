 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)--Adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman Sunday brushed aside concerns that remain in some quarters over holding the national polls by the announced date, on Dec 18. "I believe the issue is not important. In fact, each and every stakeholder is acting responsibly towards holding the polls," Zillur told reporters following a seminar at the city's Sonargaon Hotel. The seminar, titled Trade Facilitation in South Asia, was co-organised by SAARC Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCI) and the Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FBCCI). Speaking as chief guest at the seminar, Zillur said there was no visible improvement in the levels of trust among SAARC member countries, which is leading to trade imbalances. The adviser called for immediate initiatives to narrow any 'psychological barriers' between SAARC countries, along with unnecessary trade barriers. SCCI chief Tariq Sayeed and FBCCI president Annisul Huq also addressed the seminar, which was attended by local and regional business leaders. bd
