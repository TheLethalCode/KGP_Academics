<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  In a year that has been marked by a global food crunch, the government has decided to double the next Boro season's direct subsidy to farmers, an official of the agriculture ministry said on the eve of World Food Day. Anwar Faruque, director general of the ministry's seed wing told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that some 66 lakh farmers had received cash in hand subsidies totalling Tk 249 crore ahead of 2008's Boro production. "The amount will be nearly twice as much this time, and will cover more farmers," the DG said. Speaking earlier at a press conference ahead of World Food Day, Faruque said the amount of subsidy was being almost doubled in order to meet the 1.8 crore tonne target for the 2009 Boro season. A special report by FAO and WFP published in August estimated last Boro season's production was some 17 percent higher than the previous yearthough the report added that poverty was still on the rise due to spiralling food prices, it said. The 2008 Boro rice output was estimated at 1.7 million tonnes, up by 17.2 percent from the previous year and 29.3 percent above the five-year average. The study said the rise in Boro output was due to favourable weather as well extra efforts of farmers and government in the wake of high prices and crop losses in 2007 after two consecutive floods and Cyclone Sidr. This year's theme for World Food Day is 'World Food Security: The Challenges of Climate Change and Bio Energy'. Faruque said climate change was affecting the quality of food grains, which was in turn leading to research on new varieties of paddy. He also pointed out that a worldwide increase in bio fuels for energy needs had hit global food production. The DG of the seed wing said research was on to invent new varieties of paddy for wetlands, adding that one such variety had been invented that would survive 14 days under water. He said it would soon be possible to cultivate Boro paddy on 1 lakh hectares of coastal wetland thanks to the success of Bangladeshi researchers. Ad Spijkers, Food and Agriculture Organisation representative in Bangladesh, said overall food production rose last year in Bangladesh by up to 18 percent. He hoped the country would not have to depend on others for food in future. Bangladesh would rather export food, he added. Earlier this moth, the government announced it was raising diesel imports for the upcoming Boro season and would ensure navigability of rivers for smooth supply to farmers of the irrigation fuel, to boost farm production. In September, Bangladesh Bank made it mandatory for all local and foreign banks to distribute farming loans, and introduced a three-year revolving crop credit limit in a bid to ensure future food security. The government has chalked out various programmes to mark World Food Day on Thursday. The agriculture ministry is hosting a two-day agriculture fair at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed will inaugurate the event. The fair is being supported by the FAO, the ministries of food and disaster management, environment and forest, livestock and fisheries, and water resources and private companies. bdnews
