 NAZRAN, Russia, Sat Oct 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two Russian soldiers were killed in an ambush in the Caucasus region of Ingushetia on Saturday, authorities said, and unofficial sources said the death toll could be much higher. A spokeswoman for the regional Interior Ministry said a 10-vehicle column of Interior Ministry troops had been attacked with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic gunfire which killed two soldiers and wounded nine. A regional law enforcement source said earlier 40 had died. "This is not true," the Interior Ministry spokeswoman said. Interior Ministry troops sealed off the area to search for the attackers, making independent confirmation unfeasible. Russian television showed vehicles stopped at police checkpoints. It was one of the most serious in a recent series of attacks on troops in Ingushetia, a small territory bordering Chechnya. A toll of 40 would make it the most deadly. The law enforcement source said all but one soldier in the column was killed. "The soldiers didn't even manage to resist, because several rocket-propelled grenades hit their trucks," the source said, adding that three armored personnel carriers and two trucks had been hit by automatic rifle fire and grenades. The Interior Ministry spokeswoman said the convoy had come under fire near between the villages of Muzhichi and Galashki, about 25 km (15 miles) east of the regional capital Nazran and almost within sight of the border with Chechnya
