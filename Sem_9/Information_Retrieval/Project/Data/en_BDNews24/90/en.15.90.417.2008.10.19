<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Sun Oct 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tzipi Livni is expected to step up efforts to put together a coalition government and become Israel's prime minister, after the expiry on Monday of an original 28-day period to form her administration. Foreign Minister Livni has been trying to forge political partnerships since she was elected leader of the centrist Kadima party last month, taking over from Ehud Olmert who resigned as prime minister in a corruption scandal. She was likely to meet President Shimon Peres on Monday to ask him for a two-week extension he is allowed to approve under Israeli law, a spokesman for Livni said. There is little doubt in Israel that Peres will do so, especially since a series of Jewish holidays this month has cut into her negotiating time. The question remains whether Livni, who has already won preliminary agreement from Defense Minister Ehud Barak's Labor Party to join a coalition under her leadership, can persuade the ultra-Orthodox Shas party to sign up. For Barak, a former prime minister who readily acknowledges he lacks sufficient public support to regain the office if a national election was held now, the power equation is simple. bdnews24.com/lq/1720 hrs. "If a government is established, there won't be elections," he said on Army Radio. "I know the truth is that I don't have the political backing to be prime minister. I had the option, which I have chosen, to be a senior partner to Tzipi Livni," Barak said. Olmert remains in office in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed. THIN MARGIN With Labor in her corner, Livni would control 48 of the 120 seats in parliament. Shas's membership would boost that number to 60, a wafer-thin coalition but enough to block the opposition from toppling her government in no-confidence votes. Winning the support of smaller factions, such as the Pensioners party, with seven lawmakers, and left-wing Meretz, with five, would give Livni a stronger mandate to pursue policies that include peacemaking with the Palestinians. Shas, which has long billed itself as a party that represents Israel's poor, has been demanding increased government spending of about 1 billion shekels ($270 million) on social welfare as a price for joining a Livni-led coalition. Negotiations between Kadima and Shas are likely to be stepped up, amid speculation that Livni intends to present a government when parliament reconvenes on October 27 after its summer recess. Without Shas, she could form a minority government relying on precarious support from outside the coalition of left-wing and Arab parties wary of a national ballot that opinion polls show Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud would win. "She could go to the Knesset (to ratify a government) with the seats she already has, but she believes she can do it in the end," Gil Messing, a Livni spokesman, said about her efforts to enlist at least 60
