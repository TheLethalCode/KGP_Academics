 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Truth and Accountability Commission has summoned 17 top BTCL and BRTA officials with suspected corruption ties, commission chairman Justice Habibur Rahman Khan said on Wednesday. At a regular press briefing at the commission's office, Justice Khan said the truth commission got the names of the 17 from clemency-seekers who have previously confessed to the commission. Justice Khan said the TAC would take legal action against the officials of Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited and Bangladesh Road Transport Authority if they refused to appear before the commission. Allegations against the officials were extreme, Justice Khan said. He said the suspects were accused of pocketing huge amounts of money from the government through misappropriation using means such as 'fake budgets'. Some of the named officials had retired from service, he added. Member of the commission, Manzur Rashid Khan, said the suspects had been notified of the allegations against them. He said it had become clear to the TAC in two and half months how corruption takes place and who does it. Another TAC member Asif Ali said most of those applying to the commission for clemency were government employees. Some of them were from semi-government bodies. Asif Ali said the TAC would ask the government to provide guidance in the form of counselling or behavioural treatment for officials of graft-ridden organisations in a bid to prevent institutional corruption. Habibur Rahman Khan said the commission had received 313 applications for clemency hearings to date. The commission had held 150 hearings so far. Out of 313, only 17 people applied to the commission of their own accord. The rest of the cases were recommended by the Anticorruption Commission and the National Coordination Committee on serious crimes. The TAC has received Tk 10.17 crore of a total Tk 19.69 crore in illegal earnings it has ordered returned to the state. The commission has issued 18 letters of clemency. b
