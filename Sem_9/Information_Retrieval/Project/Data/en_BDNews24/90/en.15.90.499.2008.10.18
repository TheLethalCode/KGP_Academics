 New Delhi, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India will deploy a warship in the Gulf of Aden to guard its merchant ships from Somali pirates, but ship owners said on Friday that it was not enough to instil confidence among sailors. The warship with marine commandos and helicopters on board will escort Indian ships passing through the region, considered one of the world's most dangerous stretches of water for piracy, a navy spokesman said on Friday. "The ship has set sail for Africa and will start its anti-piracy patrolling near Somalia soon," the navy officer said. A Japanese-owned merchant vessel carrying a 22-member crew, including 18 Indians, was hijacked by Somali pirates last month in the Gulf of Aden. Family members of the missing Indians, who are all being held hostage, have appealed to the government to negotiate their release. The government says it is in touch with local authorities and is trying to prevent similar incidents in future. "The presence of Indian Navy in the area will help to protect our sea borne trade and instil confidence in our sea faring community," a defence ministry statement said. At least 25 Indian ships pass through the Gulf of Aden every month, but Indian crew members are afraid to sail through the region, an official of the Indian National Ship Owners Association (INSA) said. "Just two weeks ago, crew members of a mercantile ship turned back and the crew wanted to leave the ship in the high seas," Shashank Kulkarni, Secretary General of INSA told Reuters from Mumbai. "One Indian warship cannot do much, as there are other foreign ships patrolling the region, but piracy has increased and taken a dangerous turn now." Of the 24 Somali incidents recorded in April-June period this year, 19 occurred in the Gulf of Aden, where at least eight vessels reported being fired on by pirates with rocket propelled grenade launchers and automatic weapons. "The pirates have sophisticated weapons and can blow up a ship if needed," Sudhir Rangnekar, former director of the Shipping Corporation of India said. b
