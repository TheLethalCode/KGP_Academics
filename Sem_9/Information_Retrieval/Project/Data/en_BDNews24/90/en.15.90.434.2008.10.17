 ISLAMABAD Fri Oct 17,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One of the two Chinese telecommunication engineers kidnapped by Taliban militants along with two Pakistanis has been recovered after seven weeks in captivity, a military spokesman said on Friday. The two Chinese and a Pakistani driver and a guard were kidnapped in the northwestern town of Dir near the Afghan border on August 29 while returning to a guest house after working on a telecommunications tower. A Taliban spokesman based in the Swat Valley, to the east of Dir, later claimed responsibility and said abductions would continue until the government stopped attacks on militants. "One Chinese engineer has been recovered by security forces," said a military spokesman. He gave no details as to how and where the man was seized. Earlier, a Pakistan television station said the two Chinese had escaped from their captors when they were being moved but one was recaptured and wounded with a gunshot to a foot. Security has deteriorated sharply in Pakistan in recent months with troops battling militants in parts of the northwest. A Polish engineer who was kidnapped last month near the northwestern town of Attock said in a video message aired by a television station this week he was being held by Taliban. Police are also searching for Afghanistan's top diplomat in Pakistan, ambassador-designate Abdul Khaliq Farahi, who was kidnapped on September 22 in the northwestern city of Peshawar. A week later, security officials said Farahi had been freed but police said that was not true
