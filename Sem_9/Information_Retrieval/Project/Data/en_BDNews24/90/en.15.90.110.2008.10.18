 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League will sit in another dialogue session with the government, a senior party leader said Saturday. AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said the date of the dialogue would be fixed in a day or two. Speaking to reporters at his NAM flat residence Saturday, he said: "The government has contacted Awami League for another round of dialogue." He said the party would raise withdrawal of emergency for polls, permanent release of Sheikh Hasina, deferment of upazila elections, amendments to the new Representation of the People Ordinance in the ensuing dialogue. Some post-election issues would also be on the agenda, he added, saying: "Awami League wants to ensure that the constitutional bodies like the Election Commission, Public Service Commission, ACC and judiciary do not fall into the hands of partisan people after elections." "Whatever parliament is formed through a free, fair and acceptable election there must be some legal surety for the good works of this government." "Not only AL, everybody should assure continuity of this government's successes." Ashraf was positive that the parliamentary election would be held as scheduled on Dec 18. He said the international community was in favour of the election. "The political parties and the people also want election." "The chief adviser in his address to the nation said the election would be held on December 18. He repeated it in his addresses to the UN and the Commonwealth" The AL leader also pointed out that the Election Commission had finalised the voter list and parties are registering. "Therefore, I am not ready to accept that the election would not be held." He added that after Sheikh Hasina returns home Awami League would start election activities at full throttle. But, he said, if Sheikh Hasina is not given permanent release they would go for a stronger movement. "I hope that it would not be necessary." bdnew
