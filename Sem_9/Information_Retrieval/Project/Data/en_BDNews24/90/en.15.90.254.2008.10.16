 Dhaka, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had talks with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and two other election commissioners on preparations for elections on Thursday. After a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said they primarily focused on the December national election. "We apprised the CA of our overall preparation for the national polls," Sakhawat told bdnews24.com. Registration of political parties and the tasks of the EC were also on the agenda. Wrapping up exams at all educational institutions by November, appointment and training of election officials, and the law and order situation were also discussed at the meeting. The EC has extended the deadline for political parties to apply for registration by Oct 20. As of Thursday, 29 political parties including Awami League had applied. BNP and its allies, however, have so far refused to take a decision on registration, saying it would not be possible before further talks and consensus with the government on several debated issues. BNP leaders say they expect to have another dialogue with the government before Oct 20. Sakhawat Hussain said that the state of emergency came up for discussion at the meeting, with the CA stressing that the government would soon take a decision on the matter. The CEC had said earlier in the week that any specific clauses in Emergency Powers Rules to which parties objected, they should discuss directly with the government in dialogue. The national election is set for Dec 18, and upazila polls for Dec 24 and 28. The CEC has said the schedule for polls would be announced by Nov 2. Advisers were also present in Thursday's meeting. bdnews
