 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - BNP and its political ally Jamaat-e-Islami will apply for registration to the Election Commission by the EC's deadline for application, party leaders said Sunday. BNP's decision to register was made to safeguard the party, secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at his NAM flat Sunday. Earlier in the day, a BNP delegation led by joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan had collected the registration form from the EC. Jamaat assistant secretary general Quamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com that his party would also apply on Monday, as a Jamaat team collected a form earlier in the day. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, meanwhile, has called an emergency meeting of the party's standing committee for Sunday evening at her Gulshan office to amend the party constitution for registration with the EC, office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. On BNP's registration Delwar told reporters: "Though we have placed a seven-point proposal to the government we have not received any response from them yet." "But tomorrow is the last date for registration. Under the circumstance we have decided to go for registration to safeguard the party's survival," he said. "BNP has yet to decide to participate in the national elections, though it will be registered within the deadline." "The proper electoral atmosphere has not been ensured yet. BNP wants to take part in the election. But to do that the government will have to accept our proposals," the secretary general said. Delwar stressed: "BNP will not go for any stage-managed elections, even though it is registering." "egistering and taking part in the elections is not the same." Replying to a query, he elaborated: "BNP is going for registration so that no group or party can conspire to keep us away from elections on the excuse of non-registration." "If the two leaders take part in the election the election will be acceptable to all," he said. "But the emergency must be lifted before elections. The demand is not only ours, but also that of other parties and the public." Delwar was hopeful of a second dialogue with the government. "We hope they will call us for dialogue very soon." bdnew
