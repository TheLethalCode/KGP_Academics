 Chittagong, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty was the latest foreign diplomat to add his voice to the election debate on Saturday, saying he did not see any problem with holding the December parliamentary polls under emergency. "If city corporation and municipality polls can be held in a free and fair manner under emergency, national elections can be held too," Chakravarty told reporters after inaugurating an art exhibition of Bangladeshi and Indian artists at the high commission's Chittagong office. On deportation of Bangladeshi criminals, including Subrata Bain, he said India was ready to deport them but the process must not be one-sided. In reply to another question, Chakravarty said India was addressing duty-free access of Bangladeshi products, adding that India had cut down the list of Bangladeshi goods banned in India to 400 from 700. Inaugurating Saturday's event, the Indian diplomat said the art exhibition on the subject of "vicinity" would further strengthen the relationship between the countries. Twenty-two artworks by 11 artists  six from Chittagong and five from Kolkataare included in the exhibition. Chakravarty also remarked that Bangladesh would be benefited if Indian movies were shown in Bangladeshi cinema halls.
