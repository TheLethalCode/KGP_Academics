<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  Shakib Al Hasan struck his maiden Test half-century to help Bangladesh to an overall 258-run lead against New Zealand at the close of the third-day of the two-match Test series opener at the Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong Sunday. The Tigers, who made 245 in the first innings, were 184 for eight at stumps in the second innings, after bundling New Zealand out for just 171, the visitors' lowest ever total in an innings against Bangladesh. After claiming seven scalps for 36, Shakib struck 71 before being caught by Ross Taylor at slip off Daniel Vettori, who returned four for 39 after scoring 55 not out in the first innings. Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, who remained unbeaten on five along with Abdur Razzak on nought, will resume the fourth day Monday, in a bid to pull off the home sides second Test win since their lone triumph against Zimbabwe in 2005. It was the 21-year-old Shakib, who wrecked the Black Caps' first innings with his career-best bowling, going on to rescue the Tigers with the bat after the hosts were reduced to 71 for five soon after lunch. The on-form Shakib smashed 12 fours in his 151-ball knock to erase his previous best of 41 not out against New Zealand in Wellington earlier this year. The all-rounder drove Kyle Mills for four to reach 48 and then pushed the same pacer through cover in the next ball to bring up his maiden Test fifty off 105 balls in his seventh match. After reaching fifty, he came out from the shield to hammer off-spinner Patel for three successive fours in the next over, scoring 21 runs against 46 balls. Shakib, promoted to bat at the number seven spot, put on a slow but significant 56 runs for the sixth wicket with Mushfiqur Rahim, one of two first innings heroes. Mushfiqur fell after a patient 32 off 121 balls, leaving the side at 127 for five after the tea break. The left-handed batsman then added another 48 runs for the seventh wicket with Nayeem Islam, who made a gritty 19 off 70 before becoming Vettori's fourth victim as the spinners continued to dominate on the turning wicket. Apart from Mushfiqur and Shakib's innings, it was all but the same old story of the top order collapse as Junaed Siddique (6), Rajin Saleh (6), Mohammad Ashraful (duck), Mehrab Hossain Jr (6) returned cheaply. Tamim Iqbal, however, played an impressive 100-ball 33, studded with five boundaries. Early in the morning, left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan wrapped up New Zealand's first innings, removing Iain O'Brien (5) to finish 7 for 36, the best figures by any Bangladeshi bowler in a Test after Emanul Haq Junior's seven for 95 against Zimbabwe. A persistent Vettori, however, converted his overnight score of 48 into his 17th Test half century, remaining unbeaten on 55 off 82 balls. New Zealand, having resumed on 155 for nine, added another 16 runs to finish on 171 in the first innings, giving a 74-run lead to the hosts. bdnew
