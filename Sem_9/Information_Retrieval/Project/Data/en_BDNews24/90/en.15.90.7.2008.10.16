<TEXT>
 Dhaka, October 16 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has extended by a fortnight an embargo on the 'arrest and harassment' of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in two graft cases. A HC bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Roisuddin gave the order Thursday after hearing Sheikh Hasina's appeal seeking the extension. The court also extended stay orders on the graft cases by another two weeks. The High Court ordered the government on Oct 5 not to 'arrest or harass' Hasina until Oct 20, in connection with the two casesinvolving irregularities in dealings with Niko Resources Ltd and installation of barge-mounted power plants cases during her term as prime minister. The court also asked the government not to create obstacles to Hasina's free movement at home and abroad. Awami League chief Hasina was released from detention in June, and has remained abroad since, after spending almost a year in special jail after her arrest in July last year. Barrister Shafique Ahmed represented the former PM, while deputy attorney general Mohammad Ali Akand represented the state in Thursday's hearing. The ACC filed the Niko corruption case against Hasina and six others on Dec 9 last year, and pressed charges against nine including Hasina on May 7 this year. It is alleged that Hasina's administration inflicted Tk 13,600 crore in financial losses on the state by awarding Chhatak, Kamta and Feni gas fields to Canadian oil-gas exploration firm Niko Resources Ltd without tender. On Sept 2 last year, the ACC filed a case against seven including the former prime minister, accusing them of taking Tk 3 crore bribe in the name of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in return for a contract to set up three barge-mounted power plants. bdnews
