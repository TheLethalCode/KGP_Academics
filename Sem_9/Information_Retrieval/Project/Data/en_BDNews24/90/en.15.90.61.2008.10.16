<TITLE> Tom Cruise death report is 'erroneous garbage' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tom Cruise is alive and well, his agent said on Thursday, denying Internet reports that the actor had fallen to his death in New Zealand. "This is completely not true. Tom is not in New Zealand nor has he been there recently. This is erroneous and unreliable Internet garbage," Cruise publicist Jeff Raymond told Reuters. Claims that the star of "Top Gun" and "Mission:Impossible" had plunged to death from the Kauri Cliffs circulated on the Internet on Thursday and were even picked up by traders on the Singapore oil and foreign exchange markets. A similar erroneous report two years ago claimed that actor Tom Hanks had died after falling from the same cliffs. Cruise was pictured this week in New York with his actress wife Katie Holmes and their daughter Suri. Holmes is appearing on Broadway in the play "All My Sons", which has its official opening on Thursday night.
