<TITLE> No taka-dollar adjustment for now: BB boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com)Despite a grim US economic outlook and the dollar's volatility, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said Friday the central bank was not thinking of adjusting the taka against the US currency. Speaking to reporters at Zia International Airport, on his return from Washington DC, he said the government did not want to affect export earnings or import costs by adjustment of the taka against the dollar. Replying to queries, the central banker said: "Unless there is urgent necessity, we want to keep it that way." Returning from the annual general meeting of WB-IMF in DC, he said Bangladesh will receive a total $1 billion in financial assistance from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund this year. Earlier in the week, finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, after Washington talks with WB officials, had said the bank was committed to a total assistance package of $1 billion by Dec 2008, a record level of financial support for Bangladesh. BB governor Salehuddin told reporters on Friday: "Multi-lateral agencies' impression of Bangladesh among the developing nations is quite positive." "Donors have lauded the stability of Bangladesh's macro-economic fundamentals, relatively low inflation rate and the constant 6 percent growth rate," he added. On the impact of global financial turmoil, he told newsmen that the Bangladeshi economy is not likely to suffer any immediate effect. "However, the export sector and inflow of ODA (overseas development assistance) may witness some downturn due to the financial crisis," added the Bangladesh Bank boss. The BB governor earlier in the week told a Washington meeting, on "Impact of Financial Crisis in South Asia", that deepening recession fears will definitely touch economies such as Bangladesh. The financial services industry in Bangladesh, thanks to "low exposure" to US and European markets, will not be affected by the global downturn for now, but a prolonged crisis will dampen exports and flow of ODA funds, said the central bank chief. bdn
