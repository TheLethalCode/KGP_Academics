 MOHALI, India, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australian spearhead Brett Lee is adding variety to his pace to excel in India after a subdued start in the drawn first test. Lee, 31, took one wicket in each innings as India frustrated the number one side by salvaging a draw, batting through most of the final day on an uneven pitch in Bangalore. One of the fastest bowlers in the world, Lee worked on change of pace and movement in the nets on Wednesday. The second test in the four-match series starts on Friday.

"I was really happy with the way I bowled in the first test," he said. "You can look up at the scoreboard and see not a lot of wickets next to my name or Stuey Clark's or any other bowler. An elbow strain prevented Clark from bowling on Wednesday. Lee missed the home one-day series against Bangladesh for personal reasons and his bowling in the drawn four-day warmup prompted skipper Ricky Ponting to say he was a bit "underdone" entering the series. The bowler with 291 test scalps has assumed the lead role after Glenn McGrath retired last year and heads a young pace attack in India. Lee looked forward to playing on a pitch which was home to his Punjab side, finalists at this year's Indian Twenty20 league. "It feels like a home game," he said. "Hopefully the wicket has got a bit of carry, this is traditionally a bouncy wicket here in India. The one in Bangalore was a bit low and slow
