 BUENOS AIRES, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors ended 10 days of internal squabbling by beating arch-rivals River Plate 1-0 away on Sunday in the biggest fixture of the Argentine season despite playing most of the second half with 10 men. Lucas Viatri headed the only goal following a Juan Roman Riquelme free kick in the 61st minute, nine minutes after Hugo Ibarra was sent off for insulting a linesman over the award of a throw-in. Defending champions River, who have won only once in 10 games, were spared the indignity of going bottom of the 20-team Apertura championship when Rosario Central lost 1-0 at home to Gimnasia-La Plata. River stayed above Central on goal difference with both teams on eight points. "It hurts to see the team where it is," said River coach Diego Simeone, adding that he did not speak to his players afterwards. "Neither team played well but they took advantage of a set piece." Boca also went into the game under pressure. Having lost three of their previous four matches they were then hit by a public row after defender Julio Cesar Caceres gave a radio interview criticising Riquelme, who immediately hit back. A peace agreement was reached on Friday after the Paraguay defender apologised and the two hugged each other after the final whistle. "There was a misunderstanding between two team mates and it was resolved by conversing," said Boca midfielder Fabian Vargas. The mercurial Riquelme answered his critics with an excellent performance as he controlled the Boca midfield. River edged the first half, striker Radamel Falcao Garcia hitting the post with a shot which slipped through goalkeeper Javier Garcia's hands. Boca dominated the second, squandering two chances on the break before Riquelme fired narrowly wide from the edge of the area. Boca moved up to fourth place with 17 points, still eight behind leaders San Lorenzo who beat San Martin-Tucuman on Saturday. Central, one of the country's most successful provincial clubs, were left bottom after Walter Ribonetto put through his own goal to give new coach Gustavo Alfaro a losing star
