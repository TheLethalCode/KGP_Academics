 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com)  New Zealand were left teetering on 105 for seven as Shakib Al Hasan snared his fifth scalp on the second day of the two-match Test series opener, with Bangladesh bundled out for 245 in the first innings, at Chittagong on Saturday. Daniel Vettori was batting on six with Kyle Mills on nought at Birsreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in the port city. Jacob Oram was the latest to go, caught by Abdur Razzak off Shakib, who earlier removed Jamie How, debutant Jesse Ryder, Aaron Redmond and Brendon McCullum. Debutant Nayeem Islam had Daniel Flynn caught by keeper Mushfiqur Rahman while Razzak dismissed Ross Taylor. Earlier, Bangladesh, having resumed the second day on 183 for four, added only 62 runs for the remaining six wickets before the lunch break, as Daniel Vettori raised his wicket toll to five for 59 from the first day's two for 50. Overnight batsmen Mehrab Hossain Junior and Mushiqur Rahim resumed their partnership on an unbeaten 139, with Mehrab striking Kyle Mills for four in the very second delivery of the day, but were separated in the fourth over of the day by pacer Iain O'Brien, who returned three for 36. O'Brien had Mehrab caught by Aaron Redmond at short cover to end Bangladesh's fifth-wicket record 144-run partnership. Mehrab took his overnight 79 to 83 off 179 balls studded with 11 fours. Mushfiqur along with debutant Nayeem Islam showed signs of another resistance, but the debut batsman (14 off 46 balls) came down the wicket against off-spinner Jeetan Patel to be stumped by Brendon McCullum, leaving the side at 229 for six, triggering a low order collapse. On that total, Mushfiqur and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza were successively dismissed by Vettori, and Bangladesh collapsed to 229 for eight. Mushfiqur added 20 runs to his overnight 59 to finish on 79 off 210 balls featuring a dozen fours and one six, while Mashrafee played a three-ball duck. Abdur Razzak played a 22-ball 11 to take the side near the 250-mark, before left-spinner Vettori had Razzak caught by Jesse Ryder to complete his fourth five-wicket haul against Bangladesh and overall 16th in his Test career. Off-spinner Patel wrapped up Bangladesh's first innings having Shakib Al Hasan caught by Vettori, and returned two for 67. b
