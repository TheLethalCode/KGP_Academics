<TITLE> Big Two to blame if Dec 18 polls stalled: Oli </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com) LDP chief Oli Ahmed says he will blame the two major parties rather than the caretakers or the army if the parliament election is not held on Dec 18. The former BNP standing committee member however told LDP activists Friday that the party would be part of the Awami League-led polls platform and negotiate its share of "grand alliance" seats once Sheikh Hasina returned home. "We will participate in the election as a partner of the grand alliance. No alliance will be able to form government without us," the former cabinet minister in the 1991-96 BNP government said. The LDP or Liberal Democratic Party was part of the Awami League-led grand alliance launched ahead of the now-scrapped 2007 polls. Speaking at a party meeting at city's Moghbazar, the retired colonel was critical of the Jatiya party led by General Ershad. "JP won't be able win more than 10 seats. The number of JP seats has been on the decrease with every election. The party does not have any base or political support beyond Rangpur." Oli Ahmed also warned the caretaker government against "wavering" on its anti-graft drive. "Do not compromise with the corrupt. People expect you to continue with your drive," he said. Party secretary general Prof Jahanara Begum, presidium member Redwan Ahmed, Abdul Karim Abbasi, Syed Didar Bakht, Mahmudur Rahman Chowdhury, vice president Abul Quashem, Dr Nazimuddin Ahmed, joint secretary general Shahadat Hossain Selim were, among others, present in the meeting.
