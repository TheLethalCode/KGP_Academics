 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission in an "exceptional initiative" met with top land ministry officials Sunday, in the first of four important ministry meetings, to identify causes and reduce administrative corruption. ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury and two commissioners Abul Hasan Monzur Mannan and Habibur Rahman met Sunday with land secretary Abu Mohammad Moniruzzaman Khan at the ministry conference room. Chairman of the Land Reform Board Monirul Islam, chairman of Land Appellate Board Ashraful Moqbul and other top officials were also present. After the meeting, ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury told a press briefing: "It is an exceptional initiative." "Administrative corruption cannot be removed without first identifying it. For this reason the top administrative officials have to be involved with the process." The causes of corruption and problems faced by the ministry were discussed. More discussion in this regard would be held at the ACC in future and remedial measures would be proposed, said the ACC boss. "Laws and rules formulated over a long time are creating scope for corruption. These need reform," he said. Asked what type of corruption took place in the ministry and related aganecies, and whether those who were involved were identified, the ACC chairman said: "We are not looking into corruption by individuals, rather we are looking into the workings of the ministry and organisations." "We are trying to identify the problems." He added: "We have just begun to do so and we will work from the top of the administration downward in phases." "The land ministry has been requested to take measures to curb those forms of corruption that can be checked right now. The secretary and high officials concerned has assured us in this regard," said the ACC chief. Land officials made a proposal in the meeting to form a land tribunal, Hasan Mashhud said, adding that he would recommend the proposal to higher authorities. Land secretary Abu Md Moniruzzaman said the meeting discussed the present state of land management. He said most of the cases now being filed in courts are land-related. The government has already taken some measures in this regard and more steps would be taken, the secretary said. bdnew
