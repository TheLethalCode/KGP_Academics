 REYKJAVIK, Wed Oct 15, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iceland's central bank slashed interest rates on Wednesday and officials pursued efforts to get help from Russia in tackling the worst economic crisis in the island's history. The central bank cut its main rate to 12 percent from 15.5 percent, hours before Prime Minister Geir Haarde was due to address parliament on how the government is coping with the crisis stemming from the collapse of its financial sector after years of rapid expansion overseas. While the central bank Sedlabanki acted at home, a team of Icelandic officials was due to meet for a second day in Moscow with Russian officials over a possible multi-billion-euro loan. Iceland is also due to present a plan to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the coming days as it is widely expected to seek funds. Iceland has had high interest rates for several years as the central bank has tried, unsuccessfully, to rein in inflation. A collapse of the Icelandic crown had only made the inflation situation worse as Iceland imports so much of its goods. The central bank, Sedlabanki, said the crisis would mean the loss of many jobs and decreased market demand. "The next phase of the banking crisis will be difficult with severe economic contraction," Sedlabanki said in a statement released in Icelandic on its Web site. The bank said it had held informal talks with employers and unions to discuss the situation. An economist in Iceland hailed the move. "It will help companies that will now have to be financed by Icelandic banks. This will be a big help for them," said Asgeir Jonsson, analyst at Kaupthing. Kaupthing, the largest bank in Iceland, was taken over last week by the state along with Landsbanki and Glitnir. "Going forward we will not see any serious inflation in 2009 given that 20 percent of the CPI (consumer price index) is the housing market. Labor unions have said they would be willing to accept a two-year wage freeze." He added, "The main thing is that they have to stabilize the currency and get the payments system going again." Local politicians also had been calling for the central bank to reduce borrowing costs. Many Icelanders face huge bills on their debts already, coupled with the prospect that home values have tumbled. HOME AND AWAY On Tuesday, Iceland drew on swap facilities it had set up with Nordic nations, tapping Denmark and Norway for 200 million euros ($273 million) each. Prime Minister Haarde said the funds would be as part of efforts to get Iceland's currency market working again. There was no word yet on whether the central bank would hold a news conference. Central Bank Governor David Oddsson has come under criticism, some from political leaders, that he had not done enough to stave off the crisis and that his communications had at times exacerbated problems. Haarde on Tuesday gave his firm backing to Oddsson. "I have full confidence in him," Haarde told Reuters when asked whether Oddsson should go. "This is not the time to assess blame for what happened, this is the time to find solutions.
