 MINSK, Oct 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Fabio Capello said he was delighted with the unity England showed in Wednesday's 3-1 win over Belarus, a result that ensured their best start to any World Cup qualifying campaign. Two goals from Wayne Rooney, who has now scored five times in his last three internationals, and one by Steven Gerrard gave England 12 points from four matches to leave them five points clear of Croatia and Ukraine at the top of Group Six.
