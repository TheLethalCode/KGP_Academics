 Dhaka, Oct 18 (bdnews24.com) - Dhaka University on Saturday witnessed a mass rally against 'fundamentalism' in a bid to safeguard artworks across the country, as part of continuing public protests sparked by the recent removal of Mrinal Huq's noted Baul sculpture on Airport Road. In the protest rally at the foot of the Aparajeyo Bangla monument on the DU campus, writers, teachers and students chanted slogans and carried banners accusing the government of backing 'fundamentalists'. "I doubt whether Islam really supports this kind of intolerance," said mass communication and journalism department teacher Geeti Ara Nasrin. She asked all to fight against those who falsely use the name of religion to root out culture. "This kind of removal of art bears no relation to religion or Islam," Farsi department chairman Saiful Islam said too. History department teacher Muntasir Mamun echoed him, adding: "We protest the attack on art and culture." He also slammed Islami Oikyo Jote chairman, mufti Fazlul Haque Amini, who reportedly threatened to break sculptures across the country if the party came to power. Educationist Serajul Islam Chowdhury said: "The recent incident is the result of religion-based politics. People must combat the communalism now. " "The fundamentalists are attacking the art and culture of independent Bangladesh," he said. "Those who were against the liberation war have broken the sculpture. It is the high time to fight against the heinous act," agreed Group Theatre Federation chairman, M Hamid. Cartoonist Rafikunnbai demanded to know why the government had given no proper reason for breaking and removal of the sculpture. "We must create a strong movement from Dhaka University to thwart this type of fundamentalism," he said. A human chain was also formed in front of the Faculty of Fine Arts in protest against the removal of the sculpture. bdne
