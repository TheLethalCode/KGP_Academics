 WASHINGTON, Sun Oct 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democrat Barack Obama's lead over Republican John McCain in the presidential race has dropped to 3 points, according to a Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll released on Sunday. Obama leads McCain by 48 to 45 percent among likely US voters, down 1 percentage point from Saturday. The four-day tracking poll, which has a margin of error of 2.9 points.
