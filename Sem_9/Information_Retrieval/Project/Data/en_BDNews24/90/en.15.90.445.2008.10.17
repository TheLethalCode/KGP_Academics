<TITLE> Drogba says wants to finish career at Chelsea </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Didier Drogba has pledged his future to Chelsea and would sign a new contract if the club offered him one, he was quoted as saying in British media. "I would love to finish my career here. Of course, I would sign a new contract if the club offered me one," the Ivory Coast captain said. The 30-year-old Drogba also said he would be back in action for Chelsea within three weeks after a knee injury. He said he was glad he stayed in west London after having been linked with AC and Inter Milan in the last transfer window amid speculation he would leave the Premier League club. He developed a close relationship with former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, who signed him from Olympique Marseille in 2004, and media reports had speculated he would follow the Portuguese coach when he took over at Inter Milan. Drogba helped Chelsea win two Premier League titles, the FA Cup and League Cup twice under Mourinho. They reached the Champions League final last May after Avram Grant took over as manager, losing to Manchester United on penalties. NEW CHALLENGE "When I was saying I wanted to leave, even if I went I didn't know if I would find what I have here," said Drogba. "I am not the kind of person who is scared of a new challenge, which is why I was saying that. But I don't need to move. "I would love to go until the end of my contract here, which is two years. It's because of the relationship I have created with the players and the staff. "Now with (Luiz) Felipe Scolari coming in (as manager), he is talking to the players. I like the way he is dealing with the players. That is important." Drogba has seen little action under Scolari, having recovered from knee surgery after the season began only to suffer another knee injury against CFR Cluj in a Champions League game in Romania two weeks ago. "It (the knee) is feeling good. I'm working to be back on the pitch as soon as possible," said Drogba. "I have set no targets but it will be a maximum of three weeks. "I want to be back and fresh. The first few hours after I did it was really frustrating. But, when I knew the cruciate ligaments were safe and it was just a big twist of the knee and ankle, I was really happy and the frustration was gone.
