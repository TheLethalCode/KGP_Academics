 HARARE, Sun Oct 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe's rival parties are still far away from implementing a power-sharing deal, the opposition MDC said on Sunday, as some regional leaders prepared to hold a summit aimed at breaking the deadlock. "We are still miles, miles, miles behind in terms of the implementation of the deal," MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told South Africa's SAfm radio. But Chamisa added that Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) had no choice but to remain cautiously optimistic despite the hurdles. He was speaking a day before some heads of state from the regional grouping SADC were due to meet in Swaziland to try to help Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU PF and opposition agree on cabinet posts after four days of inconclusive talks which ended on Friday. The power-sharing deal, mediated by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, is seen as Zimbabwe's best hope for rescuing an economy where fuel and food are scarce and inflation stands at 231 million percent, the world's highest. State leaders who form the Southern African Development Community's defense and security body are expected to hold talks on the stalemate in Swaziland on Monday. Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara, head of the smaller MDC faction, will take part in the troika meeting of Angola, Mozambique and Swaziland, Mbeki has said. BRINK OF COLLAPSE Tsvangirai threatened to pull out of talks last Sunday after Mugabe allocated powerful ministries such as defense, finance and home affairs to his own party. "People are suffering. There is no food. No jobs. No cash in the country. The country is almost on the edge of total collapse. We want to make sure we rescue the situation. This is why we remain cautiously optimistic," said Chamisa. Mbeki said on Friday a deal was still possible despite another round of inconclusive talks. But his effectiveness has been thrown into doubt since South Africa's ruling ANC party forced him to resign. And the MDC accuses him of favoring Mugabe, an issue that Chamisa raised again. "I suppose that Mbeki seems to be more inclined to appreciate the circumstances from the ZANU-PF point of view than from the MDC point of view," he told SAfm. "That is the situation and we are hoping that when we go to the troika our side is going to be heard." Tsvangirai beat Mugabe in a March 29 presidential election but fell short of enough votes to avoid a June run-off, which was won by Mugabe unopposed after Tsvangirai pulled out, citing violence and intimidation against his supporters. Mugabe's victory in the run-off was condemned around the world and drew toughened sanctions from Western countries whose support is vital for reviving Zimbabwe's ruined economy
