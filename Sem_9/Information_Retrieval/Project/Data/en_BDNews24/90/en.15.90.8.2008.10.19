 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League met with Election Commission officials Sunday to address queries on the party's draft constitution keeping associated organisations, an EC official said Sunday. Joint secretary to the EC Secretariat (law) Nurul Islam Khan told bdnews24.com that the Election Comission had talks with an Awami League delegation Sunday, and if they address the issues raised, an official letter will be sent on the recommendations of the committee on scrutiny registration applications. An AL team, led by office secretary Abdul Mannan Khan, visited the EC Secretariat in the afternoon. Abdul Mannan told reporters EC officials had some queries on AL's associate organisations. "We clarified the matter. We don't believe further changes to our draft constitution will be necessary." The EC Secretariat contacted AL on Saturday, inviting the party to discuss the matter, he added. Scrutiny committee member AKM Salimullah told bdnews24.com earlier Sunday that the committee had asked EC officials to send a letter to the party informing them of the recommendations regarding asspociate organisations. The party applied for registration on Oct 15 along with a draft of its amended constitution, in line with new electoral laws. As many as 43 parties had applied for registration with the EC up to Sunday afternoon. bdnews
