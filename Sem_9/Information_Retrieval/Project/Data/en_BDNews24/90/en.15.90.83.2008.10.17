<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Thu Oct 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of taxi cabs and motorised autorickshaws stayed off Mumbai streets on Thursday, in a protest against a planned phasing out of older vehicles and the growing numbers of private taxis in India's financial hub. Commuters streaming out of train stations joined long lines at bus stops or tried to flag rides from private cars, as the ubiquitous black and yellow taxis, some with strike notices pasted on their windows and windscreens, stood by the road side. "We are demanding that we should be given sufficient time and subsidies for the phase out of old taxis," said A.L. Quadros, general secretary of the Mumbai Taxi Mens Union, which called for the one-day strike. The city, which has more than 50,000 ageing black and yellow cabs in various stages of disrepair, had proposed phasing out vehicles that are more than 25 years old, and had set a deadline of Dec. 4. About 8,500 taxis will need to be phased out. "This is not sufficient time," Quadros said, adding the state should also provide subsidies in the form of exemption of sales tax and other incentives for the purchase of new cars. Union representatives would meet the state chief minister later on Thursday for talks, Quadros said. The union was also calling for the state to limit the issue of new licences to private taxis, which are increasingly preferred by commuters who have long struggled with faulty meters, sagging seats and smelly black and yellow cabs. "They are taking away our business," Quadros said. Private fleet operators, fearing for the safety of their employees, also kept vehicles off the street, said a spokesman for operator Meru Cabs. While traffic on Mumbai's normally congested streets flowed more easily, the airport dropped passengers arriving in the city at the nearest train station in minibuses, a spokeswoman said
