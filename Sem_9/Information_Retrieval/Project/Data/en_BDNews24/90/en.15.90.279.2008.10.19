 TOKYO, Sun Oct 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea could issue an important message on Monday, a Japanese newspaper reported on Sunday, although South Korea said no significant military moves have been detected in their communist neighbor. On Saturday, Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that multiple unidentified sources had said North Korean diplomats had been told to stay close to their embassies and await "an important message." It said the message could deal with relations between the two Koreas or the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. A second Japanese newspaper reported on Sunday that the message could come on Monday. The daily Sankei Shimbun newspaper quoted an unidentified defense ministry source on Sunday as saying information had been obtained that "an announcement of important information will be made on October 20." It also said that Japan's foreign ministry would neither confirm nor deny the original report. South Korea said earlier on Sunday that no significant moves had been detected in North Korea. "We haven't spotted anything unusual in North Korea and there's nothing to confirm regarding the newspaper report," said a spokesman for South Korea's unification ministry. Tensions between the two Koreas have mounted recently. On Thursday, North Korea threatened to end all relations with South Korea, a major source of aid and cash, in anger at the hardline policies of Seoul's conservative president. Kim's health has also been the subject of speculation after U.S. and South Korean officials said he may have suffered a stroke in August. A sharp increase in tension between the two Koreas could cause problems for the South by increasing its perceived political risk and making it more expensive for its companies to raise funds internationally at a time when the economy is already wobbling from the impact of global financial turmoil. Its threat to cut ties came days after it pledged to resume taking apart a nuclear plant that makes bomb-grade plutonium. Its decision to return to a disarmament deal followed Washington's move to take the reclusive state off its terrorism blacklist, removing some trade sanctions. Analysts speculate that the North may expel South Koreans working at a joint factory park or a mountain resort located just north of their heavily armed border. Pyongyang sent back some South Koreans in August as tensions escalated after a South Korean tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier in July. Questions have been raised over how decisions are now made in the North after the reports Kim may have suffered a stroke
