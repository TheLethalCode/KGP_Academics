 Dhaka, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Shops, markets and malls will remain closed after 8pm, a directive from the energy ministry said on Wednesday. In accordance with labour laws, and in a bid to conserve national power, the decision to curtail opening times for shops, markets and shopping malls has been enforced again. Under the directive, owners are asked to close their shops at 8pm and not to go for unnecessary illumination. Power distribution organisations and concerned companies are also instructed to strengthen their surveillance in this regard. During Ramadan and Eid-ul-Fitr, the government decision on shops and markets was suspended temporarily for the convenience of consumers. bdnews
