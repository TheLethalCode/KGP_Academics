<TITLE> India should focus on growth now: PM adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Thu Oct 16, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's inflation rate would remain in double digits for some time, but it is now on an easing trend and policy can be focused towards growth, a top economic adviser said on Thursday. Annual inflation hit a peak of 12.91 percent in early August, and data on Thursday showed it had fallen to 11.44 percent on Oct. 4, a third successive weekly fall that took it to its lowest since the end of May. The near-term policy priority has shifted to ensuring enough liquidity in financial markets as the turmoil in global markets has spread to India, and with that there have been calls to shore up growth against the risks of a global recession. "Double-digit inflation would remain for some time as a consequence of the base effect," Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council told Reuters in a telephone interview. "But the rate of inflation seems to be easing. Since this is a pre-election year, inflation will be the uppermost issue. "As I mentioned, the policy should now be towards growth. Industrial output grew at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent in August, its slowest pace in nearly 10 years, as rising prices, the aggressive rate rises of June and July, and slowdowns in key export markets such as the United States and Europe have bit. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has said the fundamentals of Asia's third-largest economy are strong and growth in the current financial year would be close to 8 percent. But private economists see growth slowing to about 7.5 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2009, from 9 percent last year. Growth in the June quarter slipped to an annual 7.9 percent, the slowest in 3- years. Tendulkar said the central bank would definitely keep an eye on inflation numbers before making any cut in interest rates. "Definitely they will be looking at the numbers closely," he said. The central bank reviews monetary policy on Oct. 24 and market expectations have been fuelled that it may cut its main lending rate, the repo rate, as part of its strategy to ease liquidity in the banking system. In the past week it has slashed the cash reserve ratio for banks by 250 basis points, releasing 1 trillion rupees ($20.5 billion) into the banking system, after increasing it by 400 basis points since December 2006. Tendulkar said the measures taken by the central bank and the government to ease tight cash conditions was a message to the banks to start lending. Among other measures, the central bank is also releasing 250 billion rupees to banks for a farm loan waiver scheme, and the government raised the cap on foreign investment in corporate debt to $6 billion from $3 billion
