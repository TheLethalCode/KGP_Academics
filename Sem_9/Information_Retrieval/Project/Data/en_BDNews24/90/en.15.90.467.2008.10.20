 Dhaka, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com) Don't fund luxury and the culture of consumption. Give money, instead, to agriculture, SMEs and housing. The warning and advice came from central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed who met the chief executives of all government, private, specialised and foreign banks Sunday. Shun unproductive and risky ventures, he told them. "Some banks even offer loans for marriage!" The governor, speaking to reporters after the meeting, said he had advised all banks to decide on loans cautiously in view of the prevailing global economic crisis. "The banking sector in western countries has plunged into a big crisis as they gave away money without much scrutiny," the governor said. "So we must exercise utmost caution. Consumer loans, unproductive loans have to be brought down as much as possible," he said of his recommendations to the bank CEOs. "In the present situation of the country, money should be diverted to the productive sectors, especially agriculture, small and medium businesses (SME) and housing. "More money for these sectors would mean more jobs and desired growth of GDP." On the impact of the global crisis, the governor said: "We are observing the overall situation carefully. The banks are being given guidelines accordingly. "There's been no adverse impact on the banking sector so far, and we hope there will be no negative impact in future too." The governor said, "Many banks invest huge amounts of money in unproductive sectors, ignoring the productive sectors. "The banks invest in procurement of luxurious items for more profit. Some banks even offer loans for marriage. "As a result, on one hand inflation goes up. On the other, the productive sectors are deprived. No new employment is generated. Growth is hindered." The governor said, "The banker's meeting also discussed the quality of service of the banks. A central bank investigation found that the subscriber service quality of no government or private bank is satisfactory." Salehuddin said the bankers pledged to improve the quality of service. When his attention was drawn to allegation that some banks were being too aggressive by offering higher than usual rate of interest on deposits, the governor said, "The matter has also come to the attention of the central bank. The banks have been directed to refrain from such unhealthy banking activities." He said he instructed the banks to keep a balance between deposits and loans. The governor dismissed suggestion that the global recession would affect investment in Bangladesh. "The bank CEOs have told me that the demand for loan has not dropped, it has rather increased." Quazi Mahmud Sattar, chairman of the Association of Bankers, Bangladesh (ABB), a grouping of private bank executives, echoed governor in allaying fears of any impact on banks. "The depression in the world economy will not have any direct negative impact on the banking sector in Bangladesh. "Despite that the central bank has asked us to conduct banking activities cautiously." Sattar, however, admitted exports and remittance would suffer. On the quality of subscriber service, he said, "Not only banks, the quality of service of any corporate entity in Bangladesh is not up to international standard. We are trying to increase the quality of our service."
