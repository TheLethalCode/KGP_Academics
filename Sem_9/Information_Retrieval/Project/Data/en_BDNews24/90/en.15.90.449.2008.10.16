 NEW DELHI, Thu Oct 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian travellers heading to Africa and South America are struggling to obtain necessary yellow fever vaccinations because of a shortage of stocks at centres in New Delhi, a newspaper reported on Thursday. The Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, one of four designated centres for vaccination, had run out of the vaccine while the other centres were also short on supplies, the Hindustan Times said. Several travellers who had queued up for hours at the centre on Wednesday returned home without getting vaccinated, the paper said. Many were asked to come back on Saturday. "There is nothing the hospital can do," N K Chaturvedi, an RML hospital official, told the paper. "We'll vaccinate as soon as we get the vaccines." People travelling from India to several countries in central Africa and South America need yellow fever vaccination 10 days before travel.
