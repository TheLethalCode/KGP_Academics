 NEW DELHI, Thu Oct 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dalai Lama left hospital in India's capital Thursday after recovering from successful surgery to remove gallstones, officials said. The exiled Tibetan spiritual leader waved at people waiting outside the hospital before getting into a black Mercedes and being driven away. "The treatment (was) very, very successful, now I am returning," a smiling Dalai Lama told Reuters television, before the convoy of cars took the spiritual leader away to a Tibetan youth hostel in the capital. "He is in very good spirits and very happy to have had his surgery done here," Pradeep Chowbey, a hospital doctor said. In August, the Dalai Lama was admitted to a hospital in Mumbai with abdominal discomfort and released after a few days. After returning to Dharamsala, the northern hill town which serves as the headquarters for the Tibetan government-in-exile, he made a few public appearances before deciding to come to Delhi for another round of medical tests. Doctors said he will be fit to resume normal duties after some rest. The Lama has called a special meeting of Tibetan exiles in November or December to discuss this year's political unrest in Tibet and the future of the Tibetan movement. An aide said he would be resting in Delhi for a few days before returning to Dharamsala
