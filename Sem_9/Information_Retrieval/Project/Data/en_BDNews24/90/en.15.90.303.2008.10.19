 MOHALI, India, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India debutant spinner Amit Mishra grabbed his third wicket to reduce Australia to 174 for seven and facing the prospect of a rare follow-on at lunch on the third day of the second test on Sunday. Australia were still 295 runs behind India's imposing first innings total of 469 all out after a spectacular batting collapse on a good Mohali pitch. Mishra, 25, playing due to skipper Anil Kumble's injury, took three for 42 while paceman Ishant Sharma took two. Australia all rounder Shane Watson was on 32, holding one end up for over two hours, and Brett Lee was on five as India took command to push for a lead in the four-test series. Australia, reduced to 104 for two overnight replying to India's first innings 469 all out, had pinned their hopes on the consistent Mike Hussey and Watson.

Saurav Ganguly top-scored with 102 for his 16th test century in his farewell series and raised partnerships of 142 runs and 109 runs with Sachin Tendulkar (88) and stand-in skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (92) to guide India to a solid first innings total.
