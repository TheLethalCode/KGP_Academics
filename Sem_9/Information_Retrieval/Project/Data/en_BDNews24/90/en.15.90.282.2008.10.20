 MADRID, Oct 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona's Mali midfielder Seydou Keita will miss the trip to face Basel in the Champions League next week after picking up an injury in Sunday's 1-0 Primera Liga win at Athletic Bilbao. Keita was substituted in the 31st minute after twisting a muscle in his right leg, and was taken to hospital to check there was no damage to the bone. He will undergo further tests on Monday, the club said on their website (www.fcbarcelona.com).
