 NASHVILLE, Oct 15 (bdnews24.com/Billboard) - Britney Spears is gearing up for a tour next spring, her first outing since 2004, sources said. The arena trek will help promote her new album, "Circus," due December 2 via Jive Records. The first single, "Womanizer," is expected to leap into the upper reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 this week after first-week download sales are factored into the chart. The chart will be published on Thursday. Spears' 2004 tour grossed more than $34 million, according to Billboard Boxscore. In the ensuing years, her career was derailed by a litany of personal and professional woes.
