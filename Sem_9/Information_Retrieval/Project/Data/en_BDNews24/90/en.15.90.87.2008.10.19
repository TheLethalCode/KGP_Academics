 ROME, Oct 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Napoli moved top of Serie A on Saturday after a late Ezequiel Lavezzi goal secured a 2-1 come-from-behind home win over Juventus. Juve's second consecutive league defeat extends their winless run to five games in all competitions and increases the pressure on coach Claudio Ranieri before Tuesday's Champions League match against Real Madrid in Turin. Brazilian striker Amauri volleyed Juventus in front just after the hour mark, but Slovakia midfielder Marek Hamsik equalised for the hosts three minutes later when he glided in unmarked to head home a Lavezzi cross. The Argentine striker then pounced on a loose clearance and sprinted into the area to fire Napoli to victory in the 80th minute. Napoli have 14 points from seven games, one more than Lazio, Udinese, Inter Milan and Fiorentina, who beat 10-man Reggina 3-0 earlier on Saturday with the help of two late Alberto Gilardino goals. Juve are five points off the pace before the rest of the Serie A programme on Sunday, when champions Inter visit struggling AS Roma. "We played a good match. We made some silly mistakes but we also did some good moves," Ranieri told Sky television. "It's not a crisis. We're going through a tough spell but it's not a crisis." In Florence, Giampaolo Pazzini drilled home a penalty five minutes before halftime to set the home side on their way after Reggina goalkeeper Andrea Campagnolo was given a red card for felling Mario Alberto Santana as he raced towards goal. In-form Italy forward Gilardino, resting on the bench for most of the game ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Bayern Munich, steered a diagonal shot into the far corner in the 75th minute. He then headed past substitute keeper Christian Puggioni, who had rushed out of his goal, and ran on to slot the ball into an empty net nine minutes from time for his sixth league goal this season. Winless Reggina stay second from bottom with two points. The Juve match was the last of three homes games Napoli had to play with the end stands of their stadium closed as punishment for the trouble that marred their opening day fixture at Rom
