 MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany, Oct 16 (Reuters) - A fine long-range strike from Piotr Trochowski earned Group Four favourites Germany a 1-0 win over Wales in a rain-soaked World Cup qualifier on Wednesday. Germany, fresh from a 2-1 win over Russia on Saturday, had most of the possession and virtually all the chances but solid Welsh defence frustrated them before Trochowski swept in his first international goal with around 20 minutes to go. Victory strengthens Germany's position at the top of the group, with 10 points from four matches. Russia are second with six points from three games, with Wales on six from four. Germany never looked in danger of conceding but for a long time they lacked the wit to unlock the Welsh defence.

Bastian Schweinsteiger's first-half effort whistled over the bar and Michael Ballack's precise shot from a similar position, after turning on the edge of the area, brought the first good save from Wayne Hennessey. Germany took a few more risks at the start of the second half, with Philipp Lahm causing trouble when he cut in from left-back, before Trochowski worked the ball back and fly with a late swerving shot that was too good for Hennessey. "I've had a lot of shots and one had to go in some time," Trochowski told German TV. "I'm delighted it was enough to win the game." Wales had one good chance to equalise when Craig Bellamy took advantage of a mistake from Lahm and cut the ball back into the area. Chris Gunter managed to get in a shot but Per Mertesacker stepped in to bloc
