 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has asked the government to investigate a failed attempt by Rapid Action Battalion to arrest an innocent person in Satkhira four days ago. Following a petition by two human rights organisations, the bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Mohammad Delwar Hossain asked the government to form an independent investigation committee and submit the report within 10 days. The committee should not be comprised of any members of the law enforcing agency, the justices said In its order given on Wednesday, the court also asked the government why no legal action should be taken in relation to the Satkhira incident and asked the RAB director general to submit a list of the members of the elite force, present in the event in Satkhira on May 22. On May 23, the newspaper Samakal published a report claiming that someone had thrown weapons into the house of Safiqul Islam in Natuar Danga village of Satkhira sadar just as a group of RAB Members, entered the house. Local people then held 21 RAB members following the incident Advocate Manzil Morshed, lawyer for Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh and Society of Justice, said in Wednesday's hearing that it is the responsibility of the law enforcers to ensure safety for common people. Instead of doing so a group of RAB officials attempted to frame a person in a false case, he said. In its order the High Court bench also asked the RAB director general and inspector general of police to notify it what actions they had taken following the May 22 incident. It summoned RAB official Maj Quamruzzaman and deputy assistant director Delwar to appear before the court on June 8. The court ordered law enforcers to ensure safety of the inhabitants of Natuar Danga village. The court has appointed five lawyers as amicus curie to provide assistance in the hearing. They are Amir-ul Islam, M Zahir, Rokonuddin Mahmud, Shahdin Malik and Sara Hossain. The High Court in last November issued a suo moto rule on the government and RAB following the death of two brothers in crossfire in Madaripur. It had asked for an explanation why the death in crossfire should not be declared illegal. bd
