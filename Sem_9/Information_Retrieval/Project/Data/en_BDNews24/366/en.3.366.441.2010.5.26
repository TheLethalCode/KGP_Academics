<TEXT>
 Kishoreganj, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid has said the government is taking steps to exempt farmers of Haor areas from paying loan since they are affected by the onrushing water from hilly areas. He, however, insisted on government officials giving accurate estimates of the losses. Hamid met with local government officials and heads of organisations implementing development projects at Kishoreganj Circuit House on Wednesday. He emphasised that the government staff work sincerely because otherwise, no government projects will be successful. The speaker said no criminals would be given leeway for their political affiliations for the government to maintain the law and order. Hamid also ordered the officials to take effective steps to stop river-grabbing and corruption in fish preservation and construction works. bdne
