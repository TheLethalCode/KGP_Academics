 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  A furniture trader died in hospital on Tuesday after the Rapid Action Battalion arrested him on Monday night. The deceased was identified as Abul Kalam Azad, 44. RAB's legal and media wing director Mohammad Sohail Hossain said that doctors had declared him dead at around 8am after they took him to the National Institute of Cardio-Vascular Diseases. "He died of cardiac arrest. It was a natural death," he claimed. Azad was taken to Bangladesh Medical College Hospital (BMCH) branch at Uttara at around 4am soon after he complained of chest pain, Hossain said. Doctors at BMCH said Azad was suffering cardiac disease. He was taken to NICVD when his condition deteriorated, he said. RAB said they were conducting a drive at Senakalyan Complex at Mohakhali on Monday night and detained Azad and his son Ripon on charges of keeping porn CDs. RAB said they had released Ripon earlier on Tuesday after his father became ill. Ripon said he and his father Azad were interrogated in separate rooms at the RAB-1 office on Monday. Ripon, however, could not say if his father was tortured while questioning. He said his father used to sometimes come to visit his shop at the complex. bdnews
