 Chandpur, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP state minister ANM Ehsanul Haque Milan has raised questions about the neutrality of the judiciary. Milan, who appeared before the court on Wednesday in an extortion case, also expressed his doubts about whether the judges dealing with his case were independent. Chandpur judicial magistrate Rahmat Ali, setting June 9 for the next hearing, ordered teh police to provide Milan appropriate medical treatment. The BNP leader, currently behind bars, has accused the judges of willfully denying him bail when others, accused in the case, have already been set free. The case was filed against Milan and his associates in the district's Kachua Upazila in Feb 2007 for beating Alamgir Hossain, vandalising his motorcycle and demanding Tk 5 lakh as extortion from him. bdnews2
