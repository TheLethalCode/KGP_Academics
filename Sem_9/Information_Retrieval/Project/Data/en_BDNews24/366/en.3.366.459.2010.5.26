 LONDON, May 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh's captain, Shakib Al Hasan, has confirmed he received an approach from an unknown person whom he believed wanted him to manipulate the result of a one-day international against Ireland. The incident is believed to have taken place in Dhaka in March 2008, and involved a brief phonecall on the eve of an ODI series against Ireland in which Shakib, who was not captain at the time, was offered 'sponsorship' in return for his under-performance, reports Cricinfo. In accordance with the strict guidelines of the ICC's anti-corruption and security unit, Shakib immediately reported the approach to a Bangladesh Cricket Board official and to Colonel Noor, the ASCU's regional manager, and never heard from the caller again. Bangladesh had been expected to win the contest, and duly did, by a comfortable 3-0 margin. "It was a long time ago, probably two-and-a-half years ago, in our home conditions against Ireland," Shakib told reporters on the eve of the first Test against England at Lord's. "I didn't talk to him much because we had a team meeting to go to, so I told him 'I'll talk to you later' and immediately told a member of the board and the ICC guy. They took action and after that he never called me again." Shakib's revelations come on the same day that the Daily Telegraph revealed that a senior county cricketer was asked to 'name his price' to fix the result of televised one-day matches in English domestic cricket, and confirm the fears of the outgoing head of the ASCU, Lord Condon, that the threat of match fixing will never be entirely stamped out, and that it could "spread like a rash" if the game's players and administrators relax their vigilance. Shakib added that the exact nature of the deal that the phone-caller was proposing was never fully revealed. "We didn't have time to discuss all the things, and what I should do," he said. "I took the phone, and from the way he was talking, I thought he might do something, so I told someone. He never exactly told me he wanted me to fix a match, he just told me he wanted to be my sponsor. "I can't speak for anyone else, but as far as I'm concerned my head wasn't turned at that time," he added. "What I feel is I do not care about the money. I want to play for my country, because that is a great pride for me, and I want to continue to do well for my country. As far as my family is concerned we are settled enough to lead our lives, so I am not concerned about those monies. If I play well for the next ten years, the money will come and I won't have to worry about
