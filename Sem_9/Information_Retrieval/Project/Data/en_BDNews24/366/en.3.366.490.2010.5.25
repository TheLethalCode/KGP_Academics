 LONDON, May 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Off-spinner Graeme Swann was Monday named as the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB)'s Cricketer of the Year, which is selected by the British media. Seamer Katherine Brunt won the Women's Cricketer of the Year prize and Chris Edwards claimed the disability award, says BBC Online. Nottinghamshire's Swann, 31, has taken 99 wickets in 45 games for England in the past year, and also starred in the Ashes and ICC World Twenty20 triumphs. He is currently third in the ICC's world rankings of Test bowlers. Swann helped England regain the Ashes last year, claiming eight wickets in the decisive final Test victory at Oval and averaging 35 with the bat, which has also helped him to fourth place in the world all-rounder rankings. He snared 37 wickets in six Tests against South Africa and Bangladesh over the winter, was an automatic choice in the one-day side and an ever-present in the Twenty20 team which captured England's first world one-day trophy in the Caribbean earlier this month. The awards cover the 12-month spell from the start of last year's international summer in May to the end of the just-completed World Twenty20. Swann topped a shortlist which also included Test and one-day captain Andrew Strauss, Twenty20 skipper Paul Collingwood, and pace bowlers Stuart Broad and James Anderson. "I am absolutely delighted to win this award," said Swann. "It's been a magical year for me with so many high points. "I love playing for England and hope this award can be a stepping stone for even greater things, both personally and as part of a successful England team. "I would like to take this opportunity to thank my team-mates for the support they've given me on and off the field over the last year. "As I'm sure you can see from the pictures on TV we work hard as a team and take real pleasure in each other's successes. The atmosphere and bond we have in the dressing-room at the moment makes winning that much sweeter." Barnsley-born Brunt, 24, won the women's award for the second time after a fine year for England - having previously won it in 2006. She claimed figures of 3-6 from four overs in England's victory in the ICC Women's World Twenty20 final against New Zealand at Lord's last year and a match-winning 5-22 in the second one-day international against India in Bangalore in February which propelled her to third in the ICC women's bowling rankings. "I am honoured to win the award for second time. It's been a mixed year for the team but along the way we've had some amazing highs such as winning the World Twenty20 in 2009," she said. "I've been pleased with my bowling performances over the last year, but I'm always striving to take it to the next level. "My ultimate goal is to be the best bowler in the world in the women's game. It's great to be part of a successful team with so many talented players and makes taking this award even more special." Her award was chosen by a panel comprising former England skipper Clare Connor, now the ECB's head of women's cricket, England head coach Mark Lane and the Guardian newspaper's Mike Selvey, himself a former England seam bowler. The other candidates for the women's award were star batter Claire Taylor, wicketkeeper Sarah Taylor and off-spinner Laura Marsh. Edwards, a 17-year-old all-rounder, became the second winner of the disability prize after Nathan Foy in 2009. He made his debut for the England Learning Disability side in 2008 as a 15-year-old, and has now cemented his place as an opening batsman and useful seam bo
