 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday stayed two cases for hurting religious sentiment. The cases were filed against high-ranking leaders of the Islamist fundamentalist outfit Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir. Notable defendants in the two cases are Jamaat amir Matiur Rahman Nizami, his deputy Delwar Hossain Sayedee, the party's Dhaka Metropolitan chief Rafiqul Islam Khan and former Shibir president Shafiqul Islam Masud. The bench of justices Tariq ul Hakim and Soumendra Sarker ordered the government to explain why both the cases should not be quashed. Lawyer Khandaker Mahbub Hossain argued for the petitioners at the court. The cases related to Dhaka City Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan's comparison of Nizami with the prophet Muhammad at a Mar 17 meeting of Jamaat's student front, Islami Chhatra Shibir, in the city. Various newspapers on Mar 18 reported Khan saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". One of the two cases was filed on Mar 21 in Lalmonirhat and the other on Mar 25 in Rangamati. bdne
