 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid do away with socio-cultural barriers, women health workers are inspiring women to take up jobs. The workers usually provide health support in rural Bangladesh. Speakers made the observations at a seminar on 'women health workers bringing change' at the Sasakawa Auditorium at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B) in capital on Wednesday. Brac Development Institute (BDI) of Brac University and ICDDR, B, jointly organised this seminar. BDI chief researcher Simin Mahmud and coordinator Mahin Sultan, the BDI coordinator of "Pathways of Women's Empowerment Research programme" presented the discussion note. Speakers also said that the seminar was actually an outcome of research, which determines the women workers' contribution in changing society. The experience of Brac, ICDDR, B, Ganashasthya Kendra and governmental organisation's women health workers' from different areas of the country was explored in this research, they said. The final report was a result of 45 women activists' interviews from Savar Ganashasthya Kendra, Jamalpur Brac health centre and Matlab upazila ICDDR, B. The husbands and family members were also interviewed including the workers and representatives, the speakers added. Simin Mahmud said, "There had been a vast change in the activists' lives, who are working in the rural areas." "Besides, they have also turned into bread winners for their households." "These women are encouraging other women to work while delivering primary health care." Mahin Sultan said, "Women faced restrictions to go outdoors in the past, which is decreasing every day."
