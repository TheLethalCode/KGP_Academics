<TITLE> Thai court approves 'terrorism' warrant for Thaksin </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, May 25 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  A Thai court on Tuesday approved an arrest warrant for fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra on terrorism charges, which carry a maximum penalty of death, in connection with recent violent protests. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva's government has accused Thaksin of inciting unrest and bankrolling the mass rallies by the opposition "Red Shirts", many of whom seek the return of the former telecoms tycoon. "A court found there was enough evidence so it issued an arrest warrant," Naras Savestanan, deputy chief of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), told reporters after the closed-door hearing at the Criminal Court. "Now it's the attorney general's job to enforce the warrant," he said. The tycoon-turned-premier was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006 and lives in self-imposed exile, mainly in Dubai, to avoid a jail term for corruption. If found guilty, Thaksin could in theory face the death penalty, but the warrant appears aimed at boosting attempts to extradite Thaksin, who has found sanctuary in several countries. The government has exerted pressure on countries he has visited and moved to freeze his finances. Abhisit said the court ruling and the severity of the charge would help the government's efforts to have Thaksin extradited. "It will make our work with foreign countries easier," he told reporters. "We still have to monitor his movements and seek cooperation in line with existing agreements. As of now many countries are banning him, but not all." The DSI, tasked with investigating violence surrounding the anti-government demonstrations by the Red Shirts, said on Monday it had submitted evidence "which show Thaksin's coordinating role" in the unrest. Thaksin last week denied he was the "mastermind of the terrorists". His legal adviser, Pichit Cheunban, said Tuesday he would inform the ex-premier of the court move and "discuss what to do next." The street rallies, which were broken up last week by the army, paralysed central Bangkok and descended into several outbreaks of violence that left 88 people dead since mid-March, mostly civilians, and nearly 1,900 injured. Many of the protest leaders have been arrested and are in police custody. Authorities Tuesday extended a midnight-to-4am curfew in Bangkok and 23 provinces for four nights as it seeks to restore order in the capital, where arson and looting broke out last week after the army crackdown. Thaksin is idolised by many of the "Red Shirt" protesters for his populist policies, including cheap healthcare and village funds, but Thailand's elite see him as corrupt, authoritarian and a threat to the revered monarchy. His elected allies were later ejected in a controversial court ruling, paving the way for Abhisit's administration to be appointed in a 2008 army-backed parliamentary vote. The Reds, who are campaigning for fresh elections to replace a government they condemn as undemocratic, disbanded last Wednesday in the face of a military offensive that forced their leaders to surrender. Enraged militants within the movement set 36 major buildings ablaze including the stock exchange and Thailand's biggest mall, Central World, which now stands in ru
