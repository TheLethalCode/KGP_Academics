<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University students protesting since Wednesday morning the introduction of evening classes have ended their blockade of Doel Square when the vice-chancellor agreed to meet with them. Around 8am, students from the Department of Computer Science & Engineering locked the classrooms and started to boycott the classes. Around midday 200 students began blocking all vehicular movement, other than university vehicles, at Doel Square. Dean Shahida Rafique, from the Faculty of Engineering & Technology, and assistant proctor Aftab Ali Sheikh, from the Faculty of Science, visited the scene and asked the students to lift their blockade. The students, however, said they would not stop their protest, which started on Saturday, unless the university authorities gave them their assurance in writing that the master's course would be cancelled. In a statement, the Progressive Students Alliance expressed its solidarity with the protest. The students alleged that the dean had earlier agreed to cancel the course on Sunday, but on the following day, advertisements announcing the course were posted in various newspapers. Responding to these claims, the dean said in the morning that the department could not then decide whether the course should be postponed as the decision to introduce it was taken at a syndicate meeting. He added the course could not be temporarily suspended. Later on Wednesday afternoon, however, proctor KM Saiful Islam gave a written statement to the students which included a recommendation from the dean that the course would be cancelled subject to talks with the department's academic committee. The demonstrating students responded by saying that they would only lift the blockade in the presence of the vice chancellor and his assurance that the university would not introduce any more evening courses. The blockade was, however, lifted at around 3 pm and the Alliance is in talks with vice-chancellor professor ASMS Arefin Siddique. Meanwhile extra police forces have been deployed at Doel Square. bdnew
