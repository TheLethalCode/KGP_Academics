 Savar, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion on Tuesday arrested a pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leader of Jahangirnagar University and two of his associates in Savar on the capital's fringe. RAB also seized a pistol, three bullets and a magazine from them. The detainees are JCD's co-convener Galib Imtiaz Nahid, 27, and associates Mahiduzzaman, 26, and Selim Hossain, 28. Nahid is a student of 32nd batch of Bangla department. Shah Mizanul Haque, squadron leader of RAB-4 Savar camp, told reporters that Nahid and his aides were detained from a room of Savar's Hotel Highway. He is alleged to have been involved in extortions, mugging and robbery, the RAB officer said. Nahid used to carry on criminal activities at night and lived at different residential hotels in the daytime, Haque added. The university authorities have recently suspended him for one year on charge of attacking a Bangladesh Chhatra League activist of the university. Nahid, however, told reporters he had known nothing about the arms and ammunition. He claimed he had been sleeping during the RAB raid. A case was being filed under arms law in the evening. bdnews
