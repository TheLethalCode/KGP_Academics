 Savar, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  At least 20 people, including a police officer, were injured in a clash between police and workers of a readymade garment factory in Savar on Wednesday. At around 8:30am, over a thousand workers of Setara Group demonstrated in front of the factory to press for their 12-point demands, which included a pay rise, Ashulia police chief Sirajul Islam said. He said that the police charged the workers with clubs to disperse them as the demonstrators were allegedly planning to "sabotage" the factory. The workers hurled brickbats at the police, said Islam, who was also injured in the clash. Authorities from Setera Group have shut the factory down for an indefinite period after the incident. The injured were given first aid. The police officer admitted that several workers had been injured in the police baton charge. bdnew
