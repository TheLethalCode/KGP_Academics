 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  All private chambers of doctors across the country will remain closed on June 6. The Bangladesh Medical Association (BMA) says that the countrywide strike was to press for the doctors' demand for justice and trial of assault on a physician. All specialist physicians in Dhaka closed their private chambers to public on Monday evening protesting the assault. Bangladesh Society of Medicine president M A Jalil Chowdhury said the strike came as a protest against an assault on their former president A K M Rafik Uddin. The decision was taken in a BMA meeting on Monday. Vice president of Dhaka city BMA Md Abdur Rouf Sardar told bdnews24.com of the decision at around 11pm following the meeting. The meeting started at around 9pm at the BMA office. Besides BMA and the Bangladesh Society of Medicine, members of other associations including the Association of Physicians of Bangladesh and the Orthopaedic Society were present. Rafik was assaulted at his private chamber in Dhanmondi on May 9. The incident was triggered when one of his female patients, an Eden College student, alleged that he had molested her. Reportedly, her friends, mostly Dhaka University students, became agitated hearing her complaints. As a result they assaulted Rafik for his harassment and reportedly vandalised his chamber. A case was filed with the Dhanmondi police in this connection. The female patient also filed a case alleging that doctor had sexually molested her in his chamber. On May 11, a ministry statement said that home minister Sahara Khatun ordered for the immediate arrest of the assaulters following a visit by a doctors' delegation led by BMA chief Mahmud Hasan. The delegation also put a 24-hour deadline for the arrest of the attackers. Jalil said Monday, "No one has been arrested till now." He claimed that doctors were suffering from a lack of security.
