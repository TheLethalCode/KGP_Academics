 bdnews24.com Beijing correspondent Beijing, May 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Indian president Pratibha Patil arrives in China on Wednesday on a six-day official visit, the first one by a head of state of the neighbouring country in 10 years. The visit, at the invitation of Chinese president Hu Jintao, coincides with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have a long-standing dispute over Arunachal Pradesh and part of Jammu and Kashmir. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told a press briefing that during the visit, China and Indian leaders would discuss bilateral, regional and global issues and economic cooperation, and focus on furthering their ties. The relations of the two neighbors has not been without recent incident, with the Chinese incursion in Leh in India-administered Jammu and Kashmir and the row over Tibetian leader Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Pradesh. China has two major territorial claims -- one in Arunachal Pradesh and the other in Ladakh district in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir. India deems the territories as its own. The Indian president will also visit Shanghai and Luoyang of central China's Henan province. In Shanghai, she will visit the World Expo 2010 and preside over the first major brainstorming session of India-China Business Forum on May 31. In Luoyang, she will attend the inauguration ceremony of the white horse temple, a famous Indian-style Buddhist temple.
