<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, May 24 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Gunmen shot dead two police officers and wounded six others in a spasm of violence in Jamaica triggered as gangs take up arms to fight US calls to extradite a popular local druglord. Just hours after Prime Minister Bruce Golding Sunday imposed a state of emergency in the capital of the Caribbean tourist island, officers came under attack there, police said Monday. It was the first time any Jamaican policemen have been killed in the unrest triggered when the government last week signed an order to extradite Christopher "Dudus" Coke, a reputed gang leader who is hugely popular as a kind of local Robin Hood, for helping impoverished Jamaicans. But Coke also figures on a US Department of Justice list, which includes the "world's most dangerous narcotics kingpins." He is accused since the 1990s of leading an international gang known as "The Shower Posse," which the Justice Department says sells marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere. He was formally charged in August with conspiracy to traffic drugs and illegal weapons, and if convicted faces mandatory life imprisonment. Armed supporters are said to be roaming eastern Kingston and have erected barricades to protect him in the standoff which has turned increasingly violent. Police said the gangs, also blamed for burning down a police station, had stockpiled a large cache of weapons, including large-gauge rifles. Unconfirmed reports said one civilian has also been killed, since the violence erupted. Golding has vowed to pursue Coke's arrest and extradition. "The criminal element who have placed the society under siege will not be allowed to triumph," Golding said late Sunday in an address to the nation. He said the state of emergency in Kingston "will be a turning point for us as a nation to confront the powers of evil that have penalized the society and earned us the unenviable label as one of the murder capitals of the world. "We must confront this criminal element with determination and unqualified resolve," he said.Coke, 42, also heads the Tivoli Gardens community, which Golding represents in the Jamaican Parliament. And to Kingston residents, Coke is more like a godfather. Thousands marched through the city Thursday chanting, "Leave Dudus alone, leave Dudus alone." "He is next to God," one demonstrator said. "Just like how Jesus died on the cross for us, we are willing to die for Dudus," said another. Amid the fury of Coke's supporters, the month-long state of emergency was slapped on Kingston and St. Andrew after Golding held an emergency meeting of his cabinet Sunday. "The threats that have emerged to the safety and security of our people will be repelled with strong and decisive action," Golding promised in his address. Although Golding signed the extradition request for Coke, reversing an earlier decision, the petition is pending a final court decision, with Coke required to attend the hearing. The police came under attack in eastern Kingston late Sunday after a woman driver reported being shot at, the police's Constabulary Communication Network said. The wounded police were taken to the University of the West Indies hospital, where two of the officers died, the CCN said. Police said the violence had spread to Spanish Town, the old Jamaican capital to the west of Kingston, where gunmen shot up a police station. The police also reported that more barricades had been mounted on roads across Kingston and neighboring St. Andrew despite the state of emergency. People have been urged to leave the roughest neighborhoods and sections of Kingston came under siege as armed men roamed the city, taking on policemen who attempted to clear roadblocks. The US State Department on Friday issued a travel warning urging US citizens to weigh the risks of traveling to and within the Kingston metropolitan ar
