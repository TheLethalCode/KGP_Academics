 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has issued a suo moto rule on the police to verify a newspaper report that 300 vehicles were requisitioned the day after a court order. Daily Amader Samay carried the report on Tuesday after the court on Sunday asked the government and police not to requisition vehicles unless it was in public interest. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Mohammad Delwar Hossain on its own ordered the inspector general of police, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner and deputy commissioner of Dhaka Traffic zone to verify the report and inform it within a week. The same bench had asked authorities not to allow vehicles to be requisitioned except in public interest. The police had also been asked why section 103 (A) of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police ordinance, that allows vehicles to be requisitioned, should not be declared illegal and unconstitutional. The order had been given on a public interest petition filed by rights organisation, Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh. The court in Sunday's ruling also ordered authorities not to harass the owner or the driver during requisition and pay them compensation within seven days in case of any damage to the vehicles. The bench also asked government officials not to use requisitioned vehicles for personal purposes. The Bangla language daily Jugantar on May 14 had published a report on clashes between police and a taxicab driver whose vehicle was being requisitioned. There was a photo of three police officers along with the report. The court ordered the Dhaka metropolitan police commissioner to submit to the court details about the officials along with the driver within three days. The next date for hearing has been set for June 7. The court appointed seven lawyers as amicus curie to assist the court at the hearing. The lawyers are Rafique-ul-Huq, Rokanuddin Mahmud, M Amir-ul-Islam, Ajmalul Hossain QC, Mahmudul Islam, Supreme Court Bar Association president Khandaker Mahbub Hossain and former SCBA president AFM Mesbah Uddin. Deputy attorney general Nazrul Islam Taluker represented the government at Sunday's hearing. bdn
