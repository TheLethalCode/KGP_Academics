"The way things are in our country today (the financial crisis) we must have a good showing to bring them some joy." Echoing his remarks, Panathinaikos team-mate Kostas Katsouranis added: "We have the capabilities to bring joy to Greeks in the World Cup." Both players agreed that making it to the next round in the World Cup would be a huge success for Greece who play in Group B against Argentina, South Korea and Nigeria. And they credited German coach Otto Rehhagel will their surprise 2004 success.
