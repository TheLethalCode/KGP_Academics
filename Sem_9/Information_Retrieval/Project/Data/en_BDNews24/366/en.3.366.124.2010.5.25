 Dhaka, May24 (bdnews24.com) -- The chief election commissioner has suggested that the government pass legislation setting out criteria for the appointment of election commissioners. "Educational qualification, family background, lifestyle and public image should be judged while appointing commissioners. Such consideration will ensure selection of the right persons," M Shamsul Huda said on Monday. He said that the Election Commission was going to send a set of recommendations to the government. Speaking at the launch of a UNDP publication on parliament elections at Sonargaon Hotel, he urged the political parties to stop repeatedly demanding the resignation of election commissioners, and instead work to make the Commission a robust institution. "The Election Commission is an institution of human beings. So there may be mistakes. But if parties start raising hell for their resignation, it will be impossible to make it a strong institution. The parties should have patience," he said. His comment came in the wake of BNP's demand for resignation of election commissioners over the Apr 24 by-election in Bhola-3 constituency, which the main opposition party claims were rigged. Referring to the MA Aziz-led Commission in 2006, Huda said the commissioners had to quit in the face of demand by then opposition Awami League "as they were nominated." He pointed out that the Commission, under his leadership, had sent a draft of a law, The Election Commissioners (Method of Recruitment) Ordinance-2008, to the caretaker government in 2007. The proposed law provides for a search committee to prepare a panel of three nominees for each post in order of preference after examining their qualifications. It also provides that candidates will be finalised on the agreement of the parliament's Business Advisory Committee. The recommendations of the committee would be forwarded by the commission to the prime minister's office, which will then send them to the parliament secretariat and the Business Advisory Committee of the parliament. On the independence of the Commission secretariat, the CEC holds that being independent makes no difference. "The Commission will have to work smoothly with recruitment of manpower by the PSC and financial accountability to the Comptroller and Auditor General." Huda last year had pointed out that no law had been enacted in 36 years to appoint people to certain constitutional posts such as that of election commissioner. The Commission's lawyers said the constitution did not determine any requirements for election commissioners. It gives authority to the president to make appointments to the EC on his own. UN resident representative Stefan Priesner unveiled the cover of the publication, "Election in Bangladesh, 2006-2009: Transforming failure into success", written by Peter Escher. Moderated by Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation chairman, the programme was addressed also by Prof Mozaffar Ahmad and Prof Imtiaz Ahmed. bdne
