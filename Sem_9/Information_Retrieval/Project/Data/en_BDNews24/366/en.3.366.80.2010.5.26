<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said that the government is working towards achieving eight percent growth by 2015 to ensure that people have the capacity to purchase food. "Gaining food sufficiency will not ensure food security. It can only be ensured when people can buy the food," said Hasina, at the inauguration of a two-day meeting of the Bangladesh Food Security Investment Forum (BFSIF) on Wednesday. Hasina said the government is determined to reduce the number of impoverished people in the country, which is currently 60 million, adding that achieving growth in the agriculture sector is the prime condition to eradicate poverty. The government is providing a subsidy to the agriculture sector, she said The PM said that even though the Copenhagen deal has some shortcomings, it is significant and that was why Bangladesh had accepted the deal. Even though Bangladesh is not at all responsible for climate change, the country is a victim of various natural disasters every year. She suggested that the developed countries should come up with technical as well as financial assistance. Food and Disaster Management Minister Abdur Razzak, who was also present at the programme, said that the major impediment to attaining food security is limited investment. He said that the government has increased allocation in the social safety net programme by slashing the budget from other sectors. Razzak, who is also chairman of the BFSIF, hoped the forum would be able to achieve its objective. In her speech, Agriculture Minister Matia Chowdhury claimed the country has tripled its food production over three decades, but availability had become a challenge in recent years due to natural disasters. Matia said if the country were to depend solely on the donor agencies it would lead to further insecurity and vulnerability instead of self-sufficiency. Climate change has emerged as a threat to ensuring food security because arable lands are decreasing every year, the agriculture minister said. The minister urged donor agencies and partners to assist Bangladesh with financial and technical support. The forum, meeting at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, is expected to discuss and identify the relevant sectors for disbursement of the G8 group fund donation promised to Bangladesh. The forum will also decide on the strategy for the expenditure. These allocations would be finalised at the upcoming meetings of G8 in June in Canada, and at the Asia Food Security Investment Forum in the Philippines in July. Earlier, a US$ 20 billion fund was formed at the G8 Group's 2009 summit in Italy's L'Aquila. This year, the G20 also promised to donate $22 billion to different countries for development in the agriculture sector, Razzak told a press briefing on Tuesday. Financial assistance to Bangladesh will also be decided at the two international meets, the food minister added. bdn
