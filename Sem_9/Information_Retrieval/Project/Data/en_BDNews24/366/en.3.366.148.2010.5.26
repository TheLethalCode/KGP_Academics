 KARACHI, May 26 (bdnews24.com) -- The decision to appoint Shahid Afridi as captain in all three formats of the game, came in for sharp criticism from former Pakistani players who feel the move is a big gamble and could backfire as the all-rounder was not a regular member of the team in the five-day format. Former captain Zaheer Abbas was stunned by the decision and said the selectors should have given more thought on the captaincy issue, reports PTI. "I am really surprised at the board's decision because he has not played a Test in the last four years," Abbas said. "It is a strange decision and one that could badly backfire because Shahid (Afridi) has not been a regular Test player and his last test was in 2006. So how can the board give him the captaincy for two very tough series against Australia and England," he said. "I don't think there was a hurry to announce the captain for the England tour. The board could have waited for the Asia Cup to begin and then decide who was the best choice to lead Pakistan in the Tests," Abbas added. Abbas pointed out that Test cricket was unlike Twenty20 and ODIs where luck played a big part. "Test matches are the real challenge and no player can hide his weaknesses or issues in a Test match," he said. Former captain and ex-chief selector Aamir Sohail was equally disappointed with Afridi's appointment and said it would be tough for the 30-year-old all-rounder to lead the Pakistan in England. "The board has taken its decision but it is a debatable one. It is a big gamble. I think Shahid (Afridi) will be really tested in England as he has been out of the Test side for four years now," Sohail said. Sources said that another former skipper Javed Miandad was also not in favour of Afridi's appointment as Test captain and had even conveyed his reservation to the PCB chairman Ijaz Butt. However, former selector Abdul Qadir has backed Afridi's appointment and said it was a step in the right direction. "I think the board should have done this much earlier. I don't know why they delayed it. I would also urge the PCB to name Salman Butt as vice-captain for the Asia Cup and England tour," the former leg-spinner said. "In the existing circumstances he (Afridi) is the best choice and I think he should continue until the board is able to groom a vice-captain properly," he said. Qadir backed former skippers Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik's inclusion in the 35-man list of probables for the Asia Cup and the subsequent tour of England. "What has happened has happened and I think we should not waste our best players at this level," he said. Former captain Wasim Akram believed in the present circumstances Afridi was the right man to lead Pakistan in all the three formats of the game. "I feel Afridi is the right choice for Pakistan. Although he is fit to lead in one-dayers and T20s, I have my doubts in Tests. But right now, PCB has no choice. They are short on options," he said. "Afridi is a fine choice as the team is struggling. They need someone with the right temperament. International teams are not travelling to Pakistan because of security reasons. The team has also not played enough cricket. The loss in the T20 (World Cup) semis would still be hurting. So the team should move on under a new leadership," he said. "In my honest opinion, Afridi cannot make a Test side on his batting skills alone, and in bowling too, I am not sure he will do wonders in English conditions where there will hardly be any turn. But I think he will excel as a leader. He will inspire the team with his aggression and passion," the former left-arm pacer added. "Afridi should know one thing. England tour will not be easy. To beat England on their home soil will be extremely difficult. However, if Pakistan adopt proper planning and execute accordingly, anything can happen." "Most importantly, experience in batting is crucial, especially in middle order. That is where Afridi has to put his foot down. Have his say in selection committee. He is the captain so he knows who the best eleven are," Akram told espnstar.com. Akram also lauded Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik's inclusion for the Asia Cup and England tour. "I think if the Board is okay with having them (Younis and Malik) in the team and the captain too has no issue, one must go ahead with it. The captain should specially work to have them in the side since their experience and talent can only help Pakistan win matches. It will reflect well on captain Afridi," he said. "I also think Afridi is tough enough to handle these seniors. He can also count on them to take the team to glory in tough English conditions," the cricketer-turned-commentator a
