 Jahangirnagar University, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  A Chhatra League leader of Jahangirnagar University was suspended over a clash from early Monday. The clash took place just four days after a new committee of the university unit of the pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League was formed. This decision was taken in a disciplinary board meeting, presided over by the vice-chancellor, Sharif Enamul Kabir, a press release said. The meeting also formed a five-member committee to investigate the matter. BCL joint secretary Md Asgar Ali, a 33rd batch student of Economics department was expelled temporarily for three months. He was also expelled from the party for an indefinite period following the incident. Asgar was responsible for the attack on his rival BCL activists of Bhashani Hall Sunday midnight, the statement added. Rival factions within the BCL attacked each other leaving vice president Rashed Reza Dicken and at least seven others injured. Witnesses say on Monday the BCL group led by Dicken was attacked at Bhashani Hall by Asgar and his supporters. The probe committee, headed by the pro-VC, was asked to work on the issue and submit the report within one week. Earlier in the day, JU BCL submitted a memorandum to the vice-chancellor demanding punishment of Asgar, Suman, Jakir, Shamrat, Sohan and others giving a 24-hour ultimatum. The JU BCL committee was formed on May 20 after the old one was dissolved last year following rampant clashes within the university's Chhatra League factions over establishing supremacy on the campus after the Awami League government assumed power. This was the first inter-party clash at JU after the declaration of the new committee. bdnews2
