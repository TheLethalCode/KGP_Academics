 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League's advisory council alleged that there had been a breach in the constitution as the Chief Justice had not administered an oath of office to two High Court judges. The party's general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, also local government minister was speaking on Tuesday night after an advisory council meeting at Ganabhaban, the prime minister's official residence. On April 18, chief justice Fazlul Karim gave oaths to 15 of the 17 appointed judges. Mohammad Khasruzzaman and Ruhul Kuddus Babu were left out due to 'unavoidable circumstances', said an official press release explaining the omission. The meeting, headed by party president Sheikh Hasina, also expressed its grave concern in this regard. A council member and also chief of the parliamentary watchdog on the law ministry, Suranjit Sengupta, on Monday alleged that the chief justice had violated his oath. Law minister Shafique Ahmed on May 16 had termed speculations about the pending oath baseless. In a bid to reassure people, he had said that they would soon take oath. Mainly consisting of Awami League stalwarts, who are commonly perceived to have been sidelined with mainly advisory roles without much executive authority, the advisory council was reported to have expressed satisfaction over the government's activities. Disgruntled senior leaders Amir Hossain Amu, Tofael Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Abdul Jalil, who were not accommodated in the cabinet, are currently advisory council members. They were said to be critical of the chief justice not administering oath to two controversial High Court judge-appoints. Ashraf said the council had pressed Hasina to further strengthen the ruling alliance inlcuding conducting councils of the party associates. "The advisory council also made suggestions to Sheikh Hasina over governing. They found government activities satisfactory," he added. The council members expressed their satisfaction over the country's current law and order situation, he said. The Awami League advisers said that the government was countering militancy, fundamentalism, religious miscreants, and national and international terrorists appropriately. They also suggested immediate local government elections. The advisers proposed a list of educational institutions that were already under the MPO (Monthly Payment Order). Moreover, Ashraf said, "The prime minster has also asked for suggestions to include more members to the council." There are currently 19 members in the 41-strong council. Tuesday's meeting also discussed the process of selecting chairman for the divisional sub-committees of the AL's central committee. The advisors were made chairman of the sub-committees. Ashraf said the advisors have started work from Tuesday. The AL parliamentary standing committee members would be members of the different sub-committees, he added. Council member Abdur Razzak and Rahmat Ali could not attend Tuesday's meeting due to illness. bdnews
