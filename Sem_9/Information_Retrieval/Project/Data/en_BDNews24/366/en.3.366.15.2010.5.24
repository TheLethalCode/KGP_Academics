 May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka stocks slumped on Monday with the key index falling by 1.7 percent after a week of hype, which experts, however, said was 'fairly normal'. The general index or the DGEN lost 103 points to end on 5993 points due to profit taking, with almost 80 percent of the traded issues declining in the day. The bull-run since May 10, induced by the news of the government nod for face value conversion, caused the bourse to gain 1.92 percent on Sunday taking the index over 6000 points for the first time in history. The benchmark of DSE added 271 points in the last six sessions when records were broken every day, with market capitalisation rising by Tk 115 billion. Market participators said that the downturn was caused by investors' profit taking behaviour. "This is fairly normal after the rise over almost the last two weeks," mutual fund operator Yawer Sayeed told bdnews24.com. According to the CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh, a good portion of the investors sold of their holdings to benefit from the recent rise. "There is no reason to become worried at this fall." He, however, said that the market was still overheated. "If the fall continues for several days, then we can say that it is being bearish." Out of 254 traded scrips, 202 fell, 47 advanced and five held steady. Meanwhile, the daily turnover slid down to Tk 18.51 billion from Tk 20.55 billion of the previous day. bd
