 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com) Former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed has said the current cabinet is full of 'inexperienced and amateurish' ministers. He also accused the ruling Awami League ministers of 'confusing people' with 'vulgar words'. The BNP standing committee member was speaking at a discussion meeting organised by the Jatiyatabadi Swechchasebak Dal, the BNP volunteer wing, at the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh on Tuesday. The opposition MP said there was no coordination among the cabinet members. "Vulgarity has become a trademark of Awami League." Moudud also urged the BNP activists across the country to prepare for the Jun 27 countrywide general strike. "We will compel the government to run away," he said, trying to make the point that the BNP's campaign to unseat the govenrment would be very strong. Claiming that 'Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of Bangladesh', Moudud said those who wanted to wipe out Zia's name from history were living in a 'fool's paradise'. BNP standing committee members Mirza Abbas, Abdul Moeen Khan, Rafiqul Islam Mia, joint secretary general Aman Ullah Aman and office secretary Fazlul Haque Milon spoke among others. bdnews
