 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)--The cabinet committee on purchase has approved proposals under the quick rental plan for buying 240MW from three power plants. The plants will start feeding the national grid six to nine months after contracts are signed, cabinet secretary M A Aziz told reporters after a meeting on Wednesday. The proposals of 100MW plant at Keraniganj (Powerpac Holding Ltd), 100MW at Meghnaghat (JV Consortium and PVD Power Technologies Ltd) and a 40MW plant at Noapara (IFDC Volcan Energy Ltd) were approved on comparatively lower rates, Aziz added. The government will buy power at Tk 7.78 per unit from Keraniganj plant, at Tk 7.70 from Meghnaghat and at Tk 7.77 from the Noapara plant. Earlier, three more proposals were approved by the purchase committee under the quick rental plan, undertaken by the incumbent government to add 1015-1215MW by the current year. According to the plan, contracts of rental plants are to be awarded to the qualified firms without tender procedures. Proposals from three more firms had been rejected on the grounds of higher rates, Aziz said, adding that they still "have scopes to re-negotiate the rates." He said those proposals, worth 317MW, will be presented at the next meeting after negotiations. The three proposals are 102MW plant at Madanganj (Summit Power), 115MW plant at Khulna (Khulna Power Company Ltd) and 100MW plant at Kodda, Gazipur (IEL Consortium and Associates). bd
