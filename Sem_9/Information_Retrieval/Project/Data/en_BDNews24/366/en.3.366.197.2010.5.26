 Beijing, May 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Indian president Pratibha Patil arrived in China on Wednesday evening on a six-day official visit. This is the first visit by an Indian head of state in 10 years. Chinese assistant foreign minister Hu Zhengyue and Indian ambassador to China, S Jaishankar, welcomed her at the Beijing International Airport. The visit, at the invitation of Chinese president Hu Jintao, coincides with the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries, which have suffered because of the long-standing dispute over Arunachal Pradesh and part of Jammu and Kashmir. Chinese foreign ministry officials said Patil would meet Chinese leaders and sign a number of agreements during the May 26 to 31 tour. She will meet Chinese president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao on Thursday. She will also meet chairman of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Jia Qinglin. They said during her visit Chinese and Indian leaders would discuss bilateral, regional and global issues and economic cooperation, and focus on furthering their ties. The relations of the two neighbours have recently experienced some unpleasantness, including a Chinese incursion into Leh of India-administered Jammu and Kashmir and a row over Tibetian leader Dalai Lama's visit to Arunachal Paradesh. China has two major territorial claims  one in Arunachal Pradesh and the other in Ladakh  in India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir. India deems the territories as its own. The Indian president will also visit Shanghai and Luoyang of central China's Henan province. During her three-day Shanghai stay, Pratibha is set to visit the World Expo 2010 and preside over the first major brainstorming session of India-China Business Forum on May 31. bd
