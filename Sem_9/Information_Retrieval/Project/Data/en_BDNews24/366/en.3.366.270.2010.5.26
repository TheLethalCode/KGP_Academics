<TEXT>
 BERLIN, May 26 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Germany's injured captain Michael Ballack has warned his country's football fans against having high expectations for the World Cup finals in South Africa. "After the draw in Cape Town, I said then: people should know that we can lose in the preliminary rounds to any of the other sides," Ballack told German magazine Stern. "Australia, Serbia and Ghana are all athletic, tough teams."

"In the last few tournaments we were second and third, so why hold anything back?" With an air of expectancy growing at home for the public's national heroes, Ballack says only German success in South Africa will be viewed as acceptable by their public. "Germany is a nation that has to win," said Ballack. "When I watched the German athletes at the Olympic Winter Games in February, I thought: it is the same for us.
