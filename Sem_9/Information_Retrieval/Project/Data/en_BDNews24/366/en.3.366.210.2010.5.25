 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court has thrown out charges against 12 lawyers that they had vandalised the Supreme Court property in 2006. The bench of justices Mohammad Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiquee gave the order on Tuesday. The lawyers were accused of vandalising the Supreme Court in Nov 30, 2006 during a hearing on a petition challenging the legality of former president Iajuddin Ahmed's taking over as chief adviser to a caretaker administration. Dhaka's magistrate Omar Sadat filed a case against four lawyers including senior lawyer Kamal Hossain on Dec 5. But the police pressed charges against 12 lawyers. The High Court on Apr 4, 2007 stayed the case proceedings after the 12 lawyers petitioned it to cancel the case. It court also asked the government why the case should not be declared illegal. Assistant attorney general Bashirullah told bdnews24.com after Tuesday's ruling that the case had been quashed because allegations were not based on firm legal grounds, the investigation was not done properly. The case was filed out of an ill-motive, he said. The lawyers are Kamal Hossain, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Amir-Ul Islam, Tania Amir, Subrata Chowdhury, Subrata Saha, Md Khosruzzaman, Inayetur Rahim, Khairul Alam Pipul, Syed Mamun Mahbub, Md Suhrawardy and Aosafur Rahman.
