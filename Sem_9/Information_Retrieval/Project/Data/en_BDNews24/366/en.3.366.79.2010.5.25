<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong city BNP president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury has termed the Election Commission's role in the June 17 city corporation 'ill-motivated'. "The election will become a mockery," Khosru told reporters at a press conference at his Mehedibagh residence on Tuesday. In a letter to the EC on May 22, the senior BNP leader demanded the removal of the acting mayor Zahirul Islam Dobhash as he is a council candidate in the election. Following his demand, the EC replied that it had no role in the appointment or removal of an acting mayor. Khosru on Tuesday said, "No one can take part in an election as acting mayor." "The excuse that the Election Commission cited regarding local government is applicable during normal times." "It is not applicable during the polls," he added. Khosru also said: "If the Election Commission fails to understand this then it is not competent to carry out its responsibilities." Dobhash, the first panel mayor and councillor of ward 33, was made the acting mayor on Thursday, when outgoing mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury resigned before filing his nomination papers for the mayoral race. Dobhash is also a ward councillor candidate. Commissioner Shakhawat had said in response to the BNP letter that: "The local government has directives regarding the handing over of power after the city corporation mayor resigns." "It must be done in line with the Local Government (City Corporation) Law-2009." Khosru alleged that Mohiuddin's personals aides and staff were still enjoying facilities of the city corporation. He said many election laws had been purged of drawbacks in the past. "It is not just about the letter of the law that matters but also its spirit," he said. "It should not be difficult for the EC to understand that laws must be formed to ensure equity, justice and accountability," he said. He warned that the EC would have to bear the consequences if legal loopholes hamper a fair election. Commenting that EC had full authority during elections, Khosru said, "We will have to think again if holding fair election is hampered by the election commission either referring matters to the local government ministry or by showing other excuses." bdnews24.
