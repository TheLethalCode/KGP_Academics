<TITLE> Fake teachers found on training programme </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, May 26 (bdnews24.com) - A total of 56 out of 83 headmasters and teachers participating in a training programme at Rajshahi Higher Secondary Training Institute were found to be 'impostors'. Astonishingly, this was detected on the very last day of the training on raising teaching capacity. The issue surfaced after deputy director Shamsuzzoha of the institute examined their papers on the basis of trainers' allegations about some of the trainees' age and behaviour during the training. All the impostors were first detained in a room and later released on the orders of officials of the institute before the police came. Officials and employees of the institute were blaming one another for this bizarre situation. A three-member committee, led by additional director Dr. Selina Afroze of the institute, has already been formed to investigate the incident. The committee has been asked to submit its report within three days. Blaming officials of the institute, employees said they resorted to such a ploy for partial misappropriation of the money to be given to the authorities. Some school headmasters who came to receive training told reporters that all the trainees were supposed to receive Tk 3,400, including Tk 400 per day for dining and lodging cost for the six-day training. Some employees and teachers said the director, deputy director and a fourth-class employee, Abdul Hannan aiming to line their pockets committed this deception. They also alleged that the officials had also pocketed the project money through training of fake teachers. The director, deputy director, however, denied any involvement. Deputy director Shamsuzzoha claimed that Abdul Hannan was the mastermind and he has been absconding since the scandal was exposed. Director Swapan Kumar Datta said the training is imparted to those who remain on the list sent by district officials. bdn
