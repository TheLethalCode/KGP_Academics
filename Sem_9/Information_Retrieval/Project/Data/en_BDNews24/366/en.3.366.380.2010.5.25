 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com) -- Senior Awami League MP Suranjit Sengupta claimed on Tuesday that judges of higher courts had collaborated with every military ruler who had usurped power in Bangladesh violating the constitution. Sengupta made the remark following a public statement by a former chief justice who alleged that politicians were making the judiciary a "glass house"  meaning that it had been weakened  by appointing poor quality judges. Chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry had previously saluted the judiciary for declaring the Fifth Amendment to the constitution illegal, particularly pointed to justice Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem who he said had sided with Gen Ziaur Rahman, when Sayem assumed the post of Chief Martial Law Administrator and Chief Justice at the same time. "We have not made the judiciary a glass house, some of the judges have done it," the chairman told reporters on Tuesday at the parliament's media centre. "We, the politicians, had built a 'concrete house' of the judiciary," he said replying to the analogy of a glass house. He said the country's first constitution had made the judiciary its guardian, "But some judges have become party to every military rule in the country's history." "Even, sitting chief justice Sayem became chief martial law administrator when Gen Ziaur Rahman usurped power," he added. Sengupta, who was one of the members of the committee that drafted the first constitution in 1972, said the judiciary was supposed to protect the constitution but the same body legalised abrogation of the constitution at different times. The Awami League MP said the former chief justice's comment against the politicians would help a particular group, not the political system. The standing committee chairman said democracy, however, could not be sustained without an effective judiciary. In his last speech, at the immediate past parliament session, Sengupta had thanked the judiciary for declaring the Fifth Amendment "illegal and void" which the court said was "unlawfully" carried out by the military ruler Ziaur Rahman, the de facto founder of the opposition BNP. The BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, also a member of Sengupta's committee, however, criticised the judiciary for the pronouncement. The 5th amendment legalised the activities of the extra constitutional government, led by Gen Zia, which came to power after the assassination of Bangladesh's founding president Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. b
