<TITLE> Finn hails Fraser influence </TITLE>

 LONDON, May 26 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- England pace bowler Steven Finn wants to make his mark in Test cricket just as his idol, Australia great Glenn McGrath, has already done. But if Finn does go on to enjoy a successful international career, he believes much of the credit will go to former England seamer Angus Fraser. The 21-year-old Finn, who played his first two Tests in Bangladesh earlier this year after a late call-up following injuries to Stuart Broad, Graham Onions and Ryan Sidebottom, could make his home debut against the Asian nation at Lord's - where he plays for Middlesex - on Thursday. At 6ft 7in tall, Finn is seen as a potential successor to Stephen Harmison and someone who could yet do well on the generally harder Australian pitches England are likely to encounter when they defend the Ashes later this year. But Finn is anxious to avoid being labelled so early in his career. "It would be nice to have a lot of pace and be able to control it," he told reporters at Lord's here on Tuesday. "That's the ideal fast bowler. At the moment, I am somewhere in between the two. By no means am I the finished article." He added: "I have my idols, people like Glenn McGrath who was a fantastic bowler, best bowler in my opinion who has ever played the game. It would be nice to play in the sort of environment he was playing in a few years ago and see how I can do." But a more direct influence on Finn's progress has come from former Middlesex stalwart Fraser, now the county's cricket director. "Angus Fraser who has been a very big help, is a great believer in just bowling, bowling and bowling," Finn explained. "That will get you fit and that will teach you how to bowl. I believe in that too." "At the moment I am still learning about my game. I've spoken a lot to to Gus about this. I don't want to be like anyone else, I want to be Steven Finn. "Gus has brought discipline, an analytical approach to the way I bowl," Finn added. "There's a lot more thought process that goes in to what I do, the working out of batsmen, the way it really hurts me when I give away runs. "I hate it, just as much as Gus did. He would stand there swearing, punching himself. He's helped bring in to my game a lot more discipline and I think that's important I carry that into any sort of cricket I play." Turning to the prospect of playing a Test at Lord's, Finn, who made his Middlesex debut as a 16-year-old, added: It's something I have dreamed of since I first came to watch a Test here in 2001. If I get the opportunity this week, it will be a great experience. "I wasn't expecting this 18 months ago or even six months ago. I wasn't expecting an international debut in 2010, I just take each game as it comes. That's all I can do and I think it will stand me in good st
