<TITLE> Mexico's Marquez to bow out after WC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MEXICO CITY, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Rafael Marquez, the first Mexican signed by Barcelona thanks to distinguished performances for the national team and AS Monaco, will bow out of international soccer at the World Cup. "The moment has come to give way to young Mexicans so I'll be giving my all in South Africa," Marquez told a news conference in March. The 31-year-old is one of the European-based players certain to appear in coach Javier Aguirre's squad to contest the tournament opener against hosts South Africa on June 11, and the remaining Group A games against Uruguay and France.

After eye-catching performances at Monaco and then with Mexico at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, he moved to Barcelona where his star continued to rise and he became one of the best central defenders in the world. With Barcelona, Marquez has won three La Liga titles, three Spanish Super Cups, two Champions Leagues and the Spanish King's Cup. Despite his achievements, the defender does not feel widely acknowledged at home. "Unfortunately, in Mexico I am not recognised for what I have achieved and what I am doing for the country but this doesn't worry me. I always try to be the same person," Marquez said in an interview with Tele
