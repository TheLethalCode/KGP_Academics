 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Police statements over the arrest of the chief of banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh are in conflict. Inspector general of police Nur Mohammad told a press briefing on Tuesday that a special team of detectives arrested JMB chief Saidur Rahman on Monday night at Dania in Dhaka's Jurain. But a press release handed to reporters immediately after the briefing mentioned put the time of the arrest at Tuesday morning. Again the unsigned press release said Saidur was arrested from an Abdullahpur residence under East Dania "with the help of local police." But Kazi Ayubur Rahman, chief of Kadamtali police under which East Dania falls, said he knew of no arrest of any JMB leader in his area. He told bdnews24.com that he would have known if any agency conducted any drive in his area. Hasan Mahmud, director general of RAB that runs a special cell to deal with militancy, said he heard that Saidur was arrested on Monday. Asked why there was no RAB member in the special detective team that arrested Saidur, he told bdnews24.com that he was ignorant of any such team. "The police chief can better say that." Police said seven policemen were injured in a grenade attack on Sunday night while raiding a hideout of another outlawed militant organisation Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami, Bangladesh in Jurain. Ten grenades were recovered after an attack on policemen during the raid on a flat. Police also arrested Siddiqur Rahman and said he was a member of the military winf of harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Bangladesh. Banned over the years, JMB and several other Islamist groups aim to turn Bangladesh into a Sharia state, launching bomb attacks and killing lawyers, judges, police and government officials. Militants launched a countrywide series of bombings in Aug 2005 and are believed to have stages a grenade attack in Aug 21m 2004 that killed 23 people at an Awami League rally addressed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina, then the opposition leader, escaped with partial hearing loss. Saidur took over as the chief of JMB after its former boss Shaikh Abdur Rahman and military wing chief Bangla Bhai and four other leaders were executed in March 2007. The Islamists kept a low profile after the execution, but started regrouping after Hasina took office in January 2009. Intelligence reports say they were planning an offensive soon as the government started a fresh sweep against them. bdn
