 TIGNES, France, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Divided and miserable two years ago, France have pledged to unite and have fun at the World Cup in South Africa to avoid a repeat of their Euro 2008 flop. Since arriving at the scenic Alpine resort of Tignes for a week-long training camp, the players have taken part in a series of unusual group activities in search of harmony and 'healing'.

For the first time in years, however, the players seem to be enjoying themselves and their coach, once famous for dry remarks and undecipherable comments, appear to be relaxed and confident.
