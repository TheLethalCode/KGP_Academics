<TEXT>
 Tangail, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman has warned against using poverty as a tool for doing business and urged all to work wholeheartedly to fight the curse. "We've done enough research and consultancy with poverty, even done business with it. "Now the time has come to get rid of this ghost out of the nation", he said at a meeting with the officials and bankers of Micro-credit Finance Institution (MFI) at Tangail Alenga Resort Wednesday morning. Atiur, who is also the chairman of the Micro-credit Regulatory Authority (MRA), said people have different observations about NGOs. "Their working area is concentrated in the remote areas of our country. It has created a lot of employment opportunities in different sectors, including the banking sector." The governor termed the NGOs' activities as positive, as the government alone cannot provide adequate job opportunities. "'The banks could materialise many seemingly impossible plans with the initiatives of those NGOs and the MFI", he said. "The banks will be able to meet the targets of disbursing agriculture and SME loans through the NGOs." Atiur said that the NGOs were trying to alleviate poverty at different levels and the banks also provided assistancet. Mentioning the banks had liquidity, he said "but they don't have branches in the remote villages. On the other hand, MFI has access to many remote villages." The meeting was also addressed among others by MRA's executive vice chairman Khondokar Majharul Haque and Tangail deputy commissioner M Bazlul Karim Chowdhury. After Dhaka, Tangail stands second in having micro-credit organizations; 50 out of 523 organisations, certified by MRA, are operational in Tangail. bdnews24.com/c
