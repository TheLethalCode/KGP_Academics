<TITLE> Extra 55,000 to get technical training a year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)With the global demand for skilled and semi-skilled workers rising, the government has decided to provide technical training to an additional 50,000 workers every year. Labour and employment minister Mosharraf Hossain told a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on Tuesday that from the next fiscal year the government was planning to set up 30 more technical training centres for that. "At present, 38 technical training centres produce about 50,000 technically trained workers every year. But the 30 additional training centres will take the figure to 100,000 workers per year," Israfil Alam, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on labour and employment said, quoted the minister as saying. If the additional training centres start functioning, all 64 districts will have at least one technical training centre, which will provide 48 different kinds of training, he said. "The minister has told us that the government will prioritise workers who come from the Monga-hit, Sidr-hit or aila-affected areas to go abroad for jobs," said Alam. During prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visits to South Korea and Malaysia, the two countries had said that they would recruit more semi-skilled and skilled workers from Bangladesh. Korea will recruit 4,400 skilled and semi-skilled workers from Bangladesh next year through the state-owned Bangladesh Overseas Employment Services Limited, expatriates' welfare ministry sources say. Bangladesh's quota for the South Korean market this year is 3,800, the ministry sources say. The expatriates' welfare ministry officials hope that Malaysia may also soon open up its labour market for Bangladesh. Foreign ministry officials say most labour-importing countries are now reluctant to recruit unskilled workers. Saudi Arabia, which hosts the highest number of Bangladeshis, has already banned unskilled workers from Bangladesh in many sectors. In 2007-08, the expatriates' welfare ministry took measures to set up more technical centres considering the huge global demand for skilled workers. "There is a huge demand for female household workers in many countries. The additional training centres will impart training for this kind of work," said Israfil Alam. He said the exploitation suffered by Bangladeshi workers would significantly reduce if Bangladesh could export skilled and at least semi-skilled workers. The ministry sources say, there are about 6.5 million Bangladeshis, concentrated mainly in the Middle Eastern countries, around the world. The expatriates sent remittances worth over US $10 billion last year, according to the central bank figures
