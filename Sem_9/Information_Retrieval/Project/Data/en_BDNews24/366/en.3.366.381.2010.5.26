 NEW DELHI, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A spate of attacks on Indian students in Australia last year has rattled travellers from the subcontinent, with up to 30 percent fewer tourists opting to take the trip Down Under. Indian tour operators say there has been a sharp drop in tourist traffic to Australia's holiday and business sectors in the last seven months.
