Motaleb Miah, managing director of the market's shop-owners association, said they were forced to shut down after twice receiving threats. He said the association filed a complaint with the Nilkhet police around 5:30pm after some 50 Awami League men came to the association's office on Sunday. They returned on Monday with the same threat, he claimed 'Moeen' and 'Sultan' who led the group introduced themselves as Awami League and Juba League men of Ward-52 and demanded that some shops be handed over to them for setting up a party office, he said. A sub-inspector on probation, Ashish Kumar of Nilkhet police confirmed to bdnews24.com that the complaint had been filed.
