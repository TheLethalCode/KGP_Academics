 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)-Teachers of non-government primary schools have submitted a memorandum to the prime minister demanding nationalisation of their jobs. A team of teacher leaders went to the prime minister's office to submit the memo after the police intercepted a procession of the teachers in front of the foreign ministry. Before the procession, members of the Non-government Primary Teachers' Association held a rally at Muktangon in the city. "We work as much as the government primary teachers do. But our salary is far less than theirs. We don't even get medical allowance," association president Aminul Islam told the rally. He said that the non-government primary teachers were leading inhuman lives with the low income. Islam demanded announcement of nationalisation of their jobs in the next fiscal year's budget to be unveiled early next month. "If the government cannot immediately announce nationalisation of our jobs, we request them to start offering benefits similar to the government primary teachers," he added
