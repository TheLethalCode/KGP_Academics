 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Computer science students of Dhaka University boycotted classes on Tuesday protesting an evening masters course. The students at a press conference at Madhu's Canteen said they would continue boycotting the classes indefinitely if the course was not stopped immediately. Students began their movement on Saturday demanding cancellation of the evening course. Later, they postponed their movement on an assurance from the dean. But the students restarted their programme when they saw an advertisement on Monday in newspapers about launching of the course. In their reaction, students staged a demonstration on Tuesday morning in the department. At one stage, they put the department under lock and key. The authorities broke open the locks at around 1pm. The students at the press conference, held at 2 pm, said that they would continue the boycott indefinitely if the commercial evening classes were not closed. Later, the concerned authority met with students but the three-hour meeting ended without decision. The students coming out of the meeting announced continuation of their programme. Departmental chairperson Suraiya Parveen told journalists: "The discussion with the students ended without any decision. Their demand was to stop the course. The discussion was fruitless because of their inflexibility." But she did not say anything if admission form sales would continue. bdnew
