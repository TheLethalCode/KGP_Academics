 BEIJING, May 25 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The United States and China Tuesday signalled progress in their pivotal relationship at high-profile annual talks after months of tension, but no major breakthrough on fractious economic disputes. With North Korea again sparking regional tensions, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner met top Chinese officials for the two nations' "Strategic and Economic Dialogue". Underlining the importance of the talks between the world's biggest and number three economies, Washington sent a mammoth 200-strong delegation including several cabinet-level ministers to the Chinese capital. "The dialogue has been very productive," Clinton said as the talks wound down, while Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu described the meetings as "wide-ranging and in-depth, yielding results in many aspects". Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan called the two economies "increasingly inseparable" but Clinton, speaking to China Central Television (CCTV), added: "We're not going to agree on every issue." China and the United States have been at loggerheads on an array of fronts ranging from trade and the value of the yuan to Internet freedom and Taiwan. President Hu Jintao said Monday that China would reform its exchange rate regime, but at its own pace. Foreign critics, including a vociferous number of US lawmakers, accuse China of artificially depressing the yuan's exchange rate so as to gain an unfair trade edge. The Chinese side meanwhile pressed Washington to lift restrictions on exports of cutting-edge US technology to China. Earlier this week, US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke said a review of export controls ordered by President Barack Obama would be completed by mid-year, but declined to specify which curbs could be relaxed with respect to China. "The United States needs to take some concrete actions to show its sincerity to the Chinese people," China's state-run Global Times newspaper said in a commentary. For their part, Clinton and Geithner have highlighted US concerns over China's "indigenous innovation" policies, which some business leaders say are reducing foreign firms' access to the lucrative Chinese market. Countries should "recognise that we will all benefit if we have... governments helping to facilitate, not interfere", the secretary of state said. Clinton also said export-driven China needed to do more to boost domestic consumption in order to "create more balance in the world economy" -- repeating a message delivered by Geithner. In the strategic arena, Clinton is pressing Beijing to back efforts to slap further sanctions on North Korea over the sinking of a South Korean naval vessel, which investigators have blamed on Pyongyang. South Korea has cut off trade with the North and pledged to take the matter before the UN Security Council where China, Pyongyang's sole major ally, is one of five veto-wielding members. On Tuesday, Beijing -- for the third time in a week -- called for restraint. "We believe dialogue is better than confrontation," Jiang at the foreign ministry said. Clinton demanded that North Korea "stop its provocative behaviour" and called on China to cooperate with the United States in bringing the hermit state to heel. She added that the two sides had found "common ground" on clean energy cooperation and climate change, announcing they would boost student and "people-to-people" exchange programmes. The standoff over Iran's nuclear programme was also up for discussion at the Beijing talks, which were to conclude with a joint press appearance at 0915 GMT. Clinton and Geithner were to brief the media separately afterwards. Clinton was to fly to South Korea on Wednesday for crunch talks on the sinking of the Cheonan corvette, which left 46 South Korean sailors d
