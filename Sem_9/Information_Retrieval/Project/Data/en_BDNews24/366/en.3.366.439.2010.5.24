 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  A parliamentary watchdog says chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim was in breach of his oath in office by not swearing in two 'controversial' judges appointed to the High Court by the president last month. The parliamentary standing committee on law ministry at a meeting on Monday 'unanimously' said that the delay in giving oaths to two appointed judges constitutional 'stalemate', which 'was unacceptable'. It also suggested that the government talk to president Zillur Rahman for expediting the oath-taking of the two judges: Ruhul Quddus Babu and Muhammad Khasruzzaman. "Since the two judges were appointed by the president as per the constitution, the chief justice's only role must be to administer oath to the two judges," Suranjit Sengupta, the committee chairman, told reporters at the parliament building. "He (the chief justice) cannot make any inordinate delay or leave it to uncertainty. This (not administering oath to the two judges) becomes a breach of (his own) oath," he said. "We, the committee, have unanimously termed this a constitutional stalemate and expressed concern at this. This is unacceptable in a democratic polity," he said. The lone opposition MP, the BNP's Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, agreed with the other Awami League MPs at the meeting, the chairman said. Suranjit said his committee had suggested that the law minister Shafique Ahmed meet the president in the next seven days to find a way for pulling the country out of the 'constitutional stalemate'. Law minister Ahmed, who attended the meeting, refused to talk to media. On May 16, he termed baseless, suggestive speculations that regulations had not been properly maintained while appointing the judges. He added that they would soon take oath. The chairman said in line with the constitutional obligation, the president had suggestions from the prime minister and law minister before appointing 17 judges. "As per the practice, the president had effective consultation with the chief justice on the appointments. If he had anything to say, he could have taken it up with the president before the gazette notification," said Suranjit. "Now, he has nothing to do but swear the two judges-appoint in as per the constitution," he said. On April 18, chief justice Fazlul Karim gave oaths to the 15 appointed judges-appoint, other than Babu and Khasruzzaman. According to media reports, Babu, a former leader of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal's student wing, was indicted in a murder case when he was student leader at Rajshahi University. A short time prior to his appointment as a judge, he was discharged from the case The reports also suggest that Khasruzzaman, now a deputy attorney general, was allegedly involved in vandalism in the court premises. Sengupta said the president could speak to the chief justice and remind him of his constitutional obligations
