<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)The High Court will hear on June 6 BNP chief Khaleda Zia's writ petition challenging the legality of the government notice asking her to leave her cantonment house. The bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Sheikh Hasan Arif fixed the fresh date of hearing on Tuesday. Moudud Ahmed, a laywer for the petitioner, sought deferral of the date for two months, saying two of Khaleda's most important counsels needed the time for some personal reasons. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam opposed the time petition. On Sunday, the opposition chief's petition challenging the government order was shifted to this High Court bench and removed from Monday's agenda of the bench of justices Md Imman Ali and Obaidul Hasan. Earlier on May 17, the hearing was adjourned until May 24 by the order of the former bench following an application for time extension by Khaleda's lawyers. On May 11, acting chief justice Md Abdul Matin had directed the BNP leader's counsel to place the application before chief justice Mohammad Fazlul Karim on his return from abroad. Earlier, the bench of justices Ali and Hasan had rejected an application to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and had twice rejected subsequent applications that the case be heard before another bench. The opposition chief's petitions were first rejected on April 13, then on May 5 and for the last time on May 11. bdnews24
