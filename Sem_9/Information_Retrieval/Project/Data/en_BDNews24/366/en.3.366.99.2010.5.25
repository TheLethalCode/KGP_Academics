 PARIS, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer did little to dampen the soaring temperatures at the French Open with a red-hot display of shotmaking that brought the year's second grand slam bursting into life on Monday. After Sunday's low-key start, Federer showed he was not going to let go of the title he battled so hard for 12 months ago without a fight as he destroyed Australian challenger Peter Luczak 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 in a match which at times resembled an exhibition on a sultry Court Philippe Chatrier. Women's third seed Caroline Wozniacki was another to make smooth progress on a day when the crowds poured into Roland Garros and the mercury nudged 30 degree celsius. While the organisers have made the tennis world wait for the bow of Rafa Nadal and Justine Henin until Tuesday, Federer asserted his claim to top billing with a charge interrupted only when a spectator was overcome by the Parisian heat. Federer treated the crowd to every shot in his arsenal -- stunning backhand crosscourts, punishing angles and one mocking drop shot to snuff out one of the match's longer rallies which had the crowd on its feet and the Swiss pointing to the cloudless sky in enjoyment. "I played a great match, I'm really happy," Federer said in a courtside interview. "It was kind of a (drop shot) festival, it's good when it works but when it doesn't, you look a bit ridiculous." Serena Williams, the 2002 champion and top seed, followed Federer on to the main court but there was only one destination for many of the fans piling into Roland Garros. From the moment home favourite Richard Gasquet was drawn against world number four Andy Murray, the French tennis public and press has scented an upset. Gasquet, the beautifully gifted stylist whose career has been blighted by injury and a doping offence for which he was later cleared, is back to something like his best having won in Nice last weekend. Murray, much more at home on the faster surfaces, has found wins hard to come by in the European claycourt swing and despite making the quarters last year is a genuine target for Gasquet, who will have enjoy partisan support on Court Suzanne Lenglen. Wozniacki, the U.S. Open runner-up and astonishingly the only teenager in the women's top 25, battered her way past Russian Alla Kudryavtseva 6-0, 6-3 in little over an hour, dispelling any worries about a niggling ankle injury. World number three Novak Djokovic, French 13th seed Gael Monfils and women's fourth seed Jelena Jankovic all make their tournament bows Monday. One player for whom defeat was a little tough to take was American Michael Yani. Aged 29, and having never won a grand slam match in his career, he went to bed last night tied at 8-8 in the decider in his opening-round match with Slovakia's Lukas Lacko. He finally went down 12-10 in the fifth in a match which lasted four minutes short of five h
