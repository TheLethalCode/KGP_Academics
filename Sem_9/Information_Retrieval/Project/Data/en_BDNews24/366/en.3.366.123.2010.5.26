 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Wednesday that the security concerns in south Asia would bring deeper cooperation and closeness among the countries in the region. While delivering her speech as chief guest at a discussion meeting on the just-concluded SAARC summit in Bhutan, the minister said the lack of institutional capacity at the national levels had been hindering the implementation of the SAARC decisions. "There are security perceptions in the region (South Asia). Perhaps, these security concerns will bring us closer to each other," Dipu Moni told the meeting at the national press club, indicating the perceived security threats within the region. "I got such a feeling at the 16th SAARC summit in Thimhpu," she said. Dipu Moni expressed hope that the South Asian countries would be able to promote a unified South Asian identity in future. The foreign minister's comment is at variance with the widely-held perception that the eight-nation South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) could not exploit its potential during its 25 years of existence due to Indo-Pak enmity. Indian premier Manmohan Singh and his Pakistani counterpart Syed Yusaf Raja Gillani shook hands during the Thimphu summit, the first time since the Mumbai attack carried out by some militants allegedly belonging to a Pakistan-based Islamic outfit. Besides handshakes, the two leaders also agreed to resume peace talks. Diplomatic observers fear that the growing Taliban threat in Pakistan and Afghanistan has created a new security situation that warrants fresh security strategy in the region. They say if Taliban and Al Qaeda win the war on terror in Afghanistan and Pakistan, they would destabilise the whole region including Pakistan and India. Dipu Moni said, "SAARC mechanisms have not been able to obtain necessary inputs from the sectoral stakeholders, civil society, private sector and think-tanks. "As a result, programmes often do not appropriately reflect demand and suffer from low-level awareness and ownership." She said many of the SAARC areas of cooperation did not have demand-driven programmes in the mid- and long term. "This makes an activity disjointed and often does not lead to any concrete result". Dipu Moni said the foreign ministries in the member states had "capacity constraints" for expediting the SAARC decisions. "There is often a misunderstanding that strengthening of the SAARC Secretariat is the panacea for all problems. "The actual problem lies in the lack of capacity in the national authorities both in terms of resource constraints and superficial understanding," she said. Diplomatic Correspondents Association of Bangladesh (DCAB) and Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods jointly organised the meeting. Foreign ministry directors general Sufiur Rahman and Saida Muna Tasneem and Tariff Commissin's Mostofa Abid Khan spoke at the meeting, which was chaired by the DCAB president Zahirul Alam
