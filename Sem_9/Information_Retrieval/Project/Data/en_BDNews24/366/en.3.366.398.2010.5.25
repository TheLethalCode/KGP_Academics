 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)--An annual development programme (ADP) of Tk 385 billion has been adopted for the next fiscal year, beginning on July 1. The National Economic Council, the government's highest economic affairs policymaking body, endorsed the ADP at a meeting on Tuesday with prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the chair. The figure represents a rise of Tk 100 billion from the current FY's revised ADP and Tk 80 billion from the original one. For this FY, a Tk 305 billion ADP was approved but later downsized to Tk 285 billion. Planning minister AK Khandker told reporters after the meeting that the government would provide Tk 232 billion, or 51 percent of the total, for the ADP and the rest is being expected from external resources. Finance minister AMA on Saturday said a Tk 1.3 trillion annual budget including Tk 385 billion ADP for the 2010-11 year would be adopted, with overall spending 14 percent higher than the current year's Tk 1.14 trillion. Khandker said agriculture, rural development and water resources have collectively got the highest allocation of 21 percent in next ADP. Power, oil and gas and natural resources got 16 percent allocation, while transport received 14 percent, education and religion 13 percent, and health, nutrition, population and family welfare 10 percent allocation. The planning minister said the projects for the next ADP will are 910 -- 94 new and 816 from the current ADP. He said this fiscal years's revised ADP consists of 886 projects. To a question on the implementation of current ADP, the minister said: "Our job is to make plan and allocate fund. It is for the ministries and department to implement the ADP." He said the prime minister had asked for full implement of the current ADP. Planning secretary Habibullah Majumder said 59 percent, or Tk 167 billion, of the revised ADP has been implemented until April this year. Previous year's ADP implementation during the same period was Tk 118 billion, he added. The government every year prepares a development budget for improving the country's infrastructure and social sectors, taking some projects under the ADP.
