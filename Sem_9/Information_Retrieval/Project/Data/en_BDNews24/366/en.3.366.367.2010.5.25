<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Outsiders will be prevented from entering Chittagong City Corporation (CCC) area from June 14 if they are engaged in any electoral duty. An election commissioner made the statement on Tuesday ahead of the CCC elections scheduled on June 17. "Executive magistrates will be asked to take legal steps against anyone entering the constituency without approval," M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters at his office. Defining 'outsiders', he said anyone living outside the city corporation area will be considered an outsider. He added it is not a party election and therefore, no political party's request will be considered. The Commission, according to section 119 of its constitution, had slapped such restrictions on public movement to ensure Bhola's fair bye-elections on Apr 24. Six army companies will be deployed as mobile and striking forces from June 14 to June 18 for the elections. Two companies of Bangladesh Rifles will be deployed from June 9. Around 20,000 law-enforcers will be deployed on June 17. Each CCC ward will be assigned one executive magistrate and one judicial magistrate from June 3. Check posts have already been set up at different entries of the area. b
