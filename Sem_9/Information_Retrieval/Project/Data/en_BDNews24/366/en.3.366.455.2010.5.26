 ADDIS ABABA, May 26 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  An Ethiopian opposition party leader on Wednesday rejected the results of parliamentary elections which gave long-time ruler Meles Zenawi a landslide win and demanded a new poll. "In view of the fact that both the election process and the voting day were not free and fair... AEUP has decided not to accept the result of the elections," said Hailu Shawl, the head of All Ethiopians Unity Party. Hailu told reporters that the party had also decided to demand a re-run as its observers were beaten and driven away from polling stations across the country. "We have asked the NEBE (electoral panel) to conduct both national and regional re-election of people's representatives as soon as possible," he added.

European Union observer mission also said the weekend polls were unfair, citing restricted political freedoms and use of state resources to by the ruling party. The United States' top diplomat for Africa, Johnnie Carson, also said they had failed to meet international standards. However Meles, who has ruled Africa's second most populous nation for nearly two decades, said the results sent a clear message to the opposition and warned them against causing any troubles. "I believe that the people of Ethiopia... have unequivocally sent a clear message to the opposition parties in our country," he told tens of thousands of supporters who turned out Tuesday for a victory rally.
