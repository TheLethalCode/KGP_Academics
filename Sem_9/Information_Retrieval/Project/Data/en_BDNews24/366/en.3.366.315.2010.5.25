 WASHINGTON, May 25 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thousands of tourists and business travellers were told to stay away from Jamaica's capital Tuesday as bloody drug clashes blockaded Kingston airport and sparked travel warnings across the globe. Washington was joined by a string of countries in Europe and Asia in urging its nationals to cancel all trips to the country, as battles between police and an alleged druglord's henchmen turned part of Kingston into a war zone. "The Department of State warns US citizens against travel to Kingston, Jamaica and its surrounding areas," said a travel warning, as Washington halted non-essential embassy services in the city over the "deteriorating situation." Kingston was plunged into violence after Prime Minister Bruce Manning decided to act on a US request that Jamaica extradite accused drug lord Christopher "Dudus" Coke. Coke's supporters stockpiled arms and set up barricades to fight back against the police, with three people killed in two days of fighting. Explosions shook the area around the gangster stronghold on Monday, sending out thick plumes of smoke, and the Jamaican airwaves were full of desperate pleas from residents pinned inside buildings by gunfire. The US advisory said access to Kingston international airport "has been blocked on an intermittent basis by gun battles between criminal elements and police," and warned of a possibility the unrest could spread beyond Kingston. Airlines Tuesday began cancelling flights to and from the troubled capital. Air Jamaica said it was calling off three flights from Kingston, two of them headed to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and the other bound for New York, while American Airlines also called off services between Kingston and Miami. Australia also revised its travel advisory, asking tourists to show a "high degree of caution" if visiting Jamaica and warning of civil unrest in Kingston and other urban centres. "You should avoid demonstrations and large public gatherings in Jamaica as they may turn violent, possibly involving the use of firearms," it said in an advisory Monday. Britain's Foreign Office "strongly advised" its nationals to avoid all "non-essential travel" to the Kingston area, and urged Britons in Jamaica to monitor local media for updates. "There is substantial civil unrest and sporadic gunfire in West Kingston and other areas of the Jamaican capital," it said. "There remains an increased risk of civil disorder and street violence in other urban areas in Jamaica where UK citizens should continue to take extra care if travelling away from their homes or hotels." Italy's foreign ministry advised its nationals "to exercise the utmost caution, to avoid public gatherings and to follow instructions issued by the local authorities." And Switzerland urged its citizens to steer clear of the Kingston area, as did Kuoni, one of the country's largest tour operators. "We have contacted our customers, and offered them alternatives" to a stay in the Jamaican capital, said a spokeswoman for the travel group. Finland's foreign ministry urged particular caution in the capital, advising visitors to avoid all travel to West Kingston, downtown, and Saint Andrews. The Nordic state also urged caution when travelling across the region surrounding the capital city, saying the security situation could deteriorate quickly. Coke enjoys support among some Kingston residents who see him as a sort of local Robin Hood, helping impoverished Jamaicans. Thousands marched in support of him late last week. But the US Justice Department has labeled him among the "world's most dangerous narcotics kingpins," accused of leading an international gang selling marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area. He was formally charged in the United States in August with conspiracy to traffic drugs and illegal weapons, and if convicted faces mandatory life imprisonme
