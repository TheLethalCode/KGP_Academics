<TITLE> World heads for 4.75% growth, debt a threat: OECD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 26 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The global economy is heading for 4.75-percent growth this year and next, thanks largely to emerging markets, and beating growth rates before the global downturn, the OECD said on Wednesday. Growth in the 30 OECD industrialised economies is expected to be far lower, at 2.70 percent, although higher than the last forecast in November of 2.50 percent. But the Paris-based organisation, a policy research forum for industrialised countries, warned in upgraded forecasts that the debt crisis in Europe and overheating in emerging markets could endanger the global recovery. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development also said that global imbalances -- meaning mainly huge trade surpluses in some emerging economies and a deficit in the United States -- are widening again. These imbalances are widely seen as a main cause of the global economic crisis. "Growth is picking up in the OECD area -- at different speeds across regions -- and at a faster pace than expected in the previous Economic Outlook," the OECD said in a twice-yearly report on the global economy. "Global output growth is expected to be around 4.75 percent this year and in 2011, above the growth rate experienced in the decade prior to the onset of the crisis." The OECD raised its forecast for output growth in the United States this year to 3.2 percent from its November forecast of 2.5 percent. It also increased the outlook for Japan to 3.0 percent from 1.8 percent and for the 16-nation eurozone to 1.2 percent from 0.9 percent. But it warned that "risks to the global recovery could be higher now, given the speed and magnitude of capital inflows in emerging-market economies and instability in sovereign debt markets. "Overheating in emerging-market economies... poses a serious risk. A boom-bust scenario cannot be ruled out," it added. Countries such as China and India, it said, may need "much stronger" monetary tightening to counter inflation and cut the risk of asset price bubbles. The report also called on OECD governments to now start withdrawing fiscal stimulus plans put in place during the economic crisis, cautioning that "urgent" action was needed in order to curb spiralling government debt levels. "Exit from exceptional fiscal support must start now, or by 2011 at the latest.... Many countries are facing very unfavourable government debt dynamics" that could act as a drag on economic growth, it said. It warned that debt levels in OECD countries would rise by 18 percentage points of gross domestic product (GDP) from 2012 onwards before stabilising even taking into account measures to cut spending. Referring to the eurozone's debt problems, it said that procedures need to be reinforced in order to prevent another crisis and warned that the turmoil could bring down private sector borrowing rates and activity. Global imbalances are also continuing to rise, the OECD said, using figures showing that the current account balance deficit in the United States would widen from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to a deficit of 3.8 percent this year. The OECD average is set to rise to minus 0.8 percent from minus 0.7 percent. The report added that banks in OECD countries remain "vulnerable" because of the continued effects of the global economic crisis and increased risks as a result of the unwinding of stimulus measures put in place by central banks. On a more optimistic note, the OECD pointed to a rebound in trade and said economic growth in Asia was helping boost the rest of the world. It also said the unemployment rate in OECD countries "may now have peaked" but added there was little chance of strong employment growth s
