 LONDON, May 25 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he expects England to sweep Bangladesh and Asian rivals Pakistan aside by winning all six of their home Tests this season. England, fresh from their World Twenty20 triumph in the Caribbean, begin a two-Test series against minnows Bangladesh at Lord's on Thursday before taking on Pakistan in four Tests later in the summer. Bangladesh have won just three out of 66 Tests since joining cricket's elite in 2000 and former England captain Vaughan expects Andrew Strauss's side to enjoy a 'walkover' against them. "The England team, I have no doubt, will be ruthless and want to beat Bangladesh convincingly, as the A side have just done last week in Derby," Vaughan told AFP in an interview here on Monday. "They will expect that kind of performance, probably a little bit better. They will expect to win by an innings, bat once in both the games and bowl the opposition out twice. "The only thing that you can do against Bangladesh is fail. That's the pressure, I guess, the players will be under and that's what we, as analysts, will be judging the guys on. "Can they succeed when they are expected to succeed? At the moment they are expected to get hundreds, take every catch, expected to get five-fors and bowl the ball in the right area and anyone that doesn't will be shot down. "That's the pressure of playing a team like Bangladesh." Turning to Pakistan, the former Yorkshire batsman, speaking after coaching schoolchildren taking part in a Michael Vaughan Cricket clinic at Hampstead CC in north London, added: "We're never too sure how Pakistan are going to arrive. One thing you get with Pakistan is excitement. "But I look at the summer and I really expect England to win six Test matches. I don't think Pakistan will have enough in their locker to beat us and Bangladesh should be a walkover. "It's not just me saying that, I think this team are good enough to win all six Test matches. "That's exactly the goal they should set themselves. I remember in 2004 we won all seven games against West Indies and New Zealand -- I expected us to do that. I look at this summer leading into the Ashes, I wouldn't like to see us lose a game. "We might draw because of the weather but I think we should win every game." This Thursday could see former Ireland batsman Eoin Morgan, a member of England's victorious World Twenty20 side, make his Test debut in place of injured Twenty20 skipper Paul Collingwood on his Middlesex home ground. And Vaughan, who retired from all cricket in 2009, believes Morgan's inclusion in a 12-man squad has already made Strauss's life easier as the Test captain returns to international cricket having opted out of the game's shortest format. "I think it's a real good one," Vaughan said of 23-year-old left-hander Morgan's call-up. "Colly's needed a rest, his shoulder is a bit sore. And the fact he's been captain a while, it allows Strauss to come back into the captaincy, not that it would have been a problem, but Colly won't be there and Strauss can just walk back in and captain the team. "Eoin Morgan is exciting, he's the first of the brand that's come through T20 cricket. "For anyone to say T20 won't help the game of cricket, won't help Test cricket, well I hope Eoin Morgan is the first to come through and say 'I was Twenty20 first and foremost, ODIs and now I'm a Test player and can adapt to all formats of the game.' "Maybe Twenty20 cricket might have produced a Test cricke
