 Chittagong, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Apparently doing away with apprehensions of a rift, Abdullah Al Noman on Monday declared his full support for Manzur Alam, BNP's mayoral candidate for Chittagong. Just one day back, Manzur had threatened absent Juba Dal members  members of BNP's youth wing perceived to be sympathetic towards Noman  that he would complain to Khaleda Zia for their lack of support, renewing doubts over Chittagong BNP's unity. Earlier on Saturday, he had claimed that Chittagong BNP was united and fully behind him. On Sunday night, Manzur visited BNP leader Abdullah Al Noman, perceived as Manzur's main rival for supposedly long held ambition in the port city's local political scene, in an apparent attempt to resolve the tension. A former minister, Noman's name had emerged as a potential mayoral candidate before the BNP backed Manzur as its candidate to run for the June 17 city corporation polls. Noman is also perceived to have had a long-term dispute with Chittagong metropolitan BNP's president Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, the chief polling agent for Manzur. An influential leader of Chittagong BNP and vice chairman of central BNP, Noman had indicated that he would contest in the elections if the party decided to choose him as a candidate. However, after attending the janaza of Manzur's mother Mostofa Khatun on Monday noon, Noman told journalists of his intention to fully back Manzur. He also said, "I will tell everyone to work for Manzur Alam as the party has backed him." Referring to himself as a potential candidate, Noman said, "People wanted to see a change after 17 long years. So they were hoping for me." Regarding Manzur's former political allegiance to the ruling Awami League, Noman said, "Changing sides is not an issue in the subcontinent. Manzur Alam is now one of us." AL's mayoral contender in the polls, ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, also attended the janaza. He consoled Manzur on his loss, but refrained from making any comments regarding the upcoming polls. Mazur's mother Mostafa Khatun died at her Uttar Kattali residence in the port city at around 2:30am on Monday. She was 82. Her janaza was attended by Chittagong Jamaat-e-Islami's nayeb-e-amir Afsar Uddin Chowdhury, metropolitan AL vice president Naim Uddin Ahmed Chowdhury and other political personalities of the port-city. bdnew
