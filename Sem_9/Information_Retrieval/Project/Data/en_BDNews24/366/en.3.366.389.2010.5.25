 Dinajpur, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Workers at the Maddhyapara Granite Mining Company continued with their indefinite strike for the third day on Tuesday. The Labour Worker Union enforced the strike from Sunday midnight, demanding permanent employment and full payment of their arrears. The mine authorities held a meeting with the employees and workers at noon but it failed to produce any concrete results. The failure of the talks prompted the workers to gather under the leadership of the Labour-Employee Union president Mominul Haque, who decided to continue their strike MGMCL managing director engineer Faruk Hossain told bdnews24.com, "We tried to make the workers understand the orders and policies of the government and the company but the workers refused to withdraw the strike". Engineer Faruk alleged that arrears were not the problems. The workers were not receiving their payments from their recruitment agencies. "According to the government rules and regulations, the workers should receive their payments from their recruitment agencies", said the managing director. The workers demanded that they should be recruited directly by the MGMCL and receive their payments from the company. The workers said that they would continue with their strike until their demands were met. Union general secretary Mostafizur Rahman earlier on Sunday said that 266 workers who had joined the mine since Apr 8, 2004, had not been made permanent and were working under contractors. The workers were promised during the training period that they would be appointed permanently but the promise was not kept. The April payments were still due. The total number of workers managed by MGMCL is 292. An average 16.5 tonnes of granite is mined yearly at the mine  and the stone is used in constructing embankments, bridges and roads. bdnews
