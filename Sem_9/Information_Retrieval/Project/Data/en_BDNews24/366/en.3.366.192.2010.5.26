 Dhaka, May 26(bdnews24.com) - A court on Wednesday ordered initiation of trials against Rid Pharmaceuticals for manufacturing adulterated drugs citing the three suspects as 'absconding'. Dhaka's Drug Court judge Mohammed Abdul Majid set June 22 for framing charges against the suspects over the deaths of eight children who were administered the company's Paracetamol syrup. The absconding suspects are the company's director Md Abdul Ghani and pharmacists Mahbubul Islam and Enamul Huque. Rid Pharma's owner Mizanur Rahman, who secured bail on Apr 18, was present at court during the order, so was his wife, Sheuli Rahman, also a director and a suspect in the case. Mizanur's bail petitions had been rejected at three hearings. Syed Rezaur Rahman appeared for the defendants in the bail petition hearing and Abul Kalam Azad became his guarantor. At least 28 children died countrywide between June-August last year after consuming a paracetamol preparation made by Rid Pharma, based in Brahmanbaria district. The paracetamol product, after tests, was found to contain toxic ingredients. On Aug 10 last year, the drug administration directorate's superintendent Shafiqul Islam filed a case accusing five peopleMizanur, Sheuli, Ghani and Mahbubul and Enamul. The court issued arrests of warrant against them on that day. At the same time, four other cases against the Rid Pharma were filed in as many places including Brahmanbaria. The status of the remaining cases was not known. Following a directive from the High Court, Mizanur surrendered to the metropolitan judge on Oct 12 last year. Judge ANM Bashirullah rejected his bail prayer and sent him to jail. Earlier, his wife Sheuli Rahman was granted bail by the High Court. bdnew
