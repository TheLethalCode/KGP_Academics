 Dinajpur, May 26 (bdnews24.com) Workers at the Madhyapara Granite Mining Company in Dinajpur withdrew their indefinite strike and resumed work on Wednesday. The authorities met with the employees and workers between 1pm and 2pm, after which the workers joined work at around 3pm. The mine's labour union president, Mominul Haque, said the authorities had assured them they would try to resolve the problems raised by the strikers. The company also said the workers would be hired on a permanent basis within one year, he said. The management also decided to lessen the agreement period with the mine's designated recruitment agency Bluster Service to 20 months from 27 months. The company's managing director Faruk Hossain confirmed bdnews24.com about the resumption of work. "We assured them that we would try to employ the workers permanently within one and half a years and they withdrew the strike after the announcement," said Hossain. The labour union enforced the strike on Sunday midnight, demanding permanent employment and full payment of their arrears. The workers demanded that they should be recruited directly by the company and receive their payments from the company. Union general secretary Mostafizur Rahman earlier on Sunday said that 266 workers who had joined the mine since Apr 8, 2004, had not been made permanent and were still working on contract. The meeting was attended by the managing director, the labour union's Mominul Haque and Mostafizur Rahman, and another seven representatives for the labour union. The 292 workers were promised during their training that they would be appointed permanently but the promise was not kept, he pointed out. The April payments were still due. An average 16.5 tonnes of granite is mined yearly and the stones are used in constructing embankments, bridges and roads. bdnew
