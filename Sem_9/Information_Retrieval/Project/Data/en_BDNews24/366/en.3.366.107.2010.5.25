 Chittagong, May 25 (bdnews24.com)Ruling Awami League-backed mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is planning to spend five times as much money as his main contender M Manzur Alam, the BNP-backed candidate in the June 17 Chittagong City Corporation elections. In their affidavits submitted to the Election Commission, Mohiuddin has stated that he will spend Tk 29.50 lakh, while Manzur estimates his spending at Tk 6 lakh. The Commission has set Tk 30 lakh as the maximum ceiling that a mayoral contender can spend, based on the number of voters in the CCC, which is 17 lakh. Manzur has put Tk 80,000 as expenses under the 'leaflet' head and Tk 10,000 as 'miscellaneous' expenses, while Mohiuddin has estimated Tk 80,000 for his miscellaneous expenses alone. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain said final costs can be more or less the estimated amounts but cannot exceed the maximum expenditure limit. He told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the Commission is keeping eye on the expenses of the candidates. The candidates will have to submit their expense sheet to the Commission after the elections, he said. According to the affidavits, Mohiuddin will meet his costs from honorariums, house property and other areas and Manzur from his own fund. Fourteen criminal cases are currently pending against Mohiuddin; four cases were filed during the military-backed caretaker government regime, and ten were lodged during the two terms of BNP-led government between 1991-1996 and 2001-2006. Another eight cases have been resolved, Mohiuddin stated in the affidavit. Among the other candidates, Manzur has had no cases filed against him, while former Krishak League candidate, Kamaluddin, has one pending case against him. Kamaluddin's nomination has since been cancelled. Mohiuddin has listed his educational qualification as a graduate, and Manzur is listed as SSC. Two candidates hold masters' degrees, six were graduates, four HSC and one SSC. Two candidates stated that they were literate and another listed himself as self-taught. bdn
