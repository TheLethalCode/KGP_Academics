 ISLAMABAD, May 24 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Former Pakistan cricket captain Younis Khan asked lawmakers on Monday for justice after being banned indefinitely from playing for his country, denying that he ever created problems within the team. "I was banned without giving a chance to clarify my position and I want justice because I want to play for my country again," a frustrated Younis told a meeting of the lower house's sports committee. The 32-year-old was one of seven players banned and fined by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after a committee investigated the team's dismal tour of Australia, and preceding tours of New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates. Pakistan lost all three Tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 international in Australia between December-February. PCB chairman Ijaz Butt earlier assured the committee that the penalties would be reviewed after receiving a report from a one-man arbitrator who is hearing appeals from the players. Younis, who relinquished the captaincy and pulled out of the New Zealand tour after differences with fellow team-mates, was banned indefinitely along with Mohammad Yousuf because of 'infighting in the team'. Yousuf replaced Younis on the tour of New Zealand and Australia. Younus joined the team after the Tests in Australia and featured in the one-day matches only. Another former captain, Shoaib Malik, and all-rounder Rana Naved-ul-Hasan were each banned for one year and fined two million rupees (24,000 dollars), while Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal and Umar Akmal were fined heavily.

"I pointed out problems within the team to the PCB and they banned me," said Younis, who replaced Malik as captain in January 2009. "Malik thought that I contrived to replace him as captain, which wasn't true." Younus said he had received offers to play outside Pakistan. "My career has been derailed because of this ban and although I am getting offers to play in England and South Africa, I want to play for my country, for my people," said Younis who signed for Surrey in England. Butt backed Younis as a player 'who always played for the country'. "Younis is a patriot and has always played for the country and I am sad that his career was derailed by same baseless allegations of match-fixing by a parliamentary committee member," said Butt. Butt was referring to allegations levelled by former sports committee chairman, Jamshed Dasti, over Pakistan's semi-final defeat against New Zealand in the Champions Trophy held in South Africa last year. Younis dropped an easy catch in that m
