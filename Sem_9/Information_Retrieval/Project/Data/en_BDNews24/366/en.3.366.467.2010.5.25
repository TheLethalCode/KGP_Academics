 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will inaugurate a two-day meeting of the Bangladesh Food Security Investment Forum in Dhaka on Wednesday. The forum, meeting at the Pan-Pacific Sonargaon Hotel, is expected to discuss and mark the sectors of disbursements of the G8 group fund donation promised to Bangladesh. These allocations would be finalised at the upcoming meetings of G8 in June in Canada and of the Asia Food Security Investment Forum in July in the Philippines. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak was speaking to reporters at a press briefing at the Press Information Department office on Tuesday. Earlier, a $20 billion fund was formed in the G8 Group's 2009 summit in Italy's L'Aquila. This year, the G20 also promised to donate $22 billion to different countries for development in the agriculture sector, Razzak said. The forum will also decide on the strategy of the expenditure. Almost 50 million people in Bangladesh are still living under the poverty line even though the country has tripled its food production since independence, the minister said. A total of 30.6 million people and 40 percent of the total number of children are suffering from malnutrition, he added. The financial assistance to Bangladesh will also be decided at the meetings, the food minister said. Agriculture secretary CQK Mostaque Ahmed, acting food secretary Barun Deb Mitra, USAID Bangladesh mission chief Denise Rollins, UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation resident representative Ad Spijkers, BIDS director general MK Mujeri were also present at the briefing.
