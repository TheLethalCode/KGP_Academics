 SINGAPORE, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell and the euro slipped on Tuesday on fears that Europe's sovereign debt woes will trigger a renewed crisis in the continent's banking sector. Europe's fumbling response to a debt crisis in Greece and bulging deficits in other euro zone countries has unnerved markets over the past six weeks, and the central bank takeover of a small Spanish lender at the weekend stoked fears of a wider meltdown. "This situation with the Spanish bank makes investors nervous because it raises suspicions that something else may be smouldering behind the scenes," said Hiroichi Nishi, equity division general manager at Nikko Cordial Securities in Tokyo. US crude futures fell below $70 a barrel, erasing the previous day's gains, on concerns the European crisis will choke off the nascent economic recovery. The worries of a fresh financial crisis boosted the safe haven appeal of gold and U.S. and Asian government debt, with Japanese government bond futures rising to near a two-year high on Tuesday. US Treasury prices had risen on Monday. Japan's Nikkei fell 2 percent to its lowest in more than five months, while the broader Topix lost 1.5 percent. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside of Japan dropped 1.6 percent. The euro slipped to $1.2300 in Asian trade from around $1.2376 late in New York on Monday, when it lost more than 1.5 percent. Against the yen, the euro eased to around 110.80 from 111.78 on Monday, when it lost more than 1 percent. NYMEX crude for July delivery was down 41 cents at $69.80 a barrel, after settling up 17 cents at $70.21 a day earlier. June 10-year JGB futures were up 0.18 point at 140.43, not far from a two-year high of 140.61 hit late last week. The benchmark 10-year yield fell 1.5 basis points to 1.235, near a five-month low of 1.220 percent on Friday. Spot gold was bid at 1,186.40 an ounce by 0115 GMT versus $1,194.95 an ounce at 1804 GMT. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.2 percent, on Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index slipped 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.7 percent. Australian shares fell 1.5 percent, South Korea's benchmark index lost 1.8 percent and Taiwan stocks fell 1.2 percent.
