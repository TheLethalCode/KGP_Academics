 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)Chief of banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh Saidur Rahman on Wednesday appeared before a Dhaka magistrate and was remanded into custody for six days. Saidur, his aide Abdullahel Kafi and Kafi's wife Ayesha Akhter were taken before Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court around 4pm in relation to a case field under the Antiterrorism Act. Saidur's wife Naima Rahman, also arrested on May 24 along with the other two, however, was not produced before the court. Magistrate Kanika Biswash granted police the time to quiz the detainees after Sheikh Mahbubur Rahman, inspector of police's Detective Branch, asked for 10 days. Investigation officer of the case said the detainees needed to be grilled for recovery of more firearms and ammunition and arrest other associates. The defendants filed no petitions for bail or opposing the remand appeal. Court police inspector Mirash Uddin stood for the prosecution. On Tuesday, police chief Nur Mohammad said at a press briefing that Saidur, wife Naima and Kafi were arrested the previous day. Police, however, did not say when and how Ayesha was detained. Saidur took over the helm of the group after the execution of JMB chief and spiritual leader Shaikh Abdur Rahman. Banned over the years, the JMB and several other Islamist groups aim to turn Bangladesh into a Dharia state, launching bomb attacks and killing lawyers, judges, police and government officials. Militants launched a countrywide series of bombings in Aug 2005 and are believed to have staged a grenade attack in Aug 21m 2004 that killed 23 people at an Awami League rally addressed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina, then the opposition leader, escaped with partial hearing loss. The Islamists kept a low profile after Shaikh Rahman, military wing chief Siddiqur Rahman alias Bangla Bhai and four other JMB leaders were executed in March 2007. But they started regrouping after Hasina took office in January 2009. Intelligence reports say they were planning an offensive soon as the government started a fresh sweep against them. b
