 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com) -- Home minister Sahara Khatun and the parliamentary watchdog on her ministry on Wednesday argued heatedly over the planned purchase of fire equipment worth around Tk 1 billion. The disagreement surfaced at the meeting of the standing committee on home ministry after its members demanded a freeze in the purchase over alleged corruption in the tender process. But Khatun and her deputy Shamsul Haque Tuku defended the ministry's decision to go ahead with the purchase in "public interest". "The committee members including the chairman demanded suspension of the purchase for now as we have launched an inquiry into the alleged corruption in the purchase bid," Mujibul Huq Chunnu, a committee member, told bdnews24.com after the meeting. Committee chairman Abdus Salam did not talk to the press and authorised Chunnu to brief reporters. "But the minister and the state minister refused to do so saying the bulk purchase was very important for the Fire Service and Civil Defence Department," said the MP of the Jatiya Party, now an ally of the ruling Awami League. "The members including the chairman and member Mirza Azam had some heated exchange with the ministers," he said. One committee member, requesting not to be named, told bdnews24.com that Chunnu threatened to quit the standing committee at one stage of the debate with the ministers. "I have just said it lightly during the discussion. What is the point of inquiry if the ministry awards work orders," Chunnu told bdnews24.com. He claimed that all of the members raised similar arguments. The parliamentary standing committee at its last meeting formed a six-member sub-committee, headed by whip Mirza Azam, to investigate the alleged irregularities and corruption in the purchase move. "The sub-committee at its first meeting found some evidence of corrupt practices," said Chunnu. "Despite our strong objections, the ministers refused to budge and said that the purchase process will go ahead," he said. "The home minister requested us to specify the irregularities. Then the purchase process will stop, otherwise not." Home ministry sources say the director general's office of the fire service and civil defence has been procuring 19 fire-fighting equipment that include special vehicles, ladder, and fire extinguishers. But unidentified people and some contractors sent written complaints to the standing committee against the department, prompting the committee to form the sub-committee. Chairman Salam and sub-committee head Azam sent separate letters to the home minister demanding suspension of the purchase until the completion of the parliamentary inquiry. But the fire service department is now in the stage of awarding work order to a 'qualified' firm
