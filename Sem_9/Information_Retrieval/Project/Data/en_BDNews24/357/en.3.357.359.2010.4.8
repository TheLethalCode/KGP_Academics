<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  The Government is taking steps to dispose of the huge backlog of labour court cases, the labour minister said on Thursday. There are currently 40,000 cases in the labour courts and they are not being resolved in a timely fashion due to shortage of courts, he said. "We are going to assign a particular court in each district. These courts will dispose of cases in a similar way to which cases under the Repression against Women and Children Act 2000 are resolved," said Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, the Minister of Labour and Employment. The minister was speaking at a seminar organised jointly by Safety and Rights and the Manosher Jonno Foundation on the subject of "Legal reform to prevent workplace deaths and injuries." There are only seven labour courts in the country  three in Dhaka, two in Chittagong, and one each in Khulna, Rajshai. At the event, Safety and Rights launched a report which showed that construction activities caused the most number of reported workplace deaths in Bangladesh for the third year running. It also set out a series of amendments to the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 which the NGO says would improve workplace safety and reduce the number of deaths and injuries. In response to the report, the Minister said that "the government is committed to giving the highest priority to health and safety of workers." He said that the tripartite committee, formed to advise the government on amendments to the BLA 2006, had already sent its recommendations to the government. The chairman of the standing committee on labour and employment Md Ishrafil Alam stressed at the meeting that amending the 2006 Act was not sufficient  one also needed to upgrade the factory and establishment inspectorate by increasing its manpower. Trade Union Kendra president Dr Wajedul Islam agreed with Alam and said that unless the inspectorate is strengthened, health and safety of workers can not be ensured. Bangladesh Employers' Federation President Rokeya Afzal Rahman stressed the importance of establishing a good relationship between workers and employers and building awareness to ensure health and safety at workplaces.
