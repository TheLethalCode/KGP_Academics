 LONDON Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain on Tuesday dismissed Afghan President Hamid Karzai's allegations of Western interference in last year's presidential election as "malign." Karzai accused Western embassies of perpetrating election fraud, bribing and threatening election officials and trying to weaken him and his government. Washington described the remarks as "troubling" and "obviously not true." Karzai, whose international reputation was tarnished when a U.N.-backed fraud watchdog threw out a third of the votes cast for him in the presidential election, said "foreigners" did not want Afghanistan to have a parliamentary election this year. Foreign Secretary David Miliband denied the allegations, made just weeks before a British parliamentary election on May 6. Britain's main political parties back the country's military involvement in Afghanistan, although many voters are concerned at the mounting death toll among its 9,500 troops battling Taliban insurgents. "Any suggestion of Britain or any other country irregularly interfering in the election processes of Afghanistan is completely without foundation," Miliband told parliament. "Our troops were there guaranteeing the safety of people seeking to go and vote and I'm sure it is a unified position across this House (of parliament) to have absolutely no truck with such malign suggestions," he said. Prime Minister Gordon Brown spoke to Karzai on Sunday and "made absolutely clear our position in respect of these allegations," Miliband said. "President Karzai did not repeat the allegations. In fact he committed himself to working with the United Kingdom. But ... it's important to turn those assurances into deeds," he said. Conservative foreign policy spokesman William Hague raised concern about the row, saying it was alarming to read so many reports of division between Karzai and the West. Karzai's spokesman Waheed Omer said parts of Karzai's remarks had been misunderstood. Western governments have been increasingly critical of his record on corruption, an issue Karzai has said is overblown and largely the fault of the West for failing to safeguard its aid bud
