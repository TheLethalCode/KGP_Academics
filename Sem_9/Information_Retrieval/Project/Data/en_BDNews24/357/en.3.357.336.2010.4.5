<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com) The government will consider introducing a social security scheme. Finance minister AMA Muhith told reporters Monday that a taskforce would be formed in this regard. "The upcoming budget will address the issue," he said after a meeting of the Social Safety Net Committee at the finance ministry. Social welfare minister Enamul Haque Mostafa Shahid, accompanying Muhith, said that the government was thinking about introducing smart cards for social security identification. The concerned ministries for social safety net, social welfare, women and children affairs and liberation war are preparing a database of potential beneficiaries, Muhith said. "The database of freedom fighters is almost done, but the number for others is huge and it'll take more time." Muhith said that the coming year will not be seeing any addition to the existing social safety net programmes. "However, the number of beneficiaries would increase under the social safety net programmes." Around 25 lakh people are currently covered under the allowance-based safety net programmes mainly aimed towards the old-aged and handicapped according to Muhith. "But it's very insignificant compared to the population," he added. The country's social safety net programmes will gradually lead to a social security system, said the finance minister. "A taskforce will be formed to monitor the social safety programmes as well as to weigh the option for social security." Regarding implementation of the programmes, Muhith said it was very good. "Mostly, above 90 percent." The meeting mainly discussed implementation of the social safety net programmes. "The ministries have prepared a guideline for disbursement. However, a decision on that is yet to be made," said Muhith. Replying to question, Muhith confidently said that there will be no beggars in the country within five year
