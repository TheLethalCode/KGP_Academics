<TITLE> My style is my strength: Sehwag </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com) -- Virender Sehwag has revealed that he has no intentions of changing his aggressive style of play, irrespective of the odd failure, reports Cricinfo. "When I play a cover-drive, I play it to score runs. I don't play a shot to get out. So, if the cover-drive ends up in a catch at slip, I am spared criticism. If it ends up in the hands at covers, I am slammed. The shot attempted has remained the same, only the mode of dismissal is different," Sehwag told the Hindu. "My style is my strength. It is my natural game. That is how I grew up and scored most of my runs. I have matured in my shot selection but will not discard my style. I don't believe in wasting balls," Sehwag said. Sehwag thanked the India captains he has played under for their backing over the years. "I have been lucky to receive encouragement from all my captains [Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, MS Dhoni]. They have always insisted on having me in the team and that means a lot to me." While he has scored runs at a fast clip - with strike-rates of 80.87 per 100 balls in Tests, and 103.51 in ODIs - Sehwag admitted that he has become more patient of late. "Sort of patient. Actually, I have become careful in my shot selection. I am neither over-defensive nor extra-aggressive. "I curse myself if I get out without making a 100 after crossing 40. I love playing in the 'V'. And I remain positive even after getting out after making just two at times. I tell myself that I took guard with nothing against my name but now I have at least two," Sehwag said. Bowling attacks have tried to work him out over the years, by denying him room outside the off stump, and by bowling short, into his body, but Sehwag has managed to find ways to score. "It is a mind game and I am good at it. I create shots to beat the field. Run-making has become tough," Sehwag said. Sehwag said he was aware of the thin line separating success and failure, and it boiled down to how one chose to look at things. "Half empty or half full. A cover-drive for four or disaster. Praise will come when you do well. So, be prepared for brickbats when you fail. You are learning from both. Success prepares me well for the failures," he
