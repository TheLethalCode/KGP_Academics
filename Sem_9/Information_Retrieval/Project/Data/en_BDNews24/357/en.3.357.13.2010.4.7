 NEW DELHI,Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The government came under heavy pressure to mobilise more police and devise a better plan to fight rebel Maoists by involving the military on Wednesday, a day after the insurgents killed 76 police in a deadly attack. The ambush by 1,000 Maoist fighters in Chhattisgarh on Tuesday exposed intelligence failure and lack of planning by the police who were trapped by the rebels in the forests of Bastar, officials and experts said. The Maoists triggered blasts and fired from all directions. A few survivors said they played dead to escape being shot as the rebels kicked wounded policemen and seized their weapons. The attack in remote central India coincided with a visit to India by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, underscoring that while India plays a growing role on the global economic stage, much of the country is immersed in poverty and insurgency. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Wednesday that the Congress party-led government must involve the military in the offensive against the rebels. The main BJP spokesman, Prakash Javdekar, said "the government must now go to war against the rebels by involving the military." "There is urgent need for more coordination between the military, security forces and other state agencies, which is missing now," he added. Failure to tackle the Maoist insurgency quickly could hurt the Congress party's prospects in eight state elections -- including polls in Maoist-hit West Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand -- lined up over the next two years, some experts said. "Security and Maoists will be major issues during elections and it could get worse if they continue to target central forces," said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, head of the Centre for Policy Research. "NATION UNDER SIEGE" India's newspapers carried big front page stories on the massacre in Bastar, with headlines saying the "Nation under siege" and "It's war". "As the one-sided battle in Chhattisgarh has shown all too glaringly, a military solution in tandem with state forces cannot be shelved," the Hindustan Times newspaper said in an editorial. Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said the government might consider using the air force for some operations but the police will continue to fight the insurgency. "If this is a war, the state will fight back," he said, during a trip to Chhattisgarh on Wednesday. Officials said they were redrawing their strategy and mobilising more troops against the rebels. "More troops will go and troops will be reinforced and we will take the battle to the Maoist camps," U.K. Bansal, India's Internal Security chief, told Reuters. Tuesday's attack has not affected mining operations in several of the mineral-rich states in central and east India, but mining officials said they were rattled by the killings. The government has struggled to transport coal to power and steel companies due to regular attacks on railway lines by the Maoists, who started their insurgency in 1967. Frequent strikes have hit production and shipment at firms such as India's largest miner of iron ore, NMDC Ltd and state-run National Aluminium Co Ltd. The estimated 20,000 Maoist combatants operate across a "red corridor" stretching from the Nepal border to West Bengal and through central India into Andhra Prad
