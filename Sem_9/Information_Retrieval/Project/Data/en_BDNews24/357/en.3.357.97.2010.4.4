 Panchagar, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)Charges have been pressed against 29 members of the 25 Rifles Battalion in connection with the mutiny that took place on Feb 25 and 26 2009. The second phase of the trial of the special court began on Sunday, having been adjourned since 4 February, with seven of the accused admitting their involvement with the mutiny. The other accused who pleaded not guilty were then given an opportunity to question two witnesses. BDR chief Maj Gen Moinul Islam presided over the court, with deputy attorney general Biswajit Roy, Lt Col Mahfuzur Rahman and Maj Didar Al Latif present as the prosecutors. The battalion commander and prosecutor Lt Col Serajul Huq presented the complaints and requested that charges be framed. After the seven admitted their guilt, the plaintiff of the case Subedar Maj Amirul Huq Sheikh and former acting commander (now Major) AKM Hasibul Hossain gave statements to the court. A number of the accused then questioned the witnesses claiming their innocence. The court will resume on Monday. Earlier in the morning, the accused BDR members were brought to the court in uniform. The February 2009 mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty finding, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. Allegations of murder will be tried separately in civilian courts. Meanwhile, relatives of the accused claimed that they were harassed when they wanted to meet their family members on trial. Piarul Islam of Meherpur, Jalaluddin from the municipal area and Jasimuddin from Feni claimed that the jail authority barred them from meeting and asked them to seek permission through the BDR authority. But the BDR authority told them to contact the jail authority. The relatives demanded an end to what they claim was 'harassment'. b
