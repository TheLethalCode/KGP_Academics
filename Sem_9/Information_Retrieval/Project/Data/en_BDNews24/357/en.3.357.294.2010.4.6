 Dhaka, Apr 06 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan will not interfere in Bangladesh's move towards bringing the latter's suspected war criminals to justice, the Pakistan high commissioner said Tuesday. "Pakistan honours Bangladesh's independence and sovereignty," Ashraf Qureshi, the newly appointed high commissioner, told reporters after a meeting with law minister Shafiq Ahmed at his office. Qureshi was asked about his stance on Bangladesh's upcoming trials of war criminals who allegedly collaborated with the Pakistan occupation forces in committing reported atrocities during the 1971 war of independence. The Bangladesh government took a big step on Mar 25 this year towards bringing war criminals to justice, with the formation of a war crime tribunal, investigation agency and prosecution panel under the International Tribunal Act-1973. Qureshi said: "This issue is completely an internal affair of Bangladesh." "The Pakistan government has no comment on the trial." The law minister also told reporters, "The high commissioner has clarified his country's stance. Pakistan will not interfere in the trials." Regarding the issues discussed in the meeting, Qureshi told reporters that they talked about economic and commercial matters between the two countries. But no specific discussion took place with the law minister on the war crime issue, Qureshi said. He also denied Pakistan being involved in lobbying with influential countries including the United States aimed at foiling the upcoming trial. "We're not initiating any propaganda. The rumour about our lobbying efforts is a figment of imagination by the Bangladeshi media. Law minister Ahmed urged the people not to be confused about the trial of the war criminals. "It is not true that we've shifted from our goal of war criminals' trial by holding trial of crimes against humanity at first. Rather, all crimes-- including genocide, looting, arson, torture  are possible to bring to justice in line with the International Tribunal Act-1973." bdn
