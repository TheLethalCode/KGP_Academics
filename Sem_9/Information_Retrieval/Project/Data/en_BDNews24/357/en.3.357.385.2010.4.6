<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 05 (bdnews24.com) The High Court on Monday issued a rule upon the Government and the Election Commission to explain why a direction should not be issued to require candidates in the Union Parishad elections to disclose seven specified issues about their personal background. The court also asked why the order should not require the EC make the information public through the media well in advance of holding the elections. The seven issues include the candidate's educational qualifications, professional or occupational information, statement of assets and liabilities and criminal records. A division bench of justices A.H.M. Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md. Delwar Hossain passed the order on a public interest writ petition filed by seven citizens including Badiul Alam Majumder of the non-governmental organisation, SUJON. The other petitioners are Syed Abul Maksud, former Inspector General of Police A.S.M. Shahjahan, AOM Shafiq Ullah, Manoranjan Mandol, Rasheda Akter and Suria Begum. The government must respond in two weeks. On behalf of the petitioners, Barrister Sara Hossain with Barrister Ashraful Hadi submitted to the court that every citizen has a right to know the particulars of election candidates at every level of administration, be they candidates for Parliament or for Union Parishads. "This information helps the citizen to take an informed choice and thus effectively participate in the democratic process in the country", they submitted. They said that it is the constitutional duty and obligation of the Election Commission and the Government to take such measures so that the fundamental right of every citizen is ensured. "The Commission has ample powers under Section 20 of the Local Government (Union Parishad) Act 2009 to frame Rules" for this purpose, they continued. The counsels argued that in relation to parliamentary elections, the High Court in 2005 gave a judgment that eight points of information should be provided by the candidates  a ruling that was upheld by the Supreme Court in December 2007
