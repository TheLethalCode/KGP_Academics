 BISHKEK,April 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 17 people were killed and 142 injured in clashes between riot police and opposition protesters in the capital of Kyrgyzstan on Wednesday, the Kyrgyz Kabar news agency said. Kyrgyzstan's president declared a state of emergency on Wednesday after clashes between police and protesters demanding an end to his five-years rule of the poor Central Asian state. A Reuters reporter in Bishkek said about 1,000 people had stormed the Prosecutor-General's office and were breaking the windows of the building and tossing out computers and office equipment. An emergency services official who declined to be identified told Reuters that more than 50 people may have been killed in the unrest. Riot police used tear-gas and flash grenades as they battled with more than 5,000 demonstrators near the offices of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. "There are five dead bodies lying on the square. There's a lot of blood," a Reuters photographer at the scene said. Political unrest has gripped Kyrgyzstan since early March over widespread poverty, rising prices and official corruption. Kyrgyzstan stands 162nd out of 180 countries on Transparency International's corruption perceptions index. The unrest is of concern to the United States, which uses a military air base in Kyrgyzstan to support its operations in Afghanistan. Russia also has a military base in Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan is heavily reliant on aid from both the United States and Russia, as well as neighbouring China, so their reaction to the unrest and government crackdown would be critical, said Alexei Vlasov, a Moscow political scientist. "If the reaction is firmly negative, Bakiyev will be in a very difficult situation because the economic situation in the country is severe," he said. Russia has so far called for restraint and for issues to be resolved without the use of force. A repeat of the 2005 popular uprising that brought Bakiyev to power was unlikely, Vlasov said, as the president had the loyalty of the security forces and had relatives in key posts. Bakiyev, from the south of Kyrgyzstan, has angered clans from Bishkek, Talas and other regions by appointing in his own kinsmen to senior positions, and excluding others from power, said Reinhard Krumm, director of a Moscow think-tank. RIOTS SPREAD The opposition protests spread to the capital on Wednesday after riots in two provincial towns a day before. The Bishkek protest began outside the main opposition office on the outskirts of the city. Some 200 protesters overcame a police attempt to break up the gathering, setting fire to police cars as they marched towards the city centre. The crowd, armed with iron bars and throwing stones, swelled as it marched on the president's office. Later, shots were heard outside the building, but it was not immediately clear who opened fire. "Several have been killed, mainly as a result of firearm injuries," said an emergency services official by telephone. "Many have been injured -- dozens." Bakiyev declared a state of emergency in Bishkek and in the towns of Naryn and Talas, the site of Tuesday's unrest, and also the Chuiskaya region, a spokesman said, adding it would include a curfew between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.. Opposition protesters stormed government buildings in Talas and Naryn on Tuesday and took the regional governor hostage in Talas for several hours before rampaging through the government building, fighting off police and burning Bakiyev's portraits. Protesters, throwing stones, attempted to storm the Talas local police headquarters on Wednesday, witnesses said. "We will stay here until the end, no matter what the government does," Talas Kadyraliyev, a 45-year-old local opposition activist, told Reuters from the scene. Kyrgyz Prime Minister Daniyar Usenov condemned the demonstrators. "They are bandits, not an opposition movement," he told reporters. "This kind of thing cannot be called opposition." Last week, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Bishkek and called on the government to do more to protect human rig
