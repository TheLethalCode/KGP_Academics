 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has backed the jute ministry's proposal for government intervention to stabilise the price of raw jute. A ministry report on raw jute prices, submitted to the standing committee on jute and textiles on Sunday, said hoarders were stockpiling raw jute to create an artificial crisis and increase the price. The report said the only way to stabilise prices was to move against the hoarders. "We support the recommendation that the government should intervene to ensure smooth supply of raw jute in the market," Akhteruzzaman Babu, the standing committee chairman, told bdnews24.com after a meeting Sunday. "The ministry should take serious measures to curb hoarding of raw jute," said Babu. He, however, declined to disclose the intervention measures. Jute minister Abdul Latif Siddiqui also told bdnews24.com he could not disclose the measures. The ministry observed in its report that the jute production in Bangladesh last year was lower than previous years. The ministry report, obtained by bdnews24.com, said the price of raw jute was "increasing day by day," while "some hoarders have been active in stockpiling raw jute". "They release small quantity of jute in the market in phases to keep the market price high and unstable," it said. "The only way of stabilising the raw jute price is to bring the hoarded jute into the market through government interventions," the report said. The government in July 2009 procured one quintal (100kg) of jute from farmers at Tk 3,499. The month after, the price came down to Tk 3,190. In November, the jute price began soaring and the price of one quintal went up to Tk 3,800 in December. The price is still on the rise, standing committee members told bdnews24.com. The government in January banned export of raw jute considering the poor domestic supply and abnormal price hike. But the following month, the ban was lifted amid pressures from exporters. "This is a free economy. How can we ban export," the jute minister told bdnews24.com when asked whether the government was planning to re-impose the ban on raw jute export. Bangladesh, the world's top exporter of jute and jute products, produces around 5.5 million bales (1 bale=180kg) of raw jute every year, which is approximately 30 per cent of global production. Of this, 2-2.5 million bales are exported and the rest internally consumed by 21 state-owned and 110 private jute mills. Jute and jute products are some of Bangladesh's main export earners. The country earned $133.5 million in 2008-09 (July-June) from raw jute. It earns around $200 million annually from jute products.
