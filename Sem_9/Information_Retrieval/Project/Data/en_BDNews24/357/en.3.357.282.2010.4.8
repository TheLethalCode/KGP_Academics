 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)The Ministry of Education has been ordered by the High Court on Thursday to ensure that no woman working in any educational institution is forced to wear a veil or cover her head. The Court ruled that, "It is the personal choice of a woman to wear a veil. If any person tries to compel a woman to wear a veil against her consent or will that amounts to a violation of her fundamental rights as enshrined in the Constitution". The Ministry was also directed to take immediate steps to implement the Guidelines on Sexual Harassment which had been set out in a High Court ruling in March last year.relating to another case. The judgment was passed by a Division Bench comprising justice Syed Mahmud Hossain and justice Syeda Afsar Jahan. The ruling followed a writ petition filed about a news report that stated the headmistress of a primary school in Kurigram had been verbally abused during a public meeting by an Upazilla Education Officer, because she had not covered her head in his presence. In its report to the court, the education authorities stated that the officer in question had made an "inadvertent error". On being summoned to the court, the officer then apologised in person to the headmistress. In its final ruling on Thursday, the court stated that "In Bangladesh there has been no uniform practice of veiling or head covering among women. In recent years there have been reported instances of attempts to forcibly impose this not only by private persons but also by government officials. "The instant case demonstrates the harassment of women and girls in public spaces, schools, educations and places of higher education both public and private." The petition was filed by Advocate Salahuddin Dolon who appeared for himself in court. Ms Sara Hossain represented the Bangladesh Legal and Services and Trust which was a co-petitioner. bdne
