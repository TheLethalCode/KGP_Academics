"The farmers are ready to adopt new technologies. It is the responsibility of the government to make those available to them. There is great scope in the farming sector to use these new technologies and that's why farmers have to get to know about them," he said while addressing the inaugural session of a three-day agriculture fair in the city. The Agriculture Machineries Merchant Association and Net Exhibition arranged the fair, 'Agritech Bangladesh' at Dhaka Sherton hotel in cooperation with Rahimafrooz.

Mentioning that the 'fodder'  feed for livestock - industry holds a bright prospect in Bangladesh, the minister said: "Farmers are not familiar with the industry.
