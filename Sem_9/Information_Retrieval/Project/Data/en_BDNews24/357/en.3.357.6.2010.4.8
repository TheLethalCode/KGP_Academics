 AUGUSTA, Georgia, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German veteran Bernhard Langer charged into an early share of the lead at the US Masters on Thursday while Tiger Woods prepared to make his highly anticipated return to competition later in the day. Langer, a twice champion at Augusta National, recorded three birdies in breezy sunshine to reach the turn in a flawless three-under-par 33, level with American Steve Marino who had completed six holes. The 52-year-old Langer, who plays most of his golf on the seniors Champions Tour, narrowly missed out on a fourth birdie when his attempt from 10 feet at the par-four ninth slid past the left edge of the cup. Wearing a bright red shirt and black trousers, the ice-cool German was warmly applauded by the gallery crammed behind the green as he made his way up the hill to the 10th tee.

The 34-year-old will be bidding to become the first player since World War Two to launch his season with a major victory since fellow American Ben Hogan clinched the 1953 Masters. In other high-profile groupings, in-form Ernie Els has been paired with American Anthony Kim and Japan's Ryo Ishikawa while holder Angel Cabrera of Argentina is playing with South Korean An Byeong-hun and American veteran Jim Furyk. Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland will set off in the company of British Open champion Stewart Cink and South African Charl Schwartzel at 1320 local (1720 GMT).
