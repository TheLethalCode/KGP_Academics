 BANGKOK, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Scores of Thai anti-government protesters tried to force their way into an army base in Bangkok on Saturday but were repelled by water cannon, as their leaders vowed to carry on their fight for new elections. Hundreds more "red shirt" supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra gathered at a satellite earth station north of Bangkok after Thai authorities again blocked transmission of an opposition TV station they said was inciting unrest. Thai PBS channel said the red shirts failed to get into the army base in central Bangkok near Phan Fah bridge, one of the main centres of their month-long protest. At another red shirt camp, in an upmarket shopping district by the Rachaprasong intersection, protest leader Nattawut Saikua told supporters the fight for new elections would go on and there would be no let-up over the long Thai New Year holiday next week. "We want to condemn the government for blocking our television channel again," he said from a makeshift stage. "They've gone back on what they said to us. How can we let these kind of people lead our country? We have to fight on." He warned the crowd to be ready for an attempt by the security forces to clear them on Saturday but there was no big military presence in the area. The Thaicom Pcl satellite station about 60 km (35 miles) north of Bangkok was the scene of the most violent incident to date in the month-old protests, with police using water cannon and tear gas against thousands of protesters. The red shirts stormed the site on Friday and forced the reversal of an earlier decision to censor the People Channel. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said security forces had returned to the station late on Friday after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva ordered that the channel be blocked. Leaders of the red shirts met in Bangkok to decide their response but Thai television said local Thaksin supporters were already gathering at the station on Saturday. The increase in tension since Abhisit imposed a state of emergency late on Wednesday caused a wobble in the stock market, but the index turned higher on Friday after influential fund manager Mark Mobius said he remained bullish on Thailand. "We are not so concerned about the political situation in Thailand," Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management, told Reuters. "Because, as you know, we have been investing in Thailand for almost 15 years or more. And we think that this kind of change in the Thai political environment has happened many times before." SMILING Television showed images of soldiers smiling, accepting water from red shirts, one exchanging a quick handshake with a demonstrator after the skirmish on Friday. "After the incident, many members of the public said they were disappointed, hurt and discouraged by the pictures they saw -- that instead of the restoration of law and order, those who broke the law can do whatever they want. My feeling is similar to yours," Abhisit said in a televised address. He said he had told security forces and other authorities that law and order must be upheld. Federico Ferrara, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, said the lower ranks of the army in particular might not be happy about fighting protesters drawn from the same social classes as themselves. "I'm not sure they are particularly confident about the loyalty of some of the mid-level commanders and especially a lot of the foot soldiers," Ferrara said. Army spokesman Sansern said before midnight on Friday: "We retreated today because we did not want any loss of life or to hurt anyone. But the station is inciting violence and spreading false information and rumours to the detriment of the country." The red shirts have been demonstrating in Bangkok for a month, effectively closing down the upmarket shopping district for a week until some big stores reopened on Friday. Tens of thousands have joined the movement, but the numbers at their two main rally points usually dwindle to a few thousand overnight and there were about 5,000 at the shopping district camp on Saturday morning. The red shirts say they are fighting for democracy and against the power wielded by an unelected elite and military. Their opponents say they are being used by Thaksin to force an election his allies would probably win, after which he could return home and reclaim money seized by the courts for abuse of power while in office. He lives in self-imposed exile, based in Dubai, after fleeing in 2008 before he was sentenced to two years' jail for corrupti
