 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government has said on the eve of World Health Day, that 12 district cities will be selected as "healthy cities". "We will take a number of steps in the cities including the development of health services, and increasing the standard of their management," health minister AFM Ruhal Haque told a press conference on Tuesday. The government has already earmarked Chittagong as a "health city", he said. It is not known when the government will provide the names of the cities. The minister admitted that the urban health service in Bangladesh was inadequate. Haque said that there are 2,213 public and private hospitals with a total capacity of 51,684 beds. There is only one bed for 2,665 people, one doctor for 3012 patients and one nurse for 6342 patients, he said. There is a particularly big difference in the ratio of doctors and nurses, the minister added. The programmes marking World Health Day include rallies and processions in districts and upazilas and documentary shows. The day marks the birth anniversary of the World Health Organisation.
