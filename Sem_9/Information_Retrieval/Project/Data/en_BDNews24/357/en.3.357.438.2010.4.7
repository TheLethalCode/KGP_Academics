 Chittagong, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)A Chittagong University teacher has been given forced leave for sexual harassment. A preliminary investigation proved that assistant professor Abdullah Al Mamun of anthropology had harassed one of his female students. The decision was made at a syndicate meeting, headed by the university's vice-chancellor, Abu Yousuf, on Wednesday. Mohammad Alauddin, pro vice-chancellor of the university, told bdnews24.com that the leave was given as punishment. Mamun, however, claimed that he was a victim of conspiracy, adding that "the investigation report was also biased." Mamun on Wednesday told bdnews24.com that he would take legal steps after further investigation takes place. The syndicate also formed a committee to let the punished teacher defend himself, syndicate member AKM Tafazal told bdnews24.com. He said a fourth-year anthropology student filed a complaint four months ago to the vice-chancellor and registrar accusing the teacher. Tafazal, an associate professor of management, also said, "A three-member committee probed the matter." "The forced leave was imposed as the committee found the complaint true after primary investigation." bdnew
