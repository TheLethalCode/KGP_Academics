 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  Salaries of Bangladesh's president and prime minister were nearly doubled on Sunday. The parliament endorsed the pay hike in a session presided over by speaker Abdul Hamid. Minister in charge of the cabinet department, Matia Chowdhury, raised 'The President's (Remuneration and Privileges) Amendment Bill  2010' and 'The Prime Minister's (Remuneration and Privileges) Amendment Bill  2010', one after another . The president will receive Tk 61,200 under the new pay scale in comparison to the earlier amount of Tk 33,400 raising the head of the state's remuneration by about 83 percent. On the other hand, the prime minister's pay was raised to Tk 58,600 from Tk 32,000, increasing by about 83 percent. However, opposition members including Harun Ur Rashid, Jafrul Islam Chowdhury and Abul Khair Bhuiyan objected and gave speeches opposing the bill. Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury said that the bills were passed with full consent at the parliamentary standing committee meeting. "Now the opposition is raising different objections and even pointing to the power crisis. It is not right." She blamed the former BNP-led government for the power crisis. The bills were passed by settling the matter through a voice vote. Separate bills will be later presented in the parliament for other pay hikes approved at a cabinet meeting of Mar 8. The cabinet approved pay hikes for the president, prime minister, speaker, chief justice, ministers, and Supreme Court justices, among other officials. According to the approvals, the speaker's salary will be raised from Tk 31,000 to Tk 57,200. The salary of the chief justice will be hiked from Tk 30,500 to Tk 56,000. Salaries of the ministers will go up from Tk 29,000 to Tk 53,100, as will the deputy speaker's. State ministers will see their salaries go up from Tk 26,100 to 47,800 and deputy ministers from Tk 24,650 to Tk 45,150. Appellate Division judges will see a raise from Tk 29,000 to Tk 53,100 and High Court judges from Tk 27,000 to Tk 47,000. The monthly salary of MPs will be hiked from Tk 15,000 to Tk 27,500. The salary hikes come in line with last year's 83 percent hike of bureaucrats' salaries. b
