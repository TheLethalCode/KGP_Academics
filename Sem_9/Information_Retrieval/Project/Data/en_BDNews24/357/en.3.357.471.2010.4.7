 LONDON, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Andrew Symonds, the gifted Australian all-rounder whose international career was undermined by a series of off-field incidents, has signed for the Surrey Lions in this year's English Twenty20 competition. Symonds, 34, who is currently playing for the Deccan Chargers in the Indian Premier League, has a strike rate of 156.79 and an average of 37.43 in Twenty20 cricket.

As well as his destructive batting, Symonds is an athletic all-round fielder and can bowl medium-pace or off-spin.

Symonds said he had always enjoyed playing in England. "I am really looking forward to playing with the Surrey Lions. I consider myself lucky to have the opportunity to play this exciting form of tournament cricket in so many different regions," he said.
