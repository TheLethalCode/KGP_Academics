<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  Parliament ended its fourth session on Monday with the speaker urging MPs to make parliament the "meeting point for all views". The 39-day session ended, as it had begun, with the main opposition absent. Speaker Abdul Hamid nevertheless urged the opposition and treasury bench MPs to "have faith in democracy". He called on them to work together in the national interest. Hamid said that 39 years after independence, "we are still unable to reach our desired democratic ideal." "We are being repeatedly hampered in our journey to democracy by evil forces," he added. "Parliament must be the central meeting point for all parties and views," Hamid said. He also called for constructive criticism. "Constructive criticism by the opposition party is helpful for the government." The BNP, which had returned to the house mid-session on Feb 11, walked out on Sunday protesting passage of a bill to raise MPs' salaries. They did not return for the final day of the session on Monday. The eventful fourth session of the ninth parliament began with the president's address and took in over 40 hours of MPs' speeches on a thanksgiving motion. With BNP's return to the house on Feb 11, after a 65-day boycott, parliament witnessed a number of heated words between opposition benches culminating in a particularly fiery exchange on Mar 4. Lawmakers came near to blows in the house. Speaker Abdul Hamid threatened to resign the following day if the prevailing "misconduct of MPs" in parliament continued. The final day of the session saw adoption of a resolution to move forward on the UN's Non-proliferation Treaty and passage of the Indigenous People's Cultural Institute Bill 2010, the 23rd law enacted by parliament in the session that began on Jan 4. bdnews24.c
