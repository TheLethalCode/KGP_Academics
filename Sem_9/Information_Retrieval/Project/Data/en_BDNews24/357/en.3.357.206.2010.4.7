 MUMBAI, APr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters Life!) - When 42-year-old business executive Sam Joy gets home from work, like millions of employees around the world, he turns to television for some relaxation, but it's not the TV you'd expect. Instead of tuning into a news or sports channel, a reality TV show or some thriller, Joy watches "Uttaran", a popular prime-time soap opera about two women in love with the same man.

"We have to innovate and create new programming to appeal to the changing general entertainment channel audience," Shankar told the conference. That innovation is coming in the form of more and more reality TV shows, moving away from the safe haven of singing competitions and venturing into realms such as psychological therapy and television weddings. As for Joy, he prefers his daily dose of soaps but would watch more news if he had more control over the remote, which is usually wielded by his wife. "But I would also check to see what's happening in Uttaran. So far, I like it. I hope they don't turn it into the regular soap story," he sa
