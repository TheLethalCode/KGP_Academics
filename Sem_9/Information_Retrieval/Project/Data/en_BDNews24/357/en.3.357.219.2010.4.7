 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com) -- A Dhaka court has given the police three additional days to question former union council chairman Nazimuddin in relation to the murder of ward commissioner Ahmed Hossain. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Golam Rabbani granted the three-day remand on Wednesday, after Detective Branch police inspector Ruhul Amin, the investigation officer, had sought seven days remand. Naximuddin has already been in police custody for seven days. Lawyers representing Nazimuddin sought his bail but the magistrate rejected the application. The magistrate also remanded another accused in the case, Mohammad Moeenul, to police custody for three days of questioning. The commissioner of Dhaka City Corporation ward number 70, Hossain was shot dead on Feb 9 this year at Alubazar in the old part of the city. Police arrested Nazimuudin, former chairman of Shuvadda union council and a local BNP leader, on Mar 28 in connection with the murder.
