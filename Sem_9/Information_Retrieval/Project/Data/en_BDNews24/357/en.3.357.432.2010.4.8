<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Apr 8 (bdnew24.com)  24 ward councillors, at a press conference on Thursday afternoon, rallied behind the Chittagong mayor. They said that the defamation case, filed by another ward commissioner, was 'baseless'. They said an ill-motivated group was trying to taint his image ahead of the city corporation elections. They said, "It was a trivial matter." But they did not specify who the other quarters were. They said Munni could have discussed the matter in a party forum and could have even asked the party president for justice. "But what she did publicly was objectionable and against party discipline." Earlier in the day a Chittagong court has asked the police to investigate a case filed against Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. Ward commissioner Ferdous Begum Munni, a woman Awami League leader, filed the defamation case against the mayor, also an AL leader, at Chittagong Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Munni complained that Chowdhury pushed her during a member recruitment campaign on Tuesday. She also claimed that the mayor kicked the chair on which she was seated which defamed her as a ward commissioner and AL leader. Magistrate Azizul Haque on Thursday asked the deputy commissioner of Chittagong Metropolitan Police (south) to probe into the case after recording the testimony of the plaintiff, and to submit the report by June 14. Lawyer for the complainant Rana Dasgupta told reporters that Munni filed the case as, being an elected representative, she felt insulted by the mayor's attitude. However, the counsel for the accused, Iftekhar Saimul Chowdhury, told bdnews24.com that a certain quarter had made her file the case to erode the popularity of the mayor. NO COMMENTS FROM THE MAYOR However, the mayor was not willing to comment on the issue as it was under investigation. Reporters on Thursday noon were waiting for his comments at the Nagar Bhaban, but could not reach him as Mohiuddin sat in a meeting with 12 ward councillors. The public relations division, after the meeting, said the mayor would not make any comments in this regard. His personal secretary Hasan Mahmood Shamsher told bdnews24.com: "The mayor doesn't want to comment on this issue as it is still in process." bd
