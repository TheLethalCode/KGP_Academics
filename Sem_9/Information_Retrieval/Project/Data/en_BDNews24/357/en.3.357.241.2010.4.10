<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Authorities in Thailand took an opposition TV station off the air again on Saturday, a day after "red shirt" protesters stormed a satellite earth station and forced the reversal of an earlier decision to censor it. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said security forces had returned to the station late on Friday after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva had ordered that People Channel be blocked. Leaders of the red shirts, supporters of ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, met to decide their response. One red-shirt leader, Nattawut Saikua, told supporters from a makeshift stage in the central shopping district they have occupied for a week that the fight would go on, and there would be no let-up over the long Thai New Year holiday next week. "We want to condemn the government for blocking our television channel again. They've gone back on what they said to us. How can we let these kind of people lead our country? We have to fight on," he said. Security forces had fired water cannon and tear gas on Friday in an attempt to push back thousands of protesters who had driven to the satellite station about 60 km (35 miles) north of Bangkok, the most violent incident to date in a month-old protest movement aimed at forcing early elections. The soldiers eventually pulled back after protesters climbed over barbed wire and forced open the gate of the compound, holding it for about three hours in defiance of a state of emergency invoked on Wednesday in Bangkok and surrounding areas. The increase in tension since Abhisit imposed the state of emergency in Bangkok late on Wednesday caused a wobble in the stock market, but the main index turned higher on Friday after influential fund manager Mark Mobius told Reuters he remained bullish on Thailand. "We are not so concerned about the political situation in Thailand," Mobius, executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management, said in a telephone interview. "Because, as you know, we have been investing in Thailand for almost 15 years or more. And we think that this kind of change in the Thai political environment has happened many times before." SMILING Television showed images of soldiers smiling, accepting water from red shirts, one exchanging a quick handshake with a demonstrator after the skirmish on Friday. Abhisit did not hide his displeasure in a televised address later in the day. "After the incident, many members of the public said they were disappointed, hurt and discouraged by the pictures they saw -- that instead of the restoration of law and order, those who broke the law can do whatever they want. My feeling is similar to yours," he said. He said he had insisted to the security forces and other relevant authorities that law and order must be upheld. "We retreated today because we did not want any loss of life or to hurt anyone," army spokesman Sansern said shortly before midnight on Friday. "But the station is inciting violence and spreading false information and rumours to the detriment of the country." Fourteen protesters, three police and a soldier were wounded on Friday, a medical centre said. One red shirt suffered a gunshot wound, most likely from a rubber bullet. The red shirts have been demonstrating in Bangkok for a month, effectively closing down the upmarket shopping district for a week until some big stores reopened on Friday. Tens of thousands have joined the movement, but the numbers at their two main rally points usually dwindle to a few thousand overnight and there were no more than 3,000 at the shopping district camp on Saturday morning, a Reuters reporter estimated. Many protesters, including Bangkok residents who have rallied to the "red shirt" cause, will want to leave the capital from this weekend to be with their families for Songkran, the Thai New Year festival, which runs from April 13 to 15. The red shirts say they are fighting for democracy and against the power wielded by unelected elites and the military top brass. Its opponents say they are being used by Thaksin to force elections his allies would probably win, after which he could return home and reclaim money seized by the courts for abuse of power while in office. He lives in self-imposed exile, based in Dubai, after fleeing in 2008 before he was sentenced to two years in prison for corruption. He phones in regularly to red shirt rallies and also communicates via Twitter, in one message on Friday denying rumours he had cancer. "I am definitely healthy. I just feel lonely at times because I am a workoholic," he wro
