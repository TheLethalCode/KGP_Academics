 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The NGO leading the campaign to improve health and environment standards in the ship-breaking sector has strongly criticised the Ship Breakers Association's allegation that it and other NGOs are conspiring to shutdown the industry in the guise of protecting the environment. The association chief, Jafar Alam, said on Wednesday that the "Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) and the Young Power in Social Action Bangladesh (YPSA) are working against the industry following a blue print formulated for its destruction." "As a part of the conspiracy BELA, YPSA and a number of other NGOs, under instigation from the Basel Action Network (BAN) are spreading various propaganda." Alam claimed. However, Syeda Rizwana Hasan, the Executive Director of BELA told bdnews24.com, "I really don't think this kind of absurd criticism merits a response. These matters are all being dealt with in court, and it is clear that the Association's strategy is simply to try to take matters into a political arena. "They are not interested in pursuing the matters legally  they just want to put pressure to try and get all the existing law changed in their favour. They want everything to be in the hands of the shipping , environment and commerce ministries  not the courts." At a press conference organised by the association at the National Press Club on Wednesday, Alam attributed the country's current leading position in the ship breaking and recycling sector as the reason for this conspiracy saying, "Bangladesh has been leading this sector from 2003 and local and foreign conspirators are trying to shut the industry down." In relation to the commerce ministry's gazette publication on Jan 26 that made submission of detoxification certificates from the scrap vessel's home country compulsory, the association president said "Imports of scrap vessels have stopped for the last two months due to this." He urged the government to change this decision in order to maintain the pace of the industry's activities. The association chief also demanded formulation of regulations for the industry along with the development of a separate ship breaking zone. Alam also pointed out that the industry meets 70-80 percent of the country's iron demands and said, "If the industry were to shut down this will not only lead to unemployment of two lakh workers and loss of revenue for the government, but the lack of raw materials would also result in the closure of approximately 450 re-rolling mills and 25 steel mills around the country." Responding to a journalist's query regarding the high death toll of workers in the industry, he said "Work is ongoing to prevent this." He also revealed that a 250-bed hospital is being made for the workers. The association president also claimed that the industry's pollution level is 'very small'. The association's vice president Mohammed Mohsin and advisor Anam Chowdhury also spoke at the meeting. b
