 Dhaka, Apr 08 (bdnews24.com)  Belal Mohammad, one of the founders of Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra, on Thursday, gave away his independence award medal and certificate to Bangladesh Betar. At a get-together at the National Broadcasting Authority office at Shahbagh, Belal handed over the medal and certificate to Mahbubur Rahman, director general of Bangladesh Radio. Belal's friends from the Liberation War in 1971, including Shahjahan Faruk, Ashraful Alam, Ashfaqur Rahman and Nasim Chowdhury were present. War-time broadcaster Belal Mohammad received the Independence Award on Mar 25 this year for his contribution during the war. Belal worked as a script writer at the Chittagong Betar before the war. On the eve of the war breaking out on Mar 25, 1971, he was among those who broadcast Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's declaration of independence from the Kalurghat Betar Kendra. Belal told bdnews24.com: "I was honoured with the Independence Award for the role in the Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendra." He said although he was one of the founders, the entire work was done collectively. "So, this award is also a collective achievement." "I'll form a Lal Mohan-Muzaffar trust with the prize money. This trust will provide technical training to the unemployed people to help them become self-dependent," he added. Lal Mohan was the youngest member of the anti-British squad led by Surya Sen while comrade Muzaffar Ahmed was one of the founders of the Indian Communist Party. b
