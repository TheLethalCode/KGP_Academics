 Al-Amin Dewan Chittagong, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com) ---Chittagong Water and Sewerage Authority (Wasa) stopped providing any new connections as it cannot provide sufficient water to its existing customers. This will result in the inhabitants of certain parts of South Bakulila, South Katrali, parts of Mohrar, from Saltgola crossing to Patenga, Agrabad Pathantoli, Middle Halishar, North Halishahar and Andarkilla not being able to obtain any new connections. Wasa has also said that it will no longer exchange narrow pipes for ones with a wider diameter Wasa chairman AKM Faizullah told bdnews24.com, "We cannot now generate enough water for our needs. If we provide any new connections, the water crisis will just further deteriorate." "So we have suspended all new connections until we can provide additional water, he said Wasa can make available 20 crore litre water daily against a demand of 50 crore liter. As a result, many places in the port city cannot access water more than once in a week. There are 46,000 resident consumers of Wasa. Wasa is also no longer going to change pipelines with three-quarters an inch diameter with pipes of a wider diameter. Ezaz Rashul, director of CTG Wasa Development Project told bdnews24.com, "Despite the water crisis, consumers want more and more connections. If we provide them, there will be even less water for existing customers." Wasa says that there are five new projects under implementation - and when these are complete in about three years, Wasa will both be able to deal with the current 30 crore litre shortfall and re-start providing new connections. The projects under construction are: Karanfully Water Supply Project with 13.60 crore litre capcity at Rangonia funded by Japan International Co-operative Agency (JAICA); Boalkhali Water Treatment Plant with 10 crore litres capacity funded by Korean Economic Development Co-operation Fund (EDCF); Mohra Water Treatment Plant with 9 crore capacity funded by the government; and 4-crore litre capacaity Maduanghat Water Treatment Plant. bdnews24
