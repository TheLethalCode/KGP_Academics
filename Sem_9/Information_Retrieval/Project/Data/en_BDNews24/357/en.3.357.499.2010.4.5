 Dhaka, April 05 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh parliament adopted a unanimous resolution on Monday giving full support to the UN secretary-general's global nuclear disarmament plan and proposed Nuclear Weapons Convention. The resolutionreiterating the nation's full support for nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful uses of nuclear energyreflects Bangladesh's policy on a nuclear weapon-free world. Earlier this year, Bangladesh, elected chair of the rotating presidency of the UN Conference on Disarmament, urged all countries to work for a nuclear weapon free world. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, taking over the chair of the Conference on Feb 3, called for global expenditure on nuclear weapons to be diverted to peaceful development. Monday's resolution called on the UN Conference on Disarmament to immediately begin negotiations on nuclear disarmament. It also said "any use of nuclear weapons would constitute international crimes, including crimes against humanity, crimes against peace, war crimes and genocide, with catastrophic global effects." The resolution is being adopted ahead of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty review conference scheduled for May 3 to 28 this year. Speaker Abdul Hamid placed the proposal on adoption of the resolution, which was passed by voice vote. The main opposition BNP, however, was absent from parliament as the resolution was passed. The resolution urged all world governments and national parliaments to join the Jatiya Sangsad in supporting a convention to ban nuclear weapons. It also stressed that the annual $100 billion spent on nuclear weapons should be diverted to climate change adaptation programmes and millennium development goals. The NPT was signed in 1970 with a view to limiting the spread of nuclear weapons in the world as superpowers, the United States and the former Soviet Union, were engaged in a nuclear arms race. At present, 189 states are party to the agreement.
