<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)The Sundarbans Eco-System Forum, a joint initiative by Bangaldesh and India, aims to protect and preserve the heritage from the adverse affects of climate change. The formation of the forum, expected to be launched by September, was declared at a workshop on Sunday on 'Climate Threat to Sundarbans Across India and Bangladesh' at Kolkata, the Press Trust of India reported Sunday. State minister for forest and environment Hassan Mahmud and Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh were present. Steps had already been initiated in the two countries to protect Sundarban's eco system, Ramesh said. The Sundarbans, the biggest mangrove forest in the world, which straddles West Bengal and Bangladesh, is one of the most climatically vulnerable areas of the world, the ministers told the workshop. "We need to protect and preserve this biosphere reserve jointly. Setting up the forum is a distinctive possibility and we deserve it as the forest having 60 percent of its territory in Bangladesh and the rest in India is 50 times the size of the Maldives," Ramesh said. Both the governments will be able to take up joint projects under the forum to save the mangrove forest and the tiger population, he said. "The forum will be the first practical demonstration of efforts to protect the Sundarbans," the minister added. Hasan Mahmud went to Kolkata on Sunday with a view to generating popular interest in India in support of nominating the Sundarbans as one of the world's seven wonders. He said 40 percent of the Sundarbans is located in West Bengal. "So we have taken the initiative to spread publicity across India. We've to get India's support to give the Sundarbans a chance to be in the top seven wonders," Mahmud said. The Sundarbans has made it on the shortlist of the top 28 wonders, and it will be from this list that the top seven will be chosen. People can vote until the end of the year. The two ministers will visit the Indian portion of the Sundarbans Monday. bdne
