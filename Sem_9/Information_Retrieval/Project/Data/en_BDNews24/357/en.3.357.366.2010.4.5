 BARCELONA, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Victor Valdes is having another outstanding season for Barcelona and his continued absence from Spain's squad underlines the embarrassment of goalkeeping riches for the European champions. Valdes, who was called up once in August 2005 but did not play, has no chance of ousting Real Madrid's Iker Casillas as Spain's number one and if he makes Vicente del Bosque's World Cup squad will be third choice behind Liverpool's Pepe Reina. The 28-year-old Catalan has conceded just 19 goals in 30 La Liga matches this term, compared to 26 for Casillas, and is closing in on a second straight 'Zamora' award as Spain's top domestic keeper to add to the one he won in 2004/05.

"There are some excellent goalkeepers in this country who, like me, do not get called up either," added Valdes, naming Sevilla's Andres Palop, Athletic Bilbao's Gorka Iraizoz and Deportivo Coruna's Daniel Aranzubia. Del Bosque, who must name his final 23-man squad by June 1, has refused to be drawn on the Valdes question. "Valdes is one of a group of keepers of an excellent level who could get a call-up," he said in an interview with soccer magazine Don Balon last week. "I am an independent man, I don't have any restraints and I try to be as fair as possible. "We don't hold anything against anyone and obviously he has a chance."
