 Dhaka, Apr 05 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Monday ordered five officials of the private mobile phone operator company Axiata Bangladesh (formerly Aktel) to appear before the court on Apr 15. Axiata goes under the brand name 'Robi' in Bangladesh. Dhaka Metropolitan Judge ANM Bashirullah issued the order in a case filed earlier on Monday morning by Miles, a prominent band of the country, accusing Robi and notable band singer James of breaching the Copyright Act. The court also ordered James to present his documents to the court in support of his allegation on the same day. The defendents named in both cases are chief executive officer Michael Kuehner, Chief Marketing Officer Bidyut Kumar Basu, Head of Regulatory Alloisus Mohan Ramaiah, Head of Corporate Affairs Segufta Yesmin Samad and head of Value Added Services Novera Nur. Hamin Ahmed and Manam Ahmed, members of the band Miles, said in their petition that Robi is illegally using two of their famous songs  'Neela' and 'Firiye Dao' - as their ring and welcome tones without seeking any prior permission from the band. James lodged a similar complaint in relation to his song  'Dukhini Dukkho Korona'. Barrister Arifur Rahman acted for the litigants.
