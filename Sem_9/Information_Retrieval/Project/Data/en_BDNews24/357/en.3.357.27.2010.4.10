 Gaibandha, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com) - Nurina Akhter chose to take her own life. Like Elora and Simi before her, Nurina thought death would be more peaceful than the harassment she faced in life. For Nurina, the harassment apparently came in the form a 20-year old boy, Shaharul Islam who used to verbally harass her everyday on her way to Girdharipur Dakhil Madrassah in the next village. 14-year old Nurina hung herself on Friday noon from a beam of her bedroom at Nishchitipur village under Idilpur union of Sadullapur upazila in Gaibandha. Although Nurina had made it very clear that she did not want to marry him, Shaharul, who came from the same village as her, used to repeatedly try to propose to Nurina when she walked to her madrassah where she studied in the eighth grade. The officer in charge of Sadullapur Hasan Imam said that Shaharul had been harassing Nurina for a long time. But after Nurina told her father about what was going on, he decided to speak to Abdul Gaffar Miah and Shahjahan, Shaharul's father and older brother respectively. This apparently made Shaharul so angry that he went to Nurina's house on Apr 8 and asked her hand in marriage. When this was refused again, Shaharul used abusive language and even threatened to kill Nurina, said the police. Young Nurina was so embarrassed that her neighbours and most of the entire village came to know about the whole incident. On Friday afternoon, Nurina decided to take her own life when the men were away for their jumma prayers. Her uncle Zakirul Islam was first to find Nurina hanging and cried out. The police came to recover her body at 8pm. Nurina's father, Nurunnabi Miah, has lodged a case. bdne
