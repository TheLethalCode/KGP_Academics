 Dhaka, Apr 05 (bdnews24.com)  The parliament on Monday passed the 'Ethnic Minority Cultural Organisation Bill-2010' to develop and preserve cultural traditions of the ethnic minorities. Information and cultural affairs minister Abul Kalam Azad placed the bill in parliament. The opposition's proposal to share public opinion on this proposition was rejected by voice vote. Independent MP Fazlul Azim, however, opposed the passage saying: "There is no necessity of this bill." He said it would create a division within the country and reactionary quarters would get a wrong signal, he said. "We want unity. The existing laws could have preserved the ethnic minority traditions quite well." Azad replied saying that the bill was part of the ruling Awami League's election pledges. A statement, illustrating the objectives of the bill, stated that it was necessary for enacting a new law on ethnic and cultural traditions for the preservation, development and advancement of ethnic minorities and related organisations. The bill also included a list of 27 ethnic minority communities, which are Chakma, Marma, Tripura, Mru, Tanchangya, Bawm, Pankho, Chak, Khiang, Khumi, Lusai, Choch, Santal, Dalu, Usai (Usui), Rakhain, Manipuri, Garo, Hajang, Khasia, Mong, Oraon, Barman, Paharia, Malpaharia, Munda and Kol.
