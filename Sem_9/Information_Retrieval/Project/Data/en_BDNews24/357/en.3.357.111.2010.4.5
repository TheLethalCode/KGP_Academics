 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com) -- Police on Monday seized the passport of Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik as they questioned him in the wake of a complaint lodged against him by the father of Ayesha Siddiqui, reports PTI. But Shoaib told police, at the Hyderabad residence of tennis star Sania Mirza, that he had been tricked into marriage with Ayesha. "The city police have questioned Shoaib Malik for one-and-a-half hours and they have also seized his passport. Immigration authorities have been informed about the case filed against Malik and his passport seizure," additional commissioner of police Dwarka Tirumala Rao said. Rao said, "As part of the investigation, a police team visited Sania's residence. We are probing the matter." "We are trying to collect evidence. Shoaib is cooperating and Sania is supporting him. They say they know the truth behind the whole issue," a police official said after the team talked to the cricketer. During questioning, Shoaib told the police that he had been 'cheated' by the Siddiqui family and tricked into marriage, he said. On Sunday, the Pakistani cricketer had claimed that he was emotionally forced into the 'nikahnama' with the Hyderabad girl but said the marriage was invalid as her family had cheated him and ruled out divorce. He said to this day he has not met the girl whose photographs were sent to him by the Siddiqui family purported to be that of Ayesha. The charges against Shoaib are that of harassment of Ayesha, cheating to marry another girl and criminal intimidation including threats to her to keep quiet, according to Hyderabad police commissioner AK
