<TEXT>
 Panchagarh, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  The special BDR court in Panchagarh will on Wednesday be the first to issue a verdict in a case involving the 2009 Bangladesh Rifles mutiny. Twenty-nine members of the 25th Rifles Battalion have been accused of rebellion in support of the massacre at the BDR Pilkhana headquarters on Feb 25 and 26 last year. The court set the verdict date on Tuesday after five days of proceedings beginning on Feb 3. During the proceedings, the court heard charges against the 29 BDR members on Feb 3 and 4. Charges were framed against the accused on April 4. The court heard from witnesses on Monday, April 5. On Tuesday it heard statements verbally and in writing from the accused. It then heard the case against the accused presented by the prosecutor Lt Col Sarajul Haque, before setting the verdict date for the following day. BDR chief Maj Gen Mainul Islam presided over the court, with deputy attorney general Biswajit Roy, Lt Col Mahfuzur Rahman and Maj Didar Al Latif present as the prosecutors. Supreme Court lawyers Mosharraf Hossian Kajol and Manzurul Huq were also present to assist the prosecutor. An army officer was also present as a 'friend of the accused' to assist some of the defendents; three private lawyers were also present. The Pilkhana mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion spread to other BDR outposts around the country. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. The Pilkhana murders will be tried separately in civilian courts. The BDR members at Panchagar are accused of rebellion in support of the Pilkhana mutiny, including taking up arms, firing about hundred rounds and blockading the Dhaka-Panchagarh highway. Seven of the 29 accused BDR men at Panchagarh have admitted their guilt. They confessed their involvement in mutinous acts and expressed repentance seeking the court's sympathy. A written statement placed before the court said: "We are sorry, ashamed and repentant and we seek forgiveness." In a verbal statement, they said that they had "stabbed the border force in the back" through their rebellion. "We have destroyed the reputation of a disciplined force," they said. On Monday, witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution, three of whom identified 18 of the accused from video footage. In Tuesday's proceedings, however, 22 accused pleaded innocent. They also pleaded for reinstatement of their jobs. In the event of a guilty verdict on Wednesday, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. Special BDR courts courts in Rangamati, Satkhira and Feni have also set verdict dates for ongoing trials. Verdicts in the trial of 19th Rifles Battalion in Feni will be given on Apr 18; of 7th Rifles Battalion of Satkhira on Apr 19; and of Rajnagar Battalion of Rangamati on May 2. bdnews
