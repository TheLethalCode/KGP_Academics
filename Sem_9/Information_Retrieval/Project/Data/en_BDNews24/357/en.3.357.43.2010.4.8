 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Pakistan will clash with hosts Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup opener on June 15 while India will take on Bangladesh next day. The Press Trust of India reported the 11-day-long tournament would be played on a single-leg round-robin basis with the top two teams entering the final to be held on June 24, with the next day slated as a reserve day, a media release from broadcast rights owners Nimbus Sport said on Thursday. The Asian Cricket Council and Nimbus have signed a five-year deal for events to be held up to 2014, including three Asia Cup events, the release added. ACC chief executive Ashraful Huq hoped the partnership with Nimbus would help the continental championship to continue to grow "its premier status exponentially across the world." He also expressed confidence that the agreement would "go a long way in creating possibilities for more Asian nations to play at the highest level possible." The Asia Cup will be held every alternate year - this year followed by editions in 2012 and 2014. Each tournament would feature India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh playing each other in a league format, with the top two teams playing off in a final to identify the champions of Asia.
