<TITLE> Secretariat to reopen gate 5 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Secretariat is set to reopen its gate no 5 after a long time. This will allow repair and refitting of the main entrance, gate 1. Subsequently, gate 5 will be closed off again once gate 1 is ready for use. "The wall closing the gate is being demolished now," said Sukomal Chakma, deputy assistant engineer of public works department, which is in charge of the secretariat. He said the home ministry endorsed a proposal last week to reopen the gate. "The demolition work began since then." Some infrastructure was built on the road leading to the gate and it would take much time to make the gate usable after demolishing the structures, Chakma said. The BNP-led government closed gate 5 to ensure security of the secretariat and ease traffic snarl-up at Press Club area. Gate-4 was also closed during that time. Since then, gates 1 & 2 have been in use as the regular entry and gate-3 for exit. Secretariat security and public works officials said, gate-1, the main entrance, would be closed temporarily for installation of metal detectors and other development work. Modern equipment would be installed to screen harmful substances including explosives, he said. The gate would also go through a beautification process, said Chakma. It might take three to four months to make gate 5 usable again. Chakma told bdnews24.com that gate-1 will reopen after being refurbished and subsequently gate-5 will be closed again.
