 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  The opposition BNP has identified 46 polling centres which it claims the ruling party might try to occupy on the Bhola-3 by-elections voting day. The BNP has been demanding that the army is deployed in the constituency but the Election Commission has so far refused. "Criminals across the country are gathering in Bhola to work on behalf of the ruling party candidate. We fear that they might occupy the polling centres," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told a press conference on Saturday at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. Of the total 63 polling centres, 46 are "risky", Ahmed claimed. Awami League candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon and BNP's Hafizuddin Ahmed are contesting the Bhola-3 (Lalmohan-Tazmuddin) constituency. Ahmed, however, did not clarify the names of the "criminals" to which he was referring. He said people doubt whether a free and fair election would be held in Bhola. He also said they had informed the matter to the commission but had not received any response. Of the total 63 polling centres, 46 are "risky", Ahmed claimed. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, who is currently in Bhola, told district administration officials on Friday that neglect on their part during the by-elections would not be tolerated. He also said that anyone found to have been failed in their duty would be suspended immediately. The BNP leader alleged on Saturday that the AL candidate was consistently breaching the electoral code of conduct and hindering the election campaign of the BNP candidate. He said that whilst standing 100 yards away from a BNP meeting, supporters of the AL candidate chanted slogans against the BNP candidate He also alleged that the ruling candidate was campaigning using more than two mikes and are hanging large party symbols and colourful banners, which are in breach of the code of conduct. According to the electoral code of conduct, one candidate is not allowed to use more than two mikes and are forbidden to use colourful and digital print banners. Ahmed alleged that the EC was not taking any action against them. At a meeting in Bhola on Friday, AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said that the BNP was only making the allegations as they realised that they would lose the election
