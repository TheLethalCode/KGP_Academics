 Dhaka, Apr 06 (bdnews24.com)  Pakistan will not interfere in Bangladesh's move towards bringing the suspected war criminals to justice, Pakistan high commissioner said Tuesday. Ashraf Qureshi, the newly appointed Pakistani high commissioner, told reporters after meeting with law minister Shafiq Ahmed at his office. When asked about Pakistan's stance on the issue, Qureshi said: "Pakistan honours Bangladesh's independence and sovereignty. This issue is completely an internal affair of Bangladesh. The Pakistan government has no comment on the trial." The law minister also told reporters, "The high commissioner has clarified his country's stance. Pakistan will not interfere in the trial." The Bangladesh government on Mar 25 took a big step towards bringing the war criminals to justice by declaring the formation of war crime tribunal, investigation agency and prosecution panel under the International Tribunal Act-1973. bdnews
