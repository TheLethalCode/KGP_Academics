<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American Andy Roddick defeated the Czech Republic's Tomas Berdych 7-5, 6-4 to win the Sony Ericsson Open on Sunday after an enthralling final. The former world number one captured his 29th career title, and second at Key Biscayne, after two fiercely contested sets. Roddick was especially delighted to win the crown after losing the Indian Wells final to Croatian Ivan Ljubicic two weeks ago. "Obviously it's a big title for me.

But he faced tenacious opposition throughout from Berdych who had beaten world number one Roger Federer on his way to the final. There was much more to Roddick's game than his trademark blasting serve, he sliced well and was smart on his feet. "He was really good today. He was really strong, serving well I was looking to get one chance or maybe one is enough," said Berdych. "But he held pretty well. I didn't get a chance during the whole match." Roddick agreed. "I've played well on the big moments. Haven't had an off day mentally. I've been able to execute. I've been able to have a game plan and execute it regardless of what kind of shots it takes.
