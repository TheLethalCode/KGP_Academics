<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)The Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited has told the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications on Wednesday that, with its own funding it will connect 100 of the country's union parishad's to the fiber optic network by 2013 in order to promote IT-based education in the remotest areas. After the meeting, Hasanul Huq Inu, the committee chairman, told journalists that the committee was now urging the government to allocate more funds so that all 5000 union parishads could be covered by the fiber optic network coverage. He also said that the standing committee meeting had recommended the ministry should both stop imposing a Tk 800 charge on mobile phone SIM cards and only impose a standard Tk 100 tax for each mobile phone set. He said that if the 12 percent duty currently imposed on each mobile phone was lifted, the smuggling of the sets would stop. Inu said that the telecommunications ministry usually implements most recommendations made by the standing committee. The recommendation for waiving the 12 percent duty on mobile sets is, however, not new. The parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications ministry in the 8th parliament (2001-2006), led by the BNP, had on several occasions made the same recommendations. In addition, before each budget in June, the private telecom companies have strongly advocated a waiver of the duty. But the finance ministry has so far ignored these demands, saying that a flat charge on all sets would hit poor people, who bought cheap sets. The former finance minister M Saifur Rahman often told parliament that rich people should pay more as they brought expensive mobile phone "A consumer having a set worth Tk 3000 and another one enjoying a phone worth Tk 50,000 should not pay same amount of duty. It would be an injustice to the poor," he said. Inu also said that the standing committee had suggested reducing the duty on fibre optics from 40 percent down to below ten percent so that the whole country could more easily be brought under the network. "We will sit on April 28 to make our final recommendations on the need for a reduction of duty on the fibre optic equipment," he told bdnews24.co
