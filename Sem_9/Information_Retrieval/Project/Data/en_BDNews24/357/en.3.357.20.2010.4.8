 Chittagong, Apr 8 (bdnew24.com)  A defamation case has been filed against Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. Ward commissioner Ferdous Begum Munni, a woman Awami League leader, filed the case against the mayor, also an AL leader, at Chittagong Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Thursday. Munni complained that Chowdhury pushed her during a member recruitment campaign on Tuesday. She also claimed that the mayor kicked the chair on which she was seated which defamed her as a ward commissioner and AL leader. The offence of defamation, set out in section 499 of the penal code, deals with "words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations" which is intended to harm the reputation of a person. The mayor was not available for comment.
