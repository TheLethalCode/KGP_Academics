 Dhaka, April 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has rejected a UNHCR proposal to register Myanmar nationals living outside designated camps in Cox's Bazar as refugees. Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes told journalists on Saturday that the regional coordinator of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees recently suggested that the government should initiate new registration for such Myanmar nationals. "We have categorically informed him (the regional coordinator) that this is not possible," Quayes told reporters at a press briefing at the foreign ministry. He said Bangladesh was ready to work with the United Nations on giving access and protection to 28,000 Rohingya refugees in the two campsNowapara and Kutupalong. "We don't want to discuss about the rest of the Myanmar nationals living elsewhere in Bangladesh illegally." "They must go back to their homeland," said the secretary. The secretary's comment comes in the wake of a campaign in the international media about alleged repression of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh. Recognition as refugees would also entail a government obligation to provide them shelter, protection, food, health services and other needs. He said although thousands of Myanmar nationals had entered Bangladesh, but the government was very "tolerant and flexible" about them. The government knew that most of them were involved in different economic activities and was allowing them to take the benefit of its health services on humanitarian ground. "We have not dumped them in concentration camps." "But that is not due to our weakness," said Quayes. Quayes also criticised some international NGOs and media for presenting "untrue" stories about the Rohingya refugees. Some western diplomats and legislators recently visited Cox's Bazar to witness the poor living conditions of the Rohingya people. The government has much international pressure to recognise thousands of illegal Myanmar nationals in Bangladesh as refugees. But Dhaka has been resisting that pressure saying that such a move would open a floodgate of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar's Rakhain (Arakan) state. The government and the UNHCR prepared a list of Rohingya refugees following a military crackdown on Arakan Muslims in 1992-93. The UNHCR with the help of Bangladesh and Myanmar government registered over 200,000 Rohngyas as refugees, most of whom have been repatrated. But over 28,000 Rohingyas refused to return fearing persecution. The local administration in Cox's Bazar says that most of the repatriated Rohingyas have re-entered Bangladesh illegally due to a lack of livelihood there
