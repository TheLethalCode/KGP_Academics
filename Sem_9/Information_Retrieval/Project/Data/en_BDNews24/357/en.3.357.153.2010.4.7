<TITLE> Bolstered Pakistani PM to be a 'firefighter' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's prime minister will see his position bolstered when he assumes most presidential powers, but faces an uphill task of bringing stability in the US ally where different centres of power vie for influence. After two years of intense political wrangling, a parliamentary committee last week approved a constitutional reform bill in the parliament. The legislation will effectively turn President Asif Ali Zardari into a ceremonial head of state and transfer most of of his sweeping powers to Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani. While the constitutional reforms are being hailed as a "Bill of Hope" for a country with a chequered political history, Gilani sees himself as focus of new crises if political uncertainty persists. "You think that the prime minister will become stronger after these amendments but I think now I will be the focus of all storms," he told the parliament before the introduction of the bill on Friday. Political turmoil in the nuclear-armed South Asian country worries the United States, which wants to see a focus on eliminating al Qaeda and Taliban militants while it struggles to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan. The Zardari government has faced several bouts of political turmoil since it came to power two years ago, with almost all crises centred on the unpopular president, who shot to power after the assassination of his wife, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in late 2007. Gilani is a staunch loyalist of Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party, now led by Zardari, but the soft-spoken prime minister has tiptoed through all crises without making many enemies. Many analysts believe even after he assumes more powers Gilani will tread a political path "cautiously" while dealing with the numerous centres of power, including a PPP dominated by Zardari, an assertive Supreme Court, a strong opposition and a powerful army. "A person of his temperament is unlikely to throw his weight around or cause friction with other centres of power," said Rashed Rahman, editor of the liberal Daily Times newspaper. "An empowered prime minister like Yusuf Raza Gilani is likely to become more confident after assuming these powers and will try to keep things running smoothly so that he completes his term in office." Under the proposed constitutional changes, Gilani will be empowered to make key appointments, such as military chiefs, and will have the authority to advise the president whether to dissolve parliament. He is expected to stay loyal to Zardari and their party, however. "I think Zardari will continue to cast his very heavy shadow on the prime minister because he is still chairman of the party of which Gilani is a member," said Riffat Hussein of Islamabad's Quaid-e-Azam University. UNITED THEY STAND, DIVIDED THEY FALL Though Gilani has a reputation of being a man of principles -- he sometimes defied Bhutto during her stint in power in the 1990s and is also said to have had some differences with Zardari -- he is unlikely to challenge the president. "There may be some strains between Zardari and Gilani but they will continue to work together because united they stand, divided they fall," said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political and security analyst. But despite his loyality to Zardari, the task for Gilani is not easy as he moves ahead. The first major problem for Gilani is a growing spat between Zardari and the Supreme Court. The court wants the government to reopen old corruption cases against Zardari after it threw out a controversial amnesty protecting the president, many of his aides and thousands of political activists in December. The chief justice of the Supreme Court last week suggested the government send a letter to Swiss authorities, with the approval of Gilani, for the revival of graft cases against Zardari. 'CAUGHT IN A NUTCRACKER' Though neither Gilani nor his office has commented on the suggestion, officials of the PPP have suggested the prime minister might find himself in a dilemma. "The prime minister is caught in a nutcracker," Rahman said. "Without his approval, the letters to the Swiss authorities can't go and if he approves them, it will put him in a very awkward position. He's in a state of limbo right now." Much depends on how aggressively the court pursues the cases. Gilani has largely tried to steer clear of the row between Zardari and his top rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, but the prime minister may come under attack from the opposition if he is seen as too close to Zardari. Gilani has also maintained cordial relations with the army and is seen as reluctant to upset it. Washington has maintained strong ties with Zardari and analysts believe they do not expect the rapport with Islamabad to change significantly with Gilani leading the government. One reason is because the military has profound influence over ties with the United States. "The prime minister is most likely to play a role of a moderator between different centres of power," Rizvi said. "He will be acting like a firefighter between the president, the opposition, the supreme court and ar
