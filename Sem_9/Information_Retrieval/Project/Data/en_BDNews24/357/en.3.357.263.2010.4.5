<TITLE> Ershad's regime illegal, says AAG </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  An additional attorney general told the High Court on Monday that former military ruler HM Ershad's military regime was "illegal". UPDATE He also said that the seventh amendment to the constitution legalising Ershad's takeover of power was also not lawful. The AAG was speaking in support of a petition filed by Siddique Ahmed, a resident of Chittagong, who was convicted of murder during Ershad's martial law period Ershad's Jatiya Party is an ally of the current AL-led government. The High Court, following the legal argument, issued a rule on the government asking it to explain why the seventh amendment to the constitution should not be declared illegal. The amendment legalised the takeover of power by the former military ruler HM Ershad along with the martial law instructions made between 1982 and 1986. The home secretary, law secretary, inspector general of prisons and Chittagong deputy commissioner are required to respond to the rule in four weeks. The bench of justices Md Momtazuddin Ahmed Naima Haider also granted Ahmed a six-month bail. Additional attorney general MK Rahman, who stood for the government, said the imposition of martial law by Ershad, his taking over of power, his enforcing of martial rule and all activities under it are illegal. The constitution does not allow the imposition of martial law, he said. So Ershad's taking over of power disobeying the constitution was illegal, Rahman added. Barrister Hassan S Azim, the lawyer for the petitioner, had earlier told the court that the imposition by Ershad of martial law was against the basic foundations of the constitution. All martial law instructions imposed between 1982 and 1986 are illegal along with the seventh amendment which legalised the martial law itself, the lawyer argued. It was illegal to establish a martial law court and the life imprisonment given to Siddiqur Rahman by that court was therefore also illegal, he said. In 2005, the High Court declared illegal the fifth amendment that provided constitutional legitimacy to the governments in power  both military and civilian  following the 1975 assassination of the nation's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. This decision was upheld by the Supreme Court in January 2010. The petitioner was convicted in 1986 of the murder in Nov 1984 of Abu Taher, a spice trader in Chittagong. A case was filed at Kotwali Police Staion by sub-inspector Ataur Rahman on Dec 24 of the same year. The 3rd martial court of Chittagong sentenced Siddique Ahmed, Noor Mohammad and Nurul Anwar to life imprisonment on Mar 20, 1986 in connection with the case. The chief martial law administrator upheld the verdict on July 19 that year. Siddique Ahmed, who remained a fugitive for 20 years, was arrested on Aug 2, 2006. He is currently behind bars in a Chittagong jail. bd
