 Dhaka, April 05 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina called on people to have patience as the power crisis heightens with summer's approach, in an address to parliament on Monday, the concluding day of the fourth session. In her 44-minute speech, the prime minister spoke for more than 20 minutes on the issue of power. She did her best to assure parliament that the government was taking all measures to address the chronic electricity shortage, describing in detail the plans to overcome the problem over the next five yearsfrom 2010 to 2015. Hasina said the government had taken measures for production of 9,276MW of electricity by 2015. The figure is more than double current power production. She also said the government will promote energy saving measures and her Awami League-led administration would implement the long-stalled Rooppur nuclear power plant to boost power generation. Hasina admitted that the country was "suffering" due to the power shortage and, as on previous occasions, she attributed the crisis to the previous BNP-led government and the interim government that followed. Calling on the public to have patience, the prime minister said her government would require at best two years to resolve the severe power shortage in the country. "People have voted us to power with high hope and aspiration. We are not sitting idle," she said. Detailing future power plans, she said: "By 2015, the government and the private sector will be producing 9,276 megawatts of electricity." "This year 360MW will be added from the public sector, and 342MW from rental plants," she said. "In 2011, another 1120MW will be added from the public and 50MW from the private sector. In 2012, the public sector will install plants totalling 325MW and the private another 644MW. "The next year 725MW will be added by government initiatives and 1050MW from the private sector. "In 2014, the public sector will add another 720MW and private another 600MW. "Both sectors will add a further 1300MW each in 2015," the prime minister said. "By December 2012, Bangladesh will also be able to import 250 mega watts of electricity from India," she said. The prime minister said the power agencies of Bangladesh and India had signed memorandum of understanding to connect the distribution lines of the two countries. "We will implement the Rooppur nuclear power plant too with Russian assistance. We are in negotiation with the Russian government in this regard," she said. Hasina also urged people to utilise the potentials of renewable sources of energy including solar and wind. "A section of my office is run by solar power. People can also utilise its potentials," she said. Maximum power generation on Sunday was 4011MW against a peak demand of 5400MW. The country's 45 power plants have a total generation capacity of 5491MW. The Awami League government's current term will end in early 2014. bdn
