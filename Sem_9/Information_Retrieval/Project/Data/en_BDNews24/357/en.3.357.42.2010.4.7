 Narsingdi, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)A 210-megawatt unit of Ghorasal power plant resumed production on Tuesday, but a security guard died from injuries sustained in the previous day's fire that had forced the unit to shut down. "The unit became operational on Tuesday afternoon," executive engineer Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com. A committee was also formed to probe into the causes of the fire at the country's largest power plant. The fire ignited Monday noon as a cable of one of the units became disconnected. Firefighters from Polash put out the fire after 30 minutes. Security guard Solayman, 30, severely injured in the fire, was sent to Dhaka Medical College and Hospital burns unit on Monday and succumbed to his injuries early Tuesday morning.

They were asked to submit the report by three days. In addition to the fire, two units of the plant with a combined capacity of 265 MW are currently closed due to forced maintenance. "Unit 4 of the plant, which is currently undergoing maintenance, will also be resumed soon," executive engineer Zakir Hossain said.
