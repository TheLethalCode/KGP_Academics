 AUGUSTA, Georgia, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Golfing greats Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus launched the 74th US Masters on Thursday while Tiger Woods was poised to make his highly anticipated return to competition later in the day. Watched by a packed gallery under clear skies, four-time champion Palmer and six-times winner Nicklaus hit the ceremonial first shots at Augusta National's par-four opening hole.

With a record television audience likely to be watching his first competitive round in one of sport's biggest events this year, Woods will play the first two rounds in the company of South Korean KJ Choi and American Matt Kuchar. Asked earlier this week if he felt ready to clinch his 15th major title after a lengthy break, Woods replied: "Nothing's changed. I'm going to go out there and try to win this thing. "A lot has happened in my life over the past five months, and I'm here at the Masters to play and compete. And just really excited about doing t
