 Dhaka, Apr 08 (bdnews24.com)-Construction activities caused the most number of reported workplace deaths in Bangladesh for the third year running according to a new report published on Thursday by a workplace safety organisation. The report, published by the non-government organisation Safety and Rights, shows that in 2009, 93 out of the total 265 workplace deaths involved construction workers  equivalent to 35% of the total. In 2008, the percentage was 38% and in 2007 it was 46%. In 2009, the manufacturing sector contributed 32% of the deaths, and the service sector 25% of the deaths. The report also states that 'electrocution' is the biggest cause of most workplace deaths. In 2009, electrocution resulted in 39 per cent of the total deaths  and has been the biggest cause of workplace fatalities in the last three years. The other highest cause of death was 'falls from height' which in 2009 caused 16 percent of fatal injuries. The NGO obtained information on the deaths through monitoring national newspapers. "Whilst the total number of deaths reported in newspapers is certainly much lower than the real number, it is very significant that in the three years we have monitored deaths, the construction sector consistently remains the most hazardous, contributing the most number of deaths," said Sekender Ali Mina, the programme director of Safety and Rights. "It is also of concern that electrocution is a high cause of deaths. Simple steps can be taken to remove the risk of fatal electric shocks, and it is shocking that so many workers die from this cause," he added. Amongst the manufacturing sector, the most number of deaths took place in ship-breaking, rice mills and garment sectors. The report, which is being launched on Thursday at an event at which the Minister of Labour and Employment, Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain is attending, sets out a series of amendments to the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 which the NGO says would improve workplace safety and reduce the number of deaths and injuries. The government recently set up a tripartite body  comprising government, employer and employee representatives  to advise it on changes to the 2006 Act. The report states that in each of the last three years, over 90 percent of workplace deaths involved male workers, with the highest number of deaths taking place amongst workers aged between 21 to 30. Amongst the legal reforms proposed in the report are a new duty on occupiers to provide information, instruction, and training on safe methods of work. The report says that this is a central duty set out in a number of key International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and is common in legislation in most developing and developed countires throughout the w
