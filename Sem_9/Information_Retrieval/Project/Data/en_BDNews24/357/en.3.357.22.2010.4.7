 AUGUSTA, Georgia, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six-time champion Jack Nicklaus said the time was right to join four-time winner Arnold Palmer for the ceremonial first tee shots at this year's Masters starting on Thursday at Augusta National. "When I was first asked about it, I was still playing," 70-year-old Nicklaus, who last competed at the Masters five years ago, told reporters on Tuesday. "So I didn't. I had no desire to do that."
