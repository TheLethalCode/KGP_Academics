 RIO DE JANEIRO,April 07 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rains kept pummeling Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday as officials in Brazil's second largest city scrambled to restore transit after 96 people were killed by landslides and floods.

In January, at least 76 people died in flooding and mudslides in Brazil's most populous states of Rio, Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais.
