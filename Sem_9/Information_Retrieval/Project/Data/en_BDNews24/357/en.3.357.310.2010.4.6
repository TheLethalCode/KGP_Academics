<TITLE> Govt seeking to legalise overseas workers in Malaysia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  The government is trying to address the situation of Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia whose status has become illegal, overseas labour minister said on Tuesday. "It would be better to legitimise those who are there, rather than sending new ones," expatriates welfare and overseas employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said. Blaming previous governments for "spoiling" the Bangladeshi labour market abroad, the minister said that agencies had previously sent more labourers than were asked for. Hossain said over 6 lakh workers migrated to Malaysia during FY 2007-08 but labour exports to the Southeast Asian nation had stopped now. The major labour markets for Bangladeshi workers are Saudia Arabia and Malaysia, the minister said. "But the two countries are no longer interested because some unscrupulous agencies have sent more workers than needed." "The previous governments did not address the issue duly which has led to the present deadlock," he alleged. The minister was speaking at a briefing programme for Bangladeshi physicians and nurses bound for Libya at Hotel Sonargaon. The programme was hosted by manpower agency Ajur Bengal, which is sending some 350 physicians and 250 nurses to Libya. Of them, a team of 70 doctors and nurses are scheduled to fly on Wednesday. The physicians and nurses are supposed to work there at government hospitals under the Libyan health ministry. The salaries of the physicians will range between Tk 48,000 and Tk 1.65 lakh while the nurses will draw between Tk 35,000 and Tk 48,000 along with other benefits. The minister said the government was making drastic moves to have workers released who were detained in different jails abroad. "The prime minister's visit to Saudi Arabia has created a new possibility of labour exports." Stressing on the need for workers' training, he said, the workers get into trouble in many countries as most of them are untrained.
