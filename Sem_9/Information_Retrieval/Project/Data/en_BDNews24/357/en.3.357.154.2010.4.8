<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  An expert has warned that the Bangabandhu bridge might be damaged in the next couple of years from a change in the direction of the flow of the river Jamuna.. They were speaking at a seminar on "Riverbank Erosion Prediction 2010", organised by the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGGIS) on Thursday. "The river flow might move towards the right and if it does the right side of the bridge could be under pressure," CEGIS executive director Giasuddin Ahmed Chowdhury said. This is because the foundations of the bridge could be eroded. He said unless precautionary measures are taken right now, the bridge could be seriously damaged, he said. Nazneen Akhter, senior professional of CEGIS, also said that in 2010, the rivers Jamuna, Padma and Ganges will erode over 1665 hectares of land, including 8km of roads. CEGIS deputy executive director Mominul Haque Sarker added that, as a result, 60,000 people will become homeless. He however said that the extent of loss could be reduced if measures were taken in time. Water resources secretary Sheikh Mohammad Wahiduzzaman said the government will take all the required initiatives to prevent erosion and flooding. Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, who was supposed to attend the programme as the chief guest, was not present. b
