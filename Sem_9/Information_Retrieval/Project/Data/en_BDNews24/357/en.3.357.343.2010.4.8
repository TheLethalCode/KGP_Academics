<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 08 (bdnews24.com)  It is not possible to conduct the trial of war criminals by only one party only. The comment was made by ASM Abdur Rab, head of his faction of the Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal. At a discussion organised by Sahaj Katha, a monthly magazine at the Dhaka Reporters' Unity on Thursday he urged that all the political parties should come together in this issue. Answering a question he said that during the Liberation War in 1971 several Jamaat leaders including Golam Azam, Motiur Rahman Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed helped Pakistani military. "There are evidences not only in Bangladesh but also in the international media." The government will form an investigation agency, a prosecutors panel and a tribunal to try the crimes against humanity and war crimes in 1971. The JSD leader said that they also wanted punishment of the war criminals. "But it would not be right to make it a political issue." He cautioned the government saying that the tribunal must remain above all debates in order to have credibility.
