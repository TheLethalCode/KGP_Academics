<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 07 (bdnews234.com)  Bangladesh and India have agreed to establish a joint forum to conserve the Sunderbans' environment, the largest mangrove forest in the world. Dr Hasan Mahmud, the state minister for environment and forest, also said the forum would work to make the Sunderbans one of the new "seven wonders". "The joint forum will be formed before next September after completing necessary discussion and formalities," he said. Dr Mahmud, who had recently returned from a trip to India, said that India has already sent to Bangladesh a proposal and that the environment and forest ministry would be responding positively after discussing it with top officials. The trip to India had been arranged to engage India in efforts to secure a place for the Sundarbans, which is shared by the two neighbours, in the world's new list of seven wonders. Mahmud said securing Sundarbans' place in the new wonders' list would need an additional 150 million votes, which is hard for Bangladesh alone to collect. He said India had not earlier been involved in the campaign for the Sundarbans. "But now it have joined the campaign. Non-government organisations and civil society members also agreed to play a strong role." The minister said inhabitants of 72 villages surrounding the Sundarbans would be engaged in efforts to save the forest and its resources. "They will be engaged in a social forestry programme. Conserving a forest like the Sundarbans is not possible with government efforts alone," he added. The state minister also attended a seminar on climate change and had meetings with Indian central environment minister, Joyram Romesh and West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb and members of provincial ministry.
