 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet on Monday approved extending the use of 'speedy trial tribunals' for a further two years to allow for quick trials of crimes including extortion, vandalism and mugging. UPDATE The government made this decision even though the Awami League had opposed its introduction when it was originally enacted in 2002 describing it as a "black law". The Law and Order Disrupting Crime (Speedy Trial) Act 2002 was enacted by the previous BNP government for an initial two year period so that trials could take place quickly in cases of serious crime. Subsequently, it has been extended by a further two years on an additional three occasions. In 2002, the Awami League  when it was in opposition - strongly protested the passage of the Act, terming it a "black law containing coercive and oppressive elements". At the time the party stated that, "It is a bad law and intended to jeopardise the country's legal system gagging people's voice. It will make the judicial system a farce, subjecting people to harassment and repression." The current extension of the Act will expire on Apr 9. The government will issue an ordinance on the matter if the passage is not possible during the current parliament session, Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, told a briefing after the cabinet meeting. Under the Act, a special court is required to dispose of a case within 90 working days of the matter being transferred to them. A further 30 working days can be granted if it has not been completed in that time. An aggrieved person is entitled to appeal to the High Court against a judgment of the Speedy Trial Tribunal within 30 days of the ruling. Monday's cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, also approved in principle the draft of Bangabandhu Krirashebi Kalyan Foundation Law 2010 the press secretary said. It also gave final approval to the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council Act-2010 and the Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation Restricted Areas and Special Tourism Zones Act-2010, he said.
