<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday ordered five leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami to surrender to lower courts within nine weeks. The five include Jamaat's ameer, Motiur Rahman Nizami, and nayeb-e-ameer Delwar Hossain Sayeedi. The order came in response to two charges of hurting religious sentiments by comparing Nizami with Muhammad (SM). The court also ordered the government not to arrest or harass the five individuals before expiry of the 9-week time period. A bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque gave the orders following an anticipatory bail hearing on the two cases filed in Khulna and Rangamati. The others accused in the case are Dhaka metropolitan Jamaat ameer Rafiqul Islam Khan, Dhaka South Islami Chhatra Shibir president AFM Yahiya and Shibir's former president Shafiqul Islam Masud. One of the cases was filed by Shahjahan Farouqi, khatib of Rangamati's Kalabagan area mosque, on Mar 24. Another case was filed the next day by Chowdhury Md Raihan Farid in Khulna. The cases were filed after Dhaka City Jamaat amir Rafiqul Islam Khan compared Nizami with the prophet at a meeting of Islami Chhatra Shibir on Mar 17. Several newspapers on Mar 18 quoted Khan as saying that the prophet in his lifetime was "tortured, falsified and conspired against" and "the same is happening in the case of Nizami". On the basis of news reports, Bangladesh Tariqat Federation secretary general Syed Rezaul Haque Chandpuri filed a case in Dhaka Magistrates Court on Mar 21. The accused in that case also included Jamaat ammer Motiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, executive committee member Delwar Hossain Sayeedi and the chief of Jamaat's Dhaka Metropolitan (South) unit ASM Yahia. But Nizami and Sayeedi were not present at the meeting. More cases were filed in Rangamati, Chandpur and Lalmonirhat. 'CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY' The court also asked the government to inform whether the case against Sayeedi for murder, rape and arson in 1971, filed in Pirozepur on Sep 8, will be included in the 'crime against humanity' trials within Sunday. At the same, it awarded anticipatory bail to Sayeedi until Sunday. The hearing for the defendants was conducted by Abdur Razzak while deputy attorney general Mohammad Sohrawardy stood for the state. bdnews24.
