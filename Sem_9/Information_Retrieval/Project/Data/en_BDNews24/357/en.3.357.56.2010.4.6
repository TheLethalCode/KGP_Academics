<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  Residents in the capital's Mahakhali area blocked a road for an hour demanding water supply resulting in heavy traffic congestion. More than 400 people took position in front of Titumir College road with pitchers and buckets at around 11am, Gulshan police chief Kamaluddin told bdnews24.com. The demonstrators alleged that they have not been getting water supply for the last four days, he said. They lifted their blockade after getting assurances from the water supply authorities for a quick solution. Officials sat a meeting with the representatives of the demonstrators at the WASA office, the police official said. Badda residents had organised a half-hour blokade for the same reason last month. The water crisis in the capital is increasing due to frequent load-shedding.
