 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's exports to Europe rose by 6.3 percent to 5.8 billion euros (1 euro ~ Tk 93) on the back of ready made garments in 2009 although Europe's global imports shrank by 23.4 percent compared to 2008. In contrast to Bangladesh's performance, Europe's imports from least developed countries also shrank by 23.2 percent according to an EU update. EU ambassador Stefan Frowein said that Bangladesh had performed well despite the recession at a briefing on EU-Bangladesh trade on Monday. He said Bangladesh's RMG exports to EU grew in 2009, when other exporters like China, India and Vietnam saw negative growth. The UE envoy said Bangladeshi T-shirts had become a brand in the European market. Bangladesh also attained growth in exporting footwear, leather goods and bicycles to Europe, he added. Frowein said Bangladesh's economy was on a good footing thanks to RMG exports and remittance inflow. "But this money is not being used in development. People are spending the money in purchase of house and cars." Suggesting diversification of the country's export basket, he said shipbuilding holds much prospect. Shipbuilding can be Bangladesh's second largest export sector, he said. EU trade adviser Zillul Hye Razi, however, said the country's export of jute, tea, ceramic and plastic goods and vegetables, to Europe fell in 2009. b
