 Bhola, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain has warned that voting will be suspended at any centre that has problems. He also cautioned the government officials that negligence during the by-polls set on Apr 24, would not be tolerated. Sakhawat reminded them, "During the election all the officers are under Election Commission." "Anyone being negligent will be suspended immediately," he added. He also said that if any candidate calls for a meeting without prior information then they will be prevented. He was speaking at a meeting of district level officials at the office of the deputy commissioner regarding the preparations of Bhola-3 (Tozimuddin and Lalmohon) by-poll Friday. The commissioner has ordered the police superintendent to increase police patrol in the minority and set up police camps if necessary. EC has taken all necessary measures to make the elections free and fair. A committee has been set up with two judges, said Sakhawat. He said it would start working from April 11. Every union of the constituency will have two EC representatives from April 19 to observe elections and the commission will take decisions on the basis of their report, he added. Voting in 12 risky polling centres will be recorded on video, said Sakhawat. The commissioner will visit 5 of the risky centres of Tozimuddin upazila on Saturday. bdnews
