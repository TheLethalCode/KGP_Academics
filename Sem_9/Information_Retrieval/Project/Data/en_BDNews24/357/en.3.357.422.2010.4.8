 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has brought a further allegation that Awami League candidate standing in the Bhola-3 by-election has violated the electoral code of conduct. It alleged that AL candidate Nurunnabi Chowdhury Shaon used a government rest house, held a meeting at a prohibited location, and had attacked a BNP meeting, all of which it claimed were in breach of the electoral code of conduct. "We have informed the Election Commission and the local returning officer but they haven't taken any action yet," BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told a press conference on Thursday. A BNP delegation met chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Apr 5 and informed him of the allegations. Huda assured them of taking required steps but no action appears to have been taken, the BNP official said. Another BNP delegation went to the commission last month to hold talks on the election. "The government is using the local administration to make way for its candidate to win the elections," Ahmed said on Thursday. "Attacks have been made so that our candidate loses the election," He said the AL candidate had used the rest house located at Lalmohan as part of his election campaign. This is a direct breach of code of conduct, Ahmed said. He also alleged that the AL candidate had held an election campaign at the Lalmohan sadar crossing although the EC had prohibited this. He also alleged that Shaon's supporters had obstructed people from joining a meeting held by BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed and had attacked a workers' rally resulting in the injury of many workers, the BNP official said. He reiterated his party's demand that the army should be deployed in the by-election scheduled to be held on Apr 24.
