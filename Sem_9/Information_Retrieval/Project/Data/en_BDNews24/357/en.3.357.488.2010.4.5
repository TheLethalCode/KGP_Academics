 Dhaka, Apr 05 (bdnews24.com)  BCL activists of Dhaka University's SM Hall seized a motorbike and beat up its rider on Fuller Road on Monday noon. Activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League, student wing of the ruling Awami League, accused that Ruhul Aziz was being reckless because a BCL activist was slightly hurt in the leg and Aziz was about to park his bike. This caused a group of BCL activists belonging to SM Hall general secretary's faction to beat up Aziz. They also snatched his mobile phone. A teacher of the university who saw the incident rescued Aziz and took him to DU medical centre where Aziz was given first aid. SM Hall's BCL general secretary, Anwar Hossain, told bdnews24.com that it was because a reckless rider had injured Farhad Hossain that his friends detained Aziz. He claimed that the accident had broken Farhad's leg. Anwar said that the motorbike was in the SM Hall garage and would be returned if contacted through the university authorities. When Aziz and his guardians went to the Shahbagh Police Station to file a case, the police refused to register their complaint. But sub-inspector Nasim denied the allegation. He said that he had asked Aziz and his parents to come later in the evening. "We will register the case as soon as they come in the evening."
