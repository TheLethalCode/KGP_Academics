 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com) --- BNP has threatened to wage a strong movement on Thursday against the government if it fails to resolve the utility crisis soon. The party's senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir issued the warning as he was speaking at a demonstration hosted by BNP's associate body Jatiyatabadi Swechchhasebak Dal at Muktangan on Thursday. The demonstration was held to protest against electricity, water and gas crisis across the country. "The government has failed to resolve electricity, water and gas crisis over the past 15 months," he said. Alamgir said that the main opposition was still letting the government off easy with its peaceful processions demanding power, water and gas. "But we will launch a strong movement if the government fails." The processionists carried empty pitchers, lanterns, and broken gas stoves in their hands as symbol of protest portraying the government's failure to provide power, water or gas. The BNP leader alleged that irrigation projects in the rural areas were being hampered greatly because of load-shedding. Alamgir slammed the prime minister's statement at the conclusion of the fourth session of the current parliament. "We are apprehending that the prime minister is damaging diplomatic relations with Saudi Aarbia by her irresponsible statement." "The fate of two million Bangladeshis staying in Saudi Arabia has become uncertain through such statement," he said. Prime minister alleged in parliament that the BNP had sent a letter to Saudi Arabia asking it to interfere in the trial of war criminals. Quoting a Bangladesh Bank report, the former state minister for agriculture said, "A current report of Bangladesh Bank stated that investment in Bangladesh had dropped by 70 percent." "Overseas employment has also gone down," he said adding that the countrymen were passing their days in great hardship.
