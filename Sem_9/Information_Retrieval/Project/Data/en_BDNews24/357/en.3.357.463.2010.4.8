<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 08 (bdnews24.com)  The government should be capable of completely resolving the prevailing power crisis across the country by 2015, prime minister Sheikh Hasina said on Thursday. Hasina said her government has initiated a number of short and long-term projects intended to solve the problem. Bangladesh is aiming to produce 9,026 MW of electricity by 2015, which the prime minister claimed would be enough to provide power supply throughout the country. Hasina was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the 17th biannual council of Bangladesh Economic Association at Osmani Memorial Auditorium. About the development of the rural poor, Hasina said, "We have subsidised the agricultural sector this year, just as we did in previous years, despite repeated opposition from the donors." She also said that had her party Awami League come to power in 2000, the country would now be more developed. Hasina claimed that AL could have won the elections in 2000 had it been willing "to sell out her country's resources". She, however, did not provide any further details on who was supposed to have offered to bring her to power. She welcomed the association's decision to set up the Dhaka School of Economics and announced that the government would donate a piece of land for this purposes on the outskirts of Dhaka. The General secretary of the association Abul Barakat, and Dr Ashraf Uddin Chowdhury, convener of the convention committee also spoke on the occasion.
