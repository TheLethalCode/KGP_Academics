<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court ordered the police on Wednesday not to torture the Bashundhara boss when questioning him. The court ordered law enforcers not to "physically or mentally torture" Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Ali Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam. Shah Alam is expected to be questioned in connection with the murder of Ahmed Hossain, commissioner of Dhaka's ward70. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain gave the order on Wednesday after hearing a petition filed by the chairman applying to stay a notice from the Detective Branch which had requested him to attend its office on Apr 11 for questioning. The court refused to stay the notice but said that Ali Akbar Sobhan will have to attend the DB office  but specifically stated that no physical or mental torture can be carried out during questioning. It also ordered interrogators not to ask any question the answers to which might subsequently be used against him in the case. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam assured the court that Alam will not be harassed in any manner during the questioning. The petition hearing was conducted by Fazle Noor Taposh on behalf of the petitioner. He said, "Police issued this notice only to harass and torture Shah Alam. Mahbubey Alam, who represented the state, responded by saying that, "Shah Alam has been called to verify the information given by Nazimuddin chairman, who funded the murder." Md Abu Tyeb, an adviser to Bashundhara's public relations, told bdnews24.com on Apr 1 that there was no way Shah Alam could have been involved with the murder. "He has no connection with the dead person." He said such statements were ill-motivated, baseless and completely false. Ahmed Hossain, commissioner of ward 70, was shot dead on Feb 9 at Alubazar, in front of Bara Masjid. The police have already arrested Shahidul Islam Biddyut in relation to the case. Kawser Ahmed and Shubhadda Union chairman, Md Nazimuddin were arrested on the basis of Bidyut's confession  both of whom are still in police remand. bdnew
