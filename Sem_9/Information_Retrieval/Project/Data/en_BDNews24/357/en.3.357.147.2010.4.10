 Shamim Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com) -- Water continues to be scarce around Dhaka city, with the Water and Sewerage Authority continuing to blame the power crisis. The worst-hit areas are the older parts of the city, including Sutrapur, Dayaganj, Narinda, Shakhari Bazar, Dholaikhal, Bongshal, Jatrabari, Mugda, Basabo, Badda, Mirpur and Mohammadpur. Residents of the areas said they are experiencing very short supplies of water from morning till night everyday. In some areas there is no water the whole day, they said. Most of the areas under Kotawali thana, including Shakhari Bazar, Goalnagar, Ashoke Lane, Ramakanta Lane and Jindabazar have been severely affected. "The WASA pipeline runs dry before noon. A very small amount of water is available in the afternoon," a local resident Moin Khan told bdnews24.com. Local people said WASA water is very smelly in Doyaganj, Dholaikhal, Royshaheb Bazar, Koltabazar and Rokonpur. Koltabazar resident Syed Ripon said: "The water is so smelly that we cannot use it. We've to buy water at Tk 10-15 a gallon to meet our everyday needs." The water crisis is also grave in Suntrapur, Narinda and Begumganj areas. A Sutrapur resident Saidul Hasan said the pressure in the pipes is very low. "The water available is not enough even just for cooking. Many residents are compelled to carry water from Narinda area." Sikkatuli, Aga Sadek Lane and Mahattuli under Bangsal area are also suffering from the crisis for the last two weeks. Lalbagh residents said they are not getting supply of water after noon. People in Kamrangirchar now depend on tube-wells which they have installed themselves. Jatrabari, Shanirakhra, Dania, Rayerbagh, Merajnagar and Mohammadbagh dwellers have been suffering from the water shortage for the last couple of days. Merajnagar resident Amanur Rahman said water pipes remains dry the whole day. Though some water is supplied at night, it is very smelly and people are falling sick from using it." Mugdapara, Manda, Basabo and Mayakanlon have also been badly hit by the shortage. People were seen in long queues at the WASA pump station at Mugdapara. Housewife Taslima told bdnews24.com that she spent 2 to 3 hours collecting water from the pump. The people in Mirpur Shah Ali and Rupnagar areas, where residents took to the streets demanding more water, are still going without water for days at a time. Paikpara, Shawrapara and Taltola are no exception to the situation. Local resident Abdur Rahim said: "Some water is available, but only at night. Though the amount is not much, we are somehow surviving the day with it." Water shortage is acute also in Kaderabad Housing, Adabar, Shekher Tek, Jafrabad, Noor Jahan Road and Salimmullah Road areas. Residents said the situation is getting worse as every day passes. The water crisis has been a boon for some people. Water vendors are doing a brisk business - selling a gallon of water at Tk 8-15 from rickshaw vans. Vendor Rois Mollah told bdnews24.com he was selling water in Dholaikhal area and earning Tk 300-400 a day. The crisis is also disrupting delivery of services at hospitals and clinics. Shahidul Islam, doctor at Mitford Hospital's dentistry department, told bdnews24.com that they cannot perform operation due to short supply of water. WASA VERSION WASA chairman Golam Mostafa said the frequent load-shedding is mainly responsible for the crisis. He said against the daily demand for 2.2 billion litres of water, WASA can produce 1.9 billion litres if uninterrupted power supply is ensured. "But we cannot utilise our full production capacity due to lack of power." The chairman told bdnews24.com that WASA and Bangladesh Army were working together to tackle the situation. "I hope the crisis will go in one month when there is rain." He said there are 546 pumps under 10 zones, including one in Narayangaj. Of them, 293 are run by generators. He hoped the remaining pumps could be run on generators by August or September. b
