<TEXT>
 MONTCOAL, West Virginia,April 09 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mine rescuers retreated for the third time early on Friday after thick smoke foiled their efforts to reach four coal miners missing since the deadliest US mine disaster in a quarter-century. Rescue teams reached one of two chambers where the missing miners may have taken refuge but found it unused, diminishing hopes that the men might be found alive, officials said at an early-morning news conference. The search crews were unable to reach a second refuge chamber, which officials have said would represent the miners' only chance of survival after an explosion on Monday at the Massey Energy killed at least 25 miners. "We had a long night and a difficult night," said a somber West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin. "We ran into some problems and pulled the teams out for their own safety." Kevin Stricklin of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration said, "It was a very tough decision to pull the rescue teams out and not put them in harm's way." The latest rescue mission, consisting of two eight-man teams, was mounted at about 12:30 a.m. (0430 GMT) on Friday after noxious gases cleared sufficiently to allow teams back into the mine. Rescuers were forced on two previous occasions to leave the mine because of an explosive mixture of methane, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Officials now will focus on pumping nitrogen into the section of the Upper Big Branch mine near the refuge chamber that the rescue teams were unable to reach, hoping to reduce the oxygen content of the air and controlling the fire. HOPE CAMERA WILL SHOW SIGNS OF MINERS They plan to drop a camera into a bore hole about noon (1600 GMT) near the targeted rescue chamber in an effort to see if the chamber has been used. Officials still hope to find the miners alive and have not switched to a pure recovery mode that would focus instead on the removal of at least 18 bodies that have been in the mine since the explosion. "What we didn't expect was smoke from a fire and that changed what we had to do," Stricklin said. Stricklin said it is now unlikely that rescuers will reach the second rescue chamber within the 96 hours that they had promised waiting families. The chambers are equipped with enough food, water and oxygen to keep 15 people alive for 96 hours. Officials are clinging to hope that the facility can sustain four miners for longer. Manchin addressed the media after breaking news of the latest setback to miners' families. "I don't need to tell you how difficult this is, especially for the families," he said. The first funerals for seven miners whose bodies were recovered are scheduled for Friday. US President Barack Obama ordered mine safety officials to report next week on the cause of the explosion, the Upper Big Branch mine's safety record and what steps the government could take to prevent a similar disaster in the future. Questions have risen about Massey's safety record and U.S. mining laws. Massey, the largest coal producer in the Central Appalachia mountain region, has defended its record, saying its accident rate hit an all-time low in 2009. The Upper Big Branch mine had three fatalities since 1998 and a worse-than-average injury rate in the past 10 years, according to federal records, which also show it has been cited for more than 100 safety violations already this year. It was cited for two mine safety violations on Monday, which mining authorities said were unrelated to the blast. Shares of Massey closed up about 2 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday after losing more than 10 percent since the accident. Analysts predict long-term financial health for the company. The Upper Branch mine blast is the nation's deadliest mining disaster since 27 miners died in a fire in Utah in 1984. West Virginia was home to the worst US coal mine disaster, when 362 miners died at the Monongah mine in 1906. In 2006, 12 West Virginia miners died at Sago mine after an explosion left them trapped underground for two da
