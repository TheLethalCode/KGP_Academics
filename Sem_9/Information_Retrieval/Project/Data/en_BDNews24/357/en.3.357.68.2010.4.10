 Narayanganj, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  At least one man died and 10 others were injured in a clash between workers of two garment factories and outsiders at Kanchpur industrial area in Narayanganj on Saturday. The deceased was identified as 25-year old Zia, one of those who apparently attacked the garment workers. Earlier, at around 7.30am workers of the Opex Group demonstrated demanding a pay raise, overtime allowances and other provisions. Officer in charge of Sonargaon Police Station said that the demonstrators from Opex garments blocked the Dhaka-Sylhet highway but it lasted only 10 minutes due to successful police intervention. He added some workers from Sinha Textiles joined the demonstrators. At around 8.30am, a businessman affiliated with the Opex Group's operations, Shamsul Haque, his son Zia along with a number of people attacked the garment workers apparently to discourage them from making their demands. Shamsul trades in bit and pieces of clothes that are regularly produced as refuse at the garment production floor. Zia, who was critically injured during the clash, was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital and died there around noon. About 40,000 people work in Sinha Textiles and Opex Group. Former BGMEA president Anisur Rahman Sinha is chairman of the Sinha-Opex group. Angry workers blocked the highway again for about 20 minutes at 10.30am. While the police managed to convince the workers to withdraw from the roads, they continued their demonstration. The workers threw Shamsul into a pond at around 11am from where the police rescued him. At around 11:30am the workers calmed down. The workers have brought allegations that the owners have been ignoring their long standing demands of overtime, higher wages, earned leave and other provisions. The owners have declined to make any comment on this. But one official of Sinha Group told bdnews24.com requesting anonymity that the owner would settle the issue with workers through discussions. Yunus said that the situation was under control. No case was filed till noon, he added. bdnews
