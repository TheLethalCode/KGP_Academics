 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  Army personnel have begun from Wednesday morning to guard WASA pumps and assist in the distribution of water in Dhaka. Army personnel, who have been deployed in each of the zonal offices in the capital, will work in coordination with the water authority to deal with the current crisis, Golam Mostafa, chairman of the Dhaka Water Supply and Sewerage Authority, told bdnews24.com. There will be one commanding officer of colonel rank in each zonal office to lead the personnel, WASA authorities said. Army deployment was supposed to have come into force on Apr 1. Mosafa had earlier said that since there was water shortage throughout the city, to avoid untoward situation, the water agency would seek army assistance as they do every year. The problem wil be alleviated if rains come within a month, he said adding that the army would be withdrawn once the situation improved. There are 546 pumps under Dhaka WASA's 10 zonal offices which includes the one in Narayanganj zone, of which 293 are run by generators. The WASA chairman said that if all the pumps could be run by generators, without depending on the availability of power supply, the water shortage could easily be solved. He said that out of Dhaka city's daily water demand of 220, WASA could only provide 190 crore litres. b
