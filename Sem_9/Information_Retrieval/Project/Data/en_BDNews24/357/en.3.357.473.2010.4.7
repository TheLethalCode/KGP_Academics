<TEXT>
 Kishoreganj, Apr 06 (bdnews24.com)  The flood situation in the haors of Kishoreganj has deteriorated due to the onrush of upstream water over the last week. About 15000 hectares with standing boro crops at Itna and Mithamoin upazilas have been gone under water. Officials apprehend that it could mean the complete loss of 60,000 tonnes of paddy. Already 20 small and big dams have been breached under the pressure of strong streams. Paddy fields are becoming submerged by water leaking through the breached portions of dams. More than 50 haors, floodplains that go under during the monsoon, are supposedly under threat with farmers becoming worried about their standing crops . The farmers have taken their own initiatives to protect the dams and even patrol at night to detect breaches. Local public representatives apprehended that the boro production may be seriously hampered if the situation deteriorates and farmers would fall in hardship losing their only harvest of the year. but the district administration and the agriculture department claimed that the loss would be negligible. The flood situation has turned for the worse at Joysiddhi, Alongjuri, Limepasha, Pashkahnia and Chilni haors due to increasing waters in the Kalni, Dhaleshwari, Namakhara and Dubi river of Itna. In Mithamoin, Kawerjor, Kanchanpur, Dhaki, Charigram and Ghagra haors were in danger due to rising waters in Daira Ghorautta and Haturia rivers. A breach in the Joysiddhi dam, for protecting the harvest, was causing widescale submergence in the area. Md Moniruddin, chairman of Joysiddhi Union said that 9,000 acres of his area had gone under water as the dam broke. The boro paddy of Chilni also went under water as the dam had broken and farmers were compelled to harvest their half ripe paddy. A local villager, Mahbub said, "Everything has gone under water in the untimely floods." Hundreds of farmers are working day and night to protect the dam at Laimpasha village. Local villager Salim Mia said, "Water in the Namakara River is increasing so much that if the dam breaks 10,000 acres of boro harvest will go under water." It was seen that farmers of Pachkanhia village were repairing the dam on their own initiatives. Aminul Islam, the upazila chairman of Itna Upazila Parishad, said, "10,000 hectares of paddy in my upazila washed away in this untimely flood. Boro is the only harvest that these low lands have." The local farmers will starve if their harvests wash away, he said. "They will have to live on borrowed money." He said with anxiety that none of the governments have taken any steps to help farmers from such floods in the haors ever since liberation. Mithamoin Upazila Parishad chairman Kamrul Ahsan Shahjahan said, "More than 5000 hectares of harvest went under water in my upazila." Md Rafiqul Islam, an official of the agriculture extension department admitted that boro crops of the lowlands had indeed gone under water. "The situation is not so serious. It will not hamper achievement of the boro production target." Deputy commissioner Md Shah Kamal said, "I visited the areas. A lot of lands have been damaged. The Upazila Nirbahi Officers have been asked to remain alert and take proper steps."
