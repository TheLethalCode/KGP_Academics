 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  A senior BNP leader has criticised the government for failing to deal with the power crisis, for its comments about the BNP in parliament and for extending the speedy trial act. UPDATE "We don't see any likelihood that the government will fulfil its election pledge to generate 7,000 MW power by 2013 for the national grid," senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told a press conference on Wednesday at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. Alamgir also condemned prime minister Sheikh Hasina's concluding speech at the fourth session of parliament on Monday. The speech was 'irresponsible' and 'unconstitutional', he said. The prime minister confused people by giving false statements in the House. She vilified the opposition in order to divert people's attention from the current crises of power, water and gas, Alamgir said. He also criticised the prime minister for terming the opposition a 'thief'. "This language is unbecoming of parliament," he said The BNP leader said the prime minister was irresponsible for mentioning the BNP and Saudi Arabia together in relation to war crimes trial. He was referring to Hasina's allegation that the BNP had sent a letter to Saudia Arabia to try and "foil the war crimes trials." He feared that this statement might jeopardise diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia, he said "Some 2 million workers are currently working in Saudi Arabia. We are getting their remittances. "Such comments by the prime minister might have an adverse impact on the country. We expect a statesman like attitude from her." Alamgir also said that the ruling party was committing criminal activities in Bhola-3 constituency ahead of the by elections which are due to take place on Apr 24. "We have informed the Election Commission of the matter but it has not taken any action yet." He reiterated the party's demand for army deployment in the constituency. The BNP leader criticised the government's extension of the Speedy Trial Tribunal by another two years. "Awami League termed it a 'black law' when it was in opposition," he said. The Act first became law when teh BNP was in government. Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque, who also attended the press conference, alleged that the BNP was not allowed to speak from the floor in the last session. "If we are not allowed to speak in parliament it is uncertain whether we will join the next budget session." Farroque also claimed that none of the 96 adjournment motions placed by the opposition were accepted.
