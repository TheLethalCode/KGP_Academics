 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  Ain O Salish Kendra, a legal aid and human rights organisation, has submitted documents and information to the investigation team, investigating war crimes committed during 1971. A seven-member delegation led by executive director Sultana Kamal handed over the documents to Abdul Matin, chief of the investigation agency on Wednesday. ASK was responding to the call by the investigative agency for anyone to provide it evidence which they considered might be useful in its task. "Over the years ASK has been collecting a lot of information about war crimes. In particular we have interviewed a lot of woman, some of whom were raped, others had husbands were killed and others were evicted from their land." Sultana Kamal told bdnews24.com "ASK has also been listing names of Razakars in its bulletin," she added. One document she said the team were particularly interested in receiving was a copy of the original ordinance that set up the Razakar force. "The investigation team said that they did not have a copy of this document," Kamal said. "The ordinance sets out the responsibilities of the Razakar, their jurisdiction and how much they would get paid. " The team told her that ASK could be helpful to the Tribunal in process of investigation, prosecution and trial, Kamal added. The government on Mar 25 formed a war criminal tribunal, investigation and prosecution teams under the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973. The investigation agency has already received evidence from the War Crimes Fact Finding Committee the Liberation War Museum who were formally asked for evidence.
