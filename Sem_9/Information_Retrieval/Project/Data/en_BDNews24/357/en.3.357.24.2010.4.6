 Panchagarh, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com) The special BDR court in Panchagarh will on Wednesday be the first BDR special court to announce its verdict in relation to cases involving the Feb 25-26 mutiny. 29 members of the 25 Rifles Battalion have been accused of mutiny. The BDR director general, who chaired the court, set the date on Tuesday after hearing statements from both the accused and prosecution. The court began at around 8:30am. The 29 BDR members, accused of mutiny presented their statements orally and in writing, followed by the prosecutor Lt Col Sarajul Haque. Charges were pressed against the accused on Sunday. Seven of the 29 accused BDR personnel have admitted their involvement with the mutiny. On Monday, witnesses gave evidence for the prosecution, three of whom identified 18 of the accused from video footage. The February 2009 mutiny saw over 70 people brutally killed, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force. Rebellion also spread to other BDR outposts around the country. The BDR members at Panchagar are alleged to have fired about hundred rounds and blockaded Dhaka-Panchagar highway. On November 15, the government formed six special courts, including two in Dhaka, to try about 3,500 border guards accused in 40 cases around the country. In the event of a guilty verdict, the maximum penalty for rebellion under the BDR Act is seven years in jail. The six special courts are trying charges of mutiny, looting and arson. Allegations of murder will be tried separately in civilian courts. bd
