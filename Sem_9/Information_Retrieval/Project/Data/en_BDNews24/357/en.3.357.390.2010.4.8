 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Thursday ordered the police to look into the sedition case against Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka to ascertain if the complainant had government approval. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate AKM Emdadul Huq in his order said it was mandatory to have prior approval of the government before filing a sedition case. He ordered the officer in charge of the Paltan Police Station to investigate if the plaintiff had the approval and set June 6 for report submission. Freedom fighter Siddiqur Rahman filed the case with Dhaka's Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court on Monday for describing Ziaur Rahman as the declarer of independence and the country's first president. Rahman in his complaint said that the BNP leader in a party meeting on Mar 27 said that Ziaur Rahman, the party founder, was not only the declarer of independence but also the country's first president. "Through this statement, the defendant defied Bangladesh's independence and sovereignty and attempted to create political animosity amongst the public, which is an act of sedition," the complaint said. A hearing will take place later in the day, Rahman's lawyer PK Abdur Rob told bdnews24.com. During the war of independence in 1971 a government in exile was formed on Apr 10. Seven days later, this government took oath in Bangladesh's Meherpur district naming Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the first president. After independence the constitution set up a parliamentary government and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became prime minister. The country's second president was Abu Sayeed Chowdhury, and the third president was Mohammad Ullah Chowdhury. In 1975, Sheikh Mujib introduced presidential government  under BAKSAL - and became the fourth president under one party government. Sheikh Mujib, along with most of his family members, was assassinated on Aug 15, 1975 and Khandaker Mustaq Ahmed then became the country's fifth president on Aug 20, 1975. Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem became the sixth president on Nov 6 in the same year. Ziaur Rahman became the seventh president on Apr 21, 1977. However, according to the BNP, Ziaur Rahman became Bangladesh's first president when he made, what the BNP consider to be the first declaration of independence on 26 Mar 1971. At the beginning of the announcement, he is supposed to have said that he was speaking as the "head of state". bd
