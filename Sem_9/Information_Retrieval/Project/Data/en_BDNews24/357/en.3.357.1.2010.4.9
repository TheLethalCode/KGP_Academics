 Dhaka, Apr 09 (bdnews24.com)  Islami Bank and Ibn Sina Trust are involved in financing fundamentalists, state minister for law Qamrul Islam alleged on Friday. The state minister was speaking at a discussion organised by World Peace and Human Rights Organisation. He said these two institutions should be brought under strict government surveillance. "Or we will have to face grave danger." He said, "We do not want to shut them down. But it is high time the government investigate their source of income." There have long been allegations against these two institutions that they are essentially organs of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami. A number of top officials of these two organisations are also among top Jamaat leaders and policy makers. Islami Bank's chairman was Jamaat's central leader Mir Kashem Ali. He is at present a member of the managing body of the Ibn Sina Trust. "BNP started bombing across the country after the Awami League government had come to power in 1996 to destabilise the government," Qamrul said blaming main opposition BNP for instigating fundamentalism. "In 2001, the BNP-Jamaat government tried to thwart the progress of cases filed in this concern. Fundamentalism could not have taken root without direct patronisation from the government." Qamrul said he hoped that fundamentalism would be entirely uprooted from the country if the highest court restores the constitution of 1972. He accused former home secretary Omar Faruk of being involved in the 10 truck arms haul and instigating Bangla Bhai, top leader of the militant outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). "Faruk was Jamaat's top leader. But the four-party alliance took no punitive actions against him," Qamrul said. Faruk retired in 2006. At present, the 10 truck arms case is under investigation. bd
