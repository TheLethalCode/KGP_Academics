<TEXT>
 David Bergman Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  The capital's water authority will have to wait until August or September at the earliest for generators to power 200 of its water pumps, the Dhaka WASA chairman has said. Dhaka WASA officials say lack of generators is one of the main reasons for the city's existing water as hot weather is giving rise to greater electricity demand to power fans and ACs, which in turn is leading to more frequent load shedding. There are 546 pumps under the Dhaka Water Supply Authority, but almost half  253  do not have back-up generators, making them non-functional during the frequent periods of power outage in the capital. WASA chairman Gholam Moustafa told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that WASA has completed a tender, and the results will go to the government's purchase committee for approval. He said the cost of the generators will be around Tk 55 crore. No date has yet been set for the purchase committee meeting  which is chaired either by prime minister Sheikh Hasina or finance minister AMA Muhith. Moustafa said that "even if the purchase committee agreed today to allow us to go ahead and purchase the generators, WASA would not get the generators for 4 or 5 months as they must come from outside Bangladesh". Prof. Qazi Matin Ahmed, a hydrologist and groundwater specialist at Dhaka University's department of geology, said that WASA should have started the tender procedure much earlier. "The electricity shortage happens every summer. This kind of situation we are seeing today was foreseeable. We should have had generators in place now." Earlier, on 31 March, Moustafa had told bdnews24.com that the water shortage could "easily be solved" if it had more generators. On Wednesday, however, Moustafa said that generators were "not the full solution to the problem". "Using electricity from the Power Development Board is the best solution, since generators cannot run for a full 24 hours and they do not always allow pumps to work at their full capacity." However, he accepted that generators "would help"
