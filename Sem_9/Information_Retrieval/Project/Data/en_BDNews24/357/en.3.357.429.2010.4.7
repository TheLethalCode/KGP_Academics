<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government is failing to deal with the power crisis, a senior BNP leader said on Wednesday. "We don't see any likelihood that the government will fulfill its election pledge of generating 7,000 MW power by 2013 for the national grid," senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told a press conference at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. It is clear that they won't be able to reach the target, he said. Alamgir also condemned prime minister Sheikh Hasina's concluding speech at the fourth session of parliament on Monday. The speech was 'irresponsible' and 'unconstitutional', he said. The prime minister confused people by giving false statements in the House. She vilified the opposition to divert people's attention from the current crises of power, water and gas, Alamgir said. He also criticised the prime minister for terming the opposition a 'thief'. "This conduct is unbecoming of parliament."
