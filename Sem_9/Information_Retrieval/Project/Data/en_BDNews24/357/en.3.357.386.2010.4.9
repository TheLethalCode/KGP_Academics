 Brahmanbaria, Apr 09 (bdnews24.com)  Traffic resumed on the Dhaka-Sylhet highway at midday on Friday after about four hours. Angry locals had blocked the route protesting against incessant power outages giving rise to serious traffic congestion. The agitators withdrew the blockade upon police assurance of conveying their demands to the authorities concerned. Assistant superintendent of police Sanjay Sarker told bdnews24.com that traffic began to operate at about 1pm. Residents of Bijoynagar upazila showed up on the highway at around 9am carrying banners and placards. Traffic was brought to a standstill on both sides of the highway causing tailbacks about 10 km-long, said witnesses. The protesters said power supply to the area had come down to just about 4 hours per day. They said students were having problems in their studies and the boro crops were also being damaged due to inadequate irrigation. Qazi Haris Chowdhury, one of the protest leaders, threatened further action if the power crisis was not solved "within the next three days". bdne
