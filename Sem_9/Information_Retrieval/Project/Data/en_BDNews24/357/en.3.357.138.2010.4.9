 MONTEVIDEO, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/lg/Reuters) - Defenders could ruin Lionel Messi's plans to shine at the World Cup because they will focus on marking the Argentine who is out of this world, Uruguay captain Diego Lugano said. The Fenerbahce central defender who faced Messi twice during the South American qualifiers told Reuters in an interview that Messi would only stand out at the South Africa finals if Argentina do well.
