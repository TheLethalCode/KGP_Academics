<TEXT>
 Bagerhat, April 9 (bdnews24.com)  Transport workers have clashed with Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and police at Bagerhat central bus terminal Friday morning. The incident is said to be in retaliation of the elite crime fighters, RAB, beating up a bus driver earlier. RAB alleged that the bus driver had creased a RAB-8 microbus when overtaking. The workers assaulted a RAB patrol team. Workers vandalised a RAB-8 microbus and forcibly detained the law enforcers for nearly one hour. A team of RAB 6 from Khulna and a contingent of Bagerhat police reached the spot upon receipt of information. It was at this point that a clash ensued when the police and RAB tried to rescue the detained RAB members. Bus service from that terminal remained suspended during that time. At least one policeman has been injured in the clash. Sheikh Anwar Hossain, treasurer of Rupsha- Bagerhat Motor Workers Union told the journalists that a Bagerhat-bound creased a microbus while overtaking it near Badamtali. He said that RAB members came to the bus terminal and beat up the driver Alamgir Hossain (38) severely. Major AKM Kamruzzaman of Khulna RAB 6 said that after the bus hit the microbus carrying elite force members, it was signalled to stop but the driver did not. As the microbus suffered damage, RAB members came to the terminal and demanded compensation from the driver, he added. He also said that the driver of the bus did not pay any compensation but started to gather workers and started arguing. At one stage more than hundred workers started to throw bricks at the RAB personnel and damaged the microbus, he added. He also said that the workers detained the elite force members. Shahidul Islam Shahin, officer in charge of sadr police station said that in the ensuing clash between the police and workers constable Matiar Rahman (50) was injured. He said the situation was under control though no case had been lodged. A meeting between transport workers, owners, law enforcers and the local administration resolved that the microbus would be repaired and offenders punished through the legal process. bdn
