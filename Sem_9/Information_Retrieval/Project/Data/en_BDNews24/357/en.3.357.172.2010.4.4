 Kishoreganj, Mar 4 (bdnews24.com)----The water level of different rivers around Kishoreganj haors areas is rising daily because of flash floods upstream. The Boro paddy on 12,000 acres of land in the low lying areas of Mithamoin and Itna Upazilas has already gone under water. It is feared that if the situation persists for one or two more days, vast tracts of land with Boro paddy will go under water. Mithamoin Upazila executive officer Sadekur Rahman said, "Crops on 7000 acres of land in Daki, Charigram, Fulpur and Kanchanpur areas have been inundated with water as the water level in Daira and Duvi rivers have risen significantly." "Though the farmers are trying to protect their crops by making embankments, it will be of little use," he said if the water level increases. The worst affected areas are Joysingi, Alongjuri, Danpur, Mriga and Upazila Sadar. in addition, 200 acres of crop land have have been submerged as the embankment of Rangamatia Canal at Sutar Para in Karimganj Upazila developed cracks in several areas. Kishoreganj deputy commissioner Shah Kamal and district agriculture extension officer on Saturday visited different areas of the haor region. NETROKONA In Netrokona, the 29 km haor protection embankment at Char-Hijada in Mohanganj Upazila is under threat because of the negligence of Water Development Board (WDB), local people are claiming. The protection embankment has not been repaired over the past years, with local people alleging that the fund allocated for this purpose has been misappropriated. If water continues to swell, the embankment will be completely destroyed, the local people said Local agriculture officials say that if the embankment does fall away, 20000 hectares of land will be totally destroyed. The dam protects the largest haor in Netrokona but some parts of dam have reduced in height by five to six feet due to lack of repair over the last three years. Executive engineer of WDB in Netrokona Harunur Rashid said, Tk 24 lakh was allocated for the repair of the dam but he could not say how the money was used. Thousands of farmers are trying hard to protect the embankment through their own endeavors. Mohanganj Upazia chairman Shahid Iqbal said, "How will the people of the haor survive if they lose their main crops - Irri and Boro?" The rise in the water level in Donu river has triggered inundation of some areas of Madan Upazila. Crops on around 2000 hectres of land at Talarkhal, Loharkhal, Chatal, Bhuiyarghat, Asha, Vengurkona, Chakua, Barkhali, Heli, Chapri, Maghan, Ghatua,Kadamsri, Govendasri, Uchitpur, Uliati of Fatehpur union parishad have been flooded. bd
