 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion have arrested a suspected member of the Pakistan based militant outfit Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) in the capital's Chankharpul area, a RAB spkesperson said on Thursday. Twenty-five year old Mobassher Shahid, alias Mubin or Yahia, was arrested at around 11:30pm on Wednesday night, Md Kamruzzaman of RAB's legal and media wing said. He told bdnews24.com that Yahia was a Pakistani citizen and had admitted that he was an active member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, staying in Bangladesh for the last five years. His main purpose was to recruit members for the banned militant outfit, Kamruzzaman alleged. He also claimed that Yahia is skilled in using various types of arms. Yahia is said to have told the elite force that he came from Karachi. Bangladesh police arrested at least four suspected LeT operatives last year, in Chittagong and Dhaka, who the law enforcers alleged were plotting to attack the Indian and US embassies here. At least one of the suspects, arrested in Dhaka, was also alleged to be a recruiter for LeT in Bangladesh, police said. LeT, founded in 1990 to fight Indian rule in Kashmir, is blamed for the Mumbai attacks in November 2008 that killed 166 people. It is also blamed for the late 2001 attack on Indian parliament. It was banned in Pakistan in 2002. bdne
