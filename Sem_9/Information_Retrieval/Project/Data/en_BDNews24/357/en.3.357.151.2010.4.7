<TITLE> Woods ready to step into the unknown at Augusta </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AUGUSTA, Georgia, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All the hype and speculation about Tiger Woods will begin to ebb away when the scandal-hit world number one makes his long anticipated return to professional golf in Thursday's opening round at the US Masters. The 14-time major champion has not competed in almost five months since his spectacular fall from grace and no-one, Woods included, knows how he will fare in his first tournament back. Woods enjoys a huge comfort level at Augusta National where he has triumphed four times but his emotional state of mind is likely to be an unknown factor on the golf course this week. Although by some distance the greatest player of his generation, he has not competed since winning the Australian Masters on Nov 15 following startling revelations about his serial philandering. Woods is scheduled to tee off in the second-to-last group with fellow American Matt Kuchar and South Korean KJ Choi on Thursday when hordes of fans and media will be closely monitoring his form. Fellow American Phil Mickelson, a twice champion at Augusta, expects the game's leading player to cope with the distractions and intense scrutiny. "From a player's point of view, we expect to see the same player that we have always seen," left-hander Mickelson told reporters on Tuesday. "I don't think anybody out here will question his ability to perform at the highest level, even though he has not competed in however many months. PLAYING WELL "I don't think anybody expected him to play well in the 2008 US Open," Mickelson added, referring to the 14th major title won by Woods despite severe knee pain and a double stress fracture in his leg. "He had not touched a club in a while, nor played in a while and he was injured. And yet he came back and he won." Three-time major winner Padraig Harrington felt the unravelling of Woods's private life would have no long-term influence on his golf career, and perhaps not even this week. "I think most players would see what went on in Tiger's life as his personal side, which has no real bearing on his golfing life," the Irishman said. "Now, we don't know what sort of bearing it's going to have in the short term. He could be incredibly stressed." Asked if he would be surprised to see Woods contending on Sunday, Harrington replied: "No. He's favoured to win the tournament and those guys who set the odds know a lot more than I do. "I would not be surprised at all if he was contending and I would not be surprised if he played better golf than ever, but there's obviously a doubt to that. We will only be able to find that out on Sunday evening." If Woods performs well at Augusta, media industry watchers have predicted the US television audience could exceed more than 20 million viewers. BIGGEST EVENT CBS news and sports president Sean McManus recently said this year's Masters would be "the biggest media event other than the Obama inauguration in the past 10 or 15 years." While the return to golf by Woods has totally overshadowed anything else likely to happen this week, several other players have the credentials to win the prized Green Jacket. Experience is always a prized commodity at Augusta National and Ernie Els, who has posted six top-10s at the Masters, along with Mickelson and Harrington, are almost certain to be in the title hunt. South African Els, a three-times major winner, is also one of the hottest players in the game having won twice in his last three PGA Tour starts. "He's been playing some incredible golf ... and to see him cap it off with a couple of wins is exciting for the game," Mickelson said of the smooth-swinging Els. "He is a big name and big draw and people want to see him play well and people pull for him to play well." Other likely contenders on an Augusta layout running fast and firm after several days of intense heat include Britons Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, American Steve Stricker and double US Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa. Long-hitting Angel Cabrera of Argentina defends the title he won last year after a nerve-jangling playoff with Americans Kenny Perry and Chad Camp
