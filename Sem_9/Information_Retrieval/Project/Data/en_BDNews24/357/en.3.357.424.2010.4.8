 MANCHESTER, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Wayne Rooney re-injured his ankle on Wednesday after making a surprise return as Manchester United were knocked out in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Bayern Munich. The England striker, who damaged ligaments in his right ankle in the first leg against Bayern last week and was expected to be missing for three weeks, lasted 55 minutes before going off with more damage to the joint.

"The fact is he was unlucky because he went over on it again. He had a couple of challenges on it and I don't think he got much protection."

Ferguson denied that he had rushed Rooney back into action too early -- a decision that could have implications for United's final five games of the season as they try and win a fourth consecutive Premier League title.

Rooney, who missed United's costly 2-1 home defeat by Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday, is now unlikely to play against Blackburn Rovers this weekend. His injury caused widespread concern in England, with even British Prime Minister Gordon Brown referring to it, because Rooney's fitness is seen as vital to England having a successful World Cup in South Af
