<TITLE> BNP: govt can only prosecute 'war crimes' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has alleged that the government is deceiving people by holding trials of "crimes against humanity" instead of "war crimes". "The government has diverted from its election pledge of holding trials of war criminals," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told a meeting on Saturday. However, the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973, under which the government has set up a tribunal to prosecute those who have committed crimes during the time of the 1971 war, allows both these offences to be prosecuted. Moreover, the term "war crimes" is often used as short hand to describe all crimes that are committed in the time of war, including "crimes against humanity". Despite this, the BNP has repeatedly tried to argue that the government's use of the term "crimes against humanity" rather than "war crimes" is significant. "The government has formed war crime tribunals but now they are going to hold trials of crimes against humanity," Mosharraf said. Mosharraf said on Saturday that his party would endorse the trial of the "real war criminals" The BNP leader said it was possible to hold trial for the offence of "crimes against humanity" under criminal law. However, Bangladesh's penal code does not include any offence of "crimes against humanity." "The government is holding the trials out of political vengeance," he said. It is holding the trial to divert people's attention from the current crises of power, gas and water. Mosharraf said the BNP would launch a movement across the country after the divisional rallies were finished. The first divisional rally was held in Chittagong on Mar 29 and the second one will be held in Khulna on Apr 18.
