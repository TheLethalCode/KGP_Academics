 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)Pakistan high commissioner Ashraf Qureshi has rejected on Wednesay a comment made by the law minister Shafique Ahmed that Islamabad had changed its position on the trial of war criminals. On Tuesday, Law minister Shafique Ahmed, following his meeting with Qureshi, told the media that "Pakistan had shifted from its previous position on the trial of war criminals". Commenting on media reports of Ahmed's comments, Qureshi told bdnews24.com that his country was maintaining its previous stance on the trial of war criminals. "We wish to dispel this erroneous impression which is contrary to the facts. It has always been a consistent stance of Pakistan that the war crimes trial is an internal matter of Bangladesh as it only relates to the Bangladeshi nationals," the high commissioner said. He added that Islamabad was satisfied with an earlier remark by foreign minister Dipu Moni that, "Bangladesh will try its own citizens involved in war crimes and that the government-planned trial of war criminals will not, by any means, affect Bangladesh's relations with Pakistan". Dipu Moni had made this comment after the newly appointed high commissioner Qureshi met her on Feb 25.. Qureshi on Feb 25 had told bdnews24.com that "Our government's position is there in the 1974 tripartite agreement between India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and that addresses the issue." He is also reported to have said at the time that the trial of Bangladeshi war criminals was "an internal matter of Bangladesh and Pakistan will not interfere". The tripartite agreement was signed on April 9, 1974 by the then Bangladesh foreign minister Dr Kamal Hossain, Indian external affairs minister Saran Singh and Pakistan's state minister for defence and foreign affairs Aziz Ahmed. The agreement on normalisation of relations among Bangladesh, India and Pakistan says, "The Pakistan government condemned and deeply regretted the crimes that may have been committed". Commenting on Qureishi's statement, Shahique Ahmed told bdnews24.com on Wednesday that he did not think that "Pakistan had ever before talked in such a clear way. "We have often been told that Pakistan had been trying to interfere in the trial of war criminals and that is why I said to the media that Pakistan had changed its position", he said
