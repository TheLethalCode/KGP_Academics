 BARCELONA, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Barcelona are planning to focus on their customary possession game while Champions League opponents Arsenal will rely more on mental strength to see them through, their coaches said Monday. Barca produced some sparkling play in the first hour of last week's quarter-final first-leg in London to take a 2-0 lead before the Gunners fought their way back to 2-2 to give themselves a chance of eliminating the champions in Tuesday's second leg at the Nou Camp. "Both teams are good at keeping the ball and the one that has the ball for longer will have more chances to win the match," Barca coach Pep Guardiola told a news conference. "We are going to try to be ourselves, to keep the ball," he added. "We will try to dominate a team that wants to dominate."

Midfielder Andres Iniesta, who has been out for around 10 days with a thigh strain, was given the all-clear Monday and Guardiola included the Spain international in his 19-man squad. Wenger predicted his players would have to work harder to win back the ball than they did in the first leg. "You know that when you don't have the ball you need everybody on board, especially against Barcelona," he said. "We have to make the pitch smaller. The heart of the battle will be in midfield.
