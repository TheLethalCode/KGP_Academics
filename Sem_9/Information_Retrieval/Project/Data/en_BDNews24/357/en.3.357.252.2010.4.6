 TEHRAN,Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran urged Russia on Tuesday not to bow to Western pressure over the sale of a Russian missile defence system to the Islamic Republic which could protect its nuclear facilities from air strikes. A cleric in the Revolutionary Guards again warned Iran would hit back with missiles fired at "the heart of Tel Aviv" if it were attacked by its arch-foe Israel. Russia is under intense Western pressure to distance itself from Iran in a dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme, but has refused to rule out delivering the S-300 anti-aircraft system.

Washington is seeking support from Russia for tougher U.N. sanctions against Iran over its nuclear programme, which the West suspects is intended to produce nuclear weapons. Tehran says it is for power generation only. Israel has hinted it could attack Iran in an effort to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons. Iran has threatened to retaliate for any attack by firing missiles at Israel, which is believed to have the Middle East's only atomic arsenal. "If Iran's enemies target the country with their missiles, before the dust settles, the dust of our missiles will be seen in the heart of Tel Aviv," the semi-official Fars news agency quoted cleric Mojtaba Zolnour as saying. Zolnour, who has made similar statements before, is a deputy of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's representative in the elite Guards fo
