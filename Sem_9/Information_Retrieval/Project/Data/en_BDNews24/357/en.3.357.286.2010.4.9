 By Al Amin Dewan Chittagong, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  Once the pride of Chittagong University students, the charming 40-minute train commute from the port city to the campus through stunning countryside has turned into a nightmare. The train journey has for years been a subject of interest and at times, envy. Students would bring along their friends from other universities to show off the shuttle. Newspapers have carried features on the ride. But all that has changed in a matter of months Chittagong University students have all but stopped travelling on the train after two murders  one student was killed while waiting at the city station and another on his way to the station to catch the campus shuttle. Political science student ASM Mohiuddin was murdered at Sholoshohor just before the train left the station on Feb 11. In the second incident, marketing department student Harunur Rashid Kaiser was killed on Mar 29just metres from the station. Police suspect both murders were linked to student politics, in particular the aftermath of violence at Rajshahi University campus in February that spread across the country. Students say they are scared of travelling on the train since the killings. The scene from just a few weeks back, when hordes of students would regularly crowd the Battala and Sholoshohor rail stations to catch the shuttle, has changed entirely. The shuttle service now has a deserted look. "We're terrified," Tapu Raihan, a journalism student told bdnews24.com. "We don't know who the next target is." "I used to take the shuttle regularly myself. But I stopped after the killings." Many students have switched to Tori, a local mode of transport that plies the city-campus road route. Liton, a conductor on the route, told bdnews24.com that their passengers have increased hugely, particularly at night. "The fear is not unnatural after the killing of two of their fellow students," assistant proctor Chandan Kumar Poddar said. "We've asked the students to be careful while travelling by the train at night," he told bdnews24.com. He also said there were plans to deploy policemen in all compartments of the shuttle at night. But for now, the once much-loved shuttle has been all but abandoned. bdnews24
