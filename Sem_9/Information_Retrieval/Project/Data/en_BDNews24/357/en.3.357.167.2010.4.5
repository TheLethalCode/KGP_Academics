<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 05 (bdnews4.com)  Weekly magazine 'Shaptahik' on Monday filed a case against pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders including its central president Mahmud Hasan Ripon on charges of assaulting one of their reporters. Mohiuddin Niloy, chief reporter of the magazine, filed the case with the Shahbagh Police Station. Rezaul Karim, chief of Shahbag police, said Niloy sued 10-12 BCL activists including central president Ripon and Dhaka University's SM Hall unit president Sajib Jahan Saikat. Karim told bdnews24.com that necessary actions would be taken immediately. On Mar 25, 'Saptahik' published a report entitled 'Chhatra League Circus: Eden College, an additional attraction'. The report contained allegations that BCL leaders took money from candidates seeking admission to Eden college. On Sunday night, DU BCL activists assaulted 'Saptahik' reporter Anis Rayhan and another weekly newspaper 'Budhbar's reporter Ahmed Fayez. They are undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Niloy, the complainant, told bdnews24.com that Anis and Fayez were going to DU campus from the Shahbag cross-section. BCL SM Hall unit president Saikat, riding a motorcycle, stopped them on their way and hurled derogatory words, Niloy said. At one point, Saikat snatched their identity cards and attacked them along with some 20-25 other BCL activists, the plaintiff said. Ripon and Saikat were not available for comments. bdne
