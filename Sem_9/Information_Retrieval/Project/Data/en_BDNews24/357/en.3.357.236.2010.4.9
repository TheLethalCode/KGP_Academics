<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan election officials tallied votes on Friday from a parliamentary poll widely expected to hand President Mahinda Rajapaksa's ruling alliance an easy victory amid lacklustre turnout. The poll on Thursday was the first since Rajapaksa in May declared victory in one of Asia's longest-running and bloodiest wars, defeating the separatist Tamil Tigers and returning the entire island to government control after 25 years. Rajapaksa has already turned the victory over the Tamil Tigers into a new six-year term, and he banked on a resurgent economy and political momentum to give his United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) a legislative majority. Although a record 7,620 candidates competed for just 225 seats in parliament, election monitors estimated turnout to be between 50-55 percent. If confirmed by the Electoral Commission, that would be the lowest turnout of all 20 national polls since 1947, when then-Ceylon elected its first parliament to prepare for independence from Britain the next year. Nearly 80,000 police and soldiers guarded polling stations across the Indian Ocean island, where polling went smoothly despite some reports of sporadic violence. The Electoral Commission was expected to announce results on Friday, and few Sri Lankans had any doubt that Rajapaksa's ruling coalition would win. STABILITY EXPECTED Rajapaksa and his allies are aiming to win 150 seats, or the two-thirds majority he needs to change the constitution. He has not made public his intended amendments save possibly creating a bicameral legislature and changing the electoral system. The opposition had vowed to block him, saying it would threaten democracy by increasing his already vast powers. Some speculate he would change the charter to allow himself a third term when his expires in 2016. Kusal Perera, a political analyst with the Centre for Social Democracy in Colombo, said the opposition's defeatist tone may have contributed to the low turnout. "They were saying that the government was getting ready to manipulate the vote. That made the people think that there is no point," he told Reuters. Rajapaksa, 64, in January won a victory over retired General Sarath Fonseka, his former war ally whom the opposition backed after he split with the president. He accused Rajapaksa of stealing his victory, but monitors noted no evidence of it. After the vote, the government arrested Fonseka and charged him with politicking in uniform and improper procurement in two courts-martial. Though still in military custody, he ran for parliament as he proclaimed his innocence. Friday's results will remove a final big question mark for investors eyeing Sri Lanka as an upcoming frontier market, and provide clarity on Rajapaksa's plans for $42 billion economy targeting 6.5 percent growth this year. The government has said it will address a high fiscal deficit, the country's persistent economic problem, through reforms under a $2.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan. Bond dealers say demand for high-yield government securities should rise after the vote, having grown more attractive with upward pressure on the rupee currency . The Colombo Stock Exchange extended gains into record territory on Thursday, and is up 165 percent since January 20
