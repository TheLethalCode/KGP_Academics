 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has set Apr 13 as the date it will rule on whether to quash the barge-mounted power plant graft case lodged against prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Md Abu Bakar Siddiqui set the date on Wednesday after hearing ACC lawyer Khurshid Alam argue that the case was filed following due process. He had referred to Sunday's Supreme Court ruling that declared that the graft watchdog had filed and investigated cases in a lawful and appropriate manner. The Anticorruption Commission (ACC) filed the case against Hasina and four others on Sept 2, 2007 during the military backed caretaker government regime alleging that the accused has taken Tk 3 crore in 'donations' to Bangabandhu Memorial Trust as part of approving a contract setting up three barge mounted power plants. The case alleged that the accused had colluded with Wartsila Power Development to install the three power plants instead of selecting the lowest bidder Barrister Fazle Noor Taposh, who argued for Hasina, said that the filing of the case, investigation and approval of the charge sheet was not done properly. The case was filed to harass Hasina, he said. Hasina filed a petition challenging the legality of the case on Oct 28 2007. In July of the following year the High Court stayed proceedings in the case. bd
