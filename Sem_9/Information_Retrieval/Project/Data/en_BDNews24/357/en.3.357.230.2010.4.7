<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com) -- Sachin Tendulkar's (45) departure due to exhaustion led to a sensational batting collapse of Mumbai Indians as Chennai Super Kings thrashed them by 24 runs in the Indian Premier League on Tuesday, reports PTI. Chasing a modest target of 166, Mumbai were cruising all along before Tendulkar left the field in the ninth over at 62 for one after making a 28-ball 36 which contained six fours. But once he left, Mumbai lost way with wickets falling like nine pins and they could make just 141 for nine in 20 overs as their five-match winning streak was snapped at the packed MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. Chennai produced a superb bowling and fielding display and turn on the heat on the Mumbai Indians once Tendulkar left the field under hot conditions. All the CSK bowlers took wickets with Thilan Thushara and Ramachandran Ashwin being the most successful with two wickets apiece by conceding 16 and 22 runs respectively. Sudeep Tyagi, Doug Bollinger, Shadab Jakati and Suresh Raina chipped in with a wicket each. Their fielding was also spot one with some fine catches, especially those of Thilan Thusara and Murali Vijay, besides saving runs to put pressure on the Mumbai batsmen. Earlier, electing to bat, Chennai made 165 for four with Matthew Hayden top-scoring with a 31-ball 35, while captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18-ball 31) and S Badrinath 22-ball 30 not out) making useful contributions. With Tuesday's win, their third on the trot, CSK are now at fourth spot with 10 points in 10 matches while Mumbai retained the top spot with 14 points from nine matches. Except for 45 by Tendulkar, who could add just nine runs after his return in the 15th over, and a late flourish of 23-ball 33 by Harbhajan Singh, the remaining Mumbai batsmen came a cropper with five of them failing to reach double figures. From 62 for one when Tendulkar left at the end of ninth over and till he returned to face the third ball of the 15th over after his side was 89 for seven, Mumbai lost six wickets from in 5.3 overs with the addition of just of 27 runs. Tendulkar returned in the 15th over but could add just nine runs after facing seven balls. His 35-ball 45 contained six fours. Harbhajan Singh made a late charge scoring a 23-ball 33 but it was too little too late as Mumbai Indians could score just 141 for nine. Mumbai made a steady start with Tendulkar continuing his sparkling form and finding boundaries at regular intervals. From 66 for one just before wicketkeeper batsman Ambati Rayudu was out in 9.5 overs, Mumbai were reduced to 89 for seven in 14.2 overs. They lost five wickets in the space 27 balls and addition of 23 runs. Rayudu fell five balls after Tendulkar left the field as he was foxed by a Suresh Raina delivery and Mahendra Singh Dhoni affected an easy stumping. With the asking rate over 10, Dwayne Bravo tried to force the pace but perished in the fourth ball he faced holing out to Thilan Thushara while trying to hoist Tyagi for just two. By then, Mumbai were 69 for three. Saurabh Tiwary, who has been consistent in the tournament, did not last long as he holed out to Matthew Hayden while trying a slog sweep off Jakati in the 12th over. Mumbai Indians' run chase almost ended in the next over with West Indian Kieron Pollard perishing for just five of six balls. Pollard, who has been disappointing with the bat in the tournament much against expectations, holed out to Murali Vijay off Ramachandran Ashwin while trying a big hit and MI were 85 for five when he was out. R Sathish and Ryan McLaren were out in the space of five balls which forced Tendulkar to come back in the 15th over. But the Mumbai captain did not remain long at the field as he fell to Thushara in the 17th over to virtually end his side's hopes with Vijay taking a fine catch at long-on. Thushara was stopped from bowling further for bowling his second above waist-high ball in the innings. Harbhajan then struck three sixes off Doug Bollinger only to be dismissed clean-bowled by the same bowler in the last ball of the match. Earlier, Mumbai Indians produced a disciplined bowling and fielding performance to restrict Chennai Indians to 165 for four. The table toppers, who have lost just one out of their earlier eight matches, did not allow the Chennai side to replicate their brilliant batting show in their earlier match in which they made 246 for five -- the highest IPL total. Most of Chennai batsmen got the start but failed to convert them into big scores. Mumbai bowlers got support from their fielders who did some fine work to deny runs to CSK batsmen. Chennai top order made a subdued start and last match centurion Murali Vijay was back at the pavilion by the fourth over as he dragged a Harbhajan Singh delivery on to his stumps for 14. The other opener Matthew was unusually quiet as Mumbai bowlers did not give him much chance to swing his bat and that meant Chennai were 35 for one at the end of fifth over. The home side picked up the tempo with one-down Suresh Raina forcing the pace. He hoisted Dwayne Bravo for a huge six in the ninth over but perished two balls later holing out to Shikhar Dhawan at deep midwicket for a 18-ball 23. After the halfway mark, Chennai were 85 for two and with wickets at hand they were looked set for a bigger total only to be pegged back by two wickets in two balls from Mumbai bowler Kieron Pollard. Dhoni, who came in at the fall of Raina, raised the scoring rate with some lusty blows but he was the third man to go as he mistimed a slow ball from Pollard who took a return catch. Dhoni's 18-ball innings contained four boundaries. Next ball, Hayden's uneventful innings ended as R Sathish took an easy catch at the long on to reduce the home side to 119 for four at the end of 14th over. Hayden's 35 came form 31 balls with the help of just two fours and a six. Badrinath (22-ball 30), who denied Pollard a hat-trict, and Australian Michael Hussey (15-ball 14), playing in his first IPL III match, failed to provide the final thrust, adding just 41 runs from the last five overs. Pollard, who has not been doing much with the bat much against expectations, was the most successful Mumbai bowler with two wickets for 27 runs from his four overs. Bravo and Harbhajan took a wicket
