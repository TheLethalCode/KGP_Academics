The delegation of BGMEA and BKMEA also asked for garment exporters be exempted from both the newly increased electricity tariff, and the minimum charge for having a gas connection which has to be paid even if do not use the gas. Muhith told reporters after the meeting that they would consider the issue of peak hour electricity and gas charges. "We however, made no commitment on the issue of the new electricity charges," he added. In early march the government increased electricity charges by an average of six percent. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedi told reporters that the finance minister assured the exporters that a package would be announced within two weeks. "We do not want to pay the hiked electricity charges, peak hour charges and a minimum charge for gas until the power situation is back to normal," he told reporters. The exporters made a series of other demands. They asked for bank loan facilities at 2 percent interest rate for importing generators and a withdrawal of VAT on house rents. The trade bodies also told the minister that the banks were charging higher interest rates on re-scheduled loans. "Banks are apparently charging more than the fixed 10 percent for loans that are rescheduled; we have asked Bangladesh Bank to look in to the matter," said Muhith. The meeting mainly focused on implementation of the second stimulus package announced in November, 2009, according to the finance minister
