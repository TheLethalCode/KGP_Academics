 Brahmanbaria, Apr 09 (bdnews24.com)  Angry locals barricaded the Dhaka-Sylhet highway in Brahmanbaria on Friday, protesting incessant load shedding and power outages in their area, and causing huge tailbacks on the major inter district route. Residents of Bijoynagar upazila showed up on the highway at around 9am carrying banners and placards. Traffic was brought to a standstill on both sides of the highway causing tailbacks about 10 kilometre-long, said witnesses. The protesters said load shedding was occurring in their area "more or less 20 hours in a day". They said students were facing troubles in their studies and crops were also being damaged for want of power for irrigation. Qazi Haris Chowdhury, one of the protest leaders, threatened further action if the power crisis was not solved "within the next three days". Assistant superintendent of police Sanjay Sarker told bdnews24.com that police were trying to negotiate a solution to the road blockade. bdnew
