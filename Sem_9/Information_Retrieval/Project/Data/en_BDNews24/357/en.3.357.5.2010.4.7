 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  An imam in Kolkata in India's West Bengal state has issued a fatwa against Pakistani cricketer Shoaib Malik for allegedly "dumping" Ayesha Siddiqui, who claimed to be his wife. Times of India reported that the imam of Tipu Sultan Masjid on Tuesday has called for the social boycott of Malik, both in India and Pakistan. "I will appeal to civil society in both the countries to boycott Malik. There is no reason why he should dump Ayesha Siddiqui," Imam Nuroor Rahman Barkati told a press conference. The former Pakistan cricket captain is in a legal mess in Hyderabad after his alleged first wife Ayesha filed an FIR against him for trying to marry Indian tennis star Sania Mirza without taking a formal divorce. Malik's passport has been seized and the Hyderabad police questioned him for close to two hours on Monday. The community leaders have rallied behind Ayesha who is in the midst of a marriage controversy. The clerics have clarified that they have nothing against Sania Mirza, but were angry with Malik. The Imam said the nikahnama was a sufficient evidence of a marriage. "Under Islamic law, a nikahnama can be issued only after the nikah has taken place. Since Ayesha has produced the nikahnama, the nikah must have happened," the Imam said. Malik at first denied that he was married, but later admitted it though he said that he had not met Ayesh
