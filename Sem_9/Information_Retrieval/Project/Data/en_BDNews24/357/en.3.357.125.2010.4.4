 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  The government has warned garment factory owners of stern action for violation of regulations related to setting up new factories. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku said on Sunday that factories violating the guidelines may in fact be shut down. He said that the government will force the owners to comply with the conditions prior to approval. "These would include provisions like two alternative sets of stairs, prohibition on any structures on factory roofs and compulsory fire fighting training for workers." The violators might face shutdown of their factories, he said. Earlier, the home ministry held a meeting with representatives of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Home minister Sahara Khatun, who also attended the meeting, said the 12 committees, relating to fire safety and prevention, that are somewhat inactive, will soon be revived. She said the government is stepping up efforts to deploy industrial police. BGMEA president Abdus Salam Murshedy requested the government to allow importing duty-free ambulance and fire fighting vehicles.
