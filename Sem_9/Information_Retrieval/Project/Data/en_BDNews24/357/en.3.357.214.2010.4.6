 Bhola, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)Countering the main opposition BNP, ruling Awami League held a press conference in Bhola on Tuesday outlining the BNP's previous criminal activities ahead of the by polls on Apr 24. At a press conference on Tuesday noon, the Awami League candidate Md Nurunnabi Chowdhury for Bhola-3 claimed that BNP activists on Mar 23 cut off a finger of Lalmohon municipality's AL publicity secretary. Nurunnabi also presented several incidents that took place during the BNP-led regime at the constituency. Nurunnabi's rival, BNP candidate Hafizuddin Ahmed at a press conference earlier on Monday alleged AL supporters had attacked BNP activists over the last few days. Some 40-50 BNP supporters were injured in those clashes, while the AL supporters were threatening the BNP activists in Lalmohon and Tajumuddin, Hafiz claimed. The BNP candidate, who lost to the AL MP Mohammad Jashimuddin, demanded army deployment during the polls, expressing his apprehension that the AL supporters could otherwise capture the voting centres. The EC declared the constituency vacant on Feb 3 as AL's Jashimuddin, a retired army officer, contested the 2008 general election before expiry of the stipulated waiting period after retirement from a government job. Jashim won the seat against BNP's Hafiz with a lead of 12,000 votes. bdnews
