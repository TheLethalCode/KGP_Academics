 BEIJING, Apr 7(Reuters) - China has an understanding with the United States for each to respect the core interests of the other, a senior Chinese diplomat said on Wednesday, calling for positive ties ahead of a Washington trip by China's president following a period of tension.

Ties between the world's biggest and third-biggest economies have also been ruffled by disputes over Chinese Internet controls, US arms sales to Taiwan, and Obama's meeting with exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. Beijing defines Taiwan and Tibet as "core issues" of its sovereignty, regarding self-ruled Taiwan is an illegitimate breakaway province, and condemning the Dalai Lama as a "separatist" for seeking self-rule for his homel
