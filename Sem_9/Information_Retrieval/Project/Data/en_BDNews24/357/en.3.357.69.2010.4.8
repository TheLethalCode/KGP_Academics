 Satkhira, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  Satkhira district administration has issued a "section 144" order on Thursday barring all meetings and rallies in the district town on Thursday. The order was issued in light of a planned Jamaat-e-Islami meeting that was to take place later in the day. The order, will remain effective for 12 hours starting from 6am, Satkhira sadar police chief Hashem Khan said. Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed was scheduled to attend a public meeting at the town's Shahid Abdur Razzak Park at 3pm. Muktijoddha Sangsad and Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee had jointly announced that they would stop him taking part in the meeting, alleging that Mojaheed was a war criminal. Enamul Haque, the head of a joint committee set up by the two organisations told bdnews24.com that "We won't allow Mojaheed to enter the town," Early on Thursday, police arrested 41 local activists of Jamaat and its student wing Shibir. Satkhira sadar police chief Hashem Khan said they were arrested fearing that they would disrupt the law and order situation. They will be released after the situation becomes normal, he said. Mohaddes Abdul Khalek, Jamaat chief of Satkhira district, alleged that his party men had been arrested without any reason. "We condemn such undemocratic action of the government," he said. Muktijoddha Sangsad brought out a procession in the town on Wednesday afternoon. Local leaders of Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Workers Party of Bangladesh, Chhatra League and Bangaldesh Samajtantrik Dal all took part in the procession. A Jamaat leader, preferring not to be named, had earlier said that they had taken permission from relevant authorities to hold the rally. bdnews24.com Khulna correspondent said that police on Wednesday night had barred Mojaheed's convoy at Khulna's zero point area at around 10:30pm when it was on its way to Satkhira from Khulna The Jamaat leaders were forced to return to Khulna after a half an hour altercation. Mojaheed told reporters that the police obstructed his convoy without any specific reason. He also alleged that police had behaved badly with them. The central Jamaat leaders left Khulna for Dhaka on Wednesday night, Jamaat's Khulna metropolitan chief Miah Md Golam Parwar said. Police, however, denied barring the leaders from going to Satkhira. Tanvir Haider Chowdhury, police superintendent of Khulna district, said that the Jamaat leaders themselves decided not to go to Satkhira on security grounds. "They returned as they were feeling unsafe," he said. He claimed that the police behaved properly with the Jamaat leaders. bd
