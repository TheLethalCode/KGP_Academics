 SINGAPORE, April 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil fell as the dollar strengthened on Tuesday, pulling back from an 18-month high near $87 reached a day earlier on data showing US economic growth is accelerating. The US services sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly four years in March and future home sales unexpectedly rose in February, statistics showed on Monday, bolstering hopes for a sustainable economic recovery and job growth. The reports sent front-month US crude to $86.90 a barrel on Monday, the highest intraday price since October 2008. On Tuesday, US.crude for May delivery slid 23 cents to $86.39 at 0235 GMT, while ICE Brent declined 35 cents to $85.53. US crude inventories probably gained for a 10th consecutive week last week, a Reuters survey showed. "I don't think that the fundamentals necessarily justify such a high price, but the underlying tone in the market remains very positive," said David Moore, Commodity Strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. "One big factor is that the US dollar is stronger in trading today and that has been an important influence on the oil price," Moore said, referring to the inverse correlation between the currency and crude. The dollar gained 0.3 percent against a basket of currencies on Tuesday. A stronger greenback renders imports of dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for buyers other than the US. Oil prices rose more than 8 percent in the five sessions to Monday, their steepest 5-day winning streak this year. There was no trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange on April 2 because of Good Friday. "It simply rose so quickly in trade affected by the Easter holidays that I suspect we are just seeing some correction from the very strong run-up in recent days," Moore said. Attention in the oil market was set to shift to US inventory statistics due out later on Tuesday and on Wednesday. Crude stockpiles were forecast to have risen 1.7 million barrels, a Reuters poll showed, while a 1.4 million drawdown was expected for distillates and gasoline supplies. The American Petroleum Institute will release its industry report on Tuesday, at 4:30 p.m. EDT (2030 GMT), followed by government figures from the US Energy Information Administration on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT
