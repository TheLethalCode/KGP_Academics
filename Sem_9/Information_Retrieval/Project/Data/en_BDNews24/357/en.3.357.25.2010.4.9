 SAN FRANCISCO, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US prosecutors charged a San Francisco man on Thursday with making threatening, harassing and obscene phone calls to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the debate over healthcare reform. Gregory Lee Giusti, 48, was arrested on Wednesday in San Francisco and made his first appearance in a federal court on Thursday. He remains in custody. Pelosi -- referred to in the complaint by her initials -- received at least 48 "obscene, harassing and threatening" calls from Giusti between February 6 to March 25 at her homes in Washington and San Francisco, her district office and her husband's office, said an FBI affidavit. The California Democrat played an important role in pushing through the legislation backed by President Barack Obama to overhaul the country's healthcare system. Pelosi told the FBI the caller used "extremely vulgar and crude language" during one call and told her, "When you go back to California, you won't have a home to go back to." One recorded message left on Pelosi's Washington residence said, "If you like your home in (Northern California), don't vote for the healthcare bill." When confronted, according to the FBI, Giusti wrote in a statement that he called Pelosi "a witch and said I did not like her pushing the healthcare bill down the peoples (sic) throat." Giusti was convicted previously in California of making telephone calls "with intent to annoy," according to the FBI. Conviction on a felony charge in the Pelosi matter could result in a prison sentence of at least two years and a $250,000 fine. Other lawmakers received similar threats as the healthcare bill was being debated. On Tuesday, a 64-year-old man in Washington state was charged with threatening to kill Democratic Senator Patty Murray because of her support of the healthcare legislation. Last week, a Pennsylvania man was arrested for threatening to kill the No. 2 Republican in the US House of Representatives, Eric Cantor, in a video posted on YouTu
