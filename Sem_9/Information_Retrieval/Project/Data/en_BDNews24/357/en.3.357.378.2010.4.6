 XIANGNING, China, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rescuers continued their search on Tuesday for 38 Chinese miners still trapped in a flooded colliery from which over 100 have been pulled alive after surviving more than a week eating bark and drinking filthy water. Officials said 153 miners were trapped in the unfinished Wangjialing mine in Xiangning, in the northern province of Shanxi, when water gushed in more than a week ago. At least 115 survivors were rescued late on Sunday and throughout Monday. "The most important thing is the safety of the 38 miners who are still trapped in the pit," provincial official Liu Dezheng told reporters late on Monday. "Our rescue teams are racing against time, using all the possible means and mobilising all possible forces to save them." The survivors clung onto life in the pitch black pit, eating bark to sustain themselves and taking small sips of the dank and dirty water that surrounded them, state media reported. It was rare good news for China's perilous coal mining industry, the deadliest in the world with thousands killed every year in floods, explosions, collapses and other accidents. Shanxi province is the heartland of that industry. Survivors were brought out from a platform, where rescuers had drilled a vertical hole last week. The hole ensured oxygen in the water-flooded pit while rescuers sent down bags of glucose. Most of the rescued miners were in a stable condition, but suffering from malnutrition, dehydration and skin infections, and 26 were in a "relatively serious" condition, the official news agency Xinhua said. Sixty were being transferred to larger hospitals in the provincial capital Taiyuan, the report added. Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao were "deeply worried" about the miners, the Xinhua report said. "The rescuers at the front must continue to foster the spirit of not being scared of exhaustion and to keep fighting, step up rescue efforts, and work all out ... to do whatever is possible to save the remaining miners," it cited them as saying. Workers are tempted into hazardous jobs in China's mines by wages that can be much higher than for many other jobs open to blue-collar workers and rural migrants. Strong demand for energy and lax safety standards have made China's mines often deadly places to work, despite a government drive to clamp down on small, unsafe operations where most accidents occur. The number of people killed in Chinese coal mines dropped to 2,631 in 2009, an average of seven a day, from 3,215 in 2008, according to official statistics. China has ordered the consolidation or takeover of many private mines. It says the shutdown of many of the most dangerous private operations has helped cut accidents. But the deadliest accidents are not limited to private firms. The Wangjialing mine was a project belonging to a joint venture between China National Coal Group and Shanxi Coking Coal Group, two of China's larger state-owned firms. "We demand the company get prepared for an investigation ... and provide real technical data and basic information for it," said Liu, the provincial offici
