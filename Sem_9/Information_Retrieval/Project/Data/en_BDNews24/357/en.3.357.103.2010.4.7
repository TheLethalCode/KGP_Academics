 BISHKEK, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five dead bodies are lying on the main square outside the president's office in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek after clashes between protesters and riot police, a Reuters photographer at the scene said on Wednesday. More than 5,000 protesters were gathered near the office, demanding President Kurmanbek Bakiyev step down. "There are five dead bodies lying on the square. There's a lot of blood," the photographer said. Kyrgyz opposition protests spread to the capital on Wednesday with riot police firing tear gas and flash grenades to try to disperse demonstrators. Political unrest has gripped Kyrgyzstan, an impoverished former Soviet Central Asian republic, since early March. The unrest is of concern to the United States, which uses a military air base in Kyrgyzstan to support its operations in Afghanistan. Russia also has a military base in Kyrgyzstan. The Bishkek protest began outside the main opposition office on the outskirts of the city. Some 200 protesters overcame a police attempt to break up the gathering, setting fire to police cars as they marched towards the city centre. The crowd, armed with iron bars and throwing stones, swelled as it marched on the president's office. Later, shots were heard outside the building. The opposition have been demanding that Bakiyev, who himself came to power in a popular revolt in 2005, tackle corruption and fire his relatives from senior positions. RIOTS SPREAD The riots spread from two provincial Kyrgyz towns where opposition protesters stormed government buildings on Tuesday and took a regional governor hostage in the town of Talas for several hours. In Naryn, a town in central Kyrgyzstan, about 1,000 opponents of the president took over the local government building, forcing the governor to flee, witnesses told Reuters. A crowd of between 3,000 and 4,000 protesters had gathered on the main square in Talas, a small town in a picturesque valley on the border with Kazakhstan. Witnesses said protesters, throwing stones, were attempting to storm the Talas local police headquarters on Wednesday, a day after rampaging through the regional government headquarters building, fighting off police and burning Bakiyev's portraits. "We will stay here until the end, no matter what the government does," Talas Kadyraliyev, a 45-year-old local opposition activist, told Reuters from the scene. The united opposition movement said more rallies were planned for Wednesday, saying it feared a broader crackdown would ensue as a result of the disturbances in Talas. Kyrgyz Prime Minister Daniyar Usenov said about 100 people were injured in the violence in Talas. "They are bandits, not an opposition movement," Usenov told reporters. "This kind of thing cannot be called opposition." Russia, the main regional power, called for restraint. "We have consistently urged that all disagreements -- political, economic and social -- are resolved by the existing Kyrgyz democratic procedures without the use of force and without harm to the citizens of Kyrgyzstan," Interfax news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin as saying. Last week, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Bishkek and called on the government to do more to protect human rights. The United Nations said on Tuesday Ban was concerned at events in Talas and urged all parties to show restraint. Bishkek residents said Internet access had been blocked in most households around the city. The main road between Talas and Bishkek had been entirely cordoned off by police, they s
