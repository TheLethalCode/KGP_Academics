 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition leader Khaleda Zia on Sunday led her party to walk out of parliament protesting a bill on a pay hike for MPs. The BNP chairperson, attending parliament for the first time in 19 sittings, said the government should first ensure smooth supply of water, gas and electricity for people and then increase MPs' salaries. "I urge the government to withdraw the bill." The government cannot even guarantee water, gas and electricity, Khaleda Zia told the parliament in the middle of the passage of the bill. "First ensure [these]. Then bring the bill," she demanded. Law minister Shafique Ahmed said: "We have increased the salaries of the president, prime minister, Supreme Court judges, public servants." "It would be discriminatory if we don't increase the MPs' salaries." Speaker Abdul Hamid, who was presiding over the session, asked Khaleda why she was only opposing pay hikes of the MPs. "You did not say anything about the bills on pay hikes of the president, prime minister, speaker, ministers, Supreme Court judges. But you are opposing the MPs' salary increase," Hamid asked Khaelda Zia just before she left parliament. The Members of Parliament (Remuneration and Allowances) (Amendment) Bill-2010 was passed as the BNP MPs walked out of parliament just after 9 pm. Bills were also passed earlier for raising salaries of the president the prime minister and ministers, among other officials. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina termed the opposition's protest a "stunt". "They increased the salaries of the ministers and MPs two times when they were in powerin 2001 and 2005," she said, referring to the past BNP-led administration. "There should be a limit to such stunts," Hasina said, as opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farrqoue urged the government to withdraw the bill on the MPs pay hike. The prime minister also alleged that the BNP MPs, when in power 2001 to 2006, swindled "thousands of crores of taka." "Those who earned thousands of crores of taka  need no pay hikes," said Hasina. Khaleda Zia addressed the house after Hasina for about 10 minutes before leading the walk out at 9.15 pm. In her 11-minute speech, Khaleda came down heavily on the Awami League government, former chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and former army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed. "The prime minister herself has said that she was poisoned (during the caretaker regime). Should Fakhruddin-Moeenuddin not face legal measures for this," asked Khaleda. "No cases have been files against them for fear they would tell about secret deals," alleged Khaleda. The leader of the opposition said lots of development activities took place from 2001 to 2006. "They (Awami League) understood that the BNP would return to parliament in 2007. "Therefore, they made deals with Fakhruddin-Moinuddin," said the BNP chairperson. She said the public servants during BNP's last term were "in peace as the price of essentials was tolerable". "There were no crises of gas, electricity and water," said Khaleda. She quoted the present finance minister saying that there was a "power famine" going on in the country. "It proves that Awami League means 'famine'. It was proved in 1974 and proved once again," said Khaleda Zia amid desk thumbing from the BNP MPs. Hasina took the floor once more after Khaleda Zia and said the crises of water, gas and electricity were caused by the previous BNP government.
