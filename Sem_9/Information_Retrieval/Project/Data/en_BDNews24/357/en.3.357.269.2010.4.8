<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 08 (bdnews24.com)  Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, an MP and BNP stalwart, has been barred from leaving the country for a week. The bar came about by dint of a Supreme Court order on Thursday that froze a High Court rule allowing the BNP policy maker to leave Bangladesh. The Supreme Court stayed a High Court order that had directed the government to allow senior BNP leader from leaving the country. Chamber judge of the Appellate Division Md. Muzammel Hossain stayed the High Court order for one week upon a petition by the government. The attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued that if Chowdhury is allowed to leave the country the trial of war criminals could be hampered. Moreover, Chowdhury might not return if he goes abroad, Alam, told the court. The High Court on Nov 24, ordered the government not to obstruct Salahuddin Qader from leaving the country for the next two months. Later on Jan 18, the court extended the period for another three months. Mahbubey Alam said a tribunal has already been formed to bring to justice those who had committed war crimes in 1971 and Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury is a suspected war criminal. Chowdhury's lawyer Shah Manjurul Haque said his client had already been abroad for a medical checkup  and has since not tried to go overseas again. Chowdhury has always denied being involved in war crimes during the 1971 war. bdne
