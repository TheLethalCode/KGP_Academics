 LONDON, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Tuesday confirmed May 6 as the date for a parliamentary election which could bring down the curtain on 13 years of rule by his centre-left Labour Party. Standing outside his Downing Street residence, with his cabinet arrayed behind him, Brown launched the month-long campaign for what is expected to be one of the most unpredictable elections in Britain for almost two decades. "It will come as no surprise to all of you and it's probably the least kept secret of recent years that the Queen has kindly agreed to the dissolution of parliament and a general election will take place on May 6," Brown said.

"Politics are taking centre stage in the UK. The ICM poll has highlighted political uncertainty which is weighing on sterling today," said Audrey Childe-Freeman, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. The threat of a hung parliament -- where no party has an overall majority -- has helped knock sterling down almost 10 percent versus the dollar this year alone. The new parliament will meet on May 18, the government said. How best to run an economy slowly emerging from the worst recession since World War Two is likely to be the central theme in the campaign, entwined with issues such as how best to manage public services in straitened ti
