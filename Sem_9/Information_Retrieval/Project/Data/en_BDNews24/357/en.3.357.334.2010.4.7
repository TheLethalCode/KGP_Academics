<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  Despite making lofty promises the political establishments are hardly sincere about fighting corruption, said Anti-Corruption Commission chairman Ghulam Rahman. He was speaking at a round table in Dhaka on Tuesday. Pointing to the widespread corruption he said, "It is the country's politics that decide the course of the nation." He said the current situation was such only because politics in Bangladesh has begun to rot. He said that it was not that the prime minister or the opposition leader lacked sincerity but there was a certain lack of effective willingness. To make the anti corruption drive more effective he recommended that a powerful and independent commission needed to be established. He also said that it was important to expedite legal proceedings along with formulating just and effective laws. Alliance of business and politics has become a source of corruption, he added. He pointed to the fact of the alliance between political parties and businessmen regarding funds and commented that it gave birth to corruption as the latter tried benefit from the former. The ACC has filed more than 1,100 cases since 2004 and only 256 have had any verdict. Of those 204 were given in favour of the commission. bdnew
