 LADLUMKAEW, Thailand, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thai protesters stormed a satellite station on Friday, breaching an army cordon and demanding officials lift censorship of their TV channel in the first major confrontation in a three-day state of emergency. Police fired tear gas in a failed attempt to disperse the thousands of protesters who climbed over rolls of barbed wire and forced open the gate of the compound, defying an emergency decree and upping the ante in their broader push for fresh elections. Most of the soldiers pulled back from the compound, leaving the grounds largely in control of the "red shirt" protesters, supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra who was ousted in a military coup in 2006. The protesters had not entered the main building, which houses a satellite uplink facility used to broadcast the red shirts' People Channel. On Thursday, authorities entered the station and seized equipment that took the channel off air, saying it was inciting violence. "We want our TV back. You cannot shut our eyes and ears," Jatuporn Prompan, a red shirt leader, said from the back of a truck after leading the protesters into compound. Many investors doubt even a violent impasse will derail a rebound in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy and one of the world's fastest-rebounding emerging markets. Thai stocks are up 76 percent over the past 12 months, Asia's third-best performer. Foreigners had bought $1.8 billion in Thai stocks from Feb. 22 to Thursday, when they were net sellers by a slight $43 million and the market fell 3.5 percent in thin volume. The market was off 0.35 percent on Friday.

Other protesters were on the way, travelling by truck and motorcycle along with the protest leaders. Army spokesman Sansern Kaewkamnerd said security forces would maintain order "in accordance with the law from use of soft to harsh means in seven steps if protesters violate (the decree)." The seven steps included baton and shield charges, water hoses, tear gas and rubber bullets. About 30,000 security forces were deployed across Bangkok, he added. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva had said he will not order a crackdown on the mostly rural and working class protesters who have also ignored orders to leave Bangkok's main shopping district since Saturday. That was before the march to the satellite station. Abhisit faces pressure to either compromise and call an election he could easily lose, or launch a crackdown that could stir up even more trouble. Most analysts doubt the authorities will use force to remove the protesters from the shopping area -- a politically risky decision for Abhisit as his 16-month-old coalition government struggles to build support outside Bangkok. The protesters left there on Friday were mainly women, children and old men. Much of Bangkok was calm and life went on as normal. Many of the malls in the central shopping and hotel district, where the red shirts have camped out since April 3, had reopened. The numbers of red shirts in the area, which had swollen to tens of thousands as the tropical heat died away in the evening, dropped away to about 5,000 on Friday. Security forces were not visibly deployed at the main rally site, although it is right in front of the police headquarters, opting to stay in their bases or on roads at least 2 km (1.2 miles) away in an apparent attempt to avoid provocat
