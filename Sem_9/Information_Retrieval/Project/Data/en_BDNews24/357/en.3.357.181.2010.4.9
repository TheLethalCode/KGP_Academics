 Chandpur, April 9 (bdnews24.com) - Civil aviation minister G M Quader has said there is no threat of a terrorist attack on airports. He told journalists at Chandpur Circuit House on Friday that the US embassy had informed Bangladeshi authorities on Thursday about a possible threat of terrorist attack on airports. "It is over now." "We were on alert so that no one could access airports with weapons or explosives," he added. Newspapers reported that security was beefed up after the US Federal Bureau of Investigation gave the alert. Saying that Jatiya Party supports the trial of the war criminals he added, "We have been demanding trial of the war criminals from even before we joined the Awami League-led alliance." "We joined the 'grand alliance' not to just get to power but because our ideologies were similar." Earlier he met Jatiya Party leaders of Cahndpur district. He urged them to strengthen the party and pray for the party chairman Ershad, also a former military dictator, who is under medical treatment in Singapore. bdn
