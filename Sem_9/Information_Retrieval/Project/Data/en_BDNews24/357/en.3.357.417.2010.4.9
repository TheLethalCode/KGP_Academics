 Dhaka, Apr 9(bdnews24.com)  BNP on Friday claimed that there were war criminals within the Awami League and demanded publication of a full list. Miza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, a joint secretary general of BNP, made the statement on Friday as he was speaking as chief guest of the Jatiayabadi Ulema Dal at BNP's headquarters at Naya Paltan, Dhaka. Mirza Alamgir said, "The government has published a list of war criminals. But there is allegation of war crimes against some ruling party leaders." "Awami League also made war criminals its ministers," he alleged adding that the names of war criminals inside Awami League also had to be made public. In support of his claim, Alamgir quoted a recent newspaper report that a war crime case was filed against a ruling party MP in Mymensingh. "BNP wants the trial of war criminals but people will not accept if political rivals are harassed in the name of war crimes trials," Alamgir said "The government is trying to silence those who want to oppose Awami League," he said. "The government is terming those who have beards and caps as collaborators of the Pakistani Army in 1971," he alleged. Questions have been raised over the list of war criminals as it included some who were aged between 4 and 8 in 1971, he said Alamgir slammed the government for its failure to resolve electricity, water and gas crises. "The success of the government lies in tender rigging, plundering and violence. The golden boys of the ruling party are perpetrating crimes in broad daylight," he said. "Though Awami League pledged to stop extra-judicial killings in its manifesto, 155 killings were reported by crossfire over the last 15 months," he alleged. He also condemned the killings of Bangladeshis by BSF along the border. bdn
