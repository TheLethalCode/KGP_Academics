 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants attacked a Pakistani checkpost near the US consulate in Peshawar on Monday, hours after a suicide bomber killed 38 people elsewhere in the northwest, a witness and a doctor said. "I saw attackers in two vehicles. Some of them carried rocket-propelled grenades.

The long-awaited constitutional amendments, which will also transfer President Asif Ali Zardari's sweeping powers to the prime minister, are due to be taken up in the National Assembly on Tuesday.
