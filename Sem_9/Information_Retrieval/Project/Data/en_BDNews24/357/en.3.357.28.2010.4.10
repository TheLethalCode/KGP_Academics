 WASHINGTON, Apr 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A doctor's endorsement of frequent recess breaks -- and not just for kids -- drew an appreciative response from experts meeting at a White House summit on childhood obesity on Friday. Dozens of child advocates, public policy experts and doctors gathered to brainstorm ideas for first lady Michelle Obama's campaign to wipe out childhood obesity in a generation.

The United States spends $150 billion a year to treat obesity-related conditions. The costs are projected to almost double over the next decade and will account for a fifth of overall healthcare spending, White House budget director Peter Orszag said. Besides direct healthcare costs and lost productivity, Orszag said the magnitude of obesity-associated health risk may not be fully appreciated. "Having a body mass index in the obesity range is equivalent to aging 20 years in terms of the chronic conditions that you face," Orszag said.
