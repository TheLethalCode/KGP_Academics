 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)A list of 36 absconding members of the BDR have been published on its website on Monday. The BDR, on the same day, also cancelled the appointment process of 510 trainees. Last year, following the mutiny on Feb 25-26, a list of 24 absconding members was published and circulated in all the police stations. Later, the number was reduced to 23 as one was arrested. An award of Tk 1 lakh was promised to anyone who assisted the BDR in finding any of these men The new list states that the men have not come to work since the mutiny. However, there was no promise of any award. The appointment process of 510 trainees was suspended saying that 'they will not be good soldiers'. BDR director general Maj Gen Moinul Islam mentioned that some of them took up arms during the mutiny, but no action could be taken against them as they had not been appopinted and had not taken oaths. He however said, that the trainees might have simply followed their commanding officers, as they were new to BDR and did not know the rules and regulations Training of the 510 members had started in January 2009 at the Rifles Training Centre of Baitul Ijjat in Chittagong. The appointment procedure is supposed to be completed after six months', according to the BDR rules. bd
