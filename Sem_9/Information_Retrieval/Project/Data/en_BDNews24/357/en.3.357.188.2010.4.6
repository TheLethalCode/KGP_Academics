 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)The taskforce, reconstituted after years last month for bringing back convicts now hiding abroad, met for the first time on Tuesday to map out its future course of action. "We've met to identify the tasks aimed at bringing back the absconding convicts in different cases, including those in the Bangabandhu killing case," law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters after the meeting. When asked if the war criminals will be covered by the taskforce, he parried the question, saying: "The taskforce will work to bring back and punish the convicts." Shafique did not want to speak on the issue of war crime since the trail procedure has just begun. Other members of the task force present at the meeting were the home minister, foreign minister, secretaries of the ministries, attorney general, inspector general of police (IGP) and director general of National Security Intelligence (NSI). The government reconstituted the task force through a circular on Mar 28, 14 years after it was formed on Oct 15 1996. According to the circular, the taskforce will prepare a list of the convicts in exile, identify their place of residence, and decide on the ways to bring them back. The committee will also monitor those convicts, who are currently having citizenship of other countries. bdn
