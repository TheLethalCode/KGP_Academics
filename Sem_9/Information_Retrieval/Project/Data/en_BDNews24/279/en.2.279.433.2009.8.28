 LONDON Fri Aug 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's population has risen above 61 million for the first time, according to a government report on Thursday, with figures suggesting the increase is due more to higher birth rates than to immigration. Net immigration into the UK fell 44 percent last year, reaching its lowest point since eight new countries joined the EU in 2004. Britain's total population grew 408,000 in 2008 to reach 61.4 million, its biggest growth year since 1962, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 791,000 babies born in the UK last year, an increase of 33,000 on 2007, a figure which is almost twice the rise recorded at the start of this decade.

The results come a year after the government introduced a new Australian-styled points-based vetting system for foreign workers coming to the UK. The figures also showed that in the second quarter of 2009, the number of people granted settlement in the UK, excluding citizens of Switzerland and European Economic Area countries, rose 26 percent to 46,120 compared with the same period in 2008. On Monday, the Migration Advisory Committee, a Home Office panel, recommended a number of measures that wean out unskilled foreign workers. They include a requirement that migrant workers from outside the European Union already have a job to offer with an annual salary of at least 20,000 pounds or, if the candidate has qualifications, of at least 32,000. Applications for asylum rose 11 percent in 2008 to 31,315. In all, 19,400 decisions were made on asylum applications in 2008, of which 70 percent were refusals. The proportion granted asylum rose three percentage points to 19 perc
