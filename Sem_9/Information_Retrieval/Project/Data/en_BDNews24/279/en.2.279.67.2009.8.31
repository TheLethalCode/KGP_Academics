 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary standing committee on liberation war affairs ministry has recommended new definition of the freedom fighters and the families of martyrs. The recommendation says only those who actively took part in the Liberation War should be considered a 'freedom fighter'. "According to the present definition, members of defence and other forces are not considered as freedom fighters. But our committee believes that those who have taken part in the independence war are all freedom fightersno matter whether he is working in any force or not," said Rafiqul Islam, Bir Bikram, president of the committee, to reporters at the Secretariat on Monday. "Therefore, freedom fighters belonging to any of the above forces will have to be recognised as freedom fighters and brought under one definition changing the present one," he said. The definition of 1972 said those who had taken part in the Liberation War were freedom fighters. "Members of defence, police, Ansars or any other forces were not recognised as freedom fighters as per that definition. But around 20,000 defence members took part in the liberation war," said Islam. The 1972 definition of a family of martyrs defines such family being one that lost an earning member. "Students of schools, colleges and universities took part in the liberation war and died but they were not bread-earners. We have recommended that their families be recognised as families of martyrs," he said. At present, there are no proper lists of freedom fighters but the government is planning to prepare one, he added. As may as 2.20 lakh applications have so far been submitted by those who aspire to be enlisted as freedom fighters, said Waresat Hossain Belal, a member of the committee. Another recommendation has been made about rejuvenating the ramshackle Muktijoddha Kalyan Trust (freedom fighters's welfare trust) enterprises into profit-making ventures again through appointing financial and industrial affairs advisers, said another member, Khan Tipu Sultan. The organisations dedicated for the welfare of the freedom fighters have to be made profitable within the next five years and the freedom fighters will be paid allowances on a regular basis, he said. bdnew
