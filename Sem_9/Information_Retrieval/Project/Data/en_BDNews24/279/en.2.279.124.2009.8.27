 Narayangonj, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)  Three workers succumbed to injuries on Wednesday and Thursday after being injured in an explosion at a sugar warehouse in Narayanganj town last week. The victims were identified as Shamsur, 40, Soleman, 30, and Alamgir, 40, all warehouse workers. Shamsu died on Wednesday morning at the burns unit of Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Soleman and Alamgir died in a Dhaka clinic on Thursday afternoon. The explosion took place at a sugar warehouse of the Gopinath Vhandar company, owned by Narayan Shaha Naru, on Friday night. The three workers were consumed by fire at the time, suffering critical burns. Officer-in-charge of Narayanganj police station Akhtar Hossain said an unnatural death case had been filed in connection with the incident. He said police had been unable to find the cause of the explosion so far, but owner of the warehouse Naru had been accused in a case of running an illegal Phensydil operation in the guise of a sugar business two years ago. "We have sent burnt sugar samples to the Dhaka explosion department. Steps will be taken after their report," Hossain said. bdne
