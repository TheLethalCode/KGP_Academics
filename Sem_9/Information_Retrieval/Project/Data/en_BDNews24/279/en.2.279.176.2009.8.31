 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Citibank NA, Bangladesh has moved a section of its services online with the introduction of their 'e-alert system' where client's bank statements are delivered automatically to their e-mail addresses. "We believe this will help us contribute to the green movement by eliminating paper-based advice statements, thus protecting the environment for the next generation," acting country director Abrar A Anwar told a news conference in the city on Monday. The service will ensure automatic delivery of transaction advice statements to clients' designated e-mail addresses, a Citibank press release said. Meanwhile, Global Finance magazine has awarded Citibank's Bangladesh division the Best Corporate Internet Bank in Bangladesh award for the second consecutive year, according to the statement. Becky Lo, the visiting managing director of Citibank's Asia Pacific region office, told reporters their strategy is to attract online customers and provide an efficient service. "We are committed to providing our clients in this country with top-class transactional banking services and industry-leading innovative solutions," said Lo. Professor of computer science at BUET, M Kaykobad, said Bangladeshi banks need to cater to their clients through the internet in view of its rapid spread through society. "Banks in Bangladesh have to embrace internet-based facilities to make their services efficient, simpler and faster," Kaykobad told reporters.
