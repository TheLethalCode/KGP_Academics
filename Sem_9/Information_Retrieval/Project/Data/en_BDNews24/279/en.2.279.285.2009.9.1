<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com)--The Supreme Court resumed hearing the presidential reference on the BDR mutiny trial on Tuesday for the fourth day with amicus curiae barrister Amir-Ul Islam resuming his statement. Another amicus curiae, Dr Kamal Hossain, started delivering his statement at around 1pm. Islam on Thursday said that one force's law could not be applied to another, and that the mutineers should be tried according to the crimes committed during the Feb 25-26 mutiny, which included murder, rape, torture and looting. The 11-strong full bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice M M Ruhul Amin ended third day's hearing on Thursday, with Islam, one of 10 amici curiae appointed by the court, continuing with his observations from Wednesday. Islam said, "The question is whether the BDR members can be tried by under the Army Act, specifically section 5(1)." He said based on past incidents, it was not possible. "Every service has a separate law. The problem arises when the law of one service is imposed on another." "The provisions maintained in the constitution and the law have to be applied," said Islam. Islam also said the crimes of murder, rape and looting perpetrated during the mutiny should be tried separately. "If only the rebellion is tried in this case, the other crimes will go untried." He also went on to say the "true perpetrators", not just the BDR mutineers, had to be uncovered. "The truth has to be unravelled. It is essential to ensure justice in this case." "Who were the conspirators behind rebellion here has not yet been unearthed." Islam in Wednesday's hearing had said: "Army officers were killed in the BDR mutiny. Their family members were also tortured. The children of the slain officers want their fathers' killers tried." He said he had seen "21 mutinies so far". He said those trials were held under the Army Act. Many accused were executed. "But the truth was not revealed." "The truth behind the assassination of Bangabandhu (Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) and four national leaders has not been revealed yet," he said. "The trial of the mutiny is not the main thing. Such questions will remain unanswered if proper trial does not take place," Islam said. Over the first two day's hearing, three amici curiae TH Khan, Khandaker Mahbubuddin Ahmed and Rafique-ul-Haque presented their observations. Difference of opinion Ahmed and Haque said that the government could try the BDR mutineers under the Army Act by issuing a gazette, while Khan said that the military trial of the BDR mutineers was not possible since the border guards were not defined as a "disciplined force". The government can issue two gazette notificationsone to bring the trial process under the Army Act and the other to suspend the effectiveness of BDR Order on those who would be tried, Ahmed said. The killing of army officers, in particular, could be tried under the Army Act, he said. But, he also observed that Article 35 of the Constitution might be a hindrance here as it states that the perpetrators should be tried under the law that was effective on the day of the occurrence. Haque also said it should be possible to hold trial under the Army Act by issuing gazette. He said since the BDR director general is deputed from the armed forces, the border guards are under his supervision. TH Khan in the first day's hearing, however, said BDR personnel cannot be tried under Army Act. "All forces are run by their respective laws including the trials of their offenders." "The Manual of Bangladesh Military Law says army personnel committing crimes may be tried under the MBML provisions. But BDR members cannot be tried that way, as they are not defined as a disciplined force." "Defence personnel committing crimes may be court-martialled, but BDR jawans cannot be subjected to such legal measures." Court yet to hear from six amici President Zillur Rahman sent a reference to the Supreme Court on Aug 17 seeking directives on the trial process. The court has appointed 10 senior lawyers as amici curiae, literally 'friends of the court', to advise it during the reference hearing. The court has yet to hear from amici curiae Kamal Hossain, Mahmudul Islam, Rokanuddin Mahmud, Ajmalul Hossain, ASM Mesbahuddin and AF Hassan Ariff. An inter-ministerial meeting on the BDR trial decided last month that the president would seek the chief justice's opinion on the BDR trial process as opinions varied widely on whether the accused mutineers should be tried under BDR, army or civil laws. At least 73 people, including 57 army officers deputed to the paramilitary force, were killed in the bloody Feb 25-26 mutiny at the Peelkhana headquarters in Dhaka. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam, presenting the reference before the court on the first day, said the mutiny case filed in Dhaka saw 1, 779 people arrested so far. Another 40 cases filed in connection with BDR rebellions outside Dhaka saw 1, 721 persons arrested. A total 3,500 people are facing trial in the cases, said Alam. bd
