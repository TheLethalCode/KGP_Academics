It had also been launched from Xichang, in 2007. China's experience with launching foreign satellites could also help in developing its own space presence. It plans to launch two or three space laboratories between 2010 and 2015, before embarking on a space station in 2020, the China Daily said on Tuesday, citing Gu Yidong, former chief of China's manned space program. It is developing a new launch center on the southern island of Hainan, which is better placed than either Xichang or China's other existing center in Gansu province.
