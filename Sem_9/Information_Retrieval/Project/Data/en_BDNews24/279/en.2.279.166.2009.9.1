<TITLE> IGP calls on govt to curb tender crime in SW </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31(bdnews24.com)Inspector General of Police Nur Mohammad has asked the government to look into possible alternatives to the tender process of awarding contracts in the south-west of the country as a means to curb rampant violent crime in the area. "Trouble often arises in the south-west over the tendering process, and so the police have advised the government to look for some alternative to current practices at the policy making level," Nur told reporters on Monday after a monthly meeting on crime at police headquarters. Nur said the meeting had also decided to conduct a "vigorous drive against extremists" in the crime-prone region of the country. He said over 150 police camps had been set up in the worst afflicted areas of the region under the caretaker government, although the current number of camps had come down. "A modernisation drive has provided police camps in the south-west with new vehicles, while police surveillance had been stepped up," said the IGP. Nur, however, went on to term well documented reports of extortion on the roads and highways "isolated events", although he said the meeting had decided to vigorously pursue any allegations of illegal toll collection. "Whoever resorts to extortion on the highway, whether it be the police, transport owners' organisations or trade unions, tough steps will be taken against them," said Nur. He said decisive action would be taken against highway police officers in areas with unusually high incidents of extortion. The meeting was also attended by additional IGP Naba Bikram Kishore Tripura, RAB director-general Hasan Mahmud Khondakar and Dhaka Police Commissioner AKM Shahidul Huq in addition to all city police commissioners and other high ranking officers. b
