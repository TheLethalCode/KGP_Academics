 BANGKOK Aug 28,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Thai court on Friday sentenced a political campaigner to 18 years in prison for insulting the monarchy, the latest in a slew of lese-majeste cases critics say are stifling dissent and freedom of speech. The Bangkok Criminal Court handed the harsh sentence to Darunee Charnchoengsilpakul, a "red shirt" supporter of ousted former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Critics of the lese-majeste law say it is open to abuse since a complaint can be filed by anybody against anybody, no matter how minor the alleged disrespect. The law has been a regular feature of the charged political atmosphere in Thailand in the past three years. The generals who overthrew Thaksin cited his alleged disrespect for the monarchy among other reasons. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has said he wants to strike a balance between upholding the law and freedom of expression, but critics say little has chan
