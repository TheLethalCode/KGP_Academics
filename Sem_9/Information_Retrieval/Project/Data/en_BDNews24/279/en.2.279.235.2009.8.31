 Liton Haider and Sayedul Islam Talat Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Doctors at Lab Aid Hospital reported the first swine flu death in Bangladesh on Sunday, a day after officials said the country's alert level may be raised from 2 to 3, signalling an epidemic. The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), however, has yet to officially confirm the death as the country's first H1N1 fatality. Mita Chakravarty, 35, died at around 10.30pm, Dr Samiran Kumar Saha, professor of medicine at Lab Aid and the patient's supervising doctor, told bdnews24.com. Saha said Mita, of Savar's Uttar Para, was one of the 199 H1N1 cases detected in the country up to Sunday. She was admitted to Savar's Enam Medical College Hospital on Aug 16 with suspected dengue, but when it was clear her symptoms did not match dengue, and might be swine flu, Mita was transferred to Lab Aid Hospital in Dhanmondi, her family said. "Mita was admitted to Lab Aid Hospital on Aug 20, and subsequent tests of IEDCR confirmed she had contracted the H1N1, or swine flu, virus," said Saha. "Her condition was serious as she was suffering complications with pneumonia." "We can say this is the first recorded swine flu death in the country," Saha said. IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com later Sunday night that they had heard of the death. "We know of a swine flu patient in critical condition at a private hospital in Dhaka," he said. "But we cannot make any official statement tonight. We will confirm the matter in the morning." Alert level may be raised Officials and experts at a swine flu seminar on Saturday said Bangladesh may soon raise its H1N1 alert to level 3, signalling an epidemic, in light of the recent jumps in the number of detected swine flu cases. They said there was no cause for panic but stressed the need for better dissemination of information about swine flu to ensure people in both urban and rural areas get proper treatment and take simple measures to curb the spread of the virus. Senior scientific officer of IEDCR Mushtuq Husain said the country was now at alert level 2, but could soon be at level 3, as the rising number of detected cases gave an indication of the actual spread of the virus across the country. But, he said, there was no reason to fear, "We have been alert since the day WHO declared a pandemic." The World Health Organization declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. Bangladesh's first case was detected on June 18. Saturday also saw a record single-day leap in the official swine flu count, with 31 new cases detected. "An action plan has been developed to fight this sort of situation," said Husein. "It will require stricter control at airports and other immigration points as well as clinical measures." 'Prepared' Health minister AFM Ruhul Haq said earlier this month that the regional scenario, including the growing swine flu fatalities reported in India, was "alarming" for Bangladesh, but the country was prepared to deal with the situation. The government has said sufficient stocks of flu drugs are in place and doctors are receiving specialised training on a rolling basis throughout the country. Officials and experts at Saturday's seminar said the virus was now being transmitted at higher rates within the country, and the public should make use of swine flu treatment facilities in place in the capital and at every district-level hospital in the country. IEDCR advises schools and offices to grant leave to anyone who displays symptoms of the flu. bd
