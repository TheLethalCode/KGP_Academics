 COLOMBO, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand struggled to 159 for five on the second day of the second and final Test on Thursday, trailing Sri Lanka by 257 runs after Thilan Samaraweera's century had put the hosts in command. Ross Taylor was providing lone resistance for the Kiwis at the close, having compiled 70 not out from 118 balls. Wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum was also unbeaten on five. Left-armer Thilan Thushara continued his fine form by taking two for 37 for Sri Lanka. Earlier, Samaraweera thumped 143 as Sri Lanka totalled 416 in their first innings despite losing their last five wickets for 27 runs.

However Sangakkara quickly reverted to the pace of Dammika Prasad, who trapped Tim McIntosh lbw for five. Thushara then had Daniel Flynn caught behind for 13, Prasanna Jayawardene taking a good diving catch. Martin Guptill (35) top-edged a pull to deep backward square before Jesse Ryder (23) helped steady the innings with Taylor, adding 85 for the fourth wicket.
