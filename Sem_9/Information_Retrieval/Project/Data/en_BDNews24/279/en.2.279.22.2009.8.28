 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)Police arrested businessman Abul Kalam Azad in the early hours of Friday on charges of assaulting a CID inspector. Paltan police chief Mujibur Rahman told bdnews24.com that CID inspector Golam Sarwar was an acquaintance of Azad, the chairman of Azad Group and owner of the Grand Azad Hotel chain in Bangladesh. Sarwar had gone to the Grand Azad Hotel in Purana Paltan, Dhaka, on Thursday afternoon to meet Azad to discuss a job for Sarwar's brother. As informed by a staff member, the inspector found Azad in room 205 of the hotel. According to case details, Azad was "furious" at Sarwar for coming to see him at the hotel without prior notice and, ganging up with 10 or 12 of his employees, he allegedly beat him up. Rahman said Sarwar left the hotel, received treatment for his injuries and lodged a case with Paltan Police Station in the evening. Police arrested Azad just after midnight as Sarwar's allegation was primarily substantiated after initial enquiries, Rahman said. bd
