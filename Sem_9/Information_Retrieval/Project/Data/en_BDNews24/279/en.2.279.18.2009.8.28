<TITLE> 2.5 lakh buildings vulnerable to quake: survey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Around 250,000 buildings in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet cities have been bracketed by a recent survey as being vulnerable to earthquake. "The survey results were absolutely shocking," says ASM Maqsud Kamal, national adviser to Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme for tsunami, cyclone and earthquake. "As many as 142,000 out of 180,000 buildings in Chittagong, 24,000 of another 52,000 structures in Sylhet and 78,000 out of 326,000 buildings in Dhaka cities have been labelled as risky," Kamal added. The 'seismic hazard and vulnerability assessment' survey was conducted between Feb 2008 and Aug 2009 to single out the highly vulnerable buildings using a modern software HAZUS in the three cities, the official added. Also a Dhaka University professor of geological sciences, Kamal said, "We had faced only two-three severe earthquakes in the last 150 years, and because of the long intervals, the possibility of a dangerous strike looks imminent." The observations came from a national workshop on "Status of Earthquake Preparedness in Bangladesh" organised by the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP) at the Sonargaon Hotel on Thursday. Vice chancellor of BRAC University and president of Bangladesh Earthquake Society professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury said the study achieved significant progress in searching and tracing the threatening Dawki fault-line, employing modern technology and foreign experts. "Such an in-depth survey has been conducted for the first time in our country," he said. In phase-1 of the project, a database has been developed comprising all the buildings of the three cities, including their water and gas pipe line networks, which should help one estimate possible damages in case of an earthquake. Following initiation of the project, volunteers have been recruited and the equipment procured and distributed, which Kamal described as laying the foundation to combating the "sudden" disaster. The most vulnerable city in the country is Sylhet, because of its proximity to the Dawki fault and the second most is Chittagong for its nearness to the Bay plate boundary, he said. "Due to high density of population, we'll face massive human disasters even in case of medium quakes." "Instructions regarding retrofitting the hospitals, fire service stations and rescue shelters to enable the facilities cope with earthquake situations will follow soon," he added. The housing and public works ministry has initiated programmes to review and revamp the building codes put in force 16 years ago. A work order has been circulated and an advisory body formed to revise and update the current code. The process will end any time by the next year, according to Kamal. City developer RAJUK, the city corporation authorities and other law-enforcement agencies need to ensure accurate implementation of the building codes, he added. Food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzak said the government has approved a project worth Tk 70 crore to procure necessary equipment for search and rescue and fire-fighting. Under the CDMP, the fire service and civil defence have already been provided with search and rescue equipment. The CDMP will raise a corp of volunteers comprising 62,000 members within the next few years. A number of rescue training activities and advocacy campaigns among the decision makers, planners, school children and teachers have been accomplished in the risky zones in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet to reduce urban risks from potential earthquakes. Earthquake will be included in the Standing Orders for Disasters (SOD) soon, which will allow taking legal steps to address cases of violation of building codes. The Earthquake Contingency Plan has been developed through conducting training programmes and exercises have been conducted to implement the plan effectively, the minister added. The draft National Plan for Disaster Management 2008-2015 containing an earthquake management plan is underway to be approved by the government. Ambassador and head of delegation of the European Commission Stefan Frowein said earthquake risks have grown substantially and urged for wider awareness among the city dwellers. UNDP country director Stefan Priesner congratulated the researchers on their unprecedented progress achieved in building an earthquake related comprehensive database. bd
