 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka mayor Sadek Hossain Khoka on Thursday said he would extend his assistance to a parliamentary probe committee tasked with uncovering alleged corruption at Dhaka City Corporation, a day after the committee alleged he was hampering their investigations. "The committee can summon all the files they need to follow up allegations of irregularities at DCC," said Khoka. On Wednesday, Rahmat Ali, head of the parliamentary standing committee on local government, claimed the mayor had been hampering a probe into alleged endemic corruption within the halls of Nagar Bhaban. He claimed the standing committee requested a room be allocated for the use of its probe body at Nagar Bhaban, the DCC head office, but the mayor had informed the committee's chairman in writing that no such room could be made available. "It is unprecedented for a parliamentary committee to be allocated a room at DCC, but we will cooperate fully with the committee in its investigations," said Khoka. Khoka said the Anticorruption Commission was already looking into alleged irregularities at city hall, and there was no need for "any other channel to do the same work". He said the committee should make sure they did not tarnish DCC's image with development partners. The controversial mayor also said he feared he would be needlessly drawn into the committee's graft investigations, and intended to write to the speaker of the House on the issue. Khoka claimed a taskforce set up under the caretaker government had failed to uncover any wrongdoing in the nine months it had been operating at DCC. "Of course, some of our officials have allegations against them, and we will take action," he said. Khoka, however, also said he did not believe the parliamentary probe was politically motivated. The parliamentary standing committee constituted the probe committee with Awami League MP Monwar Hossain Chowdhury as its convener. The other members of the probe body are AL MPs Ali Ashraf Khan Khasru and Mostafizur Rahman and BNP MP Abul Khair Bhuiyan.
