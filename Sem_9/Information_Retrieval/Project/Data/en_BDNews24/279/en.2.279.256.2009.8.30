 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)--The chairman of Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (BCSIR) has said products developed or innovated by his research institute should be marketed globally only after intellectual property rights (patent) are ensured. Professor SM Imamul Haq alleged that many research-based products were being leased out on the market without patent application which must be stopped. "It was not proper to market any product without applying for patent" he added. Haq said, "Monitoring is underway to prevent research-based products of BCSIR from being marketed without patent." "Patent right follows a procedure and so innovative method along with the product should not be leased during the procedure," said the newly appointed head of BCSIR, the state-run research and development institute, commonly known as Science Laboratory. "We have planned not to market any research based innovative products without ensuring intellectual property right or patent." There are already over 300 BCSIR products with patent right. But there are many products that have been leased out in the market without patent right which deprived the country of export earnings, Haq pointed out. He suggested the science and information ministry has a wing for dealing with intellectual property rights (IPR) issues. Besides, BCSIR should employ a permanent lawyer skilled in patent rights. The Science Laboratory has developed a wide range of new industrial and commercial products, specially food, luxury and medicine items like Spiriluna tablet, antacid food and tasty nourishing drinks. Recently, for example, BCSIR scientists have developed an environment-friendly chemical called 'glutaraldehyde' which should make a breakthrough in industrial application. Huq explained that toxic chemical substance chromium is being used in leather industries which exposes factory workers to different skin diseases. But now this new BCSIR developed 'glutaraldehyde' can be used in the leather factories instead of chromium. He underlined the need for strengthening the research activities of BCSIR to make it the country prime R&D institute patronizing its scientists and technical workforce and providing it with adequate funds for carrying out its activities. "Despite having world class laboratory, the organisation could not function properly over the past few years," BCSIR chairman told bdnews24.com. "The national research institute will be made up-to-date using state-of-the-art facilities ensuring public-private partnership in full cooperation with the government," he said. Huq claimed that as soon as he took over as chairman of BCSIR, he initiated activities aimed at building technology-sound digital Bangladesh 2021. BCSIR conducts research on 37 areas including arsenic mitigation, analytical research, animal food technology, aromatic plants, bio-gas technology, biological science, bio-technology, food micro logy, effect of processing on nutrient content of foods, fibre and polymer, environmental pollution, food science and quality, tissue culture The chairman said BCSIR has patented over 360 innovative products while some 1000 innovations are under process for patent. All concerned rush to the institute for evaluation or assessment of their products, but many countries of the world do not value its evaluation as its laboratory is yet to receive ISO accreditation certificate, said the BCSIR head. He said BCSIR is soon going to secure a laboratory ISO certificate (ISO 17025). BCSIR research-based products have earned Tk four crore during the last one year and over Tk 50 lakhs in last six months. "There is no alternative to research for the development of the country," Haq observed, adding that scientists will have to be patronised to bring mobility in their activities by providing them with opportunity of higher education, due recognition of their works and intensive assistance. The head of BCSIR also said he would hold talk with the business bodies like FBCCI, DCCI, and BGMEA to bring mobility and dynamism in research works as part of public-private partnership initiative. Referring to shortage of workforce Haq said BCSIR is supposed to have 1400 workforce while current workforce is 50 percent less than what is required. "Workforce will be increased gradually and time befitting steps be adopted to fulfil the vision 2021 to build a Digital Bangladesh," he said. Haq, also president of Bangladesh Association of Scientists, recommended an extension of retirement age for the scientists from 57 to 60 years. A professor of soil, water and environment sciences, Haq joined BCSIR on Aug 9. He also researched on the spread of arsenic in the food cycle through underground water. He has 208 researches at local and international level to his credit. bd
