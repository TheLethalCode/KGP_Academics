 TAIPEI, Aug 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Dalai Lama, a Tibetan spiritual leader reviled by China as a separatist, arrived in Taiwan on Sunday for a hasty visit to comfort victims of a typhoon, testing the island's improved ties with Beijing. China opposes the Dalai Lama's trips abroad and condemned Taiwan opposition leaders for inviting him last week to visit until Friday. He will pray for victims of Typhoon Morakot, Taiwan's worst storm in 50 years which killed up to 745 people.

The president's office has said Ma would not meet the Dalai Lama, a move that analysts expect to keep him out of trouble with China amid improvements in trade ties. There was no word from China on Sunday about the visit. Last week it accused Taiwan's anti-China opposition Democratic Progressive Party of using the disaster rescue as an "excuse" to invite the Dalai Lama and "sabotage" ties with China. The party lashed back on Sunday. "Such behaviour of Chinese officials runs contrary to the expectations of the Taiwanese people who anticipate the spiritual compassion and peace that the Dalai Lama represents," the party said in a statement. The Dalai Lama has visited Taiwan in 1997 and 2
