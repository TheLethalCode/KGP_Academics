 Kishoreganj, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)Three men were beaten to death and seven injured by locals in Kishoreganj on Saturday when a 20 strong gang attempted to evade police capture following an attempted robbery of a passenger boat. "Police gave chase to a 15-to-20 strong gang travelling by engine boat after they attempted to rob a passenger boat in Goradigha Haor," Subrata Kumar Shaha, officer-in-charge of Bajitpur Police Station, told bdnews24.com. Shaha said the police and members of the fleeing gang traded shots in Shibpur Boalia, after which they jettisoned their firearms into the water.

"One man died on the spot, while two others died on their way to hospital," he said. Police identified the deceased as 30-year-old Shumon Das, 35-year-old Mesbah and 40-year-old Nabi Hossain.
