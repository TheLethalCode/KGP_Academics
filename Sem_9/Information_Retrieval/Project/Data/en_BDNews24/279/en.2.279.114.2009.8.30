 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)No bomb was found at the National Press Club in the heart of the capital on Sunday after RAB mounted a search on a hoax bomb threat. RAB legal and media wing director Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com that an anonymous caller had told them that the club would be blown off at around 12:30pm. The press club was cordoned off during the search in the lounge, canteen, media centre, library and other areas. The club management committee general secretary Kamal Uddin Sabuj said, "Such a bomb panic at the press club is unprecedented." "However, the law-enforcing agencies told me that they did not get any bomb after searching the compound," Sabuj said. He urged the government to be more careful about the security of a national institution like press club, because it is the government's duty to ensure security of the club's members and others concerned. The joint general secretary of the National Press Club management committee, Rownak Hossain Rono, told reporters that they did not know anything about bomb attack threat. "RAB came to us and said that they would search here. There are bombs." "We cooperated with them for security reasons," he said. "The threat might have been given to spread panic. RAB and police patrol have been reinforced around the club. RAB-3 deputy commander major Muhammad Khairul Amin, who led the drive, told reporters that they had started the search on the orders of the 'higher authorities' at midday. He said at around 2pm that no bomb was found and that there was no reason to panic. Two discussion meetings were interrupted at the club during the search. RAB asked the attendees to get out before searching the rooms with sniffer dogs. Of the two programmes, one titled "Six months into Peelkhana Killings: Citizens' Thought" was organised by Renaissance Institute, which was attended by BNP MP MK Anwar and Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general M Quamaruzzaman. The other programme marking National Mourning Day was being attended by health state minister Mojibur Rahman Fakir. However, the Press Club treasurer Syed Afdal Ahmed said no scheduled programmes were suspended for the bomb threat. A hoax bomb threat, made by an anonymous caller, forced the Dhaka Stock Exchange to shut down an hour earlier than the scheduled close of trading on June 29. bdnews24
