 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com) The chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law and justice ministry has said he did not unilaterally decide to summon the prime minister's advisor H T Imam and two others over the government's decision to retire two judges. "It is the parliamentary committee's decision, not my own decision," Suranjit Sengupta told reporters after attending a memorial meeting on independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman organised by Jalalabad Association at Karwan Bazar in Dhaka on Friday. The watchdog on the ministry on Thursday decided to summon Imam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud to explain the government's decision. Speaking to reporters at his Hare Road residence, Imam had said that he believed one or two committee members, whose remarks sometimes became unrestrained, provoked the summons. The government sent Dhaka district and sessions judge Mohammed Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression (prevention) tribunal judge Mohammed Shahjahan into retirement on July 30 without the consent of the Supreme Court, a decision that was overturned just days later. Without naming Imam, Sengupta said "On the party's behalf, he holds a ministerial status. We will welcome him if he delivers his speech in parliament in line with the constitution." "If he doesn't speak, it is up to him." "He can look into the proceedings and tapes in case he had any doubt over the committee's decision." Imam said he was not yet decided about whether to appear before the parliamentary standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry to clarify his role. He said he would look into the parliamentary committee's scope of work before making a decision. Asked what the committee planned to do if Imam did not turn up before the panel, he said, "Under the changed circumstances, the committee will decide." Sengupta told reporters on Thursday that the government's decision on the retirement of judges, and their reinstatement just days later, "embarrassed" the prime minister's office. "According to the papers submitted to the committee, we have seen that the prime minister's adviser HT Imam had initiated the file on forceful retirement of the two judges. "Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud also played a role in the process. "We have unanimously decided to call the three before the committee to justify the decision," Sengupta told reporters after the committee's meeting that was also attended by the law minister. bdnew
