 Correction in fourth paragraph, 15 lakh tonnes of palm oil to be exported Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)A major Malaysian business group has offered to invest $3 billion in power generation and manpower training in Bangladesh. A 13-member business delegation of Malaysian Agate Group, led by its managing director Sultan Abdul Quadir, met with commerce minister Faruk Khan, a commerce ministry statement said on Sunday. Malaysian Agate's proposals include setting up a 1000-megawatt coal fuelled power plant, establishing nursing training centres and other training for skilled manpower export. The group also expressed its interest to export 15 lakh tonnes (1.5 million) of palm oil to Bangladesh. The minister said Bangladesh has the manpower while Malaysia has the land, so the two friendly countries can add pace to development of both countries by making use of these resources, said the statement. Bangladesh's Walton Hi-Tech Industries recently signed a deal with Agate to export refrigerators and motorcycles to Malaysia. bdne
