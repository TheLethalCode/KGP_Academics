Meanwhile, on Saturday, 31 new cases were confirmed, the highest one-day jump since the health ministry detected the first case in Bangladesh on June 18.

He said Bangladesh was now preparing for level 3, but the IEDCR or health ministry could not raise the alert as an epidemic could only be officially declared from the prime minister's office. WHO declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. bd
