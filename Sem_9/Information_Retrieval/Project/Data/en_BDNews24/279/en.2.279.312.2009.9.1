<TITLE> Chris Brown says never stopped loving Rihanna </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LOS ANGELES, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - R&B singer Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to beating ex-girlfriend Rihanna, said he still loves her and details of the assault are blurred in his memory roughly six months later. Brown, who rose to fame as a teenager with hits like "Kiss, Kiss," was sentenced last week to five years probation and some community service for assaulting Rihanna in February on the eve of the music industry's Grammy awards. Since then he has publicly apologized but not sat for any media interviews. Likewise Rihanna, whose hit songs include "Umbrella," has largely stayed out of the media spotlight. But after his sentencing, Brown spoke to star interviewer Larry King and People magazine. Both released excerpts on Monday, although late in the day Brown said a video posted on CNN's site misrepresented the entire interview with King. King, whose interview airs on Wednesday night on CNN's "Larry King Live," asked Brown if he could remember the event, and in the brief video, the singer clearly said "no." "I just look at it like, wow, I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be," Brown said. "So when I look at the police reports or hear about the police reports, I just don't know what to think." Yet in a statement issued by People late Monday, Brown sought to clarify his remarks to King by saying he, in fact, remembered the event. Brown said he was asked the same question by King several times and each time he answered that he did not believe it was appropriate to give details of the night because "it really wasn't fair to Rihanna." "The fifth time -- or whatever it was -- I just misspoke," Brown told People. "Of course I remember what happened. Several times during the interview, my mother said that I came to her right afterwards and told her everything. But it was and still is a blur," Brown said. Separately, Brown told People in a story for the issue on newsstands Friday that he still loves Rihanna. "I never fell out of love with her. That just wouldn't go away," Brown said
