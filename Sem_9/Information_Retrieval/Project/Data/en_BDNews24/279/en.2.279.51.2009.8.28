<TITLE> No pressure to ditch war crimes trial: Shafique </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister has denied any international pressure on the government to not hold trial for crimes committed during the 1971 war of independence from Pakistan, days after another minister had spoken of suggestions to scupper the plan. "Instead, Bangladesh is being assisted internationally with information and evidence to make the trial transparent, objective and acceptable," Shafique Ahmed said on Friday at the launch of a book at his residence. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam on Aug 20 had said they were under pressure not to try the war criminals. Without naming the countries from which the government was facing obstacles, he had said that they had been under strain from external as well as internal quarters. The law minister said they had assurance of full assistance from United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-Moon in holding the trial. Ahmed also dismissed as baseless allegations by the Sector Commanders' Forum and Ghatok Dalal Nirmul Committee, two pro-liberation bodies, that the government was delaying the trial. "It is taking time to ensure the security of the judges of the tribunal, lawyers, investigatiing officials, witnesses and foreign observers," he said, explaining the apparent delay. "Also the office, where the war crime tribunal will sit, is occupied by several organisations which is holding up the trial." He asserted that there was doubt about the trial. The government plans to put in the dock Bangladeshis who face charges of committing murders, rapes, arsons and looting and abetting the Pakistani occupation army during the bloody nine-month war. Ahmed said no political party or personality will be put on trial for political vengeance. "This trial would have finished a long time ago if Bangabandhu (independence hero Sheikh Mujibur Rahman) was alive. He legislated International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973 in 1973 to try the war criminals." "But a political party helped the war criminals settle down in this country. Ziaur Rahman had grabbed power with the help of the collaborators," he said, alluding to late president General Ziaur Rahman and his BNP party. The book the law minister launched was 'Shajaprapto Juddhaporadhi (convicted war criminals) 1971, written by Prottoy Jasim. "My book is for those who say there are no war criminals in this country. It contains data on those who were convicted as war criminals," said Jasim. "Ziaur Rahman freed many who were sentenced to be hanged for war crimes," Jasim added. bdnew
