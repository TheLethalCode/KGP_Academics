 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina had stern words for Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders on Monday, warning against "tender-grabbing". "I am upset when I see the name of Chhatra League associated with tender-grabbing in the papers," Hasina told a discussion hosted by BCL at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre. "This is not the job of the Chhatra League. The Chhatra League's job is to keep an eye on every educational institution so that educational environment is not disturbed on any campus in the country." The discussion was hosted on the last day of August, concluding a month-long programme in memory of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who was slain with family members on Aug 15, 1975. Calling for cooperation from leaders of BCL, she asked those present to conform to their belief in pro-Awami League principles. She also asked the BCL men to be supportive of government efforts control price of essentials and solve the ongoing power crisis. "It is not possible to provide [people with] uninterrupted power overnight. Power crisis will be overcome, if patience, is maintained to some extent." BCL president Mahmud Hasan Ripon and general secretary Mahfuzul Haidar Chowdhury Roton led the discussion. bd
