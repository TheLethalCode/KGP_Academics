 COLOMBO, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka seized control of the second Test against New Zealand on Friday as they reached stumps on 157 for two with a lead of 339 runs. Spinners Rangana Herath and Muttiah Muralitharan combined to take six wickets in dismissing New Zealand for 234 on the third morning, putting the hosts on course for a series sweep. Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara gave his team another solid platform with an unbeaten 64 from 90 balls, a fluent innings that included seven fours and a six.
