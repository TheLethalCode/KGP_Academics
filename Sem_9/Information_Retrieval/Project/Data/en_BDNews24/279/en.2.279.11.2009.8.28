<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)Police have sought to remand businessman Abul Kalam Azad in custody for five days to grill him after his arrest early on Friday on charges of assaulting a police officer. Azad was taken from Paltan Police Station to a Dhaka metropolitan magistrate's court at around 1pm. Paltan police sub-inspector Mazharul Amin told reporters that a prayer to place Azad on a five-day remand will be submitted to the court for quizzing him over the case that accuses him of attempting to murder CID inspector Golam Sarwar. The remand prayer will be heard by the metropolitan magistrate Muhammad Abdur Rahim. Azad's lawyers Noor Hossain Balai and Kazi Najibullah Hiru told bdnews24.com that they will appeal for his bail. Paltan police chief Mujibur Rahman told bdnews24.com earlier that Sarwar was an acquaintance of Azad, the chairman of Azad Group and owner of the Grand Azad Hotel chain. Sarwar had gone to the Grand Azad Hotel in Purana Paltan, Dhaka, on Thursday afternoon to meet Azad to discuss a job for Sarwar's brother. As informed by a staff member, the inspector found Azad in room 205 of the hotel. According to case details, Azad was "furious" at Sarwar for coming to see him at the hotel without prior notice and, ganging up with 10 or 12 of his employees, he allegedly beat him up. Rahman said Sarwar left the hotel, received treatment for his injuries and lodged a case with Paltan police in the evening. Police arrested Azad just after midnight as Sarwar's allegation was primarily substantiated after initial enquiries, Rahman said. bdnew
