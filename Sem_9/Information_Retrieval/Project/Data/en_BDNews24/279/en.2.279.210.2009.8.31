 KARACHI, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) would not be involved in organising the 2011 World Cup following last week's financial settlement ended its row with the ruling body, an official said Monday. "We will now just take part in the tournament as a participating nation, not as a host country," a senior PCB official, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters. The International Cricket Council (ICC) board had in April stripped Pakistan of its 14 matches over security concerns, moving them to co-hosts India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. The Pakistan board ended a legal challenge on the issue after the two parties agreed Thursday the PCB will retain its host fees and also receive an additional payment as compensation. Pakistan had been invited to nominate representatives on the World Cup organising committee and central secretariat, but has decided not to attend a meeting in Mumbai Wednesday. "Since we have now reached a satisfactory settlement with the ICC and no longer are joint hosts of the World Cup, it is useless for us to be part of the World Cup organising committee or preparations," the official said. The total payout to PCB is expected to be around $14-15 million dollars (8.6 million pounds -9.3 million pounds), he added.
