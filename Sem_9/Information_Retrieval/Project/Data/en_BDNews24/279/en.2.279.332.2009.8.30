 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Foreign minister Dipu Moni signed the US embassy's condolence book on Sunday for the late Senator Edward Kennedy, who was buried near to his slain brothers at Arlington National Cemetery, Washington DC, on Saturday. The foreign minister, accompanied by her husband Tawfique Nawaz to the embassy, in her 11-line message wrote: "You carved out a space in my mind during my childhood when you stood by us in our exercise of the right to self determination as a nation." Edward Kennedy is fondly remembered in Bangladesh for his personal support of the 1971 Liberation War in the face of opposition from the then Nixon administration. Dipu Moni wrote: "As my generation grew up you imprinted your values of special compassion and justice onto our public life. "You extended yourself as our great friend in our trials and tribulations for the achievement of a democratic Bangladesh." Her husband Nawaz wrote: "You represented the great American democratic face. You included the Bengali people in your cause. Were privileged. "Our generations will carry on your human values," Nawaz wrote. US ambassador James F Moriarty stood silent as the two dignitaries signed the condolence book. A book of condolence has also been opened at the Archer K Blood American Centre Library in Banani for general public to sign, a press statement issued by the American centre said. bdnews24.com/krc/am/2030h Click her
