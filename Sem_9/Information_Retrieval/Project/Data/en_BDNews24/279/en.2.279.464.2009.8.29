<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)Law minister Shafique Ahmed said on Saturday the launching of the trial for war criminals was being delayed as the government was working to have all-important security measures in place for all those involved, from judges to the accused. He also aid the law ministry was looking at a house on Abdul Gani Road for the trial premises. "We have sent a letter to the housing and public works ministry to fix the acquisition of the house, where the proposed tribunal will be set up," the minister said. He said the government would ensure strict security to protect the tribunal judges, lawyers, investigators, witnesses, accused and foreign observers. Attending a workshop on trial of war criminals under the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973, at the National Press Club, Shafique said this was the only reason behind the delay. He denied any international pressure to stop the trials, saying, "We are trying only Bangladesh's war criminals first, so no such pressure is relevant now." But, he added, others who committed war crimes against Bangladeshis will also be tried eventually. The law minister also said international observers had asked for some amendment to the existing law, to ensure a neutral and transparent trial process. "We've already made them," said Shafique. He mentioned that the government had cut the provision to include army personnel among members of the tribunal, among other amendments. "They have also asked to ensure that no one will be tried for motives of political or other vengeance," Shafique added. On the recent spate of war crimes cases being filed at police stations around the country, Shafique said individuals filed those cases under the criminal code, while the government's trial of war criminals will be held under the tribunal law. Among the discussants at the workshop, barrister Tania Amir said, "Bangladesh touched a landmark by enacting a standard law to try war criminals in 1973 combining all the international declarations. Now we can make another mark by the accomplishing the trials." The workshop was organised by Bangladesh Heritage Foundation.
