 Kushtia, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected extremist was killed in a 'crossfire' incident with RAB and police early on Saturday, in the backdrop of deteriorating law and order in the district, law enforcers said. The latest incident is the fourth such killing, in reported shootouts between extremists and law enforcers, in less than a week. Saturday's shooting led to the death of 38-year-old Babul Joaddar, also known locally as Babul Member. Police said he was the local leader of outlawed extremist group Gono Bahini. The incident took place near a beel , or water body, in Bamon village near the Islami University in Kushtia's Sadar Upazila, said local police chief Motiar Rahman. A team of RAB 12 and police went to the beel, adjacent to the Bittipara-Patikabari road, at around 4am following a tip-off on a meeting of the outlawed group there, Rahman told bdnews24.com. "The suspects opened fire; RAB and police fired back. The extremists managed to flee the scene and police found the dead body of Babul at the spot," said Rahman. He said a firearm and nine rounds of ammunition were recovered from the spot. "Babul was the chief associate of Gono Bahini's head Ajibor Rahman," said the police officer. The body was sent to Kushtia Sadar Hospital for post mortem. Two suspected extremists were killed in crossfire with police in Kushtia town on Wednesday night. Another Gono Bahini leader Shahinur Rahman Dablu was killed in a shootout Tuesday night, police said. bdn
