 Dhaka, August 30 (bdnews24.com)The government has finally banned and ordered the destruction of all stocks of two child medications manufactured by Rid Pharmaceutical LtdTemset (Paracetamol) Suspension and Ridaplex Syruplinked to children's deaths in Bangladesh. The ban came as the drugs were proven to be substandard and harmful, said a notice released by the government on Sunday, a month after the health ministry confirmed toxic ingredients in Rid's paracetamol preparation. The notice said Temset may cause kidney malfunctions in children. It said the government has prohibited production, marketing, storing, use and sales of these drugs and ordered destruction of all existing stocks throughout the country. The notice warned of legal action against any body found to be holding stocks of the two drugs. The health minister, on July 29, announced that tests had confirmed the presence of the toxic chemical, diethylene glycol, in Temset, a children's paracetamol preparation, produced by Rid Pharma, suspected of killing at least 25 children in Bangladesh since June. He also said the company had no license to manufacture the paracetamol syrup, which Rid had falsely marketed as a 'suspension'. Diethylene glycol, normally used in the textile and leather dying industries, was used in the preparation of the paracetamol product as a cheap but deadly substitute for propylene glycol, Haque told a press briefing after a government probe committee submitted its report to the health ministry last month. The government formed the seven-member probe committee on July 21, while the Drug Administration on the same day ordered Rid Pharma to stop manufacture of all products, including the paracetamol preparation suspected of causing kidney failure and deaths of children in Dhaka. The parliamentary standing committee on health formed a separate four-member parliamentary committee to look into the manufacturing processes of pharmaceutical companies across the country. A Dhaka court issued arrest warrants on Aug 11 against five Rid Pharma officials, including the company's managing director, for production of adulterated and substandard drugs and their marketing. Rid Pharma initially denied producing the paracetamol syrup linked to children's deaths in media reports. Officials of the drug company were quoted in the press as saying Rid Pharma "does not produce paracetamol syrup, only suspension". The health minister said on July 29 that although the product was described as a suspension on the package, it had in fact contained syrup. According to the health ministry, only five domestic companiesout of more than 250 big and small drug makers in the countryhave clearance to manufacture paracetamol syrup. DA officials say the market is flooded with substandard drugs, while lawyers of the drug court say authorities, including the DA, is failing to take proper legal action against the culprits.
