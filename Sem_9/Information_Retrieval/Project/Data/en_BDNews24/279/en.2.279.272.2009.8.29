<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kumar Sangakkara scored his 20th century to help Sri Lanka build a formidable 470-run lead on the fourth morning of the second Test against New Zealand on Saturday. The Sri Lankan captain led from the front with a stylish 175-ball knock that included 12 boundaries and one six, and received solid support from Mahela Jayawardene as Sri Lanka reached lunch on 288 for three in their second innings. Jayawardene followed his first innings 92 with a fluent unbeaten 90 from 132 balls, an innings that included five boundaries and a straight six. Middle order batsman Thilan Samaraweera was 15 not out at the break with a declaration expected soon after lunch. Off spinner Jeetan Patel was the only wicket-taker of the morning, as Sangakkara edged to Ross Taylor at slip while attempting an extravagant lofted drive to end a 173-run third wicket partnership. Patel was the most successful of the Kiwi bowlers on a bone-dry pitch that showed no significant deterioration, claiming 2-112 from 32 overs. Sri Lanka lead the two-match series 1-0 after winning the opener in Galle last week.
