 Shyadul Islam Talat bdnews24.com health correspondent Dhaka, Sept 1 (bdnews24.com)The hospitals in the capital city are yet to be ready to treat swine flu patients though health authorities claimed they have taken sufficient precautionary measures to face any epidemic. A few hospitals have opened special swine flu wards with insufficient beds but most of them are yet to be properly equipped to handle patients, hospital sources said. As a result, once a swine flu patient arrives at any of these hospitals, the duty doctors send him/her to ICDDR,B or National Chest Diseases Hospital. National Chest Diseases Hospital has only four beds for treating serious patients while ICDDR,B is still going through preparations for opening its special ward for swine flue patients. This correspondent visited Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical College hospital, Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Sir Salimullah Medical College Hospital (SSMCH), Suhrawardy Hospital, Dhaka Shishu (Children) Hospital, ICDDR,B and National Chest Diseases Hospital to find the hospitals having scanty arrangements to handle any full-blown epidemic. In Bangladesh, swine flu virus (H1N1) can be tested at IEDCR or ICDDR,B. The Institute of Epidemiology, Diseases Control and Research (IEDCR) director Prof Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com, "Let the treatment start. Many patients could be treated outdoor." Though the BSMMU had earlier declared to arrange a 100-bed swine flu ward, there was not a single bed put in place, nor any doctor or nurse found to treat swine flu patients until Monday. BSMMU vice chancellor Prof Pran Gopal Datta told reporters that they had preparation for setting 100 beds in that open space in block D which would be made functional once patients start arriving. But the space reserved for the special swine flu ward cannot be reached direct by an elevator. The authorities at Suhrawardy Hospital said they were ready with a special ward with seven beds for H1N1 victims. 'Anis', an employee at the hospital, said the ward was locked as there was no patients yet. Dhaka Shishu Hospital director Prof A R Khan told bdnews24.com, "We have prepared a special ward for swine flu but we are yet to receive any patient." The DMCH has prepared a 10-bed swine flu ward but no doctor was available for the ward. A hospital employee refusing to be named said if any patient arrives, they send them to ICDDR,B as their swine flu ward was yet to be ready. SSMCH director Brigadier General Khadimul Ihsan Md Iqbal told bdnews24.com, "A special ward has been prepared with four separate beds for male and female patients ." "On Monday we got two patients but transferred them to ICDDR,B for lack of necessary logistics support," Iqbal said. Pathetically enough, though DMCH and SSMCH have made separate wards for swine flu patients, they did not designate separate washrooms or toilets for them despite the fact that H1N1 positive patients always need to be segregated from others. Likewise, ICDDR,B is yet to be fully set for admitting swine flu patients. Prof Azharul Islam of ICDDR,B told bdnews24.com that two children were admitted with swine flu infection and they already left the hospital after being cured. "We have planned a special ward after we got the two children infected with H1N1 virus and the ward is likely to be fully operational soon," Islam said. He said ICDDR,B is going to have a 15-bed ward for swine flu suspects and another 20-bed ward for treating swine flu patients. The Contagious Diseases Hospital and National Chest Diseases Hospital have also opened two separate wards with ICU, but they have all together only 16 beds. Masudur Rahman, a physician at Contagious Diseases Hospital, said, "We have opened a 12bed ward and admitted a patient two days ago Every day we treat 15-20 patients and advise them to stay at home." Doctors say all swine flu patients need not be admitted in hospitals. Only those who are found with asthma, pneumonia, breathing problem or other serious problems need to be admitted for close monitoring. IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com, "Any patient diagnosed with H1N1 symptoms should be given swine flu treatment." bd
