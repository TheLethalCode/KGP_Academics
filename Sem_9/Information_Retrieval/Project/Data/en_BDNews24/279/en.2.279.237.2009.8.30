<TITLE> No quick fix for shabby Dhaka-Ctg highway </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)The 80-km stretch that runs from Chittagong to Feni along the Dhaka-Chittagong highway is riddled with holes and hollows. The shabby highway has exacerbated the frequent traffic tailbacks, adding to the miseries of the drivers and passengers and traders, but offcials say it is not getting repaired anytime soon. Casualties from crashes almost daily on this busiest highway in the country are on the rise while transportation of essential commodities also suffers glitches, as traffic snarls on the highway in the past month lasted as long as seven to ten hours. Drivers as well as Roads and Highways Department officials says pits and holes storing rainwater get soggy and their edges gradually give in to the pressure of the heavy vehicle tyres and widen their girths and depths befitting four-five feet long ditches. Starting from Chittagong via Chhoto Kumira, Barhabkunda, Sitakunda, Mirer Sharai, Feni and after that the long stretch up to Miarhat of the highway has been rendered almost impassable. Barely a couple of years after a Tk 150 crore facelift, the highway again badly needs large-scale repair and maintenance. Some of the damaged parts have been filled with bricks, which again assume horrifying dimensions with the incessant rainfalls and heavy traffic movement. The RHD officials hinted that the highway is not likely to be in shipshape anytime soon. It is due to be handed over to a new contractor firm for revamping it into a four-lane highway of international standards, said Chittagong RHD additional chief engineer Sayeed Ahmed. "We're trying to keep the road usable through small repairs. Major facelifts have not been possible due to lack of funds," Ahmed added. He said in the absence of any facilities for loaded vehicle weighing on the way, vehicles overly loaded with cargo extensively damage the weak or holed portions. "The tender processing before the reconstruction of the highway will take another two months; no big repairs may be possible to undertake before that," said Ahmed. After trundling along the highway, stumbling and stopping here and there and talking to the officials, drivers and businessmen, this correspondent felt that the highway needs to be urgently serviced. Because transportation of export cargo and commodities are suffering delaysat times the cargo rots, forcing businessmen to count heavy losses. Greenline Paribahan bus driver Mohammad Belal said he was taking eight to 10 hours to reach Dhaka now because of the highway condition. Half of the highway's width has been occupied for over 10 days by a truck broken down in a ditch across the road near Chhoto Kumira, he said. Bus drivers tending to make up for the time lost due to slow cruising or holdups often suffer accidents. Jahed Hossain, a Chittagong-based official of Greenline Poribahan, said his company's operation costs have risen due to a number of factors including excess fuel use and frequent vehicle repairs. The last major overhaul the highway had was at the fag end of the BNP-Jama'at coalition government's rule. bd
