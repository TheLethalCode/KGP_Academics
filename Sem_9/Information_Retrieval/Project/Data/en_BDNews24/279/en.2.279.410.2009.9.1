<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Sep 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Adam Voges has been added to Australia's one-day squad on tour in England to replace injured wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. Voges was already in England with Australia's Twenty20 team but will remain with the side for the one-day series after Haddin returned home for surgery on a broken finger. "With Brad Haddin's injury, the national selection panel has taken the opportunity to add Adam Voges to Australia's squad for the seven one-day internationals against England," chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement on Tuesday. "Adam will now stay with the squad for the remainder of the tour of England before travelling with the team to the ICC Champions Trophy in South Africa."
