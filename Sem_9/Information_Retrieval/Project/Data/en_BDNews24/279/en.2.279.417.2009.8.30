 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Opposition chief Khaleda Zia has congratulated Grameen Bank founder and Nobel laureate professor Muhammad Yunus on his being awarded the highest US civilian honour 'Presidential Medal of Freedom' recently. A BNP delegation led by joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan on Saturday carried Khaleda's congratulatory note to Yunus. Being the first ever Bangladeshi to win the highest civilian award of the US was certainly a matter of great pride for all Bangladeshis and the Nobel laureate had accomplished that feat, said Khaleda. Khaleda wished Yunus health and longevity. President Barak Obama on Aug 12 bestowed the medal on Yunus for his pioneering work in micro finance and 15 other luminaries in theatre, sports, science, humanities and politics at a White House ceremony. After delivering the letter, Khan said told bdnews24.com, "I handed over [Khaleda Zia's] congratulatory letter addressed to Dr Yunus to its recipient. The [leader] has conveyed to Dr Yunus that the whole nation felt exhilarated and marvelled at his great feat of honour." The five-member BNP delegation met with Yunus on Sunday morning at the Grameen Bank headquarters in Mirpur. Other members of the delegation were former caretaker government adviser Ruhul Amin, Khaleda's private secretary ASM Saleh Ahmed, special assistant Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas and Mahbub Al Amin. b
