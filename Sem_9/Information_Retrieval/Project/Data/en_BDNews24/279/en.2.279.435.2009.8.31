 Dhaka, Aug 31 (benews24.com)The Election Commission may consider a dialogue on the caretaker government issue in case the government forwards a written proposal, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Monday. "If the incumbent government seeks comments on the caretaker government system, we'll surely oblige," Huda told reporters at the EC after signing an MoU with South Korea National Election Commission. "We have our opinions, of course. But sure we would not like to volunteer such opinions in advance as it might occasion new national debates." On the local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam calling out to EC to stage dialogue on the issue, the election chief said, "We sure would not react to the newspaper statements. But we will definitely do something if the government asks us anything like that." He said the they were moving to propose amendment to the Representation of the People Order and added: "We're reviewing the RPO articles." "The Election Commission will present the necessary recommendations before the government after holding its dialogues with the civil societies, mass media and political parties." Huda hoped that parliament in its ensuing session will approve the laws governing the city corporations, municipalities and union parishads. Under the circumstances, elections to the these local government bodies might begin in January next year, he said. On behalf of South Korea National Election Commission, Lee Jong U gave 40 laptop computers to the Election Commission. Commissioners Muhammad Sahul Hossain and Mohammed Sakhawat Hossain, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir, UN resident coordinator and UNDP representative Renata Lock Dessalien and South Korean envoy Suk Bam Park were present on the occasion. Syed Ashraf, also ruling AL general secretary, said on August 18 that the caretaker government system had failed and added that discussions should begin now to determine if the system will stay in force in the future. The Election Commission can seek opinions on whether the interim government system should go or stay in force, he said. Sakhawat Hossain said on Aug 20 the commission would rather not include the issue in its proposed dialogue. The political parties, however, might as well present their views before the commission, Hossain added. bdnew
