 Comilla, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Violence flared at Comilla University and Khulna Medical College on Monday following student clashes and protests, with the former being forced to vacate its campus. Comilla University will shut its doors for a month from Tuesday after violent clashes erupted on the campus between two factions of Bangladesh Chhatra League. "Students were directed to vacate their halls by seven in the evening after the campus was declared closed from September 1st to October 1st," Kazi Mohibur Rahman, university registrar, told reporters. At least 12 students were injured when violence reignited on the campus Monday, after two rival Chhatra League factions had battled on Aug 25. Assortments of home made weapons were recovered from the administration building following the clashes, an official at the university said. Meanwhile, Khulna Medical College students vandalised the institution's associated hospital protesting harassment of the institution's principal by two doctors. The hospital's blood transfusion room and several wards were vandalised in addition to a number of doctor chambers, while over 50 windows were smashed at the hospital. KP Sarkar, the principal of KMC, told bdnews24.com the trouble flared when he tried to take action against two doctors who were found to be providing false medical injury certificates for police cases. The doctors in turn harassed him, he said. The students said they will boycott their classes until the doctors are removed.
