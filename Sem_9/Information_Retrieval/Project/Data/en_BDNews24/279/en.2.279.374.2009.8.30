 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)At least 2,252 MW will be added to the national power grid by 2011, with a third of that to be generated by year-end, a parliamentary committee said on Sunday. Officials at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on power said that 752 MW of electricity to be generated by December this year would reduce the chronic power outages across the country. "An additional 1500 mega watts will be added to the grid by 2011," Subid Ali Bhuiyan, chairman of the standing committee, told reporters after the committee meeting in parliament building. The chairman said the power situation had improved in the country due to efficient management of resources by the government. He said the daily production of electricity had increased to 4250 MW from the previous 3700 MW since the government came to power in January. Bhuiyan said his committee also stressed the need for exploiting renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind and wave. "We have to meet the domestic energy necessities from renewable sources. Gas and coal should only be used for industrial purposes," he said.
