 Sylhet, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)An earthquake measuring 5.3 on the Richter scale jolted Sylhet and areas close by early on Monday. Sylhet earthquake observation centre in charge Sayyid Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com that the quake happened at 2:47am and lasted for seconds. The epicentre of the quake, Chowdhury said, was 463 km away from Dhaka in Mizoram, India. No loss of property or life has been reported so far. A S M Maksud Kamal, national adviser on tsunami, cyclone and earthquake risk of the Comprehensive Disaster Management Programme (CDMP), told bdnews24.com, "There's no need to worry about such minor quakes." These small tremors take place frequently due to movement of plate boundary faults, added Kamal who also teaches geology at Dhaka University. "Destruction of property or life would not happen due to earthquakes under 7 on the Richter scale," he added. bdnewds2
