 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Two British ministers, arriving in Dhaka on Monday, said the UK will help Bangladesh secure the interests of the least developed countries (LDCs) at the critical Copenhagen climate negotiations in December this year. The assurance, from Douglas Alexander, UK minister for international development, and Ed Milliband, in-charge of energy and climate change, came a day before prime minister Sheikh Hasina flies to Geneva to attend to attend the World Climate Conference-3. "We will ... discuss how the UK can support Bangladesh in playing a key role as it represents the interests of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) at the crucial Copenhagen summit in December," Alaxander told reporters after landing in Dhaka. The two British ministers went on to meet Hasina and discussed climate change and development cooperation between the two countries. Bangladesh is the chair of the 50-member LDC Group, which includes the countries that would be most vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, mostly a result of emissions by developed countries. Rich nations, including Britain, want to forge an alliance with the LDCs to press emerging economic giants China and India to make commitments for reducing their green house gases too. UN member countries will meet in Copenhagen to frame a new international legal instrument to reduce carbon emissions replacing the existing Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol had emission reduction bindings for developed countries, but not for developing countries. The last major climate talks in Bali in 2007 recognised that major emerging economies will have to reduce emissions. The LDC alliance with the developed countries will mount pressure on China and India which are now seen as major emitters of greenhouse gases. "Bangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Its efforts in adaptation and risk reduction offer lessons and inspiration to the rest of the world. "The challenges are huge," Ed Milliband told reporters. "The UK is committed to helping Bangladesh meet these challenges". The visiting ministers had dinner with foreign minister Dipu Moni at the state guest house Padma on Monday evening. International Climate Champions Initiative Alexander and Milliband also opened the UK government's International Climate Champions Initiative in Bangladesh at the British High Commission Club on Monday. Under the initiative of the British Council, the UK government will send 15 Bangladeshi youths, aged between 18 and 35 years, to participate in the Copenhagen summit. The objective of the project is to create awareness about climate change and its adaptation among the young generation. The interested candidates will have to submit proposals on climate change and a panel, headed by Dr Atiq Rahman of Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies, will choose 15 candidates.
