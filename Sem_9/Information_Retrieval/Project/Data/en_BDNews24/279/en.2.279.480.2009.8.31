<TITLE> BDR chief calls for Peelkhana justice whichever law is used </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Bandarban, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Director general of the Bangladesh Riffles Maj Gen Moinul Islam said on Monday that justice must prevail in the Peelkhana mutiny trial regardless of the law employed. "Whatever the law used, we want justice," Islam told reporters after a Durbar at the Bolipara-10 Rifles headquarters in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. He said reform of the border security force was proceeding at a good pace, while a decision on a new name for the BDR would be finalised next week. "The new name might be the Bangladesh Border Guards," said Islam. The BDR chief, however, said the main reasons for the reforms were to improve overall discipline and define responsibilities, while changes in name and insignia were less important. He said proposals on more border camps had already been forwarded to the home ministry. "Camps will be set up every five kilometres along the border," said Islam, who added camps in the Chittagong Hill Tracts would also be increased. bdnews2
