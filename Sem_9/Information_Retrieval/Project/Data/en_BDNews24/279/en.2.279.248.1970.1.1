Google said the company was now exploring ways to make Chrome accessible to more people. "We are in the process of testing one such channel with Sony," according to a statement.

But Bencuya said Google was looking at striking similar deals with other PC makers. Google introduced the Chrome browser in September 2008 and remains a distant number four player in the browser market, with a 2.59 percent worldwide share in July according to market research firm Net Applications.
