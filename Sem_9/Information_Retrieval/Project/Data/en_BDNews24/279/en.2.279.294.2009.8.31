<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Heavy rain forced the first of two Twenty20 internationals at Old Trafford between England and Australia to be abandoned on Sunday. Australia notched up 145 for four wickets from their 20 overs and had reduced the hosts to four for two before rain intervened. The visitors found themselves 54 for three but Cameron White smashed 55 from 36 balls and added 78 for the fourth wicket with captain Michael Clarke who compiled a watchful 27 not out. England lost openers Joe Denly for a golden duck after he top-edged a spitting Brett Lee bouncer to square leg and Ravi Bopara for one when the Englishman nudged Mitchell Johnson to slip. The second Twenty20 will be played on Tuesday before the seven-match one-day international series from September 4 to 20 begins in London at the Oval.
