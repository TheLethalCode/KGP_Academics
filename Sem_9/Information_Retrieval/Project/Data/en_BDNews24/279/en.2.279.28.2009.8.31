<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer and Serena Williams will begin the defence of their US Open titles at Flushing Meadows on Monday, while Kim Clijsters returns to grand-slam tennis for the first time in two years. World number one Federer, chasing a modern-day record sixth straight title at Flushing Meadows, plays American wild card Devin Britton in the first round in his first grand-slam event since the birth of his twin daughters last month. The Swiss, bidding to add the US Open to the French Open and Wimbledon titles he won earlier this year, is hoping to equal the mark set by American Bill Tilden in the 1920s. Moreover, Federer can extend his record of grand-slam wins to 16 by winning in New York. It is a far cry from 12 months ago when he arrived in New York without having won one of the first three grand slams for the first time since 2002. "I'm just more relaxed this time," he said. "I've already won slams this year. That takes away pressure from having to do well here, like the feeling I had last year, not having won a slam last year, trying to get the first one. "This year is different. I feel like I'm playing great. That gives me obviously a lot of confidence and relaxes my mind." Fifth seed and 2003 winner Andy Roddick, the runner-up to Federer at Wimbledon, opens his campaign against German Bjorn Phau. Women's champion Serena Williams, seeded second, plays fellow American Alexa Glatch in the first round. Victory for Williams over the next two weeks would give her a 12th grand-slam title, equalling Billie-Jean King's mark. Serena's sister, third seed Venus Williams, plays the first night match against Russian Vera Dushevina, while the tournament begins (4:00 p.m. British time) with the return of Clijsters after two years off the tour. In her third event back, the Belgian former world number one, who had her first child 18 months ago, plays Viktoriya Kutuzova of Ukraine. Eighth seed Victoria Azarenka, Flavia Pennetta (10) and Amelie Mauresmo (17) are also in first-round action on Monday.
