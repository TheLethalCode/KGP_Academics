 CHAMAN, Pakistan, Aug 31,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Taliban militants set fire to 18 container trucks carrying supplies for Western forces in neighboring Afghanistan in the Pakistani border town of Chaman, police said on Monday. Some 300 trucks were parked near the border crossing in the country's southwest, as the border had been closed by Pakistani authorities since Friday in a row with their Afghan counterparts over the checking of trucks coming from landlocked Afghanistan.

They first opened fire with guns, then threw a rocket-propelled grenade toward our vehicles and ran away," Akhtar Mohammad Niazi, a driver, told Reuters. Rauf said the authorities had reopened the border crossing after the incident, which took place late on Sunday. "There's a constant threat to NATO supplies so we have decided to reopen the border after the last night attack," he added. Chaman is one of the two Pakistani border crossings used for the transport of food and fuel supplies to Western nations battling a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. The US military sends 75 percent of supplies for the Afghan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 percent of the fuel for its troops, the US Defense Department says.

The attacks, especially in the Khyber region have forced NATO to look for alternative routes, including through Central Asia into northern Afghanis
