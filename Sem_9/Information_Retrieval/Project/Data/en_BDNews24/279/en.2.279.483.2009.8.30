 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)The government has failed to achieve its target for food purchases from the domestic market within the four-month period given by the food ministry, forcing it to extend the deadline by 15 days. "The purchase period has been extended until September 15," food minister Abdur Razzaq told reporters after chairing a meeting of food planning committee at the Secretariat. The government began purchasing food stocks on May 1, with a target of 150,000 tonnes of paddy, 1,200,000 tonnes processed rice and 50,000 tonnes unprocessed rice. With the purchase deadline looming on Monday, stocks of paddy remain 64,000 tonnes short of the target, while there is a shortfall of 62,000 tonnes in rice stocks. Razzaq said rice mill owners in a part of Dinajpur district with a food-surplus failed to meet expected targets after rain interfered with the rice threshing process. The minister, however, said overall food stocks were in a satisfactory condition, with stores of 1,256,000 tonnes of rice and wheat. "Letter of credits for private management have also been opened to import 900,000 tonnes of rice, and the government is going to open letter of credits to import 100,000 tonnes of wheat as well," he said. bdn
