 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)The government has decided to build a 50,000 MT concrete wheat grain silo at Joimonirgol near Mongla port, according to the food minister. The decision came from at an interministerial meeting presided over by minister Abdur Razzaque in the food ministry at the Secretariat on Sunday. He told reporters that now only 15 lakh metric tonnes of food grains can be stored, which is pretty inadequate. The government will build food silos for storing at least another seven lakh tonnes of food grains. The proposed silo to be built at Joimonirgol, 13 km from Mongla, will also have a special jetty built there matching the silo, he said. The Japan-assisted Tk 230 crore silo and jetty construction project was initially approved by the ECNEC in 1997, but it was never implemented in the past decade. A priority project of the incumbent government, the proposed food silo site has been selected because the river channel at Joimonirgol has sufficient depth, above nine feet, for 25-30,000 MT food grains-carrying ships to navigate. The ministry officials said Mongla port handles about 40 percent of the imported food grains, which should be handled much more efficiently once a large food silo goes up. The meeting discussed and decided various relevant issues such as land acquisition, building a bridge across the Mongla channel or operating round-the-clock ferry service, widening highway, strengthening the culverts for heavy vehicles and providing power and other infrastructural supports. The interministerial meeting was also attended by food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman, additional secretary Ahmed Hossain Khan, joint secretary Jahirul Haque, Mongla Port Authority member Abdul Mannan, Roads and Highways Division joint secretary Nasir Uddin Khan and representatives from BIWTA, BIWTC, shipping ministry, land ministry and Rural Electrification Board. b
