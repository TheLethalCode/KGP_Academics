 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)State minister for home affairs Shamsul Haque Tuku on Sunday gave a stark warning to banned organisations operating in the north-western region of the country, telling them to "surrender or suffer the consequences". "Law enforcers are working to curb violence in the north-western region. Steps will be taken against these criminal activities, and none will be spared," Tuku told reporters at the opening ceremony of the newly built Chawkbazar Police Station in Dhaka's old city. "If they surrender we will welcome them. I ask them to come back to the right track and work for a better country with the common people," said Tuku. He said the government would consider a general amnesty for certain individuals who surrendered themselves to the authorities, although the state minister did not elaborate on his comment. The Awami League government of 1996-2001 offered a temporary general amnesty to banned organisations who surrendered to the authorities with their arms, said Tuku. The new Chawkbazar Police Station is located adjacent to the old Lalbag Police Station. The number of police stations in the metropolitan area is now 38, with three more planned for Ganderia, Bongshal and Kalabagan. State minister for law Kamrul Islam, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Shahidul Haque and local MP Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin also attended the programme. bd
