<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)Police have remanded Abul Kalam Azad, chairman of Azad Group, in custody for one day to grill him after his arrest early on Friday on charges of attempting to murder a police officer. Paltan appealed for a five-day remand to question him over the case that accuses him of attempting to murder CID inspector Golam Sarwar. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Muhammad Abdur Rahim dismissed the bail prayer submitted by Azad's lawyers Noor Hossain Balai and Kazi Najibullah Hiru and put him on remand in custody. After submitting remand prayer in the court, M A Haque, general recording officer of police, said, "The plaintiff had gone to Grand Azad Hotel to investigate the counterfeit foreign currency dealing allegations brought against Abul Kalam Azad." "The Azad and his henchmen tried to kill him." The remand prayer mentioned Azad's possible involvement in the BDR rebellion as well. Azad's lawyers said police officer Sarwar had gone to see their client to seek a position for his brother. He pushed into Azad's private chamber without permission and got infuriated and attacked the host when asked to explain his rather rude entry, they told the court. The lawyers said Azad should have moved first to sue anyone in this case; unfortunately, the table has been turned and the aggrieved has been accused. They also alleged that the police were active in this case as the plaintiff is a police officer. Azad was taken from Paltan Police Station to the court at around 1pm. Arrest Paltan police chief Mujibur Rahman told bdnews24.com earlier that Sarwar was an acquaintance of Azad, the chairman of Azad Group and owner of the Grand Azad Hotel chain. Sarwar had gone to the Grand Azad Hotel in Purana Paltan, Dhaka, on Thursday afternoon to meet Azad to discuss a job for Sarwar's brother. As informed by a staff member, the inspector found Azad in room 205 of the hotel. According to case details, Azad was "furious" at Sarwar for coming to see him at the hotel without prior notice and, ganging up with 10 or 12 of his employees, he allegedly beat him up. Rahman said Sarwar left the hotel, received treatment for his injuries and lodged a case with Paltan police in the evening. Police arrested Azad just after midnight as Sarwar's allegation was primarily substantiated after initial enquiries, Rahman said. bdnew
