 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's official swine flu tally rose to 194 on Saturday with 31 new cases confirmed, the highest one-day jump since the health ministry detected the first case in the country on June 18. Bangladesh may raise its H1N1 alert to level 3, signalling an epidemic, in light of recent jumps in the number of detected swine flu cases, experts at a swine flu seminar at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University said. The previous highest rise in a single day was 22 new cases recorded last Wednesday. Dr Mahmudur Rahman of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) told bdnews24.com initial swine flu cases detected in the country had arrived from overseas, but the trend had now clearly shifted to rising infections within the country. Officials and doctors at the BSMMU seminar said there was no cause for panic but stressed the need for better dissemination of information about swine flu to ensure people in both urban and rural areas go for proper treatment and take simple measures to curb the spread of the virus. They said the virus was now being transmitted at higher rates within the country, and said the public should make use of swine flu treatment facilities in place at every district-level hospital in the country. Senior scientific officer of IEDCR Mushtuq Husain told the seminar that the country was now at alert level 2, but could soon be at level 3, as the rising number of detected cases gave an indication of the actual spread of the virus across the country. Dr Nazrul Islam, former vice chancellor of BSMMU, told the seminar, "The spread of swine flu is rising and we cannot remain isolated from it in this globalised world." But all who spoke stressed there was no reason for panic as doctors across the country were being trained to deal with the situation and the government has sufficient stocks of flu drugs in place. Mushtuq Husain said, "We have been alert since the day WHO declared a pandemic." The World Health Organization declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on June 11. Bangladesh's first case was detected a week later. Husain said the country was preparing for level 3. "But the IEDCR or health ministry can't raise the alert." An epidemic alert for Bangladesh could only be officially declared from the prime minister's office, he said. "An action plan has been developed to fight this sort of situation, which will be implemented after the prime minister's approval," Husein said. "It might require stricter control at airports and other immigration points. The decisions will come from inter-ministry meetings."
