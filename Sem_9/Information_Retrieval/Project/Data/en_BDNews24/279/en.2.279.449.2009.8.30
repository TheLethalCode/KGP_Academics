 SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium Aug 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's hopes of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix in 2011 are on track despite exchange control obstacles, according to Force India team owner Vijay Mallya. In January, the Indian sports ministry rejected a request by race promoters JPSK Sports to remit $36.5 million in foreign currency to Bernie Ecclestone's British-based Formula One Administration (FOA).

"I don't know where these rumours are coming from about the team," he said. "The team's alright, the team is in good shape and we are improving with every race as you can see. I didn't get into it to get out of it." Mallya, whose United Spirits is the world's third largest spirits maker, said his core liquor business was performing well. "The airline industry is under pressure, but not only in India," he told reporters. "My finances do not depend on the airline and neither do Force India's finances depend on the performance of any of my companies. Force India is securely funded and I am committed to stay here as everybody kno
