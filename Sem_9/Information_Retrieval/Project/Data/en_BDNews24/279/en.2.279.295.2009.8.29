 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  Senior BNP joint secretary general Mirza Abbas Saturday demanded a purge of the party's plotters from the party, indicating the so-called 'reformist' faction. "We should launch a purging drive against the plotters and betrayers who now remain in silence inside the party," he told a meeting at BNP's metropolitan office in Naya Paltan. Hinting at those who came to be known as 'reformists', during the past caretaker government period, the BNP leader said: "The plotters are still continuing with their schemes within the party ... and they are being rewarded by certain quarters." "But people who worked risking their lives for the party are still being harassed and facing cases. "The plotters are involved in conspiracy so that BNP programmes are not implemented successfully. They still want to undermine the party," Abbas said. Abbas said: "That group has found a fine position inside the party and the government as well." "If we speak against them we face threats and charges. Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu is still behind bars." The meeting was held to organise programmes to mark the release day of party chief Khaleda Zia from jail on Sept 11 last year, and her son Tarique Rahman on Sept 3. The party has organised seven days of upcoming programmes across the country in all. BNP will observe programmes on Aug 31 and Sept 1 marking the founding anniversary of the party. Sept 3 will mark Tarique's release last year. It will hold protest rallies on Sept 6 and 7 against price hikes and deterioration of law and order. The party will mark Khaleda's release with programmes on Sept 10 and 11. b
