<TEXT>
 CHENNAI, India, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian tennis player Sania Mirza has received acupuncture treatment on a painful right wrist to be ready for the US Open starting on Monday, local media reported on Friday. The 22-year-old, who reached the US Open fourth round in 2005 and the third round in 2007, underwent wrist surgery in April last year but was sidelined from the New York event after the problem flared up during the preceding Beijing Olympics. Mirza became the first Indian to win a WTA tour event in 2005 and touched a world ranking of 27 two years ago, but has now slipped to 71 in the list. She flew home to Hyderabad last week after the pain returned while playing in the US. "I started feeling some pain on my right wrist in the semifinal in Vancouver (challenger)," Mirza told the Times of India. "It got worse with every match. I thought it would be better to get some treatment before the US Open. "I'm much better now, but not absolutely pain-free," she said. "I've had a good run of matches and I'm striking the ball well. Hopefully, the wrist will hold up."
