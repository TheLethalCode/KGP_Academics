 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Sunday sent Azad Group chairman Abul Kalam Azad to jail in a forgery case after granting him bail the same day in a case accusing him of attempted murder of a police officer. Azad was produced before Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court after being in remand following his arrest at the Grand Azad Hotel in the early hours of Friday. The investigation officer in the attempted murder case Mazharul Amin filed the forgery case against him on Sunday morning. Amin's case statement said he recovered two seals that are used by government offices and a design of a high-rise building. The statement alleged the accused had kept these seals in his office with a motive to forge documents. The attempted murder case was filed by CID inspector Golam Sarwar on Thursday evening, who alleged that Azad along with several employees at the Grand Azad Hotel, owned by the accused, had assaulted him putting his life at risk. During the hearing, Azad's lawyer Syed Rezaur Rahman and Noor Hossain Bolai told the court that the plaintiff of the assault case Sarwar went to the hotel on Thursday with an "ill-motive". Failing to pursue his "ill-motive", he filed the case against Azad, said Rahman. FBCCI 'concerned' The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, meanwhile, expressed concern over Azad's arrest and remand. In a statement released Sunday, the country's apex business body said, "The business community is concerned that a prominent businessman of the country was sent into remand in police custody in a police-related case." The federation called for "proper and impartial investigation" to ensure justice for all. The statement also reported the Azad family's allegations of his torture at the hands of police in remand. bdnews24
