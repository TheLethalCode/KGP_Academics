 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)A local businessman has said he wishes to take control of the capital's traffic management systems from Dhaka City Corporation and the police in order to reduce the city's crippling gridlock, although he failed to elaborate on the details of his plan. "Traffic congestion will not be reduced in Dhaka if we follow the same systems used in India, Malaysia, China, Japan or Thailand. We must employ our own systems to reduce traffic jams," Bhuiyan, introducing himself as the chairman of Bhuiyan Kallyan Trust, told reporters at a press briefing at the Dhaka Reporters Unity auditorium on Saturday. He said traffic congestion in the capital could be reduced 20 percent by following 'scientific methods', while a further 20 percent of the city's jams could be removed by properly managing roundabouts. "Implementation of planned bus bays in the city would remove another 10 percent of traffic congestion from the roads," he said. He did not expand further on what his traffic management plans involved, or how they would be financed and implemented. Bhuiyan said he had not discussion his plans with any government body, including the capitals two traffic controlling agencies, Dhaka Metropolitan Police and DCC, although he had prepared a presentation and would discuss the issues with them soon.
