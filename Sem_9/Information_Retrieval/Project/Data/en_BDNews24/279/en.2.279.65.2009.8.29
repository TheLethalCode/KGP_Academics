 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)  A woman doctor was found hanged at her home in Jatrabari on the outskirts of Dhaka early Saturday, police said. Jatrabari police chief Muniruzzaman said they had recovered the hanged body of 28-year old Tamanna Haque Sonia from her bedroom at her in-law's house in Bibirbagicha. Muniruzzaman told bdnews24.com that Sonia's father-in-law Farhaduddin had phoned the police station early Saturday as there was no sound from the room. Police recovered the body by breaking down the door, he said. Sonia's family blamed her husband Dr Fakrul Islam, employed at Mitford Hospital, for the death. Her cousin Hasanul Munir alleged that Fakrul and his mother had tortured Sonia since her marriage in 2007. Fakrul has fled the scene after causing the death, Munir claimed. The husband has not been located since the incident, Jatrabari police chief Muniruzzaman said. Sonia was doing two years' training at Mitford Hospital, her sister Sadia Haque said.
