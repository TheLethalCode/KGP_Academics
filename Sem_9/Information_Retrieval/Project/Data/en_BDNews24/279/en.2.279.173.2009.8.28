<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)--Some businessmen are pushing the prices of essential commodities up, the commerce minister has alleged. "The price is increasing because of the actions of some businessmen. We will see for a day or two. If the price still increases illogically then we will take steps," he said said at a seminar on self-dependence and self-consciousness in the capital on Friday. Although, price of some products, like eggplants, green chilies and sugar, increased in Ramadan, the market is stable, he said. The price of egg started falling with the announcement of egg import, he said. "We do not want to import eggs but we expect that egg producers will not increase the price," he added. The government will allocate loans to farmers to enable them to bring their produces directly to the market, eliminating the chain of middlemen. "The loan will be given to increase agricultural production and direct transportation of the goods by the farmers," he said. The price of agro-products increases greatly by the time it reaches the retail market from the field because of the middlemen. The farmers don't get the price they expect for the produce while the consumers pay more than they should. "We have given approval to the construction of a power plant [on Thursday]. We will give a few more such approvals this year. Five to six thousand megawatts of electricity will be added within three to five years," he said. The seminar was arranged by Transform Bangladesh Trust, a Christian youth organization. b
