<TITLE> Communists to open up West Bengal food market </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KOLKATA, India, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Communist-ruled West Bengal has begun amending laws that could eventually allow foreign corporations to retail agricultural produce, opening up an annual market potentially worth more than $600 million. In its more than 30 years of rule in West Bengal, the communist government blocked private firms from entering agriculture, arguing that profit-minded corporations would exploit farmers. But with agriculture stagnating, land short in supply and unemployment on the rise, the communists started to change tack about five years ago, aggressively wooing private investment. That move did not go down well with many farmers, the communists' traditional support base, who voted against them in an election this year. But the government insisted it was not going back on its pro-industry policy. "The government has started the process of amending the APMC (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee) Act to clear grey areas regarding entry of MNCs and big companies," Mortaza Hossain, West Bengal farm marketing minister, said. "We will debate the amendments...and then enforce it." The amended law will help small farmers who are now mostly forced to sell their produce to middle men and big farmers at lower prices. Marginal farmers are a majority in eastern India. "Allowing multinationals and big firms will be a good move, as small farmers will be able to sell their produce directly by eliminating middlemen and the bigger farmers," said Abhirup Sarkar, an economist with the Indian Statistical Institute. India allows foreign multiple-brand retailers to operate only via wholesale or franchise and licence arrangements in its fast-growing retail market, which is forecast to nearly double from an estimated $350 billion by 2015. India's booming retail sector has attracted the world's largest retailer Wal-Mart and global No. 3 Tesco to India in joint ventures with Bharti Enterprises and the Tata Group respectively. West Bengal last year permitted Germany's Metro AG to open its cash and carry wholesale arm. Some experts said the new amendment, which would open up a market for agricultural produce worth at least $615 million annually, could anger big farmers. "I think it will ruffle the big farmers who will try to react adversely and even resort to coersion to stop the entry of big companies in agri-retail," Dipankar Dasgupta, an economist said. The amendment proposal, however, does not contain any plans for allowing large corporations in contract farming.
