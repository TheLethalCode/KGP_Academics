 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)The Private University Act 2009 is set to be finalised with an option for representatives of the chancellor to attend convocations in his or her stead, ending recent speculation that the president would lose ex officio chancellorship of the country's private universities. University Grants Commission chairman Professor Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com on Sunday the draft law, aiming to raise education standards in the sector that has long been accused of irregularities, is set to be tabled in the upcoming parliament session. "We have submitted a draft of the law to the ministry and expect it to be placed in the next parliament session scheduled to sit from Sept 7." The proposed law stipulates that though the president shall continue to be ex officio chancellor, he may send his representatives to a university convocation in his absence, the UGC chairman said. Islam also said he expects the new act will curb long-standing irregularities in the private university sector. There are 51 private universities in Bangladesh at present, many of which are charged, most commonly, with setting up without proper of proper facilities and providing sub-standard education. Officials of the UGC and the education ministry said the draft act has been finalised incorporating provisions such as formation of an accreditation body in a bid to control standards and assess academic activities of private universities. The proposed act also recommends further empowerment of the vice chancellor as the existing law allows private university chairmen extensive powers, which has led in some cases to their abuse. The proposed law also has specific provisions regulating part-time teachers, stating that the number of part-time teachers shall not comprise more than one quarter of the university faculty. It also stipulates that a full time teacher will not be able to work as a part-timer in more than one other institution, and no teacher will be allowed to work part-time elsewhere without permission of his appointing authority Though the immediate past caretaker government passed the Private University Ordinance 2008 on Nov 24, it became ineffective for not being enacted in time by the ninth parliament. An education ministry official told bdnews24.com that the proposed act would be sent to the cabinet for approval and subsequently placed in the parliament as a bill. bd
