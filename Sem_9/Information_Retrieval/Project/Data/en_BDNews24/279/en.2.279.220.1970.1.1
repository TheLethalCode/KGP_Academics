 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Stocks opened the week day in the red as low investor participation led indices on the twin bourses to edge down with turnover registering a significant fall. Navana CNG, however, debuted on the Dhaka and Chittagong exchanges on Sunday with a strong performance. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index slipped almost 12 points to end on 2966.21, while turnover slumped to Tk 3.93 billion from Thursday's Tk 5.10 billion. The DSI or all-share price index closed at 2492.10, falling 9.60 points, or 0.38 percent, while the blue-chip DSE-20 dropped 4 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2104.73. Sunday's trading caused more than sixty percent of issues to decline. Losers outnumbered gainers 152 to 77, with five holding steady. Meanwhile, Navana CNG, a concern of Navana Group, debuted with its price closing more than nineteen times its face value. The company, which converts cars to run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and operates re-fuelling stations, floated 18 million ordinary shares of Tk 10 each through direct listing. Earlier, it disclosed its earnings per-share till May 20, 2009 at Tk 4.04, and a paid-up capital of Tk 366 million. According to direct listing procedures, trading opened with investors bidding for a 10-minute period to establish a price. Selling got underway based on the highest bid, which was Tk 181. Navana CNG's price reached Tk 270, but subsequently fell, ending on Tk 193.90. Market experts termed the price "irrational". "In a rational scenario, the price may go up to 3 or 4 times, but almost 20 times is outrageous," mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com. "The lack of share supply in the market was mainly responsible for the price going so high. "Problems occur when an overpriced market creates a bubble, and someday the bubble has to burst, which crashes the market," said Sayeed. "However, an influx of IPOs created another diversion for investors, which saved the market from a disaster for now," said Sayeed, the top official of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh. The rush on Navana CNG left it leading the turnover board, with Tk 315.781 million shares changing hands. Off-dock service provider Summit Alliance Port Ltd followed with a turnover of Tk 202.155 million, closing 1.46 percent down, to Tk 2217.25. ICB 2nd NRB Mutual Fund rose 4.1 percent to Tk 228.25. It had shares of Tk 181.589 million traded. Aftab Automobile's turnover reached Tk 174.579 million, slipping 0.69 percent to finish at Tk 1640.50. Beximco lost 0.81 percent to close at Tk 279.70, seeing Tk 127.770 million worth of shares traded. Among the other scrips on the turnover boardBex Tex, Jamuna Oil, Heidelberg Cement and First Lease International fell. AIMS 1st Mutual Fund gained. bd
