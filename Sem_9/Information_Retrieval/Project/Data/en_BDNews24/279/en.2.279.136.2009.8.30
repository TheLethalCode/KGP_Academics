 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)--A parliamentary watchdog chief has termed prime minister's advisor H T Imam's comments on the summons "indecent and irrelevant. He said his committee was only doing its constitutional duties by asking three high officials to appear before the panel. Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law ministry, at a press conference on Sunday reiterated that his standing committee unanimously decided to summon them to know about the government's decision to sack two judges and then reinstate them. The standing committee at its meeting on Aug 27 decided to invite Imam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud to clear their position. Imam told reporters at his Hare Road residence on Friday suggested that Sengupta may have summoned the adviser from his sense of deprivation in the ruling coalition. He also said some elements "in the ruling party but not in the cabinet" may have contributed to call them before the parliament panel. Imam said he was not yet decided about whether to appear before the committee to clarify his role. "I reiterate that the standing committee unanimously decided calling them to the standing committee to ensure the transparency and accountability of the government," the committee chief said, showing two cassettes of proceedings of the standing committee. "According to the constitution and rules of procedure, I can call you to appear before the committee. It is up to you whether you will come or not," he said. State minister for law Quamrul Islam on Saturday said that the committee did not decide to summon the three officials. He also said sacking of the two judges was a "settled issue" and the standing committee need not discuss it. The government sent Dhaka district and sessions judge Mohammed Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression (prevention) tribunal judge Mohammed Shahjahan into retirement on July 30 without the consent of the Supreme Court, a decision that was overturned just days later. They are also Bangladesh Judicial Service Association president and secretary general, respectively. The two judges had led a demonstration at the law ministry protesting certain procedures in the government's separation of the judiciary from the executive. Supporters of judges Gafur and Shahjahan opposed the decision to retire them and issued a deadline for their reinstatement. The government reinstated the two on Aug 2. The decision to reinstate the two judges was taken after they had sought amnesty from the prime minister, Imam said. "There are ups and downs in politics. He has gone up and I thank him for his success; I have respect for him," Sengupta said of Imam.. "But it is not fair to say that I and my committee have decided to call him to the standing committee from a sense of deprivation. "Most of his comments were irrelevant, indecent, undemocratic and against the parliamentary norms," said the AL leader, who was reduced to an adviser to the Awami League president from a policymaking presidium member. He is seen as "one of the reformists" who publicly criticised AL chief prime minister Sheikh Hasina's firm grip on the party. Hasina has made him the chairman of the standing committee. "I have taken oath to perform the duties of an MP as per the constitution and rules of procedure and carry out my job without being influenced by personal factors. "As per the rules of procedure, the standing committee has the authority to investigate any alleged irregularities of the ministry. "So, I and my committee have worked according to the guidelines of the constitution to discuss the controversial sacking of the two judges," said Sengupta. He said the standing committee decided to discuss the issue since the first decision of the government to sack the judges was wrong. Sengupta said the government could not suspend any judge since the judiciary was independent of the executive. In line with the constitution, he said, the authority to sack judges vested with the president who would act according to the suggestion of the Supreme Court. Suranjit told journalists that H T Imam initiated the file, also signed by law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud, on sacking the two judges. He also said law minister and state minister did not sign the file.
