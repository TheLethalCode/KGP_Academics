<TEXT>
 Dhaka,Aug 29(bdnews24.com)FBCCI president Anisul Huq said on Saturday that prices of kitchen markets essentials in the country remained at a "tolerable level", although the country's apex trade federation would probe reasons behind ongoing elevated sugar prices. "The prices of goods like chilli and brinjal, which were high on the first day of Ramadan, have now come down to a tolerable level," the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry president told reporters after visiting Banalata Market in the city. Huq said the FBCCI would investigate reasons behind continued high sugar prices, despite withdrawal of government duty on the essential. The FBCCI chief, however, cautioned that price increases in certain goods are commonplace during Ramadan.
