 LONDON, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain agreed to include Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset al-Megrahi in a prisoner transfer deal with Libya because of "overwhelming interests" shortly before an oil deal was sealed with Tripoli, a newspaper reported on Sunday. The Sunday Times said leaked letters from Justice Secretary Jack Straw undermined government denials of a link between the former Libyan agent's freedom and British trade interests. Megrahi, 57, was released from jail on August 20 after Scottish authorities said his terminal cancer gave compassionate grounds for him to return home to die. The release of the only person convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie that killed 270 people, and his rapturous reception in Tripoli, has angered the United States government, which lost 189 citizens.

Cabinet minister John Denham told Sky News it was "perfectly clear" there was no link between Megrahi and any trade deals, given that Scotland eventually released him on compassionate grounds and not under the transfer agreement. The negotiations on prisoner transfers had been part of the "broader normalization of relations with Libya," he s
