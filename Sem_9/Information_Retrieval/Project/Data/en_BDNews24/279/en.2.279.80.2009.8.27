 ISLAMABAD, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 12 Pakistani border police were killed on Thursday in a suspected suicide bomb attack at the main crossing point into Afghanistan, government officials said. "They were breaking their fast when a bomber blew himself up near them. So far, we have reports that 12 people have been killed," a government official told Reuters by telephone from Jamrud, the main town in the Khyber region. He was referring to the end of fasting at sunset during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
