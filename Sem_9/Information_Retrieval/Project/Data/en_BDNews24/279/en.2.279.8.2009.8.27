 Dhaka, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons has been diagnosed with skin cancer and will undergo surgery in Australia, reports Cricinfo. "I have skin cancer near my eye and I will need a surgery to have it removed on Thursday," Siddons was quoted as saying in Bangla daily Prothom Alo. "The plastic surgeon says it should be straight forward and I can travel back in two weeks if there are no complications after surgery. "I'm hoping for a smooth outcome from the surgery. It all depends on the spread of the cancer when they start looking. I'm only here (in Australia) for surgery, not for holidays. I already put this surgery off by eight weeks so I could be with the team on the tour." Siddons did not return to Bangladesh following the tour of Zimbabwe and went to Australia instead. His contract as Bangladesh coach expires in November but he expressed the desire to continue with the team until the 2011 World
