<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)The prime minister's advisor H T Imam said on Friday that two judges had been sent into forced retirement on the prime minister's orders in July and in line with a 1974 law. Speaking to reporters at his Hare Road residence, Imam said he was not yet decided about whether to appear before the parliamentary standing committee on law, justice and parliamentary affairs ministry to clarify his role. He said he would look into the parliamentary committee's scope of work before making a decision.. The committee chief Suranjit Sengupta said on Thursday that Imam had initiated the file. On the committee's summons, he said that he believed one or two committee members, whose remarks sometimes became unrestrained, provoked the summons. The advisor claimed that the decision to sack the judges conformed to a relevant 1974 law. The decision came in line with the constitution as that law had not been repealed yet, he also said. The government sent Dhaka district and sessions judge Mohammed Abdul Gafur and Gazipur district women and children repression (prevention) tribunal judge Mohammed Shahjahan into retirement on July 30 without the consent of the Supreme Court, a decision that was overturned just days later. They are also Bangladesh Judicial Service Association president and secretary general, respectively. Imam said he would look into the scope of the parliamentary committee's work. "You know over which issue it took place. The prime minister ordered the law minister for an instant step after [that incident] at the Secretariat," he pointed out. The two judges had led a demonstration at the law ministry protesting certain procedures in the government's separation of the judiciary from the executive. Supporters of judges Gafur and Shahjahan opposed the decision to retire them and issued a deadline for their reinstatement. The government reinstated the two on Aug 2. The decision to reinstate the two judges was taken after they had sought amnesty from the prime minister, Imam said. The parliamentary committee on Thursday decided to summon Imam, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud to explain the government's decision. Thursday's meeting of the committee disclosed that law minister Shafique Ahmed and his deputy Kamrul Islam did not know of the decision, either. Committee chairman Suranjit Sengupta told reporters on Thursday that the government's decision on the retirement of judges, and their reinstatement just days later, "embarrassed" the prime minister's office. "According to the papers submitted to the committee, we have seen that the prime minister's adviser H T Imam had initiated the file on forceful retirement of the two judges. "Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and establishment secretary Iqbal Mahmud also played a role in the process. "We have unanimously decided to call the three before the committee to justify the decision," Sengupta told reporters after the committee's meeting that was also attended by the law minister. The chairman said they would need to clarify whether they sought opinion of the Supreme Court, as per Article 116 of the Constitution, before making such an imortant decision. "The papers also show that neither the law minister nor state minister for law had signed the retirement order. "Law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal will be summoned first to appear at our Sept 9 meeting to explain his action," said Sengupta. bdnews24
