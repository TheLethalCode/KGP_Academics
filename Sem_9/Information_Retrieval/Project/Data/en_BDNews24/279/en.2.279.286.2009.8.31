 LOS ANGELES Aug 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - "Rachael Ray" and "The Tyra Banks Show" won the talk show categories at the Daytime Emmy Awards for the second consecutive year on Sunday, while the women of "The View" ended Ellen DeGeneres' four-year reign as best talk show host. "Cristina's Court," now in its third season on Fox, beat out veterans "Judge Judy" and "The People's Court," among other nominees, to claim the prize for best legal/courtroom program also for a second year. "Rachael Ray" took home the "entertainment" talk show prize, while "Tyra Banks" won the "informative" prize. Both shows are syndicated. The talk show category was split into two for the first time last year. Both Ray and DeGeneres were nominated for best talk show host, alongside Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa of "Live with Regis and Kelly," but they lost to ABC's "The View" and co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Sherri Shepherd and Barbara Walters. But "The View" was a surprise absentee from the entertainment talk show category. Meanwhile, CBS' "The Bold and The Beautiful" was named best drama, beating out ABC's "All My Children" and NBC's "Days of Our Lives." But the soap won just two prizes overall. The top acting prizes were shared among the soaps, with Christian LeBlanc winning for his lead role in CBS' "The Young and the Restless" and Susan Haskell taking the corresponding prize for ABC's "One Life To Live." Supporting honors went to Tamara Braun for "Days of Our Lives," while Vincent Irizarry of "All My Children" tied with Jeff Branson of CBS' "Guiding Light." In all, "One Life to Live" and "All My Children" led the field with five Emmys each, while PBS' "Sesame Street," "The View," "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and "El Tigre" won four each. "All My Children" went into the event with a leading 19 nominations. ABC was the top network, with 17 awards, followed by public broadcaster PBS with 16. ABC had led the field with 50 nominations. The 36th annual awards, hosted by "Ugly Betty" co-star Vanessa Williams, were held at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Los Angeles, a sign of the event's diminishing prestige. It used to be held at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood, home of the Oscars, and broadcast on a major network. But after last year's show hit a record low of 5.4 million viewers, ABC declined to renew its contract, and this year's show ended up on the CW, a niche channel that targets young women. ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. Fox is a unit of News Corp. NBC is a unit of General Electric Co. CBS is a unit of CBS C
