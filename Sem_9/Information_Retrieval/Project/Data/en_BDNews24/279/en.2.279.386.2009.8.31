 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Aug 31(bdnews24.com)The government is set to distribute free Aman rice seedlings to farmers in the north of the country, who were hit by flash floods this month as late monsoon rains ended a worrying period of drought in July. "We have learnt that farmers have sufficient seedlings for now, but we are ready to supply them to farmers whose beds may bedamaged by the recent flooding," Md Fazlul Haq, director of the Department of Agricultural Extension, told bdnews24.com on Monday. "Farmers in the north are now preparing their land to plant Aman paddy after floodwaters, covering about 100,000 hectares in greater Rangpur and Bogra, recede," Haq said. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, plantation of Aman rice this season has been completed in about 80 percent of targeted land throughout the country. "We fixed a target of some 54 lakh hectares for Aman cultivation in the current season, of which some 43 lakh hectors have already been planted," said Haq. He said this year's target was lowered from 56 lakh hectares last year due to the low price of paddy in the wholesale market. Brac executive director and agriculture researcher Mahbub Hossain told bdnews24.com that the low price of paddy was also one reason behind the reduced target. "Farmers are tending to cultivate jute for its higher price, after which they go for vegetable cultivation," Hossain said. He said a good Aman harvest would be achieved if plantation was completed by August. "However, yield on crops planted after August may fall 30 percent on expected returns," Hossain said. The government has also decided to install 9,470 deep tube-wells for farmers in the north of the country to mitigate drought impact on Aman production. bdnews2
