 Khulna, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)--Four medical teams are working at three land ports and one seaport of the Khulna division to prevent foreigners and Bangladeshis carrying swine flu from abroad. The ports are Benapol of Jessore, Bhomra of Satkhira, Darshana of Chuadanga and Mongla seaport at Bagerhat, said officials at the Khulna divisional health office. "Arrangements have been made for separate wards to quarantine swine flu-affected patients at the hospitals and upazila health complexes of ten districts including the four ports," said Dr Md Harun-ar-Rashid, acting health director of Khulna Division, to bdnews24.com. Moreover, he said, there is a good stock of medicine to cure swine flu. Only three swine flu patients, including a child, have been detected in Jessore until now and all of them are under treatment, said Rashid. However, Khulna deputy civil surgeon Dr Mir Daud Ali said that no swine flu patients have been found in Khulna but the hospitals were prepared and there were sufficient medicines. bdnews
