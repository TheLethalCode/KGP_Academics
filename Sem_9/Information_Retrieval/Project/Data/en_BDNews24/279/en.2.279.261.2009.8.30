<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court again deferred hearing of embezzlement charges against opposition BNP chief Khaleda Zia in the Zia Orphanage Trust case on Sunday, as she, son Tarique Rahman and two other defendants did not appear. Senior metropolitan special judge ANM Bashirullah set Sep 7 for the next hearing when the defendants will have to appear. The court also directed the government to ensure security for Khaleda, a two-time former prime minister, to facilitate her appearance in the court on the next hearing day. Defence lawyer Masud Ahmed Talukder told the court his client could not appear because of security concerns. Tarique could not appear in the court since he is staying in London for medical treatment, he said. Two other defendants, former BNP MP Kazi Salimul Haque and Sharfuddin Ahmed, were present in the court. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the court against Khaleda, Tarique and four others on Aug 5. Khaleda and the others face charges of embezzling more than Tk 2 crore by throwing up the Trust that allegedly exists only on paper. The other defendants in the case are Mominur Rahman, a nephew of Khaleda, and former principal secretary at the prime minister's office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui. A total of 36 people have been listed as state witnesses in the case, according to investigation officer Harun-or-Rashid. The Supreme Court in the first week of August upheld the previous High Court bail orders secured by both Khaleda and Tarique in the case filed with Ramna Police Station on July 3, 2008. b
