 Syed Nahas Pasha, from London London, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com)--GPs and health professionals working in maternity, obstetrics, gynaecology, and sexual health are being asked to take part in a new study into female genital mutilation in a bid to better ensure that services to protect women and girls are as effective as possible. The study aims to increase the government's knowledge about women and girls affected by FGM in England. It will also look at how the training needs of key health professionals could be improved and provide vital information for the development of appropriate sexual and reproductive health services. The findings will inform the forthcoming cross-government strategy on tackling violence against women and girls. Female genital mutilation, also known as female genital cutting which is illegal in the UK, can cause long-term mental and physical suffering, difficulty in giving birth, infertility and even death. Female circumcision, officially known as female genital mutilation, is one of the most political areas of women's health. Worldwide, it is estimated that well over 100 million women have been subjected to it. In UK up to 24,000 girls are at risk of FGM. Supporters of the practice say it is done for cultural and religious reasons, but opponents argue that not only is it potentially life-threatening, it is also an extreme form of oppression of women. Dame Christine Beasley, England's chief nursing officer said: "Up to 24,000 young girls in the UK are at risk of Female Genital Mutilation. We have put training in place to support frontline healthcare staff in responding where they see or hear of this practice taking place. "By taking part in this research, Nurses will be helping to ensure that the training available to them in this difficult area is refined and improved."I urge all nurses to log on and take part in this important research. " Health minister Gillian Merron said: "Female Genital Mutilation is an extremely harmful practice and is illegal. It violates women's most basic human rights. "Keeping children and young people safe is a top priority for the health service and the findings of this research will be essential in ensuring that we continue to offer women the best possible protection. "Often, women affected by Female Genital Mutilation first come into contact with the NHS through maternity, obstetrics and gynaecology and sexual health services. "I am therefore asking all these health professionals to take a stand against this practice by taking part in this research." Female genital mutilation is common among Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Yemeni, Malaysian and Indonesian communities. The maximum penalty for committing or aiding the offence is 14 years' jail term. Some ethnic minority communities have evaded the law by arranging for girls to have the operation abroad. Circumcision is usually performed on girls between four and 13 years old, but can be inflicted on newborn babies or young women before marriage or pregnancy. Reasons given include custom and tradition, religious demand, hygiene and prevention of promiscuity. There are three main types of circumcision-- the removal of the tip of the clitoris, total removal of the clitoris and surrounding labia; the removal of the clitoris and labia and the sewing up of the vagina, leaving only a small opening for urine and menstrual blood - a process known as infibulat
