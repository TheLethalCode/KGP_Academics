 Dhaka, Aug 29 (bdnews24.com)Seven men were beaten to death by mobs, for attempted robbery, in two separate incidents in Chittagong and Kishoreganj districts on Saturday. Three men were killed and seven injured by villagers after a 20 strong gang attempted to evade police capture following an attempted robbery of a passenger boat at Goradigha Haor in Bajitpur Upazila, Kishoreganj. "Police gave chase to a 15-to-20 strong gang travelling by engine boat after they attempted to rob a passenger boat," Bajitpur police chief Subrata Kumar Shaha told bdnews24.com. Shaha said the police and members of the fleeing gang traded shots in Shibpur Boalia, after which they jettisoned their firearms into the water. Mithamoin Circle police gave chase to the gang by speedboat, said Shaha. "When the gang attempted to hide at Boalia village, hundreds of villagers circled them and beat them severely," said Shaha. "One man died on the spot, while two others died on their way to hospital," he said. Police identified the deceased as 30-year-old Shumon Das, 35-year-old Mesbah and 40-year-old Nabi Hossain. Police rescued other members of the gang and sent them to the Zahurul Islam Medical Hospital. Another four robbers were beaten to death by a mob at Sitakundu in Chittagong earlier Saturday. Sitakundu police chief Nazrul Islam told bdnews24.com that an armed gang of eight to ten robbers entered Sedai Nagar village of Bariardhala union. Locals, alerted to their presence, descended on the gang and beat them up, Islam said. "Four were left dead on the spot," said the police officer. Of the dead two were identified as Mohammad Bablu, 30, and Mohammad Younus, 35. Police also recovered two machetes, one Kirich, a locally made chopper and a knife from the spot, said Islam.
