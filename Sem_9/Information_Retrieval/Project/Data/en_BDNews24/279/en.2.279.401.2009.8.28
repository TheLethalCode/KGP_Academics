 LONDON, Aug 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England were given a fright by Ireland in their first match since regaining the Ashes, winning by two runs in a rain-affected one-day international match in Belfast on Thursday. Only four players that played in the victorious fifth Test against Australia at the Oval on Sunday made the England line-up which struggled to 203 for nine off 50 overs in cool conditions. Ireland were then set a revised total of 116 from 20 overs because of bad weather but fell agonisingly short of a major upset, ending on 113 for nine. Opener Ravi Bopara, who was dropped for the Oval Test, went for a duck, as did Jonathan Trott who made a big impact on his Test match debut, as England struggled. Only a 67 from debutant Joe Denly enabled England to set a competitive target as Ireland bowler Trent Johnston finished with figures of four for 26, including the wickets of Bopara and Trott. Johnston then chipped in an unbeaten 21 with the bat as Ireland chased victory. They needed 17 from the final over bowled by Owais Shah but despite two Johnston boundaries England held on for victory.
