 RIYADH, Aug 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A top Saudi security official has survived a suicide attack in his office in the Red Sea port of Jeddah, the state news agency SPA reported on Friday. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, deputy interior minister in charge of security, was meeting well-wishers for the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan on Thursday when a man blew himself up with explosives he was carrying, the agency said. The man was a wanted militant who insisted on meeting the prince to announced he was giving himself up to authorities, SPA added. It said the suicide bomber, whom it did not identify, was the only casualty. The attack was the first to directly target a member of the royal family since the start of a wave of violence by al Qaeda sympathisers in 2003 against the U.S.-allied monarchy. Saudi-owned al Arabiya television showed Prince Mohammed, apparently slightly injured, meeting King Abdullah later. "This will only increase our determination to eradicate this (militancy)," said Prince Mohammed, who is the son of Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz. The prince has been largely credited with the government's recent success in crushing the violence. Earlier this month, Saudi authorities announced the arrest of 44 militants close to al Qaeda and the seizure of explosives, detonators and firearms. In 2004, militants rammed a vehicle laden with explosives into the entrance of the Interior Ministry headquarters in the capital Riya
