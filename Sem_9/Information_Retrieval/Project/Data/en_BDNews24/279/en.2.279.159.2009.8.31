 DHAKA, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Bangladesh franchise Twenty20 league plans to shift next year's edition to Sharjah as venues in the country would be under renovation for the 2011 World Cup, officials said Monday. The Chittagong Divisional Sports Association, based in the country's second biggest city, attracted huge sponsorship support after launching the event last year on the lines of the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL). "We have had preliminary discussion with the Sharjah cricket authority already. A three-member delegation will visit Sharjah later this week for further discussion," A.J.M. Nasiruddin, chairman of the tournament organising committee, said. The organisers signed a one-year deal worth $170,000 (104,821 pounds) with a private channel ATN Bangla Sunday to broadcast the matches. "We have some other local sponsors. So money will not be a big issue for us," Nasiruddin said. Sri Lankan cricketers Jehan Mubarak and Chamara Kapugedara were among those who featured in the inaugural edition of the Port-city Cricket League (PCL) in April. The eight-team league is officially sanctioned by the Bangladesh cricket board. Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka will jointly host of the one-day World Cup in 2011.
