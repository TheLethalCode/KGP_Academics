 Gazipur, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)Two children were injured by an explosion at Tongi on Sunday, when an object they discovered in the hollow of an electric post detonated as they were playing with it, officials said. Nine-year-old Nipa, a rickshaw puller's daughter from Uttar Auchpara and 7-year-old Bappa from the same locality were admitted to a clinic for treatment, Shahidul Islam, sub-inspector of Tongi Police Station, told benews24.com. Nipa, Bappa and a third child Ruma were playing in the street at around 1pm when they found three objects covered with scotch tape in the hollow of an electric post, said Tongi municipality councillor Md Nasiruddin Mollah. Mollah said the three children tried to unwrap one of the objects but it detonated when they dropped it on the ground, leaving Nipa injured in the leg and Bappa with a head injury. Shahidul Islam said the devices were "live bombs". "The two other bombs did not detonate and were deactivated at Tongi Police Station," said Islam. Maleka Banu, sub-inspector of Tongi Police Station, said an investigation would be mounted into the origins of the devices. bdnew
