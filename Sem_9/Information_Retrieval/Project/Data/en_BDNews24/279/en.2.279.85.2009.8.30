<TEXT>
 Pabna, Aug 30 (bdnews24.com)At least 35 people in Pabna have been infected with anthrax after consuming beef infected with the bacterium, the district health department said on Sunday. Pabna district health department said an anthrax infected cow in Sathia upazila was slaughtered and sold on Aug 26 in Soto Pathailhat village, leaving at least 35 locals infected with the bacterium after they consumed the contaminated meat. Doctors confirmed the cases of anthrax infection when a number of the victims went to Sathia upazila health complex seeking medical assistance. Anthrax commonly infects both wild and domesticated mammals which ingest or inhale the bacterium while grazing. Diseased animals can then spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact or through consumption of the meat. A four-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident, headed by Dr Ranjit Kumar, a specialist in epidemiology at the health directorate. Primary testing at the Sirajganj animal resource office's laboratory has already confirmed the presence of anthrax in the beef, although the committee had taken further samples for testing. Pabna civil surgeon Dr AHM Md Khairul Alam Choudhury said there was no reason to panic. "Hopefully those infected will recover in a few days, although problems may arise as the disease is contagious," said Choudhury. He said the victims should stay in hospital until they are free of the contagion. bdn
