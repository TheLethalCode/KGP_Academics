<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Aug 31 (bdnews24.com)Health minister A F M Ruhal Haq on Monday asked people to maintain highest safety measures instead of being panicked about the spread of swine flu, hours after the virus claimed its first victim in Bangladesh. He asked the news media to apply 'rational mind' and not use language that might frighten people. The minister's advice came after recent reports by several dailies that the flu had already turned into an epidemic in Bangladesh. "There is nothing to panic if one contracts the virus. We have sufficient stock of vaccine, Oseltamivir capsule," the minister told reporters at the Secretariat. "Many companies in our country are manufacturing the medicine. We are also exporting the medicine," he said. On the death of a 35-year-old H1N1 patient at Lab Aid Hospital in Dhaka on Sunday, Haq said: "The patient who died was initially treated as a dengue patient. Later she was detected with swine flu and given treatment." The minister asked people to go to medical hospitals for treatment if they have high fever with respiratory problems. He suggested that the affected people and others use masks, and wash their hands with soap. "It is possible to recover from the illness without complications if diagnosed at the right time," Haq said. As many as 213 cases were detected up to Monday morning, according to the minister. Simple implications Health authorities in Bangladesh and around the world recommend taking these simple steps to protect against swine flu:  Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.  Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based hand cleaners are also effective.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.  Try to avoid close contact with sick people.  If you are sick with flu-like illness, keep away from others as much as possible to keep from making others sick, and stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone IF it goes without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.  If flu-like symptoms get worse, or are accompanied by respiratory problems, seek medical treatment. Other important actions that can be taken are:  Follow public health advice regarding school and office attendance, avoiding crowds and other social distancing measures.  Be prepared in case you get sick and need to stay home for a week or so; a supply of over-the-counter medicines, alcohol-based hand rubs, tissues and other related items might could be useful and help avoid the need to make trips out in public while you are sick and contagious. bdnews24
