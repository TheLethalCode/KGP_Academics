 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Metropolitan Police arrested 17 drivers and seized thirteen vehicles on the capital's roads on Tuesday, in a tough new crack down against traffic violations. The metropolitan police also filed 689 cases, seized 11 driving licenses and imposed fines totalling Tk 61,900 on the first day of the special operation against invalid licenses and unruly drivers. DMP chief AKM Shahidul Haque inspected the newly introduced lane-system at the Dhaka Sheraton, Sonargaon and Kakoli intersections. He also urged road users to help solve the city's chronic traffic problems. Meanwhile, there were fewer vehicles on the roads Tuesday, possibly in fear of the new drive. DMP assistant commissioner Shyamal Chowdhury said the operation will continue under the 12 teams led by deputy police commissioners. The metropolitan police force had earlier announced the crackdown, beginning Dec 8, against drivers violating newly introduced traffic light or lane rules. Drivers face strict penalties, including a minimum Tk 1,000 fine and three-month suspension of driving license, depending on the type of violation. In measures to ease gridlock and enforce greater discipline on roads, DMP introduced new automated signal lights at 50 intersections of the city on Nov 21. A weeklong promotional campaign began on Dec 1 to introduce new traffic lanes, ahead of the crack down. bdne
