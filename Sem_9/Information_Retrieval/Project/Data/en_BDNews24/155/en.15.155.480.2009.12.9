 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court issued a contempt of court ruling on the government and jail authorities on Wednesday for failing to comply with an order on providing medical treatment to detained former BNP deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, an accused in the Aug 21 grenade attack case. The home secretary, deputy commissioner of Dhaka, inspector general of prisons and Dhaka's jailor have been ordered to appear in the court on December 13. The bench of justice Syed Md Dastagir Hossain and justice Md Roisuddin also asked these people to explain why the charge of contempt of court should not be brought against them. The court on Oct 13 ordered for special treatment outside the jail for the ex-deputy minister and on Nov 24 it again asked for his treatment inside the jail by the specialist physician. Pintu filed a contempt of court petition on Dec 7 as both the orders were not obeyed. Advocate Mahbub Hossain argued for Pintu while deputy attorney general Zahid Sarwar Kajal represented the state. The Aug 21 grenade attack at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people face charges in the cases, including Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. bdn
