 Rangpur, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Angry locals brought traffic to a standstill for seven hours on the Dhaka-Rangpur highway on Wednesday following deaths of two people in an accident. Traffic resumed at around 2.15pm as local MP Ashiqur Rahman assured the blockaders of meeting their demands. Hundreds of protestors blockaded the highway after the death of rickshaw puller Abdus Salam, 40, and passenger Islam, 30, when a Bogra bound truck knocked them down at the town's Modern Crossing at around 7am. Angered by the accident, the people demanded arrest of the truck driver and compensation for the families of the dead. Passenger buses and cargo vehicles remained stranded on both sides of the highway for hours. bdnews24.com
