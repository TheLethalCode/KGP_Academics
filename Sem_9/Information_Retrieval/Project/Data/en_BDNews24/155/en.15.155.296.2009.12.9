<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary watchdog has suggested that the Water Supply and Sewerage Authority must stop dumping untreated waste in the Buriganga river, considered as Dhaka's lifeline. The parliamentary standing committee on local government at its meeting Wednesday said the Dhaka City Corporation and WASA should coordinate their works of liquid waste management to save public money. "We have recommended WASA to stop throwing untreated waste in the Buriganga immediately," Rahmat Ali, the chairman, told reporters after his committee meeting Wednesday. The committee's recommendation strengthens common people's demand for saving the Buriganga from encroachment and pollution. WASA dumps thousands of tonnes of untreated liquid waste everyday into the Buriganga and Balu rivers, which encircle the capital. Pollution of the two rivers has become so severe that the water has turned similar to lubricating oil. The government has been trying to save the rivers taking different projects. Rahmat Ali said Dhaka City Corporation and WASA under the local government ministry were maintaining two separate networks for sewer disposal. "This overlapping practice is mere waste of public money. "The DCC and WASA should coordinate their works to stop repetition of the same service," said the chairman. Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, his deputy Jahangir Kabir Nanak, committee members Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury, Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, Md Monowar Hossain Chowdhury, Abul Khayer Bhuiyan and Begum Ashrafun Nesa Mosharaf attended the meeting.
