 LONDON, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British spy chief in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq denied on Tuesday he had come under pressure from Prime Minister Tony Blair's government to beef up intelligence to help justify military action. Separately, a member of parliament said in a report that a key part of the government's case for war -- a claim that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein could launch weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes -- had come from a taxi driver who overheard a conversation between two Iraqi military officers in his cab. The 45-minute claim was contained in a dossier published by the British government in September 2002 that was approved by John Scarlett, then head of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee. Designed to convince the public of the threat posed by Saddam's regime, the report was criticised for making the intelligence seem stronger than it was, and came to be known as the "dodgy dossier." No weapons of mass destruction were ever found, leading critics to argue the public had been deceived as Blair committed Britain to the role of chief US ally in the war. "It would have been much clearer and better, and the matter wouldn't have been lost in translation if it had spelled out in the dossier that the word was munitions and not weapons," Scarlett told an inquiry into British involvement in the conflict. "There was absolutely no conscious intention to manipulate the language or to obfuscate or to create a misunderstanding as to what they might refer to." TAXI CONVERSATION Earlier on Tuesday, Adam Holloway, a member of parliament for the opposition Conservatives, published a report on the British role in Iraq in which he examined the 45-minute claim. "It had originated from an emigre taxi driver on the Iraqi-Jordanian border, who had remembered an overheard conversation in the back of his cab a full two years earlier," Holloway said in his report for a defence policy group. It added that Blair's team had ignored warnings about the reliability of the intelligence and the information "went on to become one of the central planks of the dodgy dossier." Blair's order to send 45,000 British troops to take part in the 2003 invasion to topple Saddam Hussein provoked massive anti-war protests in London. Blair's alliance with US President George W. Bush alienated many supporters of centre-left Labour, which has been in power since 1997 and faces an election by next June. A previous official probe into pre-war intelligence said blaming Scarlett for the dossier "would have been unfair in respect of what were collective shortcomings." Scarlett also told the inquiry on Tuesday that information in the days before the invasion suggested Iraq had disassembled missiles that could hit Israel and had no warheads that could carry chemical or biological weapons. But he agreed that the information, which was passed on to Blair and senior ministers, was not thought to be "game-changing" as it was thought to be part of Saddam's policy of concealment. Despite criticisms levelled at Scarlett over failures of pre-war intelligence, he went on to become "C" -- the head of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) -- in 2004, a position he held until last mon
