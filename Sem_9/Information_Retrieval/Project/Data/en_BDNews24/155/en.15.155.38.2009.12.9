<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)--The government is renaming the DoE as the Department of Environment and Climate Change, a senior environment ministry official has said. An inter-ministerial meeting at the environment ministry on Tuesday approved the new name, said Joynal Abedin Talukder, a joint secretary. He said the renaming process had begun but final approval by the cabinet and formalities of the relevant ministries needed to be completed. Environment secretary Mihir Kanti Majumder presided over the meeting. Abedin said the move aims to raise awareness about the environment and climate change and elicit more effective steps in Bangladesh in the wake of the Copenhagen climate conference. DoE director (admin and development) Billal Hossain told bdnews24.com that the renaming proposal was made in the middle of last November, keeping its organoram intact. However, he said a post for a climate change director among others was later added in preparation for the newly organised department. The process for expansion of the department's manpower across the country is also at the final stage, said Hossain. Approval has been given for recruitment of 468 more staff, which will bring total the DoE manpower up to 735. Also under the new initiative, department of environment offices will be expanded to 21 districts from the current six divisional official. bdn
