<TITLE> Bangladesh most affected by climate change: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh has been the worst affected by climate change over two decades from 1990, a newly-published report revealed on the second day of crucial climate talks in Copenhagen. The 'Global Climate Risk Index' said the top ten most affected countries were all developing nations in the low-income or lower-middle income country group. The report, by Berlin-based NGO Germanwatch, said 600,000 people died as a direct consequence of more than 11,000 extreme weather events around the world from 1990-2008. Total losses of $1.7 trillion were incurred over the period surveyed. The report said such natural disasters and their consequences could weaken the process to reach Millenium Development Goals and the most affected countries needed greater financial assistance to achieve the goals. Bangladesh was among the countries facing "continuous" climate change impact, the report said, although more than 80% of deaths due to disaster in the country over the period surveyed occurred in 1991. More 140,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that year. The fact that no such catastrophic death toll occurred since, despite continuing extreme weather events, is partial proof that it is possible to prepare for climate risks and prevent larger-scale calamities, said the report. Bangladesh incurs annual losses of 1.81 percent of GDP due to extreme weather events, the report added. Total losses were $2.19 billion a year from 1990 to 2008, said the report. Man-made climate change is expected to lead to further increases in precipitation extremes, both increases in heavy precipitation and increases in drought, said the report. It said the Copenhagen climate summit must result in a real difference for particularly vulnerable developing countries, through an ambitious adaptation action framework. A key role therefore needs to be played by scaled-up financial support provided by developed countries. LOWEST SCORE Bangladesh scored 8 on the Index, Myanmar 8.25, Honduras 12, Vietnam 18.53, Nicaragua 21, Haiti 22.83, India 25.83, Dominican Republic 27.58, the Philippines 27.67 and China 28.58. Myanmar, Yemen and Vietnam were the countries most severely affected in 2008, the last year of the survey. The Global Climate Risk Index is based on average figures. But there are two groups of countries among the 10, those who continuously face the threat of extreme events, and those who only rank high because of exceptional catastrophes. Two examples for the latter case are Myanmar, where more than 95% of the damages and fatalities occurred in 2008 through cyclone Nargis; and Honduras, where more than 80% in both categories were caused through Hurricane Mitch in 1998, the report said. Similarly, the appearance of European countries among the first 25 countries is almost exclusively because of the extraordinary number of fatalities due to the 2003 heat wave, in which more than 70,000 people died across Europe. TURNING POINT According to Germanwatch, 1990 marked a turning point in the climate debate, with the adoption of the First Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This report laid the foundation to negotiate and eventually agree on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) two years later, in 1992. Now, almost 20 years later, it is time to take stock of the impacts of climate-related extreme events, said the Berlin-based group. Also, 1990 is the base year for greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for developed countries under the Kyoto Protocol, and the lack of substantial progress on the way to low-carbon economies is a key factor why many poor countries face a bleak future in face of more severe climate change, it said.
