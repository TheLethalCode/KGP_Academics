<TITLE> AL leader slams Tarique's new power post </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)  A senior ruling party leader has expressed concern at BNP's appointment of Tarique Rahman as senior vice chairman of the opposition party. Awami League's Mahbubul Haque Hanif said Wednesday the opposition has again opened the door to corruption by promoting the controversial Tarique, son of BNP chief and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, to such a prominent and powerful party post. "Tarique (Rahman) was the kingpin of all corruption and terrorism that took place in the country for the last five years," said Hanif, AL joint secretary general. He said BNP had "reared corruption, terrorism and communality" in the past, and had "exposed the party's real nature to the nation" with Tarique's new appointment. "They proved that they could not emerge from (the) past," Hanif said. BNP's Fifth National Council on Tuesday, in a closed-door session, moved to give Tarique greater sway in the party. Tarique, currently in England, had been holding the post of joint-secretary general since 2002. He now becomes a member of the standing committee, the party's highest policymaking body, by virtue of being the only senior vice chairman of the party. The new appointment sparked jubilation among thousands of supporters inside and outside of the council venue, though he disappointed many by stating he would not be returning to politics "just yet" due to "continuing ill-health". Speculation had mounted ahead of the conference that Khaleda's elder son, who was all but banished from politics by the past caretaker government, would be returning to take up a central role in a "renewed" post-council BNP. Tarique however, in a video message aired at the council said he is still undecided about his direct involvement with party activities. "It will depend on the overall situation and my health," said Tarique, who went to London for medical treatment in Sept 2007 after being granted bail in a number of corruption cases. bd
