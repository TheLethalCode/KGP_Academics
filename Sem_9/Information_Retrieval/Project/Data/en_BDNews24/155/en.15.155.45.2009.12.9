<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Newspaper Owners Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) in a press release Wednesday welcomed the government decision to amend the Criminal Procedure Code to allow greater freedom of the press. The cabinet on Dec 7 provisionally approved the draft of the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 2009. The amendment, if passed in parliament, will no longer allow warrants of arrest in defamation cases against journalists, editors, writers and publishers. NOAB said it regards the decision "as a step in the right direction" toward greater press freedom. Currently, a court can order arrest of journalists if any defamation case is filed under Section 500, 501 and 502 of the CrPC, inhibiting media freedom in many instances.
