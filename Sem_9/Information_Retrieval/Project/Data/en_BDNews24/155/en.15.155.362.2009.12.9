 CORRECTED: figure in 10th paragraph Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Khaleda Zia called for party unity and promised a better future as she opened BNP's long pending national council on Tuesday, but it was her elder son Tarique Rahman who stole the show. The council expanded the standing committee, the party's main decision making body, empowered party chief Khaleda to pick top leaders and promoted Tarique to a powerful senior post. But amid all the activities, it was a 10-minute video speech by Tarique that kept the audience spellbound, signalling his future role in the party, now headed by his mother. BNP's fifth national council took off in the morning after a long hiatus of 16 years with Khaleda hoisting the national flag at the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre in the capital. Some 2,512 councillors, 12,000 delegates from across the country and 3,000 local and foreign guests attended. A three-tier security was put in place to guard against any trouble, officials and organisers said. The council in a closed-door session did not name the party's new secretary general but made Tarique senior vice chairman, a move that gave him greater power in the party. Tarique, currently in England, had been holding the post of joint-secretary general since 2002. He now becomes a member of the standing committee, the party's highest policymaking body, by virtue of being the only senior vice chairman of the party. The new appointment sparked wild jubilation among thousands of supporters inside and outside of the Conference Centre, though he disappointed many by stating he would not be returning to politics "just yet" due to "continuing ill-health". The council also expanded the standing committee by raising the number of members to 19 from 15. The number of specific office bearers in the 251-strong executive committee has also been raised to 113, the rest remaining members with no particular responsibilities. The council also entrusted Khaleda to name the party secretary general later. 'RESPECT OPPOSITION' Khaleda in her speech demanded respect for the opposition and called upon the government "to make parliament effective". "Create an environment for them (the opposition) to speak for the people and refrain from accusing them of false charges," she added. "Make scope for discussions on welfare of the country and the people in parliament instead of taking any secret decision. We will help make the house effective," she said. Khaleda asked the government to stop filing false cases against her party leaders and activists and refrain from torturing and harassing them. The opposition leader urged the councillors and delegates to build efficient and quality leadership to take the party forward. She called on all BNP leaders and activists to maintain discipline in the party. Khaleda, following on in her address, asked the government to implement its election pledges. "Work for the country and the people and fulfil your election pledges. We will help you." "But if you do anything contrary to the country's interest we will protest it. We will launch movement with people if required," she warned. Awami League's deputy publicity secretary Ashim Kumar Ukil, heading a four-member ruling party delegation to the council, voiced hope that BNP would be reformed and stronger with the holding of the council. "We, on behalf of Awami League, wish all success of the party. We hope the council will help strengthen democracy and re-establish the spirit of the war of independence," Ukil said in his address at the opening session of the BNP's fifth council on Tuesday. 'TOUGH MOVEMENT' Khaleda asked all to get ready for tough movement. "You should stay united and rally public support. It will be our prime job for the future." She reiterated her firm stance against corruption, communalism, militancy and terrorism. "We have to be careful about those who introduced autocracy by killing democracy. We should remain alert so that they cannot revive." Khaleda asked people to be aware of propaganda by certain quarter. She urged all to unite with the spirit of nationalism and democracy. "We do neither want religious fanaticism nor politics against religion. All of us are brothers and sisters irrespective of religion. We want to live as Bangladeshis. The council also heard formal announcement of Khaleda Zia's re-election as BNP chairperson. Khaleda Zia was re-elected unopposed the chairperson of BNP as she was the only candidate for the top post. She took up the party helm in 1983 from the then BNP chairman Abdus Sattar, the post being renamed 'chairperson'. bd
