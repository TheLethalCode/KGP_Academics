 Chittagong, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Port Authority has finally signed a three-year container handling contract with Saif Power Tech, after a protracted tender process. The company won a third bidding round on Nov 5, offering the lowest rateonly Tk 155 per container. The same company is currently taking Tk 505 per container under an 'interim' deal struck after its contract expired last year. It charged Tk 1200 per container during the previous caretaker government's tenure. CPA chairman Commodore RU Ahmed and managing director of Saif Power Tarafder Ruhul Amin signed for their sides. Secretary for the port Syed Farhad Uddin told bdnews24.com the agreement was signed on getting the evaluation committee report. Other bidders have questioned how the company's quotation dipped to Tk 155 in the new tender for the contract from charging Tk 1200 per container just two and a half years ago. Saif Power Tech was appointed to handle containers at CCT in June 2006. After the contract expired in 2008, two tenders were floated that year to appoint a new handler. Birth operator Everest Enterprise was the lowest bidder in the first tender in November 2008, quoting Tk 453 handling charge per container. However, the then shipping adviser to the caretaker government, MA Matin, cancelled the tender, saying "conditions were not met" and floated a new one. Esack Brothers Ltd then quoted the lowest price, Tk 340 per container, in the second tender in December. But on Oct 8, eight months after signing the deal, Chittagong Port Authority cancelled Esack's contract following recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee on shipping. The standing committee recommended cancellation of the contract and floating of a new tender after allegations that the firm secured the tender through irregularities. The standing committee also said Esack Bros does not possess required experience to handle the work order. Esack has demanded Tk 25 crore in damages from port authorities for the cancelled contract. Everest Enterprise has sued directly for compensation for cancellation of the original tender. The company is seeking Tk 25 crore in damages from Matin and ex-shipping secretary Sheikh Motahar Hossain. In the third bidding round last month, the current CCT operator Saif Power Tech quoted the lowest price for the three-year contract of Tk 13.95 crore, or Tk 155 per container. Saif Power officials have rejected any suspicions over their low bid, calling it "a business strategy" and saying they have substantially cut projected costs. bd
