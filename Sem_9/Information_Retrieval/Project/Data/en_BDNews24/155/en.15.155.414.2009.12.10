 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com) Listed companies with price-earning (PE) ratio above 75 have been barred from receiving margin loan by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the modified version of the margin loan criteria, from now on merchant banks and brokerage houses can not disburse loans to their clients to trade on such scrips. SEC member Mansur Alam said that the decision came from a meeting on Wednesday. "The market regulator decided that companies with PE ratio more than 75 will not be considered as marginable securities any more," he told bdnews24.com Thursday. The move is the latest of a series of decisions by the SEC regarding margin loans. Earlier in October this year, in three separate occasions, the SEC asked to suspend margin loan facilities of 28 companies with PE ratio over 100, the same for mutual funds until further notice as well as for Z category shares which failed to submit annual reports timely. Alam said that the earlier decisions would remain in force. A PE ratio is a company's current share price compared to its earnings per share. The higher the PER, the higher is the market values of the company earnings.
