 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh will ask for 15 percent of an expected adaptation fund, at the global climate talks in Copenhagen, as the most vulnerable country. "As was established on the very first day of the Copenhagen conference, Bangladesh is the country most affected by climate change," Hasan Mahmud, state minister for environment and forest told a press conference at his office Tuesday. "Fifteen percent of the world's climate change victims live in Bangladesh. So it will demand fifteen percent of the expected 'adaptation fund'," said the minister. Mahmud said Bangladesh is calling for 1.5 percent of GDP from each of the developed and fast developing countries to build a climate fund, which may raise a total of $450 billion to $600 billion a year. Bangladesh has presented its case as one of the most vulnerable countries at global climate change conferences throughout the past two years, since Bali. As a result, it has played an important role among the least developed and most vulnerable countries, he said. "We produce just 0.20 percent of green house gas emissions. It plays a tiny role in climate change," he said. "And as the damage done by greenhouse gas effect on Bangladesh has been proved beyond question, we should get proper compensation." 'MOST AFFECTED' A new report unveiled on the second day of Copenhagen climate talks said Bangladesh, Myanmar and Honduras were the countries most affected by climate change over two decades from 1990. Berlin-based Germanwatch, in its 'Global Climate Risk Index 2010' report, said the top ten most affected countries were all developing nations in the low-income or lower-middle income country group. The report said 600,000 people died as a direct consequence of more than 11,000 extreme weather events around the world, with losses incurred of $1.7 trillion, over the period surveyed from 1990-2008. It said such natural disasters and their consequences could weaken the process to reach Millenium Development Goals and the most affected countries needed greater financial assistance to achieve the goals. Bangladesh was among the countries facing "continuous" climate change impact, the report said, although more than 80% of deaths in the period surveyed occurred in 1991. More 140,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that year. The fact that no such catastrophic death toll occurred since, despite continuing extreme weather events, is partial proof that it is possible to prepare for climate risks and prevent larger-scale calamities, said the report. Bangladesh incurs annual losses of 1.81 percent of GDP due to extreme weather events, the report added. Total losses were $2.19 billion a year from 1990 to 2008, said the report. Man-made climate change is expected to lead to further increases in precipitation extremes, both increases in heavy precipitation and increases in drought, said the report. It said the Copenhagen climate summit must result in a real difference for particularly vulnerable developing countries, through an ambitious adaptation action framework. A key role therefore needs to be played by scaled-up financial support provided by developed countries. bdnews
