<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 08 (bdnews24.com)  Former caretaker government advisor Akbar Ali Khan said political appointments at the board of directors of state-owned commercial banks should be stopped to bring discipline in the banking system. "Honest and skilled people should get appointment in economic sector," he said. He was giving the ninth Nurul Matin memorial speech titled: immoralities in the banking sector, organised by BIBM at a city hotel. CAMEL rating should also be made public in a regular way so that banks depositors can know in advance about the economic base of the banks. Finance minister AMA Muhith, who was present as chief guest there, said: "We are trying to bring back discipline in the banking sector." Referring to an observation report on ethical problems in the banking sector, he said commercial banks' directors borrowed a huge amount of money from banks by influence. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman chaired the memorial speech. Asked about the political appointments at the board of directors at the state-owned commercial banks, Atiur said the appointment at the board of directors does not fall under the jurisdiction of Bangladesh Bank. On the publication of the CAMEL rating, he said, nothing can be said without going through the relevant laws. bd
