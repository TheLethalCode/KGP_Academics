<TITLE> Tarique steals the show </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  An electrifying 10-minute video speech by Tarique Rahman kept the audience at BNP's national council spellbound on Tuesday, signalling his future role in the party, now headed by his mother Khaleda Zia. Appointment of Tarique, now in London, as the party's senior vice-chairman sparked wild jubilation among thousands of supporters inside and outside of the Bangabandhu International Conference Centre, where Khaleda in her own speech threatened to launch movement against the government. Tarique, living in England since September 2007, had been holding the post of senior joint secretary general of the party. He will now become a member of the standing committee, the party's highest policy-making body, by virtue of being the only senior vice chairman. Speculation had mounted ahead of the conference that Khaleda's elder son, who was all but banished from politics by the past caretaker government, would be returning to take up a central role in a "renewed" post-council BNP. Tarique in his video message, however, told the council he is still undecided about his direct involvement with party activities. "It will depend on the overall situation and my health," said Tarique, who went to London for medical treatment in September 2007 after being granted bail in a number of corruption cases. "My treatment is still ongoing. I don't know how many days it will take to get full recovery. "I hope to join with you on my return home after recovery." He wished all success of the council. bd
