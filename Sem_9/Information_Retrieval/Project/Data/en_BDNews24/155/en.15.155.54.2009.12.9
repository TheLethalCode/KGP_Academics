 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com) Gopalganj district has been added anew to the initial phase of the government's national service programme to employ educated, unemployed youths. The cabinet on Oct 5 provisionally approved the guidelines on temporary job generation initially in Kurigram and Barguna districts under a pilot project. Finance minister AMA Muhith said at a seminar marking the National Youth Day at Jubo Bhaban in Dhaka on Wednesday that unemployed youths of Gopalganj, Kurigram and Barguna are going to get jobs under the programme. Gopalganj is the home district of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and she has winning one of the constituencies there every time in the general elections. Other districts will also come gradually under the programme, Muhith said. The minister also said the programme will provide jobs to a total of 18,000 youths, 6,000 from each of the three districts. The government is targeting a 15 percent cut in youth unemployment by 2021. At present 40 percent of Bangladeshi youths are jobless, he added. The minister said the scheme aims to employ one youth from each family by 2021 as part of the ruling Awami League's campaign pledge. Those who have passed SSC or equivalent exams will be eligible for the scheme. "National service in not only a project, it is a philosophy. It tends to make the jobless youths efficient for work." "Our country has many educated people who are not skilled enough to get jobs. National service programme will build up a talented workforce." "We want to reduce the rate of youth unemployment down to 15 percent within 2021. We have started programmes like national service and 100-day job creation programme keeping that target in view," Muhith said. He said after enlistment, the applicants will be given a three-month training. Then they will be appointed as assistant agriculture, health and education officers for two years. If someone wants to continue after two years of internship, they will be given position. Or, they can go elsewhere to take up another job or for higher education, Muhith explained. bdn
