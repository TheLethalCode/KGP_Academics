<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)The government will begin the massive task of clearing the Buriganga riverbed of polythene bag waste, lying several metres deep, from the new year, shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said Tuesday. The preliminary work will begin with human labour from Jan 1 due to lack of adequate machinery; excavators will be purchased later and the removal will pick up pace, the minister said. "The four rivers around Dhaka are in a very critical state right now. Measures have been taken to clear the waterways, free them from pollution and increase navigability," he told reporters at the secretariat after attending a taskforce meeting to save important rivers around the country. "The decision on beginning removal of polythene has been taken as one of the critical measures," he said. It will take time to buy the excavators, but the government wants to begin the process immediately, Khan said. "So the preliminary work will be started with labourers. It will launch the task, as well as create employment, though it will require more time and cost in the end," the minister added. The government does not have dredgers available with technical capacity to tackle the job. It will purchase new excavators, costing between Tk 1.0-1.25 crore. The purchase will be made soon, Khan said. Regarding the removal of illegal structures along the river banks, he said authorities had already removed 120 along rivers in Dhaka, 196 in Narayanganj and 136 in Gazipur. He said the government had also directed district authorities to delineate the river boundaries and identify all remaining illegal structures by Nov 30. "They have done their job in time; the report is on its way to the ministry." The government will start removing the structures identified as illegal and set boundary pillars, the minister said. He said daily leasing of 550 temporary structures has also been cancelled and their removal would be seen soon. Khan also said there is no law regarding the leasing of sand-extraction spots along the rivers. "Preparations are underway for legislating and regulating this." "The government has postponed the extraction of sand from the river-beds until a new law is formulated. No new permissions will be given within that time," the minister added. Tuesday's meeting was also attended by the water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen, law minister Shafique Ahmed, land minister Rezaul Karim Hira, state minister for forest and environment Hassan Mahmooda and shipping secretary Abdul Mannan Hawlader. bd
