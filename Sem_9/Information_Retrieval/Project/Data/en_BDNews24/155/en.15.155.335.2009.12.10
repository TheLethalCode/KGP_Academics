 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)Another staff of the MV Coco-4 secured anticipatory bail from the High Court on Thursday in the case concerning death of scores of passengers when the launch capsized in Bhola on November 27. Five officials have so far received bail in this case. A bench of justice AFM Abdur Rahman and justice Mohammad Imdadul Haque granted the master of the launch Shamsul Haque six months bail upon a petition filed by the accused. The bench asked two other petitioners, launch staffs Ujjal Hossain and Maksud Ahmed, to appear in the lower court within eight weeks. The four officials who received bail on Wednesday are launch master Abdur Rahim, manager Mizanur Rahman, terminal supervisor Mohammed Kibria and a staff 'Zaman'. Ferry survivor Mohammed Kamal filed the negligent homicide case on November 30 with Lalmohon Police Station. The case accuses the on-duty employees of the MV Coco-4 of causing the death of at least 85 passengers by overloading and attempting to dock 50 feet away from the Nazirpur launch terminal, where passengers were trying to disembark. The Coco-4 partially capsized on November 27, the night before Eid-ul-Azha, on the river Tentulia at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate the Eid holidays with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. Barrister Moniruzzaman argued for the defendants in the hearing and deputy attorney general Kazi Izarul Haque Akand argued for the prosecution. bdnew
