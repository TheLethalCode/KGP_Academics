 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com) A full-fledged National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) will take a shape in a month, the law minister said on Thursday. "The scrutiny committee with the speaker as its head will sit at the end of this month to appoint members of the six-member commission. Amirul Kabir Chowdhury is the chairman of the commission. "The full fledged human rights commission will be formed in the first week of January," Shafique Ahmed said in a programme marking World Human Rights Day. The commission members will include a woman and representatives of indigenous community and other communities. He said the government is aware of protecting fundamental and human rights of people. The commission will be allowed to work independently, he said. "The rule of law has been established in the country. The government does not have any intervention in the judiciary department." Amirul Kabir said: "It is unfortunate that some members of law enforcing agency sometimes violate human rights. "We do not want the image of law enforcers destroyed because of the acts of some of its members." He became critical of extra-judicial killings. "We have received many complaints against law enforcers including RAB and police. "We cannot form a separate probe commission as we do not have proper organogram of the commission and required regulations." He said the government has been informed of the matter. On 'crossfire' Amirul Kabir said: "We want investigation of all extra-judicial killings. We have submitted written notice to the home ministry on some incidents." He said the commission had sent an organogram to the government seeking 62 people to make the commission effective and strong. The commission is currently operating with four officials appointed by the government  two deputy directors and two directors and five officials of UNDP project in Lalmatia. The commission chairman recommended for quick recruitment of manpower and formulation of regulations for its expansion to divisional and district levels. The National Human Rights Commission ordinance was promulgated on Dec 23, 2007 during the caretaker government. A three-member commission was formed on Dec 1, 2008. After the passage of the ordinance in parliament on July 14 with some amendments two commissioners Munira Khan and Neeru Kumar Chakma quit the commission. bdn
