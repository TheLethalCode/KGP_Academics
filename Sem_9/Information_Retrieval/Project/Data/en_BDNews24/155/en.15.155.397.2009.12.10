 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The Election Commission is mulling holding projection meetings for the candidates of the mayoral post ahead of the Dhaka City Corporation polls to help reduce their campaign expenses, a commissioner said on Thursday. "The commission is planning to hold four public meetings with only mayoral candidates," M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at the EC Secretariat. "If the decision is taken finally the candidates will not be allowed to hold any public meeting, they will be able to hold only street rallies." Efforts will be made to allocate slots in Bangladesh Television (BTV) to create opportunity for the candidates to address the voters, he said. The four public meetings will be held considering 90 wards in 15 constituencies under the DCC, the commissioner said. He believed as it will be a non-party election the party supporters will not create any 'unnecessary hassles' in public rallies. Sakhawat said ensuring security in the rallies will not pose a challenge. Arrangement of rallies might cost more than Tk 50 lakh. If the initiative sees success it will be a move forward towards state funding for parliamentary polls, he said. There are 40 lakh voters in 90 wards of DCC. The commissioner asked for removing posters with Eid greetings ahead of the DCC elections. "Such activities are illegal as per electoral law. If the posters are not removed within 24 hours of declaration of schedule there is a provision of cancellation of candidacy. "We are delivering letters to the home secretary and the mayor to take actions against the concerned ones in line with Press and Publication Law." The EC is holding the polls to the expired DCC in March. bd
