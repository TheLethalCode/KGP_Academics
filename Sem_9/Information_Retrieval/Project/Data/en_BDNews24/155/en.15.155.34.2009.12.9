 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 08 (bdnews24.com) - In the most heated protest so far at Copenhagen, just two days in to the climate talks, African representatives accused rich nations of hijacking and manipulated the conference to the detriment of developing countries. Augustine Njmanshi, of Christian Aid, said Africans were suffering and would "not die in silence." He added: "$10 billion is not enough to buy the coffins to bury us with." "We are poor, but we are not stupid. There are political maneuverings to reach a deal the rich nations want," Margareta from Ghana told bdnews24.com on Tuesday at the Bella Conference Centre. She was marching with others under the banner of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance, demanding a deal to benefit the poorest countries. "We are seeking a concerted solution," she said. The UN climate chief has said climate fund commitments by rich nations could amount to $10 billion a year up to 2012 and $30 billion a year from 2012. He told bdnews24.com on the eve of the conference that the $100 billion a year, demanded right now by poor and vulnerable countries on top of existing development aid, might be available by 2020.
