 TEHRAN, Dec 8,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran will "show no mercy" towards opposition protesters seen as threatening national security, a judiciary official said on Tuesday, a day after thousands of students staged anti-government rallies. A nationwide rally on Monday to mark the killing of three students under the Shah turned violent when students clashed with security forces armed with batons and tear gas in the largest anti-government protests in months. "From now on, we will show no mercy toward anyone who acts against national security. They will be confronted firmly," said prosecutor Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, according to the official IRNA news agency. The protests were a renewed fresh show of force following demonstrations that erupted after the June re-election of President Ahamdinejad, which the opposition says he won by rigging the vote. Monday's protests in Tehran were smaller than the post-election rallies but the mood seemed more radical with protesters chanting slogans against the clerical establishment and not just criticising Ahmadinejad's re-election. Analysts say students have formed a bastion of support for opposition leader Mirhossein Mousavi. "Silencing universities will be difficult for the establishment. Ahmadinejad's fate may well hang on them," said one analyst, who asked to be named. Iranian university students played a major role in toppling the U.S.-backed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi 30 years ago and have always been a leading force behind political movements in Iran, both before and after the 1979 Islamic revolution. "PEOPLE LEADING OPPOSITION" A fierce crackdown on anti-government rallies, sweeping arrests of activists and harsh sentences imposed on leading reformists, including five death sentences, have so far failed to keep Iranians off the streets or quash the opposition. "They feel they are being humiliated by the system. As long as the authorities continue to ignore their demands, protests will continue," said the analyst. "Now the people are leading the opposition leaders." Dozens of people were arrested and several hurt in clashes in different Iranian cities on Monday. The opposition leaders did not attend the rally. When Ahmadinejad won the June election with a wide margin, his reformist opponents cried foul and thousands of Iranians took to the streets in the biggest anti-government demonstrations in the 30-year history of the Islamic Republic. Authorities deny any vote-rigging. Prosecutor Mohseni-Ejei said the authorities had no intention of letting the demonstrations continue. "Intelligence and security ... forces have been ordered not to give any leeway to those who break the law, act against national security and disturb public order," he said. Iran's Revolutionary Guards and their allied Basij militia, which suppressed post-election unrest, have warned the opposition not to stage rallies against the establishment. In September and November, opposition demonstrators clashed with government backers during rallies. Mousavi criticised the clerical establishment on Sunday for suppressing students, saying the reform movement was alive in Iran despite pressure from the authorities to end it, his Kaleme website reported. Thousands were arrested after the election. Most of them have since been freed, but the judiciary continues to impose harsh sentences on arrested reformists, including former senior officials, lawyers, students and journalists. The reformist opposition says more than 70 people were killed in June's post-election violence. Officials say the death toll was half that and included Basij militia
