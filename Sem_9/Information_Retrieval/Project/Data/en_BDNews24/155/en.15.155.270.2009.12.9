 WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Obama administration plans to announce on Wednesday that it intends to extend the life of the $700 billion financial bailout fund until next October, administration officials said on Tuesday. One official said the administration was expected to pledge to use no more than $560 billion from the fund. Another said the plan would be to tap the program to help homeowners secure mortgages through the government's housing program and to free up credit for small businesses to spur job growth.

"If you look at the US financial system today, there are parts that are still very damaged," he said, citing the housing sector and problems small businesses are having in accessing credit. Opposition Republicans have accused the administration of wanting to use the bailout program as a job-creating "slush fund." "There has rarely been a less loved or more necessary emergency program than TARP, which as galling as the assistance to banks may have been indisputably helped prevent a collapse of the entire financial system," President Barack Obama said on Tuesday. Soaring unemployment threatens to eat into the majority Obama's fellow Democrats hold in Congress when voters go to the polls in mid-term elections next November. To reduce the nation's 10 percent jobless rate, Obama on Tuesday proposed small business tax cuts and energy efficiency rebates, among other steps. This comes on top of a plan outlined in November to provide capital to community banks that lend to small businesses. Obama is set to meet with Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress at the White House on Wednesday to promote his jobs proposals. At the end of November, $560 billion had been allocated from the TARP program, the same amount the administration is now expected to declare as a c
