 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh government is going to finalise a new industry policy by January 5, said Industry minister Dilip Barua Thursday. "We (industry ministry) are trying to complete the policy before the present government enters its second year of tenure," the minister said at a press briefing at his office. The grand alliance government, led by Awami League, completes its first year of the five-year tenure on January 5. The industry ministry has posted a draft of the proposed industry policy-2009 on its website (www.moind.gov.bd) to know public opinions. Anybody can submit his/her opinion on the draft through email (addlsecy@moinbd.gov.bd) or fax (02-9563553). Earlier, opinions were collected from different experts, businessmen and labour leaders. Dilip Barua made his position clear on privatisation issue saying, "no more operating industries will be privatised." "This will be a five-year policy, but it will continue until the next one is framed," he said. Industries have been categorised into five classes in the draft. These are large, medium, small, micro and handicrafts. Those industries that are preserved for government investment being 'sensitive' and those needed to be preserved for national security will be declared as 'preserved industries'. Earlier on April 25 Dilip Barua told the reporters, "Many privatised factories remain inoperative or non-functional under new ownership. In some cases, land is sold off after take-over. Privatisation should not mean an opportunity for looting." The policy proposes sixteen prioritised sectors, among them are agriculture and agro processing, ship building, renewable energy, tourism, computer software and ICT products, high value added readymade garments and light engineering. It also includes chemicals, active pharmaceutical ingredients and herbal medicines, plastics and polymers, jute and leather goods, hospitals and clinics, diamond cutting and polishing, cosmetics and toiletries, furniture and handicrafts. The draft policy also identifies 16 sectors as 'controlled'that is, defined as preserving national resources, national security and major infrastructurewhere new investment would require 'special' approval. The sectors include deep-sea fishing, private banking and non-bank financial institutions, insurance, power generation, refining crude oil and exploration, excavation and supply of natural gas and other mineral resources. They also include major infrastructure projectssuch as flyovers, elevated expressways, monorail, container depots, mobile and land phone networksairlines, seaports, satellite channels and casinos. Investment for any new project within these sectors will need special approval from the government bdn
