 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)  Former Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed on Wednesday asked banks and other financial institutions to target needs of small and medium enterprises as engines of economic growth. His call was backed by former NBR chairman Md Abdul Mazid, who said the country's development depended on expansion of the SME sector. Mazid said SMEs contributed around 70 percent of GDP in some countries, while Bangladesh the sector accounted for less than 25 percent of the economy. Both men were addressing a seminar on SME financing, addressing policy and regulatory reforms, as part of a two-day SME Financing Fair in the capital. Salehuddin Ahmed said: "Banks and financial institutions must be SME-focused, flexible and innovative in their approach." The former central bank chief stressed the need for an SME Data Bank and marketing of innovative financial products. "It is high time to shun rhetoric and formulate a favourable policy for development of the SME sector," he said. SMEs had developed without any assistance for three decades, he said. He said the sector could soar if bureaucratic tangles and regulatory bottlenecks were removed, taxation simplified, and funding flow increased. He called on the government for greater support in these areas. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, opening the fair on Tuesday, had called on banks and financial institutions to offer collateral free loans to SMEs and keep interest rates "rational". She said the annual rate of interest for loans in agriculture, SME, housing and trade sectors had been set at a maximum 13 percent and the government wouldtry to reduce it further in phases. Md. Abdul Mazid, former chairman of National Board of Revenue, said the country's economic development depended on growth of the SME sector. Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries and SME Foundation organised the seminar at a city hotel. b
