 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said the government is planning to ensure equal rights to property for women. "I have specific plan and I will reveal it in time," Hasina said in her speech at the Rokeya Medal award programme at Osmani Memorial Auditorium on Thursday. "If we reveal the plan now many quarters will start a campaign against it on the excuse of Islamic law," she said. Razia Hossain and Mamtaz Hossain have been awarded this year's Rokeya Medal for their contributions to children literature and expansion of education. Hasina recalled the contributions of Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain in the establishment of women enlightenment and their rights. "Begum Rokeya was the pioneer of advancement of Muslim women. We are still benefiting from her contributions. What she thought a century ago is still applicable for our society," she said. The premier said it is unfortunate that women are being tortured in many places even in the urban areas in the name of religion. She regretted that early marriage is still taking place and women have to die for dowry. "Many women are the victim of acid throwing We have to fight to stop violence against women." Hasina said the pre-conditions for women development are education, economic development and empowerment. She said the past Awami League-led government during its 1996-2001 term had introduced Women Development Policy and the caretaker government brought some changes to it. The relevant authorities have been asked to review the policy to bring about some necessary amendments to it, she said. The prime minister said the past AL government had appointed the country's first female judge, secretary, deputy commissioners and superintendents of police. She also hoped to elect a female speaker of parliament in future. Earlier a child was identified by his/her father's name. The AL government first included mother's name with that. State minister for women and children affairs Shirin Sharmin Chowdhury presided over the function and the ministry secretary Rokeya Sultana delivered welcome speech. Rokeya Day is observed on Dec 9 through various programmes. Begum Rokeya was born on this day in Rangpur's Pairabond village in 1880 and died the same day in 1932. The pioneer of women emancipation played a crucial role in expanding female education among Muslim women in the subcontinent. Her 'Sultana's Dream' is considered as a milestone of feminist literature. bdnews2
