 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)The government will launch money transfer services through mobile phones at all post offices from June next year. Officials told the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications ministry on Wednesday that the postal department was set to run the e-banking services on an experimental basis through post offices in Comilla from January 2010. Once launched, people will be able to send money on mobile phones from all post offices. The parliamentary body also finalised the draft of the Post Office Act, 1898 for launching of the service. The century old act was a barrier to start the e-banking services through post offices. As per the suggestion of the watchdog, the post and telecommunication minister will table the Post Office (amendment) Bill-2009 in parliament soon. "We hope that the postal department will turn the 8,500 post offices into postal electronic centres by June 2010," Hasanul Haq Inu, the standing committee chairman, told journalists Wednesday at parliament media centre. He said people will be able to send money to the remotest corner of the country by utilising the postal electronic centres cum post offices. The chairman clarified that all post masters would get special SIM cards. The sending post office will give secret numbers to the money senders. The receiver will, according to Inu, go to the receiving post office and place the secret number to the post master to get the remmittance. The post master office will then verify the data and distribute money to the clients. He said all the 8500 post offices will be turned into postal electronic centres equipped with computers, webcam, internet facilities and other necessary logistics. "The post offices will also provide letter delivery services too," said the chairman. "As a pilot project, we will start the service at all post offices in Comilla," Mobassher ur Rahman, postal department's director general told bdnews24.com after the meeting. He said private operator will provide the connectivity facilities to his department for running the service. "We have okayed the amendment proposals to the century-old Post Office Act, 1898. "The government will table an amendment bill named Post Office Bill-2009 in parliament soon," said the committee chairman. There is a common allegation that the postal department does not deliver remittances and letters in time. The private courier service operators have been providing money transfer facilities on mobile phones almost for a decade. The postal department, which sees sharp fall in earnings from letters delivery since spread of mobile phones, has been talking of launching the faster money transfer for quite some time.
