 DHAKA, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh opener Tamim Iqbal is in doubt for a triangular one-day series in January after he ignored medical advice and continued to play cricket despite a broken hand, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Monday. Tamim injured his left hand while batting against Zimbabwe in a one day international on Nov. 5. Initial scans did not reveal any fracture though after two weeks with his hand not recovering as expected it was re-scanned on Nov. 21 and a hairline fracture discovered. He was told not to attempt batting either in practice or in games until at least Dec. 7, the BCB said. "Despite these clear verbal and written instructions, for unclear reasons Tamim had tried batting on a number of occasions, both before and after he was diagnosed with a fracture," the BCB said in statement. "After every time (batting), he complained of increased pain, swelling, and an inability to adequately grip the bat, let alone bat with comfort or competence. "This ongoing aggravation and re-injury will delay Tamim's recovery, and could give him long term issues with the wrist. "As such, there is now some doubt as to his ability to return to fitness by the next international duties in early January." Bangladesh host the triangular one-day series also involving India and Sri Lanka in early January before India then play two tests in Bangladesh. The BCB however did not make it clear whether Tamim or his club would face sanctions for disobeying their instructions. The 20-year-old has been one of Bangladesh's most consistent batsmen, scoring 1864 runs in 66 one-dayers at 28.2
