 Maruf Mallick with Toufique Imrose Khalidi Copenhagen, Dec 08 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh, speaking for the poorest countries, has said that 75 percent of global climate money must go to the most vulnerable. The plea was made at a press conference, also attended by chairman of the 49-strong LDCs' group Bruno Sekoli, on the second day of the two-week global climate talks here in the Danish capital. It came on the heels of a new report revealing Bangladesh to be among the three countries worst affected by climate change. "This money should go to the most deserving countries such as the small islands, the LDCs and the African countries," said Dr. Ainun Nishat, a member of the Bangladesh delegation. He renewed Dhaka's demand that the developed nations  bracketed as the Annex 1 countries  agree to a legally-binding commitment at the Copenhagen meeting. "We want some kind of legal enforcement. Because there was commitment made in 1990 that 0.7 percent of GDP would go for ODA. It has not happened. "If it (Adaptation Fund) similarly remains voluntary, the agreement would mean nothing." "We have started talking about 1.5 percent of GDP for the Adaptation Fund," Dr Nishat said. No senior Bangladesh government official was seen at the press conference. Dr Nishat was flanked by BSS reporter Kamrul Islam Chowdhury. At the first day's press conference by the Bangladesh delegation, on Monday, Saber Hossain Chowdhury MP, IPCC member Dr Atiq Rahman, Department of Environment director general Zafar Ahmed Khan, and a Nepali negotiator were also present. Khan is to lead the Dhaka delegation until more senior officials arrive in Copenhagen. Saber Chowdhury, who heads the all-party parliamentary group on climate, was clearly upset. "We didn't know that there would be a press briefing today (Tuesday)." the MP told bdnews24.com. "I knew it had been cancelled." "But such deviation will not occur again. And necessary instructions have been passed (to officials)," he said. LDCs still hopeful Sekoli, the LDCs' chairman, was optimistic about a positive outcome from the COP 15 negotiations on the emissions targets and funds pledges. He told bdnews24.com after the press conference: "I hope we will get something from Copenhagen. Because it is better than Bangkok and Barcelona talks. "We have some countries talking positively. The UK is talking about 30 percent reduction (carbon emissions) by 2020. It is an improvement from the last time (we met)." The LDCs are seeking to make it between 40 and 45 percent. "The developing countries are making their own commitments. Some positive information has also come from the US," Sekoli said. He however would not comment on the draft from Brazil, South Asia, India and China  the quartet known as BASIC. "I do not want to comment on it, I have not looked at it. "It is good that they have drafted something. And everybody will look at the draft and could take part in the discussion." A Bangladesh delegate on Monday had attacked the group of four for allegedly taking a different approach towards reducing emissions. "We are disappointed," the delegate said at the press conference of the yet-to-be-disclosed draft from the BASIC countries. 'CDM NOT A GREAT IDEA' Sekoli said the so-called Clean Development Mechanism or CDM was not going to work for the LDCs. "Because it's driven by the private sector. Private sector will go to South Africa, India, but will not go to Nepal or Lesotho. "If South Africa says we want to change a coal plant, they will go there," argued Sekoli who represented Lesotho. At a press briefing earlier in the day, World Bank officials also spoke of the inherent weaknesses of the CDM. "Insufficient predictability in the CDM is an obstacle to maximising the leverage potential of carbon financing for low carbon investments," the Bank said in a written statement. "Some CDM decisions have had a disproportionate negative impact on Least Developed Countries." The Bank said its carbon finance operations expanded from the pioneering Prototype Carbon Fund, which helped catalyse a nascent carbon market in 2000 to 10 funds and facilities with a current capitalization of more than $ 2.5 billion. The funds and facilities are financed by the public and private entities from the industrialized countries to support CDM and joint implementation projects and purchase ensuing emission reductions. BANGLADESH 'MOST AFFECTED' Earlier in the day, a new report, unveiled in Copenhagen, said Bangladesh, Myanmar and Honduras were the countries most affected by climate change over the two decades from 1990. Berlin-based Germanwatch, in its 'Global Climate Risk Index 2010' report, said the top 10 most affected countries were all developing nations in the low-income or lower-middle income country group. The report said 600,000 people died as a direct consequence of more than 11,000 extreme weather events around the world, with losses incurred of $1.7 trillion, over the period surveyed from 1990-2008. It said such natural disasters and their consequences could weaken the process to reach Millenium Development Goals and the most affected countries needed greater financial assistance to achieve the goals. Bangladesh was among the countries facing "continuous" climate change impact, the report said, although more than 80% of deaths in the period surveyed occurred in 1991. More 140,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that year. The fact that no such catastrophic death toll occurred since, despite continuing extreme weather events, is partial proof that it is possible to prepare for climate risks and prevent larger-scale calamities, said the report. Bangladesh incurs annual losses of 1.81 percent of GDP due to extreme weather events, according to the report. Total losses were $2.19 billion a year from 1990 to 2008, said the report. Man-made climate change is expected to lead to further increases in precipitation extremes, both increases in heavy precipitation and increases in drought, said the report. It said the Copenhagen climate summit must result in a real difference for particularly vulnerable developing countries, through an ambitious adaptation action framework. A key role therefore needs to be played by scaled-up financial support provided by developed countries, it said. bdne
