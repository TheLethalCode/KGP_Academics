 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked banks and financial institutes to give collateral free loans to small and medium entrepreneurs and keep the interest rate at a rational level. She said the government is also contemplating providing increased facilities for those interested in investing outside Dhaka. "The annual rate of interest for loans in agriculture, SME, housing and trade sectors has been set at maximum 13 percent and we will try to reduce it further in phases," Hasina said while opening a two-day SME Financing Fair at Sonargaon Hotel on Tuesday. The PM said the government wants the contribution of industrial sector to the national revenue rise to 40 percent from 28 percent by 2021. She said if the entrepreneurs invest outside Dhaka it will help decentralisation and reduce pressure on the capital. "I talked to the Bangladesh Bank governor if they could provide facilities to the investors outside Dhaka and cut interest rate." Hasina mentioned various steps taken by the government to tide over power crisis. "We are examining possibilities of importing power from the neighbouring countries. We have had talks with India and Bhutan on the matter." She asked the investors to use solar power. "Solar power is being used at the prime minister's office. If you use solar power it will cut pressure on the national grid," Hasina said. Industry minister Dilip Barua asked for lowering loan interest rate to single digit. He also called for more facilities for women entrepreneurs. Some 26 banks are taking part in the fair organised by Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Small and medium range entrepreneurs will be able to get information about loans from the fair. bdnew
