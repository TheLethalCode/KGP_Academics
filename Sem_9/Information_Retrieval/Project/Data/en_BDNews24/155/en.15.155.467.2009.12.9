<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 09 (bdnews24.com)--The Election Commission on Wednesday congratulated opposition BNP on completion of its council to approve a new constitution in line with the Representation of People Order. Democracy will get entrenched among political parties holding councils, election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain told reporters. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Tuesday alleged that the Election Commission and others made them lose the last general elections. Sakhawat's colleague M Sohul Hussain rejected her allegation. He said political parties say such things for 'technical reasons'. Of 39 political parties, 33 have submitted their 'amended' constitutions to the Election Commission. Six political parties, including BNP, have not yet submitted their 'amended' constitutions. Under the electoral laws, they will have to submit their 'amended' constitutions by January next. Hossain hoped that political parties will frame their constitution in line with the RPO, but added that the EC would move to amend them in case there is any inconsistency, he also said. bd
