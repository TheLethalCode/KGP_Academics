 WASHINGTON, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Five American men were arrested in Pakistan this week and are being investigated for alleged links to extremist groups, the Pakistani embassy in Washington said on Wednesday. The five men, students in their 20s from northern Virginia, were picked up from Sargodha in Punjab province in Pakistan on Tuesday, said embassy spokesman Imran Gardezi. He did not give further details on the circumstances of their arrest, their names or where they were being held. "The reasons for their visit to Pakistan are being investigated," said Gardezi. "They are being investigated for alleged links to extremist groups." The FBI said in a statement it was in contact with the families of the five as well as law-enforcement authorities in Pakistan. "We are working with Pakistan authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if indeed these are the students who had gone missing. Because this is an ongoing investigation, we will not be able to provide further details at this time," the FBI said. A Muslim civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), said it brought the case to the attention of U.S. law-enforcement authorities this month after family members informed CAIR of the young men's disappearance. CAIR urged anyone aware of the missing group's activities to come forward. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the US embassy in Islamabad was also seeking information about the five. "If they are American citizens, we of course are going to be very interested in the charges that they've been detained on and what sort of circumstances they're being held," said Kelly. CLINTON DECLINES COMMENT Asked about the five, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined comment but reiterated the United States was concerned about the work of extremist groups in Pakistan, particularly in the border areas with Afghanistan. "We know we've got to work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people," she said. News of the five students came as a Chicago man with Pakistani roots, accused of scouting targets for the 2008 Mumbai attacks in India, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday at his first court appearance since his October arrest. The national executive director of CAIR, Nihad Awad, told a news conference that last week some relatives of the young men went to see him and expressed concern that the five "had been missing since the weekend under mysterious circumstances." The families had discovered that the men had gone overseas but the "bits and pieces were not adding together," Awad said. His group helped the families contact the FBI, and CAIR believes that their tip had led to the arrests in Pakistan. An eleven-minute video was left behind that appeared to be a "farewell" from the young men, Awad said. He watched the video and found its contents disturbing. It did not say what the men planned to do, but dealt with conflicts in the world and featured verses of the Koran, he said. While he declined to discuss what the five men may be suspected of doing, Awad said he was not aware of any similarities to American nationals of Somali origin who went to Somalia last year to fight for Islamist rebels. He and other Muslim leaders expressed concern that the case may be misused by some to try to marginalize Muslim Americans. After the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, CAIR and other Muslim groups sought to tamp down anti-Muslim sentiment in the United Stat
