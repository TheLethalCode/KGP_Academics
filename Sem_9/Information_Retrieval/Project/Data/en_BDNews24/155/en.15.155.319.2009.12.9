 EAST LONDON, South Africa, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pace bowler Jimmy Anderson will miss England's two-day warm-up against a SA Provincial XI on Wednesday with his niggling knee injury causing concern ahead of next week's first test against South Africa. Anderson only batted in England's net session on Tuesday and will sit out the match in East London. "Yes, it is a concern. He's one of our main bowlers and he's our strike bowler. He had some further injections into his knee to try and settle things down. He had them on Saturday, so we are allowing time for those to work," Flower told reporters on Tuesday. "He's had a good reaction so far, but won't play in the first two-day game, then will play in the second one and hopefully be ready for the first test. "He could probably get through all four days, but we are trying to allow the injections to have an effect and he needs a little more time without any bowling, and we are giving him that," Flower added. "Two days of middle practice in the second game should be sufficient for Jimmy." England play two, back-to-back, two-day warm-up games against invitation XIs in East London, before the first test starts in Centurion starts on Dec. 1
