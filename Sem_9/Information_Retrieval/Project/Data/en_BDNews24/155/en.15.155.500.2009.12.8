 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.coms environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)  This decade has been the warmest since the beginning of instrumental climate records in 1850, according to data compiled by the World Meteorological Organisation. The year 2009 is likely to rank in the top 10 warmest years on record, the WMO said in a report launched Tuesday, the second day of the Copenhagen climate talks. This year above-normal temperatures were recorded in parts of most continents. Only North America (United States and Canada) experienced conditions that were cooler than average. Given the current figures, large parts of southern Asia and central Africa are likely to have the warmest year on record. Climate extremes, including devastating floods, severe droughts, snowstorms, heatwaves and cold waves, were recorded in many parts of the world. This year the extreme warm events were more frequent and intense in southern South America, Australia and southern Asia, in particular. LOWEST ARCTIC ICE According to scientific measurements, Arctic sea ice has declined dramatically over the past 30 years at least, with the most extreme decline seen in the summer melt season. This preliminary information for 2009 is based on climate data from networks of land-based weather and climate stations, ships and buoys, as well as satellites. The data are continuously collected and disseminated by the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of the 189 Members of WMO and several collaborating research institutions.
