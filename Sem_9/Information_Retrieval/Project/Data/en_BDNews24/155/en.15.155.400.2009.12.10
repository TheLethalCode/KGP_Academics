 Dhaka, Dec 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has exempted home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder from appearance in a contempt of court ruling. A HC bench of justice Syed Md Dastagir Hossain and justice Md Roisuddin granted the exemption on a government petition on Thursday. The same bench on Wednesday had ordered the secretary, deputy commissioner of Dhaka, inspector general of prisons and jailer of Dhaka Central Jail to appear in the court on Dec 13, issuing the ruling on failure to comply with an order concerning medical treatment of detained BNP leader Abdus Salam Pintu. The court on Oct 13 ordered special treatment outside the jail for the ex-deputy minister, and on Nov 24 it again asked for his treatment inside the jail by the specialist physician. Pintu, an accused in the Aug 21 grenade attack case, filed a contempt of court petition on Dec 7 as both the orders were not obeyed. The Aug 21 grenade attack at Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who was then opposition leader. Some 22 people face charges in the cases, including Pintu, his brother Maolana Tajuddin, also the alleged grenade supplier, and Mufti Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami. bdn
