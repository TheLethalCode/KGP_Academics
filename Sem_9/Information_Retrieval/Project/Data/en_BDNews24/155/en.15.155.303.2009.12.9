<TITLE> UK's Darling will set stage for election fight </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling will on Wednesday set the stage for the coming election and gamble his government's future on a one-off tax on bank bonuses and promises to protect schools, hospitals and policing. Darling's Labour government is on course to lose an election that must take place in less than 6 months and desperately needs the pre-budget report at 1230 GMT to close in on the opposition Conservative Party's commanding lead in opinion polls. Treasury sources have told Reuters he will have to raise his forecast for government borrowing from a record 175 billion pounds this year by a couple of billion pounds, limiting the scope for any giveaways. A Reuters poll predicts an extra 11 billion gilts will have to be issued in the next three months. Instead, Labour is expected to announce tax rises for the rich that may not dent the deficit much but could get more bang for their buck in opinion polls by cashing in on public rage against bankers for the longest recession since World War 2. Under consideration is a tax on bankers' bonuses, according to government sources. The most likely option is a levy on banks that pay bonuses at a rate near 50 percent, akin to employers' National Insurance contributions. There may also be changes to inheritance and capital gains tax regimes. Treasury sources told Reuters on Tuesday that tough spending cuts lie ahead for everything except health, education and the police. "We're not fixing departmental budgets now, but people have a right to know which services we will prioritise and how we intend to pay for them," one source said. "We are under no illusion that will mean some tough choices -- cutting unnecessary programmes and lower priority budgets." TOUGH TIMES AHEAD Darling will admit the recession has turned out to be deeper than he forecast in April but stick to his forecast of growth of 1 to 1.5 percent next year, according to Treasury sources. Borrowing will climb to just under 180 billion pounds in this fiscal year, but a Treasury source told Reuters it now looks as if the structural part of that is lower, allowing borrowing to come down more quickly when growth resumes. The source said Darling would pledge to cut the deficit to 5.5 percent or less of GDP by 2013-14 and would give more details of a Fiscal Responsibility Bill committing the government to cut borrowing as a share of GDP to 2015-16. But the PBR may turn out to be a non-event for financial markets, beyond traders' worries about their own wallets. Markets expect the Conservative Party to be in power by June and know anything Labour says now may never come to pass. Conservative leader David Cameron rammed the point home on Tuesday, repeating his pledge to hold an emergency budget within 50 days of taking office, if elected. That is complicating life for analysts and policymakers trying to get a handle on just where the economy is headed. Few doubt that big tax rises and spending cuts are on the way, but no political party is going to spell them out before an election. Labour is clearly hoping a hard line on bankers' pay will give it some momentum in the polls, which despite some narrowing in their lead, still mostly show the Conservatives on course for victory at an election expected in May. Labour would like to portray itself as the champion of hard-working families against a Conservative Party that panders to the rich. Cameron hit back at such accusations at the weekend, saying Prime Minister Gordon Brown's jibes about his privileged upbringing were petty and spiteful. "For all the hype, the political shenanigans, the big picture is there is a massive hole in the public finances and we are unlikely to see that plugged by (the pre-budget report) proposals," said Alan Clarke, UK economist at BNP Parib
