 Dhaka, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)--Four officials of the MV Coco-4 secured anticipatory bail at the High Court on Wednesday in the case that accuses them of causing the deaths of scores of passengers when the launch capsized in Bhola on Nov 27. The bench of justices AFM Abdur Rahman and Mohammad Imdadul Huq granted them six months bail following a petition by the accused. The four officials are master of the launch Abdur Rahim, manager Mizanur Rahman, terminal supervisor Mohammed Kibria and a staff 'Zaman'. The court asked the government to explain why the four should not get permanent bail. Ferry survivor Mohammed Kamal filed the negligent homicide case on Nov 30 with Lalmohon Police Station. The case accuses the on-duty officials of the MV Coco-4 of causing the deaths of at least 85 passengers by overloading and attempting to dock 50 feet away from the Nazirpur launch terminal, where passengers were attempting to disembark. The Coco-4 partially capsized on Nov 27, the night before Eid-ul-Azha, on the river Tentulia at Nazirpur in Lalmohan, some 40 km from Bhola district town. The vessel, crowded from hull to decks with people heading home to celebrate the holiday with families, began tipping with the weight of disembarking passengers and partially sank, according to eye witnesses. ASM Mizanur Rahman argued at the bail appeal hearing for the defendants. Additional attorney general AKM Zahirul Huq and deputy attorney general Kazi Isarul Huq Akanda argued for the prosecution. bdnews
