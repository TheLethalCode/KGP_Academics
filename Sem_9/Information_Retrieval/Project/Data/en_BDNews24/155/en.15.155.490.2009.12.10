 NAGPUR, India, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Skipper Kumar Sangakkara lashed 78 off just 37 balls to inspire Sri Lanka to a 29-run win over India in the first Twenty20 international on Wednesday. Sangakkara hit 11 fours and two sixes, his fourth Twenty20 fifty off 21 balls equalling the fastest by a Sri Lankan, until he was run out off the final delivery of the innings. Sri Lanka amassed 215 for five after being put in on a good pitch and then restricted the hosts to 186 for nine. India dropped three easy catches, missed an easy run out and repeatedly misfielded to spoil their hopes at the halfway mark. Sangakkara, who made 137 in the final test in the 2-0 series defeat, lashed 17 runs in one over from left-arm spinner Pragyan Ojha and 15 more off debutant seamer Ashok Dinda in another. He added 74 with Tillakaratne Dilshan for the second wicket and 69 for the fourth wicket with Chamara Kapugedera, who blazed to 47 from just 20 deliveries. Indian openers Gautam Gambhir, who hit 55 off 26 balls, and Virender Sehwag (26) began promisingly but fell while desperately trying to score quickly before Sri Lankan steadily tightened their grip. The second and final game will be played in Mohali on Saturda
