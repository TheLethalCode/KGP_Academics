 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Copenhagen, Dec 08 (bdnews24.com)  Some 75 percent of any climate adaptation fund should go to the most vulnerable small islands, LDCs and African countries, and it should come from developed countries, the Bangladesh delegation to Copenhagen said on Tuesday. Bangladesh made the plea on behalf of least developing countries and those most vulnerable to climate change, at a press conference at the Bella Conference Centre in the Danish capital. It also demanded a legally binding framework for the adaptation fund. Dr. Ainun Nishat, member of the Bangladesh delegation, said, "The climate fund should not be mixed up with official development assistance, which is a separate thing. This is very important." "We also want some kind of legal enforcement." "There was a commitment in 1990 that 0.7 percent of GDP of rich nations would go to overseas aid for developing countries. This has not happened." "If the adaptation fund also remains voluntary, the same inaction will be seen, what ever is finally agreed," he said. He said 1.5 percent of GDP was being mentioned for the adaptation fund.
