 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com's environment correspondent Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com - Three-quarters of any climate adaptation fund should go to the most vulnerable countries, Dhaka's delegation to Copenhagen said on Tuesday, as a new report revealed that Bangladesh was among the countries worst affected by climate change. Bangladesh made the plea on behalf of least developing countries and those most vulnerable to climate change, at a press conference at the Bella Conference Centre in the Danish capital. It also demanded a legally binding framework for the adaptation fund. Dr. Ainun Nishat, a member of the Bangladesh delegation, said 75 percent of any climate money should should go to the most vulnerable countries such as small islands, the LDCs and African countries. He stressed: "The climate fund should not be mixed up with official development assistance, which is a separate thing. This is very important." "We also want some kind of legal enforcement." "There was a commitment in 1990 that 0.7 percent of GDP of rich nations would go to overseas aid for developing countries. This has not happened." "If the adaptation fund also remains voluntary, the same inaction will be seen, what ever is finally agreed," he said. He said 1.5 percent of GDP was being mentioned for the adaptation fund. BANGLADESH 'MOST AFFECTED' Earlier in the day, a new report unveiled in the Danish capital, said Bangladesh, Myanmar and Honduras were the countries most affected by climate change over the two decades from 1990. Berlin-based Germanwatch, in its 'Global Climate Risk Index 2010' report, said the top 10 most affected countries were all developing nations in the low-income or lower-middle income country group. The report said 600,000 people died as a direct consequence of more than 11,000 extreme weather events around the world, with losses incurred of $1.7 trillion, over the period surveyed from 1990-2008. It said such natural disasters and their consequences could weaken the process to reach Millenium Development Goals and the most affected countries needed greater financial assistance to achieve the goals. Bangladesh was among the countries facing "continuous" climate change impact, the report said, although more than 80% of deaths in the period surveyed occurred in 1991. More 140,000 people were killed in a devastating cyclone that year. The fact that no such catastrophic death toll occurred since, despite continuing extreme weather events, is partial proof that it is possible to prepare for climate risks and prevent larger-scale calamities, said the report. Bangladesh incurs annual losses of 1.81 percent of GDP due to extreme weather events, according to the report. Total losses were $2.19 billion a year from 1990 to 2008, said the report. Man-made climate change is expected to lead to further increases in precipitation extremes, both increases in heavy precipitation and increases in drought, said the report. It said the Copenhagen climate summit must result in a real difference for particularly vulnerable developing countries, through an ambitious adaptation action framework. A key role therefore needs to be played by scaled-up financial support provided by developed countries, it said. bdn
