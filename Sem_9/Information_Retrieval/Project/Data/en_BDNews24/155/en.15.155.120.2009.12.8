 GENEVA, Dec 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay voiced concern on Tuesday that Iran is using more force to suppress protests and urged the Islamic republic to respect opposition supporters' right to protest. "The suppression of protests is escalating, it is much more serious," Pillay told Reuters. She also said that a senior Iranian human rights official, who had requested a meeting with her, set for Tuesday, had cancelled it.

The South African judge and former UN war crimes judge said that she was reviewing the fairness of trials of people arrested in the post-election violence, which had led to some receiving death penalties or severe prison terms. "I also drew attention to the trials that are going on. There are very severe penalties that are being imposed," Pillay said. "I've asked about the mode of those trials and I'm examining whether there has been fair trial." Pillay's department relies on a variety of sources, including the Human Rights Council's own independent experts, to investigate cases and does not depend solely on national authorities for information. Thousands of people were arrested in the June protests. Most have since been freed, but more than 80 have so far been sentenced to up to 15 years in jail and five people have been sentenced to d
