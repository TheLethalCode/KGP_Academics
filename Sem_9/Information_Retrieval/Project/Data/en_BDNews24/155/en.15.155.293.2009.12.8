 Dhaka, Dec 8 (bdnews24.com)The closed-door council session of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party began at 4:30pm on Tuesday after a break to amend the party constitution and hold the formal council. The council had been adjourned until late afternoon after chairperson Khaleda Zia's speech at 2:10pm. The main opposition is conducting its fifth council at Bangabandhu International Conference Centre after a long hiatus of 16 years. The slogan of the council is: Different people, different paths but a consensus to save the country. Secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain will place the proposals on amendment to party constitution. Councillors will join the session with the party leaders as well. The council took off in the morning with Khaleda hoisting the national flag at the conference venue at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar in the capital. A four-member delegation of the ruling Awami League, the arch-rival of BNP, led by Ashim Kumar Ukil, attended the inaugural session. As many as 2,512 councillors, 12,000 delegates from across the country and 3,000 local and foreign guests are attending the council. BNP senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman, now in England for treatment since Sept 2007, will appear on a big screen with a pre-recorded statement. The council is being held to amend the party's constitution as required under the amended Representation of People Order, a set of electoral laws. BNP will have to submit its amended constitution to the Election Commission by Jan 24, 2010. The evening session will elect the future leaders of the party, including the secretary general. Khaleda was re-elected unopposed as she was the only candidate for the top post. She took over the position of party chairperson in 1983 from then BNP chairman late Abdus Sattar, when the post was renamed 'chairperson'. She was elected again in the party council in Sept 1993. The party will propose to add to its constitution the provision of a number of new posts of senior secretary general, deputy treasurer and indigenous people affairs secretary and one more joint secretary. BNP vice president Tariqul Islam, who is also the convenor of the constitution reform committee, said on Monday they have received some 40 reform proposals from across the country. In addition, there are suggestions for expansion of all committees from grassroots union level to central level with a provision for every committee to have at least 30 percent women, he also said. The highest policy-making forum of the party, the national standing committee, has approved all the proposals after scrutiny. But the proposals will get the final endorsement at the national council, Islam said. bdnew
