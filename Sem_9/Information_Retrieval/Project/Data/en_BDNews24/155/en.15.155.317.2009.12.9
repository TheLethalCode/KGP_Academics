<TITLE> In Bangladesh, 'climate refugees' not some distant prospect </TITLE>

 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Cox's Bazar, Dec 9 (bdnews24.com)As you walk past the wild tamarisk shrubs cropping up beyond Labonee Point on Cox's Bazar beach, you will come upon Kutubdia Parha, clusters of makeshift dwellings along the shore erected by climate refugees from the slowly sinking Kutubdia Island. Scientists say rising sea levels may displace some 20 million people in Bangladesh by 2050. A study conducted by the water resources ministry forecasts a considerable chunk of today's Bangladesh will be inundated. This amounts to a fifth of total numbers forecast. Climate change stands to drive as many as one billion people from their homes over the next four decades, the International Organisation for Migration said in a study published at the Copenhagen climate talks. But for the residents of Kutubdia Para, being a "climate refugee" is not some distant prospect, it's their reality today. Abdus Shukur, 58, one of the first settlers in the camp, told bdnews24.com, the process of losing homes on Kutubdia island and settling on the Cox's Bazar shore began during the devastating 1960 cyclone. Three decades on, the 1991 cyclone destroyed around 4,500 homes on Kutubdia island, bringing another wave of families who crossed the sea and resettled on the mainland shore, he said. "Now people arrive all the time as the island erodes." Bangladesh tops the Global Climate Risk Index, according to a report just published at the Copenhagen climate talks. The report, based on data by the world's largest reinsurer, Munich Re, shows Bangladesh has been the worst hit by climate change over the two decades from 1990. Kutubdia Parha stretches about two and a half kilometres along the beach and reaches one and a half kilometres inland. It is bounded by the airport to the east, the Bay of Bengal to the west, Nazir Tek to the north and an ADB hatchery to the south. This massive exodus and relocation of thousands of islanders has been overseen by the district administration. Homeless families, from Ali Akbar Deil, Khudiar Tek, Basho Ghope, Ali Fakir Deil, Kalamma Chharha and other villages on Kutubdia, were recommended for rehousing by the local councillors. Kutubdia Parha housed 120 families in 1988, which grew to form a settlement of 565 families in 1991, according to government figures. Its population has officially swelled to over 7,000 now. But others say the number is much higher. Non-government organisation Coast Trust executive director Rezaul Karim Chowdhury told bdnews24.com: "Over 20,000 homeless people now reside in Kutubdia Parha." Residents of the Parha, officially recognised now as Ward No 1 of Cox's Bazar municipality, say it also houses coastal belt refugees from districts as far flung as Bhola, Hatia, Noakhali and Barisal. Beyind this locality, the homeless have also taken shelter in other nearby settlements such as Samity Parha, Fadonnyar Tek, Mostakkya Parha and Bashonnya Parha. NO PERMANENT HOME Experts say the coastal belt of Bangladesh is eroding at an unprecedented rate, which is aggravated by global warming, rising sea level and extreme weather events induced by changing climate, especially threatening the low-lying coastal areas and islands. "We lost homes to the sea and settled here. Now we hear that this coast is also threatened, we are tired of moving from one place to another. It looks like only death will fianlly solve the problem of our settling somewhere permanently," Shab-e-Meraj told bdnews24.com. Samity Parha now sees sea waves crashing onto the sandy back yards of the shanties, at one time a safe distance from the sea. Mohammad Hannan, 16, said he was born here. His father arrived from Barisal 20 years ago. Hannan says in has seen the settlement grow before his eyes, spreading another 500 yards to the west. He has also seen many homes dismantled due to the advancing sea. His family members may need to move out any day. Md Sekandar, 62, from Bhola, lost his land to river erosion. He has been living here for about three decades and runs a small grocery store. Father of four sons and four daughters, Sekandar expressed hopelessness: "This place will also be devoured by the sea within a year. Only Allah knows where we shall move to next." Ninety-year-old Syeda Khatun, who arrived from Maghnama in Chakoria, said she passes her days in constant fear of losing her home to erosion again. Besides, the government also plans to evict them from the seashore, she said. Not mentioning the exact number of refugees, deputy commissioner Ghiasuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "Efforts are on to raise people's awareness of the vulnerability of Bangladesh to the climate change induced disasters and also to combat the adverse effects." "The number of climate refugees seeking shelter on the Cox's Bazar seashore has been on the increase. When the court orders the eviction of the landless from there, their situaiton must be considered." In a bid to protect the 112 kilometres long Cox's Bazar beach, the government has planned to plant its whole length with coconut palms spending Tk 3 crore, he said. RISING SEAS Twenty million people in Bangladesh face the same plight as the Kutibdia Island refugees as seas rise, say scientists of the Centre for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS). A 2007 CEGIS study titled 'Sea level rise impact on coastal livelihood in Bangladesh' covered the 16 coastal districts. Ahmadul Hasan, head of research, told bdnews24.com: "Our research indicates that the Bay sea level has rising for the last 30 years at an average rate of five millimetres a year." "It will surpass 27 centimetres by 2050 if the current rate remains unchanged." Widespread salinity will grip extensive areas of Satkhira, Bagerhat, Khulna, Gopalganj and Barisal districts, he said. Hasan also pointed out that population along the coastal belt, as elsewhere, was increasing. "Under that kind of scenario, some 2 crore coastal inhabitants will be compelled to move further up." According to the Dhaka University disaster, research and training management centre, 44 upazilas in 12 coastal districts are vulnerable to extreme cyclones, storm surges and flash floods. Researchers say there exists acute lack of dependable data about the region, as only scanty or piecemeal surveys have so far been conducted in the area. The DU researchers say proper data on the number of displaced climate victims are also sadly lacking, without which plans for their security and livelihoods can barely begin. bdn
