 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Awami League-backed candidates were elected chairmen to two Upazila councils Monday in the re-elections to five Upazilas that had polls postponed over irregularities. The rest three local government bodies saw pro-Parbatya Chattagram Janasanhati Samiti and Jama'at-e-Islami and independent candidates win. The voter turnout was thinner than before in Barura, said the upazila election officials deployed there. A polling agent was allegedly assaulted at Barura by the opponents. At Brahmanbarhia Sadar, after a polling agent was detained by the polls officials, locals and the police chased each other. No unpleasant incidents were reported from the rest three Upazila. Abdul Baten, senior assistant secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters that voters turned out in increased numbers during the later part of the 8am-4pm voting. Elections were postponed on Jan 22 in these five Upazila as ballot snatching, chasing out polling officials from polling centres, clashes between opponents and other pre-polls irregularities had been reported from the areas. Security problems forced postponement of election at Ukhia prior to Jan 22. Polling has been shifted this time too at Ukhia. Results In Ramganj Upazila of Luxmipur, Awami League-backed Manir Hossain Chowdhury has been elected chairman. AKM Ruhul Amin and Nilufer Kabir were elected vice chairman and female vice chairman. In Belkuchi Upazila of Sirajganj district, Jama'at-e-Islami- backed Ali Alam was elected chairman, Abdul Hamid Akand vice chairman and Sonia Sabur female chairman. In Brahmanbarhia Sadar Upazila, independent candidate Bashirullah Jaru was elected chairman, Noor-e-Alam Siddiqui vice chairman and Mamtaz Bashar female vice chairman. Hafiz Ahmed backed by AL was elected chairman in Barura Upazila, Md Solaiman Patwari vice chairman and Azmeer Sultana, female vice chairman. In Dighinala Upazila of Khagrhachharhi district, PCJSS-backed Dharmabeer Chakma was elected chairman, Supriyo Chakma vice chairman and Shatarupa Chakma female vice chair. Clashes Police allegedly detained and beat polling agent Shafiqul Haque Babar while he was assisting a female voter casting her vote at Sohata Primary School centre under Machhihata union of Brahmanbarhia Sadar. The locals then swooped on the polling centre with sticks and clashed with police for an hour, when the voting was kept suspended. Executive magistrate Abul Kalam Azad later led a striking force to the scene, brought the situation under control and freed agent Babar. At Krishnapur polling centre in Barura, polling agent Anwar Hossain alleged that supporters of 'umbrella' symbol assaulted him while he was on his way to the centre. Anwar was admitted to a local hospital. The security personnel posted at the centre, however, said, they had nothing to do with any incident occurring outside their centre. Voter turnout Excepting these two incidents, voting was otherwise peaceful elsewhere over the five Upazila. Abdul Baten, the senior assistant secretary, told reporters that the election was held properly, freely. bdnews24.com correspondents said the voter turnout was comparatively lower this time. Golam Mostafa, additional deputy commissioner and returning officer, Luxmipur, said 30 to 34 percent votes were cast in different centres of Ramganj Upazila . bdnews2
