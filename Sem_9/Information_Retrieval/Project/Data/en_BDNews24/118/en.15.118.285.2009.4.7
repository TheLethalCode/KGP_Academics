 Dhaka, April 07 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Tuesday passed a bill authorising the government to acquire land for construction of the proposed Padma Bridge, set to be the country's longest. The previous BNP government initiated the project to connect 24 southern and southwestern districts with Dhaka via Mawa in Munshiganj. The new Awami League-led government has fast-tracked the 5.8-kilometre bridge plan which is scheduled to start in 2011 at a cost of US$1.5 billion. But the construction work has been delayed owing to land tangles. This bill is likely to remove those problems. The bill was passed Tuesday amid opposition from the BNP and its allies whose amendment proposals were rejected by voice vote. The House passed the bill, proposed by land minister Rezaul Karim Hira, with a huge "yes" from the treasury bench. The BNP-led opposition, having only 31 MPs, replied with a strong "no". Justifying the bill, the minister said unscrupulous people had erected illegal structures overnight on the land to be acquired for the government project. According to land acquisition rules, he said, the government must pay for all structures. "Therefore, the cost of projects goes up. "This bill should stop such a trend and reduce the cost of the bridge," said Hira. Section 5 of the bill says the government will not compensate anyone for constructing any structures built 'overnight'. The bill also says district authorities will prepare a record of the land to be acquired. Opposition MPs, however, had some concerns. "This bill will deprive landowners of proper compensation," Mahbub Uddin Khokon, a BNP MP, told the House. Another BNP MP Jafrul Islam Chowdhury said, "If there is any legal challenge from the owners of the acquired land, the construction of the bridge might be further delayed". Opposition MPs : Zainul Abdin, Fazlul Azim, Nazimuddin Ahmed, Asifa Ashrafi Papiya and Hamidur Rahman Azad also spoke on the bill. But the minister rejected their concerns and proposed passing the bill as recommended by the standing committee on land. bdn
