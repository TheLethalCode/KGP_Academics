 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com) - Promising batsman Shamsur Rahman Shuvo of Mohammdan SC has made a strong case for entry into the national fold after finishing top among the 10 most successful batsman of the just concluded Premier Division Cricket League. Shamsur, who struck 398 runs in 10 innings in the first leg, showed consistency to strike 279 runs in five innings of the super league to raise his tally to 677 from 15 innings with an average of 48.35. The 20-year-old batsman struck a swashbuckling 127 against City Club in the first leg, but he was deprived of two centuries in the super league matches as he fell three and two runs short against Abahani and Bangladesh Biman respectively, but helped Mohammedan finish third in the 12-team table. National opener Tamim Iqbal of champions Abahani climbed up 13 places to finish behind Shamsur as the left-handed batsman smacked 576 runs from 16 innings with an average of 36. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful showed amazing performance to hit four successive fifties that lifted him up to sixth place from the first leg 36th position. Ashraful, who made 258 runs in the first leg 10 innings, played another five matches to finish with 543 runs with an average of 41.76. Tamim and Ashraful are the only national batsmen among the top run-getters, but without Pakistani Zahid Niaz (9th 526), the remaining batsmen are all but youngster -- M Mithun (4th -- 566), Imran Ahmed (5th 564), Jahurul Islam (7th 542), Imrul Kayes (8th 540) and Amit Majumdar (10th 491). Old horse Hannan Sarkar impressed all to grab the third place having amassed 569 runs with an average of 35.56 and the top-order batsman was picked for the 30-member preliminary squad of Twenty20 World Cup. However, no one could topple Old DOHS pacer Abul Hasan's first leg 29 scalps despite playing another five super league matches. The 17-year-old pacer played only 10 matches to take highest wickets as his side DOHS finished eighth. Spinner Sabbir Rahman of Surjo Tarun finished behind Abul to take 28 wickets playing 16 matches while Bangladesh pace spearhead Mashrafee Bin Mortaza also took 28 scalps playing 13 matches. Meanwhile, Mashrafee had started to bowl off-spin in the latter part of the first leg because of a back pain and never switched to his favourite bowling style till the conclusion. The remaining bowlers are: left-arm spinner Saqline Sajib (26 wickets), paceman Mahbubul Alam (26 wickets), left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo (23 wickets), pacer Tareq Aziz Khan (21), spinner Nabil Samad (21 wickets), left-arm pacer Sajedul Islam (20 wickets) and Shafiul Islam (20 wickets). bd
