 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com)  CID raided a number of houses rented by BDR members in the Lalbagh and Hazaribagh areas of the city on Wednesday, a day after the government put a Tk 50,000 reward on the head of each border guard still 'on the run' after the Feb 25-26 mutiny. "The raid was to nab fugitive BDR men and to recover weapons looted from Peelkhana," Abdul Qahhar Akhand, CID investigating officer in the mutiny case, told bdnews24.com. Local police and members of the armed forces took part in the raid from 7 to 10 in the morning, said Golam Rahman, officer-in-charge of Lalbagh Police Station. "But no one was arrested and no arms were recovered." Officials say between 800 and 1100 BDR men are still 'fugitives'. Around 800 border guards have been arrested to date in connection with the case. Meanwhile, the mutiny case, initially filed with Lalbagh police, was transferred to New Market Police Station on Tuesday. Some 39 days after the case was first filed, officials said Tuesday that the border force's Peelkhana headquarters, site of the mutiny, was under jurisdiction of New Market police rather than Lalbagh. bdnews24.com/lh/
