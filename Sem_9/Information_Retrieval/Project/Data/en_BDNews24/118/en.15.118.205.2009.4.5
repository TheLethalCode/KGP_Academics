 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  RAB recovered Sunday a mobile-phone set it said was looted during the Feb 25 BDR mutiny in Peelkhana from Bedgram in Gopalganj. A RAB-8 team of Madaripur led by Major Anwar-us-Sadat in a raid seized the handset from a shop. Anwar said BDR member Md Touhidur Rahman had looted the cell phone of slain army officer Major Mohammed Saleh. Rahman fled to his village home in Chuadanga on Feb 27. On Feb 28, Touhid returned to Dhaka to join back his duty on government order and left the set with his wife who handed it to her brother, Sarwar. Sarwar later joined ansar camp in Bedram and took the handset with him. As he went to a nearby shop Sunday morning to recharge account, RAB captured him and seized the set. The elite force turned Sarwar to ansar camp-1 in Madaripur and filed a general diary with Gopalganj Police Station. The mobile set was sent to the RAB headquarters in Dhaka. bdn
