Abdul Alim added after the weekly 'haat' at around 10:30pm Sunday, when all were gone home, a fire, most possibly caused by electrical short circuit, broke out and spread fast. By the time people arrived at the village market, the flames engulfed the shops owned by Quddus Mollah, Shariful Islam, Arzoo Miah, Biswajit Kundu, Ayub Ali, Rezaul Karim, Abdur Rashid, Golam Mostafa and others. Sharat Chandra Biswas, Shailkupa fire brigade chief, said with reinforcements from Magura they arrived at the scene at 10:40pm and doused the fire after fighting for three hours. bdnews24.c
