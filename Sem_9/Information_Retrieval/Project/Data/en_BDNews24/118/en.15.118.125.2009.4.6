 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak said Monday "all bars" had been lifted to his going abroad, and he had consequently withdrawn two petitions against the government. "The government has withdrawn all restrictions on my travel," Razzak told bdnews24.com. "As a result, I have withdrawn my two writ petitions." He said he would be flying to Singapore Tuesday night. "I am happy to see a satisfactory end to the matter," said the Jamaat leader. Anticipatory bail in mutiny case Razzak secured six months anticipatory bail on Sunday from the High Court after CID investigators had summoned him last month for questioning in the BDR mutiny case. CID questioned him on Mar 30, though the Jamaat leader had filed a petition with the High Court challenging the summons. The High Court allowed the questioning but issued a 'no arrest or harassment' order. Razzak said at the time: "I was summoned for questioning by the CID to be harassed." He said he had filed a contempt of court case against the government, and was sent the summons immediately after that. Twice barred from flying Razzak had filed a contempt case against the government and airport police after he was twice barred as he was trying to leave the country. On Mar 7, immigration officials at Zia International Airport prevented Razzak from leaving the country. The following day, on a petition by Razzak, the High Court directed the government not to create any hindrance to his going abroad. On Mar 18, Razzak, with his wife Saleha Siddique, was again stopped at the airport. Airport police said they attempted to board a flight "by force" without proper documents. The next day, Razzak filed a case against the government for contempt of court by failing to heed the High Court's 'no bar' orders
