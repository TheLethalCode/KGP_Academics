<TITLE> Decision on daylight saving soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com)  The power ministry may make a final decision next week on whether to introduce Daylight Saving Time, by turning clocks forward an hour, to conserve power countrywide. "We want to introduce daylight saving because it is much easier to conserve 1MW power in this way than it is to produce an extra 1MW of electricity," state minister for power Shamsul Haq Tuku told reporters Sunday. The ministry has been planning to set clocks forward for an 'extra hour' of daylight to manage the acute power crisis across the country. The minister briefed reporters after a meeting attended by energy adviser to the prime minister Toufiquee-Elahi Chowdhury and officials from other ministries. "The matter needed to be further discussed with all official stakeholders. We asked them to submit their written advice and opinions by Thursday on whether to introduce the system," said Tuku. "Another meeting will be held next week, after receiving the replies, for a final decision. For now it is still on the table," he added. The power ministry is seeking replies from 18-19 ministries and divisions on the plan. bd
