 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court has served a rule nisi upon the government to explain why it should not allow former BNP MP Ali Asghar Lobi go abroad. The High Court bench of justices Nazmun Ara Sultana and Shamsul Huda issued the order upon a petition by Lobi who claimed his name was on a list of people who were 'barred from flight' by the government. The home secretary, immigration chief, inspector general of police and officer in charge of Zia International Airport police were named respondents to the order. Lobi's lawyer Shah Manjurul Haque said his client had secured visas and bought tickets for London and Singapore. "But Lobi came to know that his name was on a list of 62 people who were not allowed to go abroad," Haque said. Additional attorney general MK Rahman said that as Lobi had not yet gone to airport to fly out, therefore he had not been "barred from flight". "His writ petition is out of context," said Rahman. b
