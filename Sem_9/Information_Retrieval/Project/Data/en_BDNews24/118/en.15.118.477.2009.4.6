 KARACHI, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani selectors have recalled fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar for this month's one-day series against Australia. Shoaib, who had been sidelined with a knee injury, was named in a 15-member squad announced on Monday by chief selector Abdul Qadir after he passed a fitness test. "Shoaib has put in a lot of effort during the fitness test and has also played domestic cricket. The medical panel was satisfied with his fitness," Qadir told a news conference. Pakistan play Australia in five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match in Abu Dhabi and Dubai from April 22 to May 7. The matches are being played in a neutral venue after Australia refused to tour Pakistan because of security concerns. Rookie opener Ahmed Shahzad was also named in the squad. Pakistan squad: Younis Khan (captain), Misbah-ul-Haq, Salman Butt, Nasir Jamshed, Shoaib Malik, Shahid Afridi, Kamran Akmal, Sohail Tanvir, Umar Gul, Saeed Ajmal, Yasir Arafat, Rao Iftikhar, Fawad Alam, Ahmed Shahzad, Shoaib Akhtar
