 Rangpur, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)BNP candidate Rahim Uddin Bharasha who lost Thursday's by-polls to Rangpur-3 constituency has refused to accept the results for what he said was rigging and demanded a re-election. Jatiya Party candidate Roushan Ershad was unofficially declared winner. Bharasha at a press conference Friday threatened agitation if his demand was not met. "How did she poll 87,000 votes with only 7 percent voters turning out to cast ballots until 2pm," he asked. According to unofficial result, Roushan bagged 87,847 votes in 136 polling centres, while Bharasha got 25,524 votes. By-elections to Bogra- 6 and 7, Rangpur-6, Kurigram -2 and Kishoreganj-6 seats were also held Thursday. Election commissioner M Sohul Hussain estimated around 50 percent of the 18, 42,000 registered voters cast their ballots in the six constituencies. bdnews24
