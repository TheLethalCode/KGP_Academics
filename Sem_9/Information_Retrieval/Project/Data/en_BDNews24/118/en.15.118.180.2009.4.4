 Gaza, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot and killed two Palestinian gunmen in a confrontation near a border fence in the Gaza Strip Saturday, Palestinian medics said.

Medics said in Gaza the Israeli military had so far prevented them from picking up the two bodies at the scene. No militant group has claimed responsibility for the gunmen. The Gaza border has seen sporadic Israeli-Palestinian violence despite a mid-January ceasefire achieved after a three-week Israeli offensive against the Hamas Islamist rulers of the coastal territory
