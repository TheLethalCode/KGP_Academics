 Islamabad, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb exploded in a religious centre for minority Shi'ite Muslims in central Pakistan on Sunday, killing at least 17 people, officials said. "We have received 17 dead bodies. Around 50 people were wounded, eight of them are in serious condition," said a doctor at the District Headquarters Hospital in Chakwal. The explosion took place in Chakwal, a city in Punjab province, as hundreds of people gathered for a religious ceremony. The blast came a day after eight paramilitary soldiers were killed in a suicide attack in the capital, Islamabad. Pakistan has a long history of tit-for-tat attacks by militants from majority Sunni and minority Shi'ite Muslim communities in which thousands of people have been killed.
