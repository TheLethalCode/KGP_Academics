<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak secured Sunday anticipatory bail for six months from the High Court in the BDR killing case, his lawyer said. The HC bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhan Miah and Marzi-ul-Haque asked the government to explain why Razzak should not get permanent anticipatory bail in the case. Razzak's counsel Rafiqul Islam Mian told bdnews24.com after the ruling that the court had allowed Razzak a six-month anticipatory bail. The High Court on Mar 29 directed the government and the police not to arrest or harass the Jamaat leader until Apr 5 and the Supreme Court on Mar 31 upheld the HC order. In the bail hearing, Mian said his client had not been allowed to go abroad even after having legal documents and court orders. Razzak sued the government for contempt of court and in retaliation, the CID interrogated him in the case, Mian added. Mian said these measures had been taken to harass Razzak politically and that his client feared that he could be arrested any time. CID assistant superintendent of police and investigation officer of the case Abdul Qahar Akhand on Mar 28 sent a letter to the Jamaat leader to appear at his office on Mar 30 to answer questions in BDR killing case. Razzak, a Supreme Court lawyer, in a petition with the High Court challenged the legality of the letter and sought a stay order on its proceedings. He also filed another petition seeking orders on the government to not arrest or harass him. b
