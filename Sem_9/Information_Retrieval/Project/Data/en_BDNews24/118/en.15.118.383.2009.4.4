<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  Water issues, both scarcity and floods, are the biggest challenges to farm production in a changing world, said the food minister on Saturday, having returned from a regional FAO meeting that placed water at the top of its agenda. Abdur Razzaq led a four-member delegation to the FAO Asia Pacific Regional Conference in Bangkok from Mar 26-31. FAO representative to Bangladesh Ad Spijkers accompanied him. Razzak said the conference focused on resolving water issues for farmers. "The conference adopted a policy in principle that the United Nations would work to ensure every country's rights to water," he told reporters at the secretariat "Bangladesh and India have 57 common rivers. The way India is retracting water through by inter-linking its rivers, agriculture in Bangladesh will experience a disaster if water sharing is not ensured." Referring to international policies on water sharing, the minister said India cannot unilaterally decide to withdraw water. "However, India has assured us of solving common water problems through talks," he said. But, Razzaq said the threat of more frequent and prolonged floods due to climate change also threatens the country's food production. He said Bangladesh could be a food surplus nation within two to three years if production continued at the present rate. "The country may even attain food surplus this year if the Boro production is as good as the just harvested Aman." "But if flooding becomes more frequent or lasts longer, the Boro crop may be threatened," the minister said. Razzak said the Bangkok conference held many discussions and took many decisions in principle in preparation for FAO's annual conference in November, which would be attended by world leaders including Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and US president Barack Obama. b
