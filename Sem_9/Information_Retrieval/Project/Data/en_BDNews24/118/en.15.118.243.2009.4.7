<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina asked on Tuesday whether the killing of army officers in the BDR mutiny was "revenge" on the forces that helped hold a free and neutral election to bring a democratic government back to power. She also pointed the finger of blame for the Feb 25-26 Peelkhana massacre at "war criminals and patronisers of the killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman". "The [Peelkhana] incident took place just when the issue of war crimes trials came to fore." She added, "It was the BNP which rehabilitated the war criminals by setting them up in parliament." The first session of the ninth parliament drew to a close on Tuesday with a full House, as the prime minister and leader of the opposition traded heated words in their closing addresses. Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in her address had criticised Hasina's handling of the BDR mutiny and questioned whether the prime minister should remain in charge of the defence ministry. The prime minister told the House: "The 50-day old government reached a peaceful solution and brought the country back from the brink of a civil war." "[The army] acted neutrally in the general election and created a favourable environment for holding a free and fair election," said Hasina, whose party came to power in early January after a landslide victory in last December's elections. "Was the massacre of army officers at the BDR Peelkhana headquarters an attempt at revenge?" Hasina asked the House. "It was the army, which prepared the new voter list, and dropped over one crore 'ghost voters', making way for a fair election." Khaleda in her speech had also alleged that the slain army officers could have been saved if a military operation was carried out. She also blamed the government for "saving the BDR mutineers, but not the army officers". Hasina in turn alleged that Khaleda possibly wanted to see a "civil war" in the wake of the mutiny. "She (Khaleda) posed some questions about the BDR killings. She asked why did we not carry out military operations. Imagine what would have happened." The prime minister said any military action to crush the BDR mutineers would have resulted in escalation of a crisis across the country and cost many more lives. "Maybe she wanted to see civil war or a situation that would force the newly elected government to go," she said. Hasina said the family members of the slain army officers along with the international community had praised the government's peaceful settlement of the mutiny. She alleged Khaleda was raising controversial questions on the mutiny "to influence the ongoing investigations". In defence of BCL Khaleda had also come down hard on the prime minister and the ruling Awami League for the recent "bloodshed" caused by the pro-AL Bangladesh Chhatra League on campuses countrywide. Hasina in turn blamed the pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal. She said it was "converted JCD activists" who were instigating the violence and "factional clashes" within the BCL. The home ministry has been asked to take strong measures against all those involved in these criminal activities, she added. On standing down just days before as BCL's organisational head, the AL chief said she could not lead any student front in line with the Representation of People Order. First JS session draws to a close The first session of the ninth parliament was adjourned on Tuesday at the last minute walk out by the main opposition BNP over restructuring of a parliamentary committee. The last sitting of the 39-day session witnessed a 74 minute address by Khaleda, with a 20 minute break in the middle, followed by the 78 minute delivery of the prime minister. Khaleda's address marked only her third appearance in the House since the inaugural sitting on Jan 25. She came to parliament on March 1 to condole the death army officers killed in the Feb 25 BDR mutiny. The ninth parliament has so far made history by forming all its parliamentary standing committees in the first session. None of the previous eight parliaments could form the parliamentary watchdogs on different ministries, to ensure parliamentary transparency and accountability, within the first session. In some cases, they took up to three years. The House passed 32 out of 40 bills during the session, mainly with a view to validating the ordinances made by the past interim government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. bdnews24.com/krc
