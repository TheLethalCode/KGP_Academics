<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 6 (bdnews24.com)  National striker Jahid Hasan Emily is expected to return to action a week before the AFC Challenge Cup to be held in Bangladesh from April 26 to 30. Emily had earlier been advised to take a week's rest on March 30 following a hamstring injury sustained in the Super Cup final between Mohammedan and Abahani on March 27. "I hope he (Emily) would be able to practise in another week as he has been rapidly recovering," said national football team physio Dolilur Rahman on Monday. Rahman, a graduate of physiotherapy from Australia, said that Emily was now 90 percent fit, but he needed a couple of days to gain full fitness. Bangladesh were drawn along with Myanmar, Cambodia and the winners between Macao and Mongolia. The winners will qualify for the finals, but the venue and date have yet to be finalised. Another striker Hedayetul Robin, however, is still doubtful for the tournament as the physo could not assess the current state of his injury. Robin has been suffering from a thigh problem including a left knee injury. "He ignored his injury and it has weakened the thigh. Besides, he now feels pain in the knee and needs some tests done before declaring him fit," said Rahman. bd
