<TITLE> Unconstitutional: CEC on new Upazila law </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Manikganj, Apr 06 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner said that vesting MPs with powers over Upazila councils was unconstitutional, as the new Upazila Parishad Act was passed in parliament Monday. "So far as I know, it is unconstitutional to give MPs such powers by law. We don't want anything which will create constitutional problems," ATM Shamsul Huda told a workshop on updating voter rolls in Manikganj. He urged the government to reconsider the issue. Parliament passed the Local Upazila Parishad Act 2009 on Monday giving MPs de facto powers over the councils and making the recently elected chairmen virtually toothless. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said just last month her government wanted to strike a balance between MPs and Upazila chairmen. But a parliamentary watchdog recommended passage of the new law making it mandatory for chairmen to accept recommendations of MPs as ex-officio advisers to Upazila councils countrywide. Elected chairmen would mainly be in charge of planning and monitoring development programmes at the grassroots. Elections of chairmen, vice chairmen and vice chairwomen to 481 Upazila were held on Jan 22 this year. Successive governments since passage of the Upazila Act of 1998 had failed to hold the Upazila polls in the face of strong opposition from MPs who became accustomed to controlling 'development activities' at the local level in absence of Upazila councils. bdne
