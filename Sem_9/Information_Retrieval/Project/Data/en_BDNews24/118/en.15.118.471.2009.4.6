 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  Transparency International, Bangladesh has called on the Election Commission for a quick audit of the election expenses and affidavit of the MPs and make them public. "We found in a study that most MPs have submitted false affidavits to the commission. There is no similarity with what they spent practically and what they submitted," TIB trusty board chairman Mozaffer Ahmed said Monday. "That's why we urge the Election Commission to make public them after a quick audit," he told a press conference on publication of a research report on parliamentary elections audit at the National Press Club. "The political parties failed to control their candidates. It should be examined," Muzaffer a. The study carried out on 88 candidates of 40 constituencies revealed that each candidate had spent more than Tk 44 lakh from the day of withdrawal of nomination to the election. No candidate was not allowed to spend more than Tk 13 lakh. Of the 88 people, 77 spent additional money beyond the affidavit they had submitted to the commission. The BNP, Jamaat and Jatiya Party candidates spent more than Tk 50 lakh on average while AL candidates spent Tk 36 lakh. The spending included public relations campaign, expenditures on supporters and donation for development activities. Only six AL candidates, eight BNP candidates and one independent candidate obeyed the EC direction on spending, the report added. Some 95.45 percent candidates submitted election expenses return to the commission. Muzaffer praised the commission for deploying returning officers and not seeking assistance of the army in the by-polls. He praised the effort of the law enforcers as well. b
