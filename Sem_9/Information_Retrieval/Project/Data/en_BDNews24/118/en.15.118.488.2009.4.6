<TITLE> BDR massacre was not 'mutiny': Faruq Khan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr (bdnews24.com) - The BDR massacre was not simply a "mutiny", but a deep-rooted conspiracy to destablise the present government, said the minister in charge of coordinating post-mutiny affairs. "A good number of people, who were involved in the bloodbath at BDR headquarters, have been identified through confessional statements," said Faruq Khan on Sunday. Some 841 people have been arrested to date, 1,200 important pieces of evidence are being scrutinised, and 66 places have been marked as crime scenes, he told reporters at a briefing following the fourth meeting of the post-mutiny coordination committee. The minister also said, "It was not a mutiny. It was instigated to destablise the present government, create barriers to development, and undermine the reputation of the armed forces." The minister said all BDR members who had reported back for duty were getting pay and rations. "But, those who returned to BDR headquarters were divided into two groups," he said. "One group was identified as possibly being involved with the BDR bloodbath and another group as not being involved. The latter were being sent back to their battalions," he said. Replying to questions, Faruq said, "The guilty may be court-marshalled, tried under criminal laws or BDR laws." The government wanted to punish the guilty in fast-track trials, he added. "The government is also taking all precautions so that no innocent people are punished," said Faruq. A home ministerial committee had already been formed to avoid this, he pointed out. The government wanted to ensure a fair and full enquiry into the incident, so its report might take more time, he said. The minister said the FBI team that visited last month had helped with technical support. "They did not give us any written report," he said. Asked about reconstitution of the BDR, he said, the border force's director general was heading the committee on the issue. b
