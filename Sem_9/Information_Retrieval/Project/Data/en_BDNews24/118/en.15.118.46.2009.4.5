 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)Construction of the proposed Tk 10,000 crore Dhaka subway project, with 60 percent financing from Japan, may begin this year, said an official on Sunday. In line with the Japan Bank for International Cooperation's condition, the lowest bidder Contech Limited has partnered with Japanese firm Itochu Corp. Managing director of Contech Masud Reza said they were hoping to receive a letter of intent and begin work within six months. Reza had earlier met with communication minister Syed Abul Hossain and presented the proposal in this regard. Itochu Corp. general manager Taru Hasabiashi also attended the meeting. The 52-km underground subway across the capital city, which is estimated to cost between Tk 10,000-12,000 crore, will have six lines and 50 stations, aimed at solving the city's traffic gridlock, according to the project proposal. Around 80 percent population of the city will have at least one station within one kilometre. The subway is expected to serve some 10-40 lakh (1 million to 4 million) commuters daily. The Sena Kalyan Sanstha (army welfare organisation) will provide technical assistance in implementing the project, which will be constructed by a "cut and cover method", meaning without disturbing surface traffic on any major route. The communication ministry first floated an international tender for the ambitious underground rail project in 2002. Contech won the bid in 2003. bdn
