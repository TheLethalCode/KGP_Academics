 SYDNEY, April 3 (Reuters) - Troubled Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds has been included in a preliminary squad for this year's Twenty20 World Cup in England. National selectors named Symonds in a 30-man squad, that will be reduced to 15 before the tournament, after they were given the all-clear to consider him. Symonds has been receiving counselling after a series of off-field incidents resulted in him being ruled out for selection until his behaviour improved. "We are satisfied he is committed to doing the things needed of an Australian international cricketer," Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said in a statement. Shaun Tait, Shane Watson, Brett Lee and Shaun Marsh were also named in the squad despite currently recovering from injuries. Australia squad: Nathan Bracken, Michael Clarke, Callum Ferguson, Brett Geeves, Brad Haddin, Ryan Harris, Shane Harwood, Nathan Hauritz, Aaron Heal, Moises Henriques, Ben Hilfenhaus, Brad Hodge, James Hopes, David Hussey, Michael Hussey, Mitchell Johnson, Jason Krejza, Ben Laughlin, Brett Lee, Graham Manou, Shaun Marsh, Ricky Ponting, Rob Quiney, Peter Siddle, Andrew Symonds, Shaun Tait, Adam Voges, David Warner, Shane Watson, Cameron White
