 JERUSALEM, April 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police questioned the new foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, for the second straight day on Friday on suspicion of bribery and money laundering, a police spokesman said. Lieberman, an ultranationalist who became Israel's top diplomat on Tuesday, has denied any wrongdoing and has called the police investigation into his affairs a smear campaign. His anti-Arab rhetoric has alarmed Palestinians as well as Arab leaders in the region. "Lieberman was questioned for five hours under caution today. He will be questioned again in the future," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Lieberman was questioned for seven hours on Thursday. The questioning was part of a years-long investigation, details of which were not made available by the police. Israeli media said Lieberman was suspected of receiving bribes through a consulting firm run by his daughter, Michal. He has been questioned about the allegations before but not as foreign minister. There was no suggestion that his ministerial career was about to be cut short. An official with Cyprus's Department for Combating Money Laundering confirmed Israeli police had asked for information about Lieberman's financial transactions. "We have been executing official requests from Israeli authorities and have passed on the information we have gathered," the official said. The official declined to say whether the information related to Cypriot bank accounts belonging to Lieberman's daughter. "We think inquiries (here) are close to an end." Lieberman had asked Israeli courts to have the investigation expedited, arguing it was unreasonable for a public figure to be subjected to allegations which cast a stain on his image. A spokeswoman said the probe has been going on for 13 years. Soviet-born Lieberman campaigned for the February 10 Israeli election on a slogan "no loyalty, no citizenship," seen as urging the deportation of Israeli Arab citizens charged with involvement with or advocating the actions of militants based in the Gaza Strip and occupied West Bank.
