 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  The law minister Saturday slammed Jatiya Party chief and former president HM Ershad for introducing state religion during his 1982-1990 regime, in violation of what the minister said the nation's core principles. "The amendment to make Islam the state religion was contrary to the fundamentals, such as secularism, of the country's 1972 constitution," Shafiq Ahmed said. Former military ruler Gen Ershad, now a ruling party ally, in a controversial eighth amendment to the constitution in the 1980s, attempted to set up High Court divisions in all divisional towns and also made Islam as state religion. On whether the incumbent government would repeal the amendment, he said: "The government is now only two and a half months old. We should not make any comment now. Let's wait and see." Shafiq also said the process of war crimes trials was likely to start this month. The minister was speaking at a scholarship awards ceremony organised by the Greater Comilla Association at the National Press Club auditorium. In his address, Shafiq asked educationists to present the "true history" of the liberation war. "We should tell the true history of the liberation war to the new generation. We have to present the reality, as well, of people who collaborated with the Pakistan army in looting, arson and killing of intellectuals, " he said. Shafiq also stressed the necessity of modernisation of the madrasa curriculum. "We have to create employment for the madrasa students by modernising the education system." "It will not be wise to keep them outside development activities," he said. There is no scope for confusion on the government's position on madrasas, he said. b
