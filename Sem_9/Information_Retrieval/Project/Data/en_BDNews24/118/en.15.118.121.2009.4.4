 BERLIN, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has agreed to extend his contract with Bundesliga team VfB Stuttgart for another season, the club said on Friday. Lehmann, 39, who has also played for Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04, was widely expected to quit at the end of the season after signing for Stuttgart last year following five successful campaigns in England. "The extension of his contract is an important sign for the whole club and shows we have high aims," Stuttgart sports director Horst Heldt told the team's website (www.vfbstuttgart.de). Lehmann, who has played 61 times for Germany including at the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, said he was delighted to stay on for another year. "It is a great club and I'm having fun playing here," Lehmann said. He started his career in the late 1980s at Schalke where he played for about a decade before moving via AC Milan and Borussia Dortmund to Arsenal in 2003. It was while playing in the English Premier League that he finally established himself as the successor to Oliver Kahn in the national team, taking over as first choice just before the 2006 World Cup where he helped Germany finish third. His last international appearance was in the 1-0 defeat by Spain in the Euro 2008 final
