 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  A new national education plan will be a modified and modernised version of previous Awami League policy, said the education minister on Monday. "No full-fledged commission will be formed again," Nurul Islam Nahid said. The new policy would be based on the Dr Shamsul Haque education policy in line with the Kudrat-e-Khuda Commission's recommendations, said the minister. Nahid has mentioned in recent weeks that essential elements of AL's past education plans would be included in the new policy. The new committee for formulation of the policy will be named in days, he said Monday. "It will take a few months to report." "Changes have to be brought in thought, spirit and work to bring a revolution in the education system," the minister told a seminar hosted by Bangladesh Colleges-Universities Teachers Association. Painting a bleak picture of dropout rates in primary and secondary education, Nahid said ninety percent of children are enrolled at some point, but half of them drop out before passing class-five. "The present level of technical education is awfully neglected in the country," he added. "So a technical school will be set up in every Upazila." Education secretary Syed Ataur said Sunday the government was forming the new committee with national professor Kabir Chowdhury as its chief. A proposal for a 16-member committee had been sent to the prime minister, said education ministry officials. Kabir Chowdhury's committee would have three months for the job, said Rahman. No recommendations of any past education commission, before or after independence, have been properly implemented to date.
