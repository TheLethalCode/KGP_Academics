<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 05 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Sunday deferred a resolution to thank President Iajuddin Ahmed for his Jan. 25 speech in parliament due to the opposition leaders' absence. The proposal on thanks-giving was shifted to Tuesday as Khaleda Zia did not attend Sunday's sitting, said opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque. "[Khaleda Zia] has told me that she will speak on president's speech and concluding speech on Tuesday," Farroque told bdnews24.com. Chief whip Abdus Shahid, therefore, deferred adopting the resolution on the president's speech, he said. "Since the leader of the opposition has expressed her inability to come to the House, we have shifted the date," Shahid told bdnews24.com. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia would both deliver their speeches on Tuesday. bdnews
