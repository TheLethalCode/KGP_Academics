 Dhaka April 07 (bdnews24.com)The BDR mutiny case, initially filed with Lalbagh police, has been transferred to New Market Police Station. AKM Anamul Haq of the chief metropolitan magistrates court gave the transfer order Tuesday on a request by CID investigating officer Abdul Qahar Akhand. Some 39 days after the case was first filed, Akhand told the court that the border force's Peelkhana headquarters, site of the mutiny, was under jurisdiction of New Market police rather than Lalbagh. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner AKM Shahidul Haq told bdnews24.com, "It was an oversight by officials due to the emergency of the situation." Criminal lawyer Amdadul Haq told bdnews24.com the accused in the case might find a legal loophole through the "mistake" in filing the case and "conflict" of police jurisdiction. But the DMP chief said: "It should not be a problem." Akhand also requested ten days remand on Tuesday for two civilian suspects in the case. The two were identified as 'Delwar', a New Market businessman, and 'Sumon'. Metropolitan magistrate Rashed Kabir approved four days for questioning them. Another two BDR soldiers, Saiful Islam and Habibur Rahman, gave 'confessional' statements at the CMM court, bringing the total to 25 accused who have given recorded statements in the case so far. bdnew
