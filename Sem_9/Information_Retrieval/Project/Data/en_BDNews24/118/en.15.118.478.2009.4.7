 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)A third of nearly 1,50,000 NGOs registered with the government and other institutions countrywide are doing nothing, the social welfare minister said Tuesday. The NGOs are registered with the social welfare ministry, cooperatives department and other institutions, Enamul Haque Mostofa Shahid told reporters at his office. Among the registered NGOs, the social welfare ministry alone gave registration to 56000, he said. The ministry has written to the ineffective NGOs to know about their latest status, the minister added. "However if they want to restart work, they will have to take fresh approvals from the ministry," Shahid said. The government was working on a new registration authority and both new and old NGOs will be required to register afresh, he added. They will also have to make the constitution, fund collection procedure and transaction accounts available with the authority, he said. The government also decided to form a social security council to monitor NGO works. It will suggest the government to close down operations of NGOs for ambiguity, he also said. The minister said the government was determined to stop funding for militancy through the NGOs which had been allowed to work without government interference. All NGOs needed to be brought under legal framework. Police may investigate their operations to see to it no outlet was left to continue with terror-funding, he added. b
