 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com) - Madrasa students will receive "modern lessons" along with religious lessons in line with new guidelines, the education minister said Wednesday as he named a 16-member committee tasked with formulating a national education policy. "We have asked for a report within three months so that we can start putting the policy into practice within this year," said Nurul Islam Nahid. "The committee will receive 90 days from its first sitting." For fast formulation, the new policy will be a modified and updated version of previous Awami League policy, Nahid said earlier in the week. No fully-fledged commission will be formed again. The new policy will be based on the Dr Shamsul Haque education policy in line with the Kudrat-e-Khuda Commission's recommendations, said the minister. Committee members The new 16-strong committee will be led by national professor Kabir Chowdhury. Members will include National University vice-chancellor professor Kazi Shahidullah, Bangladesh Economic Association president Quazi Kholiquzzaman, Dhaka University social sciences teacher Sadeka Halim, English teacher Fakrul Alam, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology teacher Zafar Iqbal and DU Institute of Education and Research teacher Siddiqur Rahman. Other members are Bangladesh College Teachers Association president and National University treasurer Kazi Faruk Ahmed, DU public administration teacher Zarina Rahman Khan, director general of the Directorate of Technical Education Nitai Chandra Sutradhar, retired additional secretaries Md Siraj Uddin Ahmed and Md Abu Hafiz, Dhaka Government Alia Madrassa former principal Maulana ABM Siddikur Rahman, Sangbad Limited director Nihad Kabir and Bangladesh Teachers Association president MA Awal Siddiqui. National Academy of Education Management director (training) Sheikh Ekramul Kabir has been proposed as member secretary. More members may be included on the committee, the minister said. BCS wants representation Members of the BCS General Education Association expressed frustration Wednesday over not being drafted in the committee. "We want inclusion as we represent hundreds of thousands of students of government colleges," BCS General Education Association general secretary Masume Rabbani told reporters at the education ministry. "As there is still scope to co-opt more members on the committee, we urge the government to include our representative."
