<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank has asked banks to cut lending rates to a maximum 13 percent except for credit cards and consumer loans to help deal with the fallout of global financial downturn on Bangladesh's economy. It also asked the banks to allow loans defaulted by recession-hit sectors to be rescheduled without down payment in the next six months. "Generally, defaulters are allowed to reschedule repayment if they make a down payment of 10 to 15 percent. This provision will remain in force about old loans. But those affected by the current global recession will be allowed to reschedule loans without any payment for six months upto September," the governor said Tuesday. "The banks will take the steps based on their relations with the customers," Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters after a meeting with chief executives of all commercial banks Tuesday. The highest interest rate for all except consumer and credit card loans is currently 14.75 percent. "We are now facing the impact of ongoing global recession," Ahmed said. "To compensate the loss and increase investment the banks have been asked to lower the lending rate to 13 percent." "In view of the crisis, we are working to bring down the rates. As part of that, the Bangladesh Bank has lowered its rates of interest for treasury bills, repo and reverse repo." Mahmud K Sattar, chairman of the Association of Bankers Bangladesh, an organisation of the bank executives, said they would try to comply with the central bank directives. The easing of loan rescheduling conditions for the affected sectors might also help to deal with the aftermath of the recession, he said. Banks have also been asked to take steps to reach remittances from expatriates at the quickest possible time. Sattar said," The central bank will let bother bankers know about its decisions made in the meeting of bankers. After that, banks will start implementing those decisions. Whether deposit interest will be reduced while reducing the bank interest, Sattar avoided a direct reply when asked if the banks would reduce the rates on deposits. "It would be very challenging for us to reduce the interest on bank loans to 13 percent. But we will try to carry out the directives of the central bank." "Ninety-five percent of the money that we lend comes from depositors. For us, the deposits are like the raw materials. If the price of the raw material comes down, so does the price of the product. "So it is only natural that a cut in deposit rates will reduce the lending rates." bdnews24.
