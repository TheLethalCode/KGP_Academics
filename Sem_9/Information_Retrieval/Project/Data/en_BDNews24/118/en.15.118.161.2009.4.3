 WELLINGTON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Harbhajan Singh and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni resurrected India's innings after tea with half centuries on the first day of the third test against New Zealand to lead them to 375 for nine at the close of play. The last pair of Ishant Sharma (15) and Munaf Patel (14) were together for the visitors at the close. Harbhajan scored 60 while Dhoni made 52 as the pair combined for a 79-run partnership to ensure the first day at the Basin Reserve ended in the balance after India had been reduced to 204 for six shortly into the final session. The pair came together after Rahul Dravid, who had ground his way to 35, fell just after the tea break following New Zealand's capture of three wickets in the hour before tea to give them the advantage as they sought to level the test series. Dhoni and Harbhajan, however, threw caution to the wind, slashing at anything short with several shots sailing over the slips or just wide of the exasperated New Zealand fielders. "It was crucial to contribute lower down the order and if you look at the scoreboard we have got some decent runs," Harbhajan told reporters. "When I went into bat it wasn't the same and thankfully me and Dhoni and all the other guys got some runs." India scored 185 runs off 35 for the loss of four wickets in the final session, as Dhoni, Harbhajan and Zaheer Khan (33) hit out. "We probably let it slip 50 to 60 runs too many there," New Zealand all-rounder James Franklin said. "But again they got away with a few lucky shots and the ball didn't quite go to hand. Sometimes that's the way it can be with the tail." AGGRESSIVE START Earlier, Virender Sehwag (48) and Gautam Gambhir (23) had been dismissed in quick succession before lunch after making an aggressive start, scoring 65 runs in the first hour. Sehwag had stroked seven boundaries and a six before he nicked an O'Brien delivery through to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum with the score on 73. Gambhir fell two runs later when he was trapped in front by Franklin. After lunch Sachin Tendulkar brought up his 53rd test half century, however, he was dismissed shortly after when he got an edge to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Martin for 62. Vangipurappu Laxman, who scored a century in the second innings of the second test in Napier, was caught at second slip by Tim McIntosh for four off Tim Southee. Part-time bowler Jesse Ryder then had Yuvraj Singh trapped in front for nine to leave the hosts struggling at 190 for five at tea. India lead the series 1-0 after winning the first test in Hamilton by 10 wickets, while the second match in Napier ended in a draw
