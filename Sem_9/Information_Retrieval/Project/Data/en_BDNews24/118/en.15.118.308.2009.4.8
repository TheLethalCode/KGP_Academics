<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)The pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal has said the government's decision to cancel the lease on Khaleda Zia's cantonment bungalow is an attempt at "political humiliation", with one JCD leader even claiming it to part of a "murder plot". JCD activists brought out immediate demonstrations on Dhaka University campus as news of the cabinet decision spread. Speaking at a meeting at the Teacher Student Centre, Hasan Mamun, president of JCD's DU unit, alleged, "The decision to cancel the lease is part of a conspiracy to murder Khaleda Zia." He asked why the issue had not been brought to the people's notice in all these years. "Why was it not discussed in parliament yesterday?" "The government took the decision at a crisis moment of the country, without informing anyone." Mamun said JCD would strongly protest against the conspiracy by taking up different movements. Saiful Islam Firoz, general secretary of JCD's DU unit, said, "The government is trying to politically humiliate Khaleda Zia." "These decisions are being taken to divert the people's attention from the recent failure of the government in dealing with the BDR case and violence at different educational institutions." A cabinet meeting, chaired by the prime minister earlier in the day, took the decision to cancel the 99-year lease on the 6 Moinul Road bungalow in Dhaka Cantonment, given to Khaleda Zia after the May 30, 1981 murder of her husband, army chief- turned-president Ziaur Rahman.
