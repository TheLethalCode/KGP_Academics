 Kushtia, April 3, bdnews24.comA project to revive the Gorai river could reap huge rewards for agriculture, the environment and tens of millions of people in the south and south-west of Bangladesh, says FAO. "Increasing the flow of the river would revitalise the life of 20-25 million rural Bangladeshis," FAO representative Ad Spijkers said in a statement Saturday. Solutions to salinity, decreasing agricultural production and survival of the Sundarbans depend largely on the natural flow of the river, said Spijkers after visiting the Gorai river region with a team of local and international experts. Gorai, once the lifeline for millions in southern regions, including the Sundarbans and coastal areas, is now a seasonal river with lean period flow down to zero. The Bangladesh Water Development Board has for decades been struggling to tackle siltation of the river, on which irrigation and agriculture, ecology and environment of those regions had thrived. But despite the BWDB's efforts and the huge investments to drag the river has now shrunk to a sandy riverbed for several months of the year. Spijkers said FAO, as an agency of the UN devoted to food security, sees enormous potential in the river, and is discussing with experts in the sector the best methods to support the government's initiatives to revive the natural flow. He also assured coordination among development partners for viable options in a discussion attended by local engineers of BWBD, among others, during his visit to Khulna and Bagerhat
