<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)  The upcoming budget will not implement all the suggestions of the Pay Commission on a new pay scale for public servants in one go, the finance minister said Monday. Half of whatever recommendations the commission makes will be implemented in the upcoming budget and the remainder in phases, AMA Muhith told reporters after a meeting with the representatives from the Institute of Cost and Accounting Management in Bangladesh at the Secretariat. The full implementation needed huge funds, the minister said. He added the situation in which the commission was formed was no more the same. Apart from that there were huge budget deficit. Muhith said they had not received the pay commission report but added it was likely in a few days. "Work is ongoing to that end." The caretaker government formed the Pay Commission on Oct 31 last year in the wake of a steep price hike of essentials. bdne
