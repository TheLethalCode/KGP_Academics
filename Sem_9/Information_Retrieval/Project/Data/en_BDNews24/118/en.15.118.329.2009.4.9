 EI/Football LIVERPOOL, England, April 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals by defender Branislav Ivanovic and another from Didier Drogba completed a stunning Chelsea comeback as Liverpool's Champions League ambitions were torn apart at Anfield on Wednesday. Fernando Torres had pounced in the sixth minute to give five-times European champions Liverpool the perfect start to the first leg of the quarter-final tie. But Chelsea, last season's beaten finalists, will go into next Tuesday's second leg clear favourites to advance to the semi-finals after Ivanovic inspired a stunning turnaround for Guus Hiddink's team. The Serbia defender took advantage of poor Liverpool marking to head home an equaliser from a corner before halftime. Ivanovic repeated his effort with a carbon-copy goal after the break before Drogba marked his return from a toe injury with the third goal which leaves Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez praying for a miracle at Stamford Bridge. He is unlikely to get it on this evidence. "I must give my compliments to the teamThey always react which is good to see," Hiddink told Sky Sports. He said Chelsea set out "to get them sweating in defence "We aimed to score (away) and when you can score three that's luxury." IVANOVIC EQUALISER Liverpool were left regretting their failure to build on the perfect start after Torres took full advantage of time and space afforded to him by side-footing his side into a sixth-minute lead after Alvaro Arbeloa's pin-point cross. Liverpool continued to look the better side early on despite missing the suspended Javier Mascherano, so leaving Brazilian midfielder Lucas with the difficult task of tracking the runs of Frank Lampard. Chelsea ought to have equalised when Drogba was teed-up in the 28th minute by Michael Ballack but 11 minutes later Ivanovic punished Liverpool's slack marking when he rose unchallenged to nod Florent Malouda's corner past Pepe Reina. Suddenly, it was Liverpool on the back foot and only a desperate goal line clearance by Jamie Carragher prevented Drogba from delivering a killer blow in the 51st minute after Lampard's defence-splitting pass. Chelsea then took control of the tie with two goals in the space of five minutes. Again the Liverpool defence went missing as Ivanovic rose to power Lampard's 62nd-minute corner into the net. Liverpool's night of misery was complete when Drogba finally found the target in the 67th after connecting with an excellent ball from the left by Malouda
