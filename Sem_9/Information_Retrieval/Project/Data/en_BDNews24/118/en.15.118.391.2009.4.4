<TITLE> Hasina turns back on BCL </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka , April 4 (bdnews24.com)Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina will no longer be 'organisational head' of Bangladesh Chhatra League, AL's top policy-making body decided on Saturday. AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters of the decision after an emergency meeting of the party presidium, coming in the wake of ongoing Chhatra League violence on campuses countrywide. Asked about the fate of BCL after the decision, he said it would go on, but added: "Chhatra League is beset with organisational problems for inefficiency of the central committee." Ashraf also said AL was calling on all political parties, including opposition BNP, to resist terror activities and extortion in the name of student politics. He said the government had ordered a severe crackdown against campus violence by students or any other groups. "The government has instructed law enforcing agencies to take the sternest action against violence, extortion, tender rigging by student leaders, members or activists, or anyone perpetrating such acts in the guise of students," he said. "The action starts now," said Ashraf. He said none, not BCL activists or any others, would be spared if they were involved in such crimes. 'Fronts' no more Chhatra League, Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal and Islami Chhatra Shibir were formed as the student fronts of Awami League, BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami respectively. New party registration rules, introduced ahead of last year's general elections, however, included amending party constitutions to get rid of all front organisations. Parties have been given until July this year to bring those amendments to bear. In the meantime, the student wings and their activities are still seen as inextricably linked with their respective political parties, causing the ruling party the most concern in the wake of ongoing BCL violence. AL's decision is likely to be seen as a move to sever those links. Stern warnings, continued clashes Just hours before AL's announcement Saturday, a dozen people were injured in Chhatra League factional fighting at Jagannath University. The violence sparked off in front of the arts faculty in the morning between two groups led by JagU's BCL unit president and the unit's general secretary. JagU's BCL unit, among other university units, had already faced several stern warnings from Hasina, Awami League and central BCL leaders in past weeks as factional fights, and clashes with rival student bodies, for control of campuses mounted. A BCL leader was killed in violence that forced the closure of Dhaka Medical College last week. Central BCL leaders were forced to dissolve BCL's JU unit in February after recurrent clashes over control of residential halls. But clashes continued unabated on the campus. JU saw another bout of violence on Friday as BCL activists wielded machetes, hockey sticks and other lethal weapons in factional clashes that left at least 10 persons injured and some eight dormitory rooms vandalised. 'Parent organisations responsible' Meanwhile, Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Shahidul Haq was questioned by reporters Saturday about action against ongoing campus violence and use of arms by student activists. He said it was the responsibility of the "parent organisation" and the educational institutions concerned to supervise students' activities. The police, of course, would take all actions against criminal behaviour, he added. bd
