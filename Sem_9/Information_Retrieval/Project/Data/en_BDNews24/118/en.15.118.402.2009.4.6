Housing and public works acting secretary Nasir Uddin has been made acting NBR chairman in place of Mazid, who held the post of top taxman from Oct 22 2007. During his around 15-month tenure, Mazid took up a number of initiatives to boost revenue earnings, including campaigns to encourage traders and professionals to pay taxes.
