 NEW YORK, Mon Apr 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of Sun Microsystems Inc tumbled 24 percent on Monday after the company rejected rival computer and software maker International Business Machines Corp's $7 billion offer.

Sun was unhappy with IBM's offer of $9.40 per share or below, and it was unclear if talks would resume, according to a source, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. The bid represented a premium of up to 89 percent on Sun's shares before deal talks were first reported last month. Sun shares had risen to $8.49 on Friday, from $4.97 on March 17, a day before talks between the two technology companies were first reported. The Wall Street Journal had previously said IBM's original bid was $10 to $11 a share. The deal may have helped IBM bolster its offering of computer servers, storage equipment and software as competition heats up with rivals like Hewlett-Packard Co. Sun rose to prominence selling high-end computer servers in the 1990s but never fully recovered from the dot-com bubble burst earlier this decade.
