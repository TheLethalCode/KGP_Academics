 SYDNEY, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Troubled all-rounder Andrew Symonds has been included in Australia's squad for their limited-overs series against Pakistan starting in April. Australia's selectors also recalled injured fast bowler Brett Lee and all-rounder Shane Watson but omitted captain Ricky Ponting, Mike Hussey and Mitchell Johnson to avoid burning them out ahead of the Ashes series in England. Symonds has been receiving counselling after a series of off-field incidents resulted in him being ruled out for selection until his behaviour improved. "Andrew Symonds has been cleared by Cricket Australia to resume playing for the Australian cricket team and he has been included in the squad," Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. "At his best Andrew is a dynamic one-day player with an outstanding record for Australia. It will now be up to him to seize this opportunity." Hilditch said Lee's inclusion was subject to a fitness test after he recently underwent foot and ankle surgery while the injury-prone Watson was included just as a specialist batsman. Michael Clarke will take over the captaincy of the 14-man squad for the six-match series, involving five one-day internationals and a Twenty20, that will be held in the United Arab Emirates in April and May. Hilditch said the tour presented the perfect opportunity for Australia to test the fitness of several returning players while giving other key men a short rest. "Having Ricky Ponting and Michael Hussey in prime form mentally and physically for the Ashes is critical and the series against Pakistan is the only opportunity to give them an appropriate break prior to the start of a very important period," Hilditch said. "Mitchell Johnson is now a key bowler in all three forms of the game for Australia and we've also taken this opportunity to provide him with a break before he commences preparation for the World Twenty20 and Ashes."
