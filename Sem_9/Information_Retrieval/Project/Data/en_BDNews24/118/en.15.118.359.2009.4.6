"The government will seek assistance to repatriate suspected war criminals on the basis of a list," AB Tajul Islam told reporters. "There's no reason to doubt that trials will be held. The trials are a must," he said. He said the home ministry has a list of the suspected war criminals. The government will also take into cognisance war crimes cases that have been filed across the country in recent months. "No one will be harassed without proper grounds in the name of the trial," Tajul assured. The government announced Sunday it would form a probe body on war crimes, with the appointment of an investigation officer, by Apr 8 (Wednesday), terming it the "first step" toward the long-awaited trials. Tajul said Monday: "The trial process will begin within the shortest possible time with the help of the United Nations." "We've sought UN assistance as it has experiences of holding such trials. UNDP country representative Renata Lok Dessallien met with home minister Sahara Khatun and law minister Shafiq Ahmed on Sunday. Dessallien told reporters that the UNDP had offered the government help to ensure the trials meet international standards. Many countries have held such trials, said Dessallien, and the UN was offering to help utilise experiences of those trials in Bangladesh to avoid mistakes. bdnews2
