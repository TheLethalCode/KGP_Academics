 LONDON, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia and defender William Gallas are doubtful for next week's Champions League quarter-final against Villarreal after picking up injuries in Tuesday's first leg, manager Arsene Wenger said. Spaniard Almunia was replaced by Lukasz Fabianski in the 28th minute of the 1-1 draw in Spain after failing to recover from an earlier knock to his right ankle. France defender Gallas, struggling with an injury to his right leg, was substituted two minutes before halftime. "The first signs are not too good, they could both be out for the second game," Wenger told Sky Sports News. Arsenal trailed to a 10th minute goal from Villarreal midfielder Marcos Senna but hit back in the second half with a spectacular equaliser from striker Emmanuel Adebayor. "When they scored an early goal to get in at 1-0 at halftime was not bad because we could reorganise a bit and bounce back in the second half," added Wenger. "We are mentally strong, resolute we never give up. We had a few opportunities to score a second goal that we didn't take.
