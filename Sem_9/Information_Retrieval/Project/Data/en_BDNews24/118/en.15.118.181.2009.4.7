 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Chhatra League activists observed a token hunger strike Tuesday demanding Awami League chief and Prime minister Sheikh Hasina return as the organisational head of the pro-AL student body.

Shohag Mahmud, a junior leader of Kabi Jasim Uddin Hall, said: "Why should Sheikh Hasina bear the responsibility of failure rather than the two main leaders of the central committee?" BCL central committee and DU unit leaders were not present at the hunger strike. Mahfuzul Haider Chowdhury Roton, general secretary of the central committee, even denied that the hunger strikers were BCL activists. "Our members didn't prepare any hunger strike schedule," he said.
