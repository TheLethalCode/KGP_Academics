<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)Two factions of ruling Awami League's labour front Sramik League clashed Monday at the city developer RAJUK's head office, vandalising offices and leaving at least three injured. Adherents of Abdul Malek and Shamsul Alam Milky, RAJUK staffers, fought each other for half an hour. The unruly activists damaged the main access to the RAJUK office and window panes of office rooms. A faction claimed three were injured during the clashes. Malek and Milky each claimed to reporters that he was the president of the Sramik League's RAJUK unit. "We launched a movement to fight for the 372 of our former colleagues who had been dismissed during the BNP-led alliance's rule," Malek told reporters. "Milky and his cohorts then brought in outsiders to attack us and vandalise the RAJUK office." Milky said, "We were tipped off that Malek group activists were preparing to assault us, so we took up position by the stadium and informed the works minister." "The minister advised us to take police assistance in getting back to RAJUK. Malek group swooped on us when we reached RAJUK office, injuring three." RAJUK chairman Nurul Huda said, "Some outsiders carried out the attack and vandalised property." "Since I just took charge on March 30, I don't yet know about the inside squabbles to make any qualified comment." A case has been filed in this connection with Motijheel police station accusing unidentified outside hooligans. A probe committee formed with RAJUK member Abdul Wahab Miah as its head has been asked to submit a report on the incident within a week. bdnews
