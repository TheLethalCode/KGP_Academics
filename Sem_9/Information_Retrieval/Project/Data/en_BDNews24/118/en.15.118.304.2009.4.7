 LONDON, Tue Apr 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Tamil protesters demonstrated outside Britain's parliament on Tuesday calling for London's help in securing a ceasefire between Sri Lankan forces and Tamil Tiger separatists. Police arrested four people -- one for violent disorder -- after scuffles broke out when officers moved protesters off a major bridge into the square outside the Houses of Parliament. "There are approximately 500 protesters remaining in Parliament Square. We have a contingency plan in place should numbers start to grow again," a police spokeswoman said. The protest began on Monday, when an estimated 3,000 people -- some of them bringing young children with them -- began to occupy Westminster Bridge and the road leading to it alongside parliament's clock tower, popularly known as Big Ben.

"The need for a humanitarian ceasefire is now even more urgent," he said in a statement. "It is vital that civilians are able to move away from danger to safety." The United Nations says tens of thousands of people are being held as human shields by the LTTE, and has urged the Sri Lankan military to protect them during a final offensive. Palitha Kohona, permanent secretary at the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BBC radio the government could not stop the offensive until LTTE agreed to lay down arms. "The government wants to preserve the civilians, we want the civilians out, but the only decent thing that the LTTE can do now ... is to let the civilians go," he said. "The solution we have offered is very simple. LTTE must lay down its weapons, and then there will be no need to fire at anybody any m
