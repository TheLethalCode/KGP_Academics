<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government will hold war crimes trials making sure that the perpetrators do not slip through legal loopholes, the state minister for law says. "The government is checking out all relevant procedures including investigation, collection of evidence and information, and the trial process so that war criminals cannot get around the law," Kamrul Islam told reporters Tuesday after a meeting of a special committee on war crimes trials at the ministry. The government has decided to stage trials in the line with the International Crimes (Tribunal) Act 1973, Islam added. He said the law was framed back in the 1970s but the trials will take place in 2009, and so "many things will have to be figured out". The nation demands war crimes trials and the government was obligated to honour the demand, he said. Law minister Shafiq Ahmed, home minister Sahara Khatun, attorney general Mahbubey Alam and high officials of the ministry attended the meeting. bdnew
