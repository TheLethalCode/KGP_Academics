 NEW DELHI, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Opposition leader L.K. Advani on Wednesday vowed to get back money stashed by wealthy Indians in illegal accounts abroad as the party stepped up its campaign for good governance in the general election. Striking a populist chord, Advani, the head of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said billions of dollars worth of recovered cash could be used for development and help raise living standards in India's villages. The world's largest democracy goes to the polls in just over a week's time, where the main tussle is between the BJP and the ruling Congress party. Raising the issue of the country's missing billions may resonate with voters in a country where a number of politicians face criminal cases, just as many pollsters say the BJP is struggling against Congress. "I am yet again raising this issue publicly because I want that India should not suffer for lack of anything," Advani told a rally in Gujarat, on the day he filed his nomination. "I believe that if we pursue this matter then there won't be any lack of resources to get India the top position among the nations of the world," he added. Advani has previously said up to $1.5 trillion was held by Indians abroad. The BJP is touting its development credentials when it was in power until 2004, and in states currently under BJP rule. Retrieving money has been a major issue in the G20, as the major countries in the group called for a crackdown on tax havens. "Of course it has a certain populist resonance, that's undeniable," said Swapan Dasgupta, a political analyst with links to the BJP. "It seeks to take into account the general mood of disgust, which is felt in India, about politicians and the type of political culture we've bred." The pledge was a highlight of the BJP's manifesto, which also promised low taxes to boost India's slowing economy.
