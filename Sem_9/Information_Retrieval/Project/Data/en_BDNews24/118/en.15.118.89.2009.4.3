 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)A team of UN Food and Agriculture Organisation comprising local and foreign experts Friday ended a three-day tour to Cyclone Sidr-affected areas in southwestern region to identify the effective options for agricultural development there. The mission led by Ad Spijkers, FAO representative in Bangladesh, visited Bagerhat and Khulna districts' Shoronkhola, Rajeshwar, Kadamtali, Rayenda, Lakurtola, and some other areas, most affected by the deadly cyclone in Nov. 2007, a FAO press release said. FAO so far has provided over 1.5 million households affected by the cyclone with agricultural inputs to support their livelihood, the release said. The team monitored distribution of seeds, fishing gears, poultry and poultry feeds among the affected farmers. It also visited two 'Farmers' Field Schools'. The farmers spoke of the need of fresh water for irrigation in two schemes. "We are here today because we share the same vision of the [Bangladesh] government" said Spijkers. "We believe that agriculture is one of the engines for the development of the country." Spijkers stressed on finding ways out from the increasingly water being saline in the various parts of the south-western districts. "And this hampers a sufficient production of rice and other crops." The FAO representative said bringing surface irrigation in the south-western areas can boost rice production, allowing farmers to achieve food security and sell part of their harvest. Part of the solution can come from the rehabilitation of the canals and by spreading in the area the water reservoirs, he said. Saline-resistant varieties and crops requiring less water should also be developed and distributed in the area, he observed. FAO intends to study possibilities to assist the farmers and rural populations in the coming days. It will bring its knowledge and expertise to implement suitable and sustainable solutions together with the government., the release added bd
