 WELLINGTON, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gautam Gambhir virtually ensured India would win their first test series in New Zealand since 1968 when he guided his side to an imposing 531-run lead at the close of play on the third day of the third test on Sunday. Gambhir, who scored 137 in the second innings of the drawn second test in Napier, moved from 28 at the start of play at the Basin Reserve to 167 after tea before he was trapped in front by Iain O'Brien after New Zealand had taken the second new ball. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni was 16 not out while Yuvraj Singh was on 15 with India 349 for five when bad light stopped play 8.1 overs early. New Zealand reverted back from daylight saving time earlier on Sunday. India, who lead the series 1-0 after winning the first match in Hamilton by 10 wickets, had taken a 182-run lead on Saturday when they bowled the hosts out for 197 in reply to their first innings of 379. Gambhir has scored 445 runs in the three-match series, at an average of 89. He batted for 642 minutes in the second innings of the second test at McLean Park to ensure India drew the match after following on more than 300 runs behind. Since India's home series against Australia last October, the 27-year-old has scored 1269 runs in eight matches at an average of 84.6, including a double century, four centuries and four half centuries. ERA ENDS Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar and Vangipurappu Laxman were the other wickets to fall on Sunday, almost certainly ending an era for New Zealand-based Indian fans. India are not due back in New Zealand until after 2012 and it is unlikely the 36-year-old Dravid, 35-year-old Tendulkar or 34-year-old Laxman will return. Dravid (60) and Tendulkar (nine) were both dismissed in the afternoon session, while Laxman was bowled by O'Brien for 61 after tea. All were warmly applauded by a large contingent of Indian fans in the crowd as they left the pitch. Dravid, who had resumed after lunch on 57, was dismissed shortly after the break thanks to a brilliant piece of anticipation by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. Having watched Dravid sweep a Daniel Vettori delivery fine for two runs, McCullum moved quickly down the legside when the right hander repeated the shot two balls later to take a sharp catch. Tendulkar smashed Vettori for a six over long-off, but did not last much longer when Ross Taylor at first slip produced a superb reflex catch low down to his right to send the Indian great back to the dressing room for probably the last time in New Zeal
