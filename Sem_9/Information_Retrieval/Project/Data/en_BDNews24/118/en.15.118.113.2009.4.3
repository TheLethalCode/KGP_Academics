 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)A year after launching international flights, Bangladesh's third private airliner Best Air has grounded international as well as domestic flights on funds crunch, putting over 100 jobs on the line. The airliner could not pay its employees for more than one month because of financial crisis, said an official of the airline, who spoke one condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media. Many have resigned while others have been sent on long vacation, with the figures no fewer than one hundred, he added. M Haider Uzzaman, the airliner chairman, said they kept all flights off since late Feb., as one of their leased aircraft was getting registered in the company's name and one of their own planes was being repaired abroad. He could not clearly explain why the aircraft that was being registered was out of operation. "We're going to resume operations by middle of this month," Haider said. The $8 million airliner has 260 employees and two aircraftMD-83 and Boeing-737-200. Haider confessed to company's financial crisis. "We're in a financial crisis. We're yet to see profits." "So we've sent some 50 employees to vacation and will ask them to be back in time." The company started operations as a helicopter operator as Best Aviation in 1999. It obtained licence from the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh to run passenger services on international and domestic routes in 2006. It launched Dhaka-Bangkok flights in May 2008 and Dhaka-Chittagong route in Jan. the same year. It later introduced Dhaka-Colombo-Male, Dhaka-Dubai, Dhaka-Singapore and Dhaka-Kuala Lumpur flights. Best Air closed down all domestic and international flights, starting with the Dhaka-Chittagong flights in Jun., and Dhaka-Colombo-Male and Dhaka-Dubai flights by Nov. The Dhaka-Bangkok flights were also stopped, followed by suspension of other flights. Officials said they were licensed to operate flights to 11 international destinations including in India, China, Bahrain and Kuwait. bd
