<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)The government has put a Tk 50,000 reward on the head of each BDR soldier still 'on the run' after February's mutiny at the border force's Peelkhana headquarters. Anyone giving information to their local police station, which leads to capture of a fugitive border guard, could receive Tk 50,000, the home ministry announced on Tuesday. The government said the identities of informers would not be revealed. Officials say between 800 and 1100 BDR men are still "fugitive", having failed to report back to headquarters or battalions after the Feb 25-26 massacre that left at least 70 people dead, mostly army officers deputed to the border force. Around 800 border guards have been arrested to date in connection with the case. bdn
