<TITLE> US stimulus package seen to 'breed more corruption' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, April 4 (bdnews24.com)The $800 billion stimulus package that Congress passed in February has renewed hopes for a revival of the American economy. But at the same time, it has also raised the prospect of greater corruption among public officials through whom the money is expected to be shelled out. The concern about the possible rise in corruption has stemmed from a slew of cases recently uncovered by law enforcement officials. From Tennessee to suburban DC, investigators have found officials on the take. In some cases, the FBI caught the misdeeds on secretly recorded surveillance cameras. In one brazen incident in Tennessee, cameras caught a former Sheriff, named William Horace Long, taking thousands in bribes. Upon taking a wad of cash from an FBI informant, Long gave his blessing to the man's money-laundering operation. The men also share a laugh about "rolling in cash". Long is far from alone. Corruption is rampant across the nation, and is rising as the economy worsens, say investigators. "The more resources we throw towards the problem, I think, the more corruption we're finding," Kenneth Kaiser, assistant director of the criminal investigation division at the FBI, told ABC News last week. In recent years, the number of public corruption cases investigated by the FBI has exploded, with 2,430 pending probes of public officials. That's nearly double the 1,300 cases in 2003. Police, politicians, top school officials and even judges stand accused. And the FBI, which is already probing possible fraud at mortgage and other financial firms, believes corruption cases could rise further as billions of dollars in stimulus money is handed down from Washington to states and cities. "While the FBI is surging to mortgage fraud investigations, our expectation is that economic crimes will continue to skyrocket," FBI Director Robert Mueller told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. "The unprecedented level of financial committed by the federal government to combat the economic downturn will lead to an inevitable increase in economic crime and public corruption cases," he said. Courts have convicted more than 1,800 federal, state and local government officials on corruption charges in the last two years alone. Included in that number: 170 federal officials, 158 on the state level, 360 local officials and more than 365 police officers. Like one police officer in Arkansas, caught on tape stealing money during a traffic stop of a suspected dealer. Or Louisiana judge Alan Green, convicted of taking bribes. He was caught on camera in his office, accepting cash from a man saying he was "delivering on my promise" and recommending that he "put that away somewhere." Green's response, as heard on the tape: "I appreciate it." Government prosecutors pushed for a tough sentence for the former judge, writing in their sentencing memorandum that in exchange for the bribe money Green received, he "harmed innocent victims by releasing dangerous criminals" at the request of a corrupt bail bonds company. A judge sentenced Green to four years and three months in prison. In another shocking example, investigators caught the superintendent of Maryland public school system sitting in a hotel room, relaxing with a bottle of champagne while accepting a cash bribe. Andre Hornsby is seen on TV camera enjoying the champagne and the cash from a fake company he set up to get kickbacks on county school projects he had a role in approving. As a female informant hands over a thousand dollars, a down payment on the $100,000 anticipated, Hornsby picks it up from the table, puts it into his pocket, and says, "That's just Christmas money." Hornsby was sentenced to six years in prison followed by three years of supervised release in November 2008. "Greed, entitlement, a sense of power, ego -- those are things that drives the public corruption," Kaiser said. "I am always amazed at how brazen -- and the entitlement people feel.
