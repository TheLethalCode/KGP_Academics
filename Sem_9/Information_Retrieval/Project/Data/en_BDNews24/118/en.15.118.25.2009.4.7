 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com) The government will scale up security in capital Dhaka and elsewhere in the country to safeguard the Bangla New Year's celebrations due in a week's time. The state minister for home said Tuesday after a home ministry meeting that more than 8,000 RAB and police personnel will be posted in Dhaka City alone in addition to the usual strength on Pahela Baisakh or the Bengali New Year's Day. "To avert any act of sabotage at the Ramna Batamul celebrations or anywhere in the country on the day, the government has decided to strengthen the security arrangements," Tanjim Ahmed Sohel told reporters. Ramna, Dhamnmondi, Rabindra Sarobar and other venues in the capital will have 17 check-posts and sufficient number of security archways installed, he said, in addition to 37 police pickets deployed. To ensure the security of the Dhaka University Fine Arts Institute rally, eight mobile police patrols will be engaged, he added. As many as 5,256 police men and 3,000 RAB personnel will be deployed to oversee the security of the capital. A further 3,000 RAB personnel will be posted in the districts on the day. "Ramna grounds entrance and exits will have 32 CCTV cameras installed and RAB bomb squad, dog squad and reserved forces will be patrolling the surroundings," the junior minister said. He said the government has taken special steps to ensure drinking water supply, provide toilet facilities and ease traffic congestion on the day. Police teams will be actively rescuing and searching out 'lost' children. A portion of Suhrawardy Uddyan has been earmarked for accommodating the hawkers, Sohel said. He however said they had no information that any sabotage acts would be carried out on the first day of the Bengali New Year.
