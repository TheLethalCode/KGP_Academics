<TITLE> Americans back Obama's outreach to Muslim nations, but suspicion remains </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 By Arshad Mahmud Washington, April 5 (bdnews24.com)As President Obama wraps up his two-day tour of Turkey, a new ABC News/Washington Post poll finds that a staggering 81 percent Americans support US outreach to Muslim nations  but many also express continued suspicion of Islam, the world's second-largest religion practiced by an estimated 1.3 billion people. Just a month after he won the presidential election, Obama in a Chicago Tribune interview, described "a unique opportunity to reboot America's image around the world and also in the Muslim world in particular". That's not the purpose of this trip to Turkey, but it is among the first foreign countries he's visited as president, after Canada in February and his European tour this past week. While administration officials are obviously encouraged by such overwhelming support to Obama's Muslim outreach, they are also somewhat disturbed by the revelation that many Americans still hold an unfavorable opinion of Islam. The poll finds that 48-41 percent Americans view Islam negatively  its highest unfavorable rating in ABC/Post polls since 2001. And 29 percent express the belief that mainstream Islam encourages violence against non-Muslims  down slightly from its peak, but double what it was early in 2002. Unfamiliarity is a central factor in these views. Fifty-five percent of Americans concede that they lack a good basic understanding of Islam; about as many, 53 percent, don't personally know a Muslim. People who profess an understanding of Islam, or know a Muslim, have much more positive views of the religion. But other factors also are at play, and favorable views of Islam have not improved even though familiarity has advanced slightly. Forty-five percent now feel they basically understand the religion, 5 points above its previous high and 20 points above its low in 2002. And the 47 percent who know a Muslim is up from 41 percent in October 2001. Another measure suggests Obama's less combative stance on the world stage has produced some change in U.S. public opinion: Forty-three percent think the United States' image in the world is improving, up from 10 percent under George W. Bush in late 2003. Just 14 percent think it's getting worse, down from 61 percent under Bush. There are sharp ideological and partisan differences specifically on improving relations with Muslim nations, especially in the numbers calling this "very important." It peaks at 69 percent of liberals, 61 percent of Democrats and 58 percent of Americans who profess no religion, compared with 32 percent of conservatives, 29 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of evangelical white Protestants. People in the latter three groups also are much more apt to think Obama will "go too far" in trying to improve those relations, and in expressing antipathy toward Islam. Among white evangelicals, 65 percent express an unfavorable opinion of Islam; that drops to 43 percent of other Americans. And 40 percent of white evangelicals think mainstream Islam encourages violence; 26 percent of other Americans hold that view. This is the case even though white evangelicals are about as likely as other Americans to know a Muslim, and 10 points more apt to claim a basic understanding of the religion. The broad relationship between knowledge and sentiment, however, is positive. Overall, people who feel they understand Islam, or who have a Muslim friend, are 22 points more apt to view the religion favorably and 17 points more apt to see it as peaceful, compared with those who lack a basic understanding or a friend who's Muslim. There are political and ideological differences here as well. About two-thirds of liberals and moderates see Islam as peaceful, as do 62 percent of Democrats and independents; fewer conservatives or Republicans agree, 49 percent and 51 percent respectively. And just 26 percent of conservatives and 33 percent of Republicans see the religion favorably. Islam also is more apt to be seen unfavorably by less-educated adults, Southerners and senior citizens than by their counterparts. There have been notable changes in some of these groups. Compared with the first ABC poll to ask the question in October 2001, unfavorable views of Islam have increased by 23 points among senior citizens, 19 points among conservatives, 18 points among Republicans and 12 points among Southerners. There's one group  liberals  among whom unfavorable views of Islam have declined, by 11 points
