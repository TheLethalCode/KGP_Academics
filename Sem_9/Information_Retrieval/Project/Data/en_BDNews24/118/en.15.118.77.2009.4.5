 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com) BNP MP-elect Mohammad Jamiruddin Sircar has termed prime minister Sheikh Hasina's call for BNP chief and opposition leader Khaleda Zia to vacate her cantonment house as "conspiratorial and objectionable". "I will respond to it in parliament," Sircar said at a meeting in Bogra Sadar Upazila Saturday. Former speaker Sircar was elected to the Bogra-6 constituency in Thursday's by-polls. Earlier in the day, another senior BNP leader, Khondakar Mosarraf, had also alleged a government "conspiracy" regarding Khaleda's cantonment house. Adressing a protest rally on the issue, he condemned the prime minister's call to vacate the house. "The house was allotted to the Zia family in memory of the late president on parliamentary recommendation in line with cantonment law," he said BNP lawmaker MK Anwar threatened to launch a street movement if the government went on conspiring against the party chief's house. The protest rally was also addressed by other party leaders. b
