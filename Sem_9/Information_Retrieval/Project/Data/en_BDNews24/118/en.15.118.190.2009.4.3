<TITLE> Ashraful assails BNP, asks Khaleda to vacate house </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com) Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam Friday said BNP's reaction to call on Khaleda Zia to vacate her cantonment house showed the party's siege mentality. He joined a growing chorus in calling the opposition leader to leave the house to help accommodate the families of the army officers killed in BDR mutiny. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina and Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad also made similar call last week. In a statement protesting the remarks of BNP leader Abdul Mannan on the issue, Ashraful urged Khaleda to "rise above greed" and return the house to the government. The prime minister did not make the appeal out of vindictiveness or narrow outlook, as the BNP was claiming; she made the call so that the opposition leader can set an example by extending a helping hand to the bereaved families, the minister said. "Instead, the BNP leaders have exposed their siege mentality by giving a vulgar explanation to a humanitarian appeal just to please their leader." Ashraful said Khaleda's family made a huge fortune in the last three decades and managed to legalise their ill-gotten money during the past caretaker government's rule. "Her [Khaleda's] two sons laundered money abroad and faced graft charges both at home and abroad," he said. Ershad on Thursday said, "I think she (Khaleda) should leave the house for the sake of democracy." "It is not right to run political activities in the cantonment. The cantonment is a restricted area. Sabotage can be carried out if different kinds of people roam the place," the former president said. Ershad, who was then the army chief, allotted the house to Khaleda after the killing of her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman. "I, as the army chief, allotted her the house being concerned about her two sons. If I knew that she would pursue politics there I would not allot it to her." Hasina told parliament Wednesday evening it was former president HM Ershad who was responsible for allocation of the 6 Shaheed Mainul Road house to Khaleda. "Ershad allotted the house to [Khaleda] violating law to make his sister-in-law (Khaleda) happy," Hasina said. The former president said Khaleda was also allocated a house in Gulshan; the two houses were allotted so that the family could survive well. Hasina said,"No member of parliament, no leader of the opposition, should live in the cantonment," "I will request her to leave her 6 Shaheed Mainul Road house in Dhaka Cantonment," she told parliament. "The cabinet will decide whether to cancel this allotted house. I alone cannot decide," she said. bdnews24.co
