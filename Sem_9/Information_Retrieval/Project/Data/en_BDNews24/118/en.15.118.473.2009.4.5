 Biswadip Das Vicenza, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)  A chief of the association of foreign communities in Italy has called for abolition of immigrants-only buses in Foggia, a city in Italy's southeastern Puglia region renowned for agriculture. According to Italy's most famous daily La Corriere Della Sera, from Monday, there will be two number 24 bus lines in Foggia in Milan, one for local residents and the other for immigrants. Both will leave from the city centre and go to the same destination, Borgo Mezzanone. But the buses and stops will be completely different, as will the terminals. The local residents' number 24 will connect Via Galliani in the centre with Borgo Mezzanone while the 24/1 will be shuttling passengers between the station and the asylum seekers' reception centre (CARA). The decision by Foggia's transport authority, ATAF, to duplicate the service and terminals was taken after a series of meetings at the prefecture and with the consent of the interior ministry.

Foggia's Centre-left mayor, Orazio Ciliberti, defended the move: "Racism doesn't come into it. This is an opportunity for an improved service that saves CARA residents, civilians and police officers two extra kilometres to get to the bus stop in Borgo Mezzanone. "No one is stopping immigrants from catching the other bus". Nevertheless, Ciliberti does not deny that public safety is the reason behind the decision. He refers to the tension with the local population and the injury of a bus driver. "It's all down to overcrowding at the centre. Instead of the 200 or 300 immigrants it can house, there are anything from 800 to 1,000," Ciliberti alleges. The president of ACIS, Habib Sgaier, was quick to reply: "This is how ATAF is attempting to solve the problem of a few violent non-EU immigrants, if there are any. But it's not a solution. "A delegation from Borgo Mezzanone has contacted us to say that local residents did not request the new li
