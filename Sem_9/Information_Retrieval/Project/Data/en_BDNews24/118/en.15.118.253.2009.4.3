 WELLINGTON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand were ruing two hours of blistering shot-making by India's batsmen as the advantage they had built after tea evaporated by the close of play on the first day of the third and final test on Friday. India, who lead the series 1-0, finished on 375 for nine after Harbhajan Singh (60) and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (52) had bludgeoned a 79-run partnership and resurrected their side from 204 for six shortly after tea.

"On this kind of wicket it is easy to score runs when the ball is short and they did bowl too short to me...that's the way I like to bat," the off-spinner said. Harbhajan said the wicket was a little two-paced and if his side's bowlers produced a disciplined line and length on Saturday, they should be able to take wickets. "We just need to be patient when we come to bowl tomorrow and hit the right areas and if we do so we will get the resul
