 Dhaka , April 4 (bdnews24.com)Awami League spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam warned of the sternest measures against 'all forms of terrorism', when he was questioned Saturday about ongoing campus violence. "The government is pledge-bound to take stern lawful action against all extortionists, terrorists and corrupt," the local government minister told reporters, who pressed him to comment on the ongoing violence by ruling party-backed Bangladesh Chhatra League. Ashraf was speaking after a meeting at party chief Sheikh Hasina's Dhanmondi office to finalise the Apr 17 Mujibnagar Day programmes. Bangladesh's first government-in-exile was formed in Meherpur on the day in 1971. The day's programmes include paying tribute to the memorial there. The one hour meeting was also attended by presidium member Abdur Razzak, organising secretary Abdul Mannan and Khulna division AL leaders. A follow-up presidium meeting was scheduled to take place in the evening at the same venue with party chief Sheikh Hasina in the chair. bd
