 KARACHI, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Private security bodyguards will be hired for the one-day series between Pakistan and Australia to be staged in Dubai and Abu Dhabi this month, a Pakistan Cricket Board official said on Wednesday. "The security plan for the series is also now approved and we are coordinating with the authorities in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and also with the emirates cricket board to provide the best possible security for the series," PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters. Pakistan play the world champions in five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match from April 22 after Australia refused to tour Pakistan because of security concerns. Australia have not toured Pakistan since 1998 and the last time the two countries played a one-day series was in early 2005 in Australia. Pakistan captain Younis Khan said he did not believe Australia would be weakened by the absence of captain Ricky Ponting and leading players Mike Hussey and Mitchell Johnson. "The Australians have a productive domestic system and this ensures they can overcome the absence of any player as they have shown in the past," he told Reuters. "They won the 2003 World Cup even though Shane Warne had to pull out before the event because of a positive dope test. "The only edge we have is they have played lot of cricket since last year and some of their players could be fatigued and not like the hard playing conditions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.
