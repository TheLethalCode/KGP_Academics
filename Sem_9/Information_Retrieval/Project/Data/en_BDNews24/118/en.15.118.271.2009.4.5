 BEIJING, Sun Apr 5, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China urged the international community on Sunday not to overreact to North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket, which prompted condemnation from many powers and triggered an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi called his counterparts in the United States, Russia, Japan and South Korea to discuss the launch, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

China is worried about the stability of North Korea given the risk of refugees flooding across its border if the impoverished state were to collapse, and analysts say Beijing is unlikely to back strong action at the United Nations against Pyongyang. China also calculates that its display of detachment will minimise damage to stalled negotiations seeking to persuade North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons, and help preserve China's stake in North Korea's survival, Chinese analysts said last week. Beijing is a permanent member of the UN Security Council, and has the power to veto proposed resolutions. It backed a 2006 resolution that other governments say bans such launches by the North. Beijing has refused to say openly whether it agrees. That mild stance contrasts with October 2006, when it denounced as "brazen" North Korea's first and only test explosion of a nuclear device -- an act that defied public warnings from Beijing's image-sensitive lea
