 JERUSALEM, Mon Apr 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Middle East envoy Tony Blair urged Israel's prime minister Monday to resume Palestinian statehood talks in parallel with a push to boost the West Bank economy and to let Palestinians control more of their territory. Blair met rightist Benjamin Netanyahu, who took office last week, laying out in broad terms how the "Quartet" of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- wants to see stalled peacemaking proceed.

Blair, tasked by the Quartet with spearheading economic development in the occupied West Bank, said providing Palestinians with greater freedom of movement was central to creating the foundations for statehood.

Blair also urged Netanyahu to ease Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip, which Hamas Islamists seized in June 2007 after routing forces loyal to Abbas's secular Fatah faction. Aides said Blair saw Israel's decision last year to give Abbas's US-trained security forces greater control over the northern West Bank city of Jenin as a model that could be applied to other parts of the territory. The administration of US President Barack Obama plans to expand its training program for Abbas's forces. Speaking in Turkey Monday, Obama said Washington "strongly supports the goal of two states, living side by side in peace and secur
