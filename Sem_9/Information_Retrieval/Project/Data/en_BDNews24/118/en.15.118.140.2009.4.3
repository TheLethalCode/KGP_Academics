 MADRID, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: (All times in GMT) Financially-troubled Valencia have secured a 50 million euro ($67 million) loan from a group of local businesses, the club said after a board meeting on Thursday, which is likely to see players paid outstanding wages owed from two months ago. They host struggling Getafe on Sunday (1700) with a doubt over striker David Villa who was rested to continue recovering from a knee injury for Spain's 2-1 World Cup qualifier win in Turkey on Wednesday. Leaders Barcelona have only won once after four breaks for internationals this season but midfielder Sergio Busquets, who debuted for Spain in Turkey, said that was no excuse for failing in Saturday's trip to face Real Valladolid (1800). "It's always difficult to return to play just after international duty but it can also affect other teams like Real Madrid who have a lot of internationals as well. We can't use it as an excuse," he said. Real Madrid will have to make changes on their left flank in Malaga on Saturday (2000) with defender Gabriel Heinze suspended and Marcelo out with a muscle strain. Winger Arjen Robben has an ankle problem, and is a doubt. Argentine striker Gonzalo Higuain, who scored all four goals in Real's 4-3 win against Malaga at the Bernabeu back in November, is likely to return to the starting line up. Portuguese midfielder Paulo Assuncao returns from suspension for Atletico Madrid at home to relegation-threatened Osasuna on Sunday (1500), with the side five points off the Champions League places after their surprise 2-0 defeat at Real Mallorca last time out. "What happened in the last game isn't going to happen again. We know our rivals have tough matches and we need to get back to playing the way we did against Barca and Real," he said. Mallorca's top scorer Aritz Aduriz returns to face his former club Athletic Bilbao on Saturday (1800) with both clubs embroiled in the fight to avoid relegation. The decision to sell Aduriz last year was deeply unpopular in Bilbao. "My heart may be divided but my head is clear on one thing. I'll do all I can for a Mallorca win," he said. King's Cup finalists Bilbao have lost four on the trot in the league. Deportivo Coruna, who visit bottom club Espanyol on Sunday (1500), have exercised the option to buy on loan Portuguese defender Ze Castro from Atletico Madrid, the club said. Espanyol have one win from their last 19 league matches and are eight points from safety, but midfielder Ivan de la Pena remained positive: "People might think I am mad, but I am sure we will save ourselves.
