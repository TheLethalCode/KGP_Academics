 KARACHI, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has pulled three Indian Cricket League (ICL)-contracted players from a preliminary Twenty20 World Cup squad, while they seek a "clear ruling" from the International Cricket Council on the players' eligibility. Launched last year, the unofficial ICL has signed many international players, but it is not recognised by the ICC or its members, and those taking part attract automatic bans from all forms of official cricket. Pakistan selectors this week named ICL-contracted Abdul Razzaq, Rana Naved and Imran Nazir in a 30-man squad to be trimmed to 15 for the tournament in England in June. The three would be replaced by Zulfiqar Jan, Saeed Ajmal and Mohammad Hafeez, said Saleem Altaf, chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board official, on Wednesday.
