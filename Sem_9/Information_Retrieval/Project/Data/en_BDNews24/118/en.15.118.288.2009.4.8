 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's thankful deliberations prompted parliament Tuesday night to adopt a thank-you motion on former president Iajuddin Ahmed's Jan 25 address in the House. Only four of a total of 170 Awami League MPs including Hasina thanked Iajuddin for his speech Hasina agreed with her rival opposition leader Khaleda Zia, who alleged that Iajuddin, handpicked for presidency by the latter when she was prime minister during 2001-06, violated the constitution by assuming the office of caretaker head without exhausting options for selecting another as chief adviser. "I agree with [Khaleda Zia] that he violated the constitution by assuming the office of caretaker head. "But she (Khaleda) will have to take responsibility for it. Because, they (BNP) handed power to him," Hasina said, while delivering her speech on president's address. "We do not want to destroy any institution. I thank him. I propose the House accept the thank-you motion," said the leader of the House. Parliament adopted the motion by a voice vote. Iajuddin, who left the president's office on Feb 12 this year, delivered the traditional inaugural address of the ninth parliament. But, in a first, MPs across the board criticised him though the speech he delivered was drafted and approved by the Awami League government. According to parliamentary practice, the cabinet approves the speech of the president who reads out the text. Awami League MPs Suranjit Sengupta, Habibun Nahar and Tarana Halim thanked Iajuddin for his address. "I thank the president as his speech was very short," Suranjit said. Actress-turned-MP Tarana Halim said, "I thank the president for acknowledging Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the father of the nation."
