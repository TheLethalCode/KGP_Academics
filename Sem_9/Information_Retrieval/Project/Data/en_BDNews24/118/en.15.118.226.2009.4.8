<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Tuesday pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal activists who recently converted to ruling Awami League's student front Bangladesh Chhatra League were instigating violence and factional clashes on the campuses. The home ministry has been asked to take strong measures against perpetrators of these criminal activities, she added. On standing down as BCL's ceremonial head days before, Hasina, also AL chief, said she could not lead any student front in line with the Representation of People Order. New party registration rules, introduced ahead of last year's general elections stipulated that party constitutions be amended to get rid of all front organisations. Khaleda came down hard on the prime minister and the ruling Awami League for the recent "bloodshed" caused by the BCL on campuses countrywide. The party's top policymaking presidium decided on Apr 8 that she would no longer be 'organisational head' of BCL. AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters that the BCL was beset with organisational problems for inefficiency of the central committee. Ashraf also said AL was calling on all political parties, including opposition BNP, to resist terror activities and extortion in the name of student politics. He said the government had ordered a severe crackdown against campus violence by students or any other groups. The government instructed law-enforcing agencies to take the sternest action against violence, extortion and tender-rigging by student leaders, members or activists, or anyone perpetrating such acts in the guise of students, he said. "The action starts now," said Ashraf. He said none, not BCL activists or any others, would be spared if they were involved in such crimes. A dozen people were injured in Chhatra League factional fighting at Jagannath University on Apr 4. The violence sparked off in front of the arts faculty between two groups led by JagU's BCL unit president and general secretary. JagU's BCL unit, among other university units, had already faced several stern warnings from Hasina, Awami League and central BCL leaders in past weeks as factional fights, and clashes with rival student bodies, for control of campuses mounted. A BCL leader was killed in violence that forced the closure of Dhaka Medical College last week. Central BCL leaders were forced to dissolve BCL's Jahangirnagar University unit in February after recurrent clashes over control of residential halls. But clashes continued unabated on the campus. The university saw another bout of violence on Friday as BCL activists wielded machetes, hockey sticks and other lethal weapons in factional clashes that left at least 10 persons injured and some eight dormitory rooms vandalised. bdnews24.com/krc/sum
