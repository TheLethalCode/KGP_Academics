 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)  M Masudul Karim and Nazmun Nahar Beauty became the fastest man and woman in the UCB 34th National Athletics Championships at the Bangabandhu National Stadium on Saturday. Army-man Karim edged Navy's M Emran Bhuiya in the 100m clocking 10.70 seconds compared to Bhuiya's 10.90. Golam Murtaza of BKSP finished third in 11.00 seconds. Despite the absence of last year's king of the track Abu Abdullah and runner-up Shamsuddin, Karim initially struggled before claiming gold on the concluding day of the meet. At the 2008 edition Abdullah set a national record clocking 10.30 while Shamsuddin finished in a time of 10.40, but both athletes did not return home after participating in the World Military Sports in Greece last month. Despite finishing outside her last year's record time of 11.60, Beauty of BJMC was too good for the rest clocking 11.90 seconds. Shamsun Nahar Chumki of Ansar and VDP took 12.00 seconds to finish second while Israt Jahan Iva became third timing 12.30 seconds. While the organisers expressed their concern at the dismal performance of the country's leading athletes ahead of the South Asian Games to be held in Bangladesh in 2010, the competitors believed the only to improve was if they were sent abroad for advanced training. "If we were allowed to train abroad for three month's our results could improve," said Karim, who first earned the fastest man title in 2006. Karim thought if Abdullah and Shamsuddin would remain in the squad, the 100m gold medal in the SA Games would be ensured. "It is unfair if an athlete chooses not to return home after going aboard and it sends the wrong message to other athletes who will become demoralised," said Karim while commenting on Abdullah and Shamsuddin. The army-man, however, thinks the situation must be dealt with immediately. Karim started out as a hurdler but switched to sprinting in 2002. Overall he has bagged 50 gold medals in his 10-year athletic career, including two gold medals from this season. Karim on Friday finished first in the 200m sprint. After clinching the 100m gold five times in a row, Beauty wondered how no one could beat her despite a poor performance. "I see no possibility of new sprinters challenging my reign," said Beauty, who first bagged gold in 2005. Beauty might have lost her crown to Chumki had she not touched her chest to ribbon. Immediate after touching the ribbon, Beauty slipped down to track after failing to control her balance. Bangladesh Army dominated the medals table with 14 gold, 16 silver and six bronze, followed by Bangladesh Ansar and VDP, who bagged seven gold, six silver and three bronze. Daffodil International University finished third with four gold and three bronze. Bangladesh Navy earned three gold, four silver and six bronze and BJMC also grabbed three gold. bd
