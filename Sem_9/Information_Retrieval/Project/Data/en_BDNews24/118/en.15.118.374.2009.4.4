<TITLE> Keep rice between Tk 20-25: CPD </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)The Centre for Policy Dialogue has advised the government to keep the price of coarse rice at between Tk 20 to 25 per kilo in order to encourage growers for increased production. The CPD also said no promise of the government could be fulfilled without solution to the gas and electricity crises. CPD executive director Mustafizur Rahman was briefing the press Saturday on 'A Recommendation Package for the Newly Elected Government'. "The Bangladesh economy is faced with a big challenge because of global recession. The budget preparation is now a big task," said Rahman. CPD's senior research director Uttam Dev told the briefing, "If paddy price falls much, farmers will not be able to get even the production cost." "If they are discouraged from paddy production, a food crisis will loom large. The government must take necessary steps so that the paddy price per maund remains at Tk 500," he said. He said the government has to ensure a steady rice price in the interest of long-term self-sufficiency in food. "If the price of course rice rises above Tk 25 per kilo, the government must release rice stocked in godowns. If it comes down below Tk 20, it should buy back rice from the market." Such system is prevalent in Indonesia, said Uttam. Rahman said: "Many countries are providing incentives to face the recession." "Our export sector has to be given different kinds of facilities including cash incentives. If that is not done, it will be tough to survive in competition in the world market. A good amount has to be set aside for such incentives," he said. Revenue, including import tariffs, may fall because of recession, he warned. "That is why the government is faced with such a big challenge in balancing the new budget." The press conference was organised to shed light on recommendations made at a March 28-29 seminar on 'Development with Equity and Justice: Immediate tasks for the new government'. bd
