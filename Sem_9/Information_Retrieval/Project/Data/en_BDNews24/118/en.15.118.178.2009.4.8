 LONDON, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies have dropped fast bowler Daren Powell and all-rounder Ryan Hinds for their two-test tour of England next month. A statement on the West Indies official website (www.windiescricket.com) said all-rounder Dwayne Bravo was unavailable because he was still recovering after ankle surgery. Three uncapped players, Grenada fast bowler Nelon Pascal, Barbados batsman Dale Richards and Jamaica medium-pacer Andrew Richardson, were named in the 17-man squad. West Indies will defend the Wisden trophy after defeating England 1-0 in the Caribbean this year. The tour starts on April 21 and includes three warm-up matches plus the two test matches. West Indies - Chris Gayle (captain), Denesh Ramdin, Lionel Baker, Sulieman Benn, David Bernard, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Narsingh Deonarine, Fidel Edwards, Brendan Nash, Nelon Pascal, Dale Richards, Andrew Richardson, Darren Sammy, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Lendl Simmons, Devon Smith, Jerome Taylor
