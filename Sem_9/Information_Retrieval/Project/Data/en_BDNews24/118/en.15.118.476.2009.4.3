<TEXT>
 ROME, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of Sunday's matches in Serie A (all times GMT): Kaka is raring to go ahead of third-placed AC Milan's home match against second-from-bottom Lecce on Sunday (1900) after recovering from a foot problem to produce a fine performance in Brazil's 3-0 win over Peru on Wednesday. "The Peru match showed I've healed. From now until the end of the season I want to play 90 minutes with Milan always," the playmaker, who has been troubled by injuries this season, was quoted as saying by Friday's La Gazzetta dello Sport. Earlier this week Kaka said he had recovered more in a week in Brazil than in over a month with the doctors at Milan, who trail leaders Inter Milan by 14 points and need to finish third for direct entry into next season's Champions League group stage. Inter Milan risk being without Maicon for the rest of the season after the right back injured his leg in Brazil's 1-1 World Cup qualifying draw in Ecuador on Sunday, but otherwise the champions' crisis in defence is easing before their visit to Udinese (1700). Walter Samuel is available after a suspension, Marco Materazzi, Ivan Cordoba and Cristian Chivu have recovered from injuries and Nicolas Burdisso is also back training with his team mates after a leg problem. Udinese's Antonio Di Natale may miss the rest of the season after damaging knee ligaments in Italy's 2-0 win in Montenegro on Saturday while fellow forward Alexis Sanchez and defender Maurizio Domizzi are suspended this weekend. David Trezeguet is being tipped to start up front alongside Alessandro Del Piero in Juventus's home game against Chievo Verona (1300). Striker Vincenzo Iaquinta may be rested for Juve, who are seven points behind Inter in second, after he played in Italy's World Cup qualifiers against Montenegro and Ireland. Captain Francesco Totti should be able to play in sixth-placed AS Roma's home game against struggling Bologna (1300) after a knee problem, while midfielders Simone Perrotta and David Pizarro are also back in contention for a starting place following injuries. But Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic looks set to miss out as tests showed he had a minor strain in a muscle in his backside, the club said. Mid-table Napoli said striker Ezequiel Lavezzi will miss Sunday's game at Sampdoria (1300) after suffering a thigh muscle strain in training with the Argentina national team this week
