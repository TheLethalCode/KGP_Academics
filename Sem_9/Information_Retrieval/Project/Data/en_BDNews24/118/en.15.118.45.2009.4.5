<TITLE> Saju Hosein to remain Ittefaq publisher for 3 months: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)The High Court ordered a three-month status quo Sunday keeping Saju Hosein as printer and publisher of Bengali newspaper the Daily Ittefaq. It also asked the government to explain why the Dhaka district magistrate order declaring Anwar Hossain Manju the printer and publisher of the Ittefaq was not illegal. The information secretary, Dhaka deputy commissioner, additional magistrate, Ittefaq Group of Publications, Saju Hosein and Manju were asked to respond to the rule. The bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddiqui gave the orders on a writ petition filed by Ittefaq Group executive director-1 Mainul Hossain. On Mar 25, the additional district magistrate declared Manju printer and publisher of the Ittefaq. On Oct 17, 2007, Saju Hosein temporarily functioned as printer and publisher of the daily. But according to 1973 printing and publication law (declaration and registration), Manju did not resign as printer and publisher of the daily. Besides, four of the six company directors supported Manju. Advocate Mahmudul Islam said in the hearing that the letter declaring Manju as publisher and printer of the daily was illegal because the Ittefaq Group of Publication is the real printer and publisher. And Manju was merely a representative of the company to obtain the declaration for the company on Apr 21, 1985. Manju was not represented in the hearing. b
