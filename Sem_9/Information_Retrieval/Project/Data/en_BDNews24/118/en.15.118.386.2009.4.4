 DURBAN, April 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Off-spinner Nathan Hauritz snapped up four wickets to steer Australia to an emphatic 141-run victory over South Africa in the first one dayer on Friday. Hauritz's career-best figures of four for 29 condemned South Africa to their heaviest one-day defeat against Australia as they were skittled out for 145 after just 33.1 overs. Chasing 287 for victory, South Africa lost their last nine wickets for just 54 runs as Hauritz and medium-pacer James Hopes, who took two for 24, ran through the order. Australia had earlier posted a total of 286 for seven, with Mike Hussey returning to form with 83 not out. Hauritz, playing his first match on tour, claimed the key wickets of Graeme Smith (52), Mark Boucher (0) and Albie Morkel (14) in 8.1 overs. Captain Smith gave South Africa a solid start as they raced to 89 for one after 15 overs but Hopes sparked the collapse by having Herschelle Gibbs well-caught by Michael Clarke at point for 33. BATSMEN STIFLED The rest of the South African batsmen were stifled by Australia's bowlers. Smith, who scored his 38th ODI fifty at a run-a-ball, tried to play Hauritz on the on-side and was beaten by the 27-year-old's wise use of flight and turn, offering a simple return catch. From then on only JP Duminy (15) and Morkel were able to reach double figures as South Africa quickly headed for defeat. Hussey pounced on every opportunity to score as he cracked an unbeaten 83 in 79 balls. He and Hopes (38) put on a quickfire 67 for the sixth wicket. Earlier, wicketkeeper Brad Haddin showed his versatility as a batsman as he moved up the order to open the innings and contribute 53. Haddin and captain Ricky Ponting shared a stand of 77 for the second wicket. Ponting fell for 37 when he mis-hit a lofted drive off Morne Morkel to his brother Albie at deep mid-on before Haddin was run out in a mix-up over calling. Paceman Dale Steyn was the most effective bowler, taking two for 45 in nine ov
