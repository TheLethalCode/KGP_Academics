<TITLE> Biman in search of foreign CEO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Biman Bangladesh Airlines is searching for an experienced foreigner to helm the flag carrier as managing director and chief executive, a top official said Tuesday. "Bangladesh lacks experienced executives in the business; it'd be better if we found an experienced foreign national (for the job)," the chairman of Biman's board of directors, Jamal Uddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com Tuesday. Biman has advertised the positions for MD and CEO with 15-year experience in the aviation industry, he said. Managing director and CEO Zahed Kuddus, a former regulatory official with no experience in business management, resigned his position Sunday. The finance director of Biman, AM Mosaddique Ahmed, is now a stand-in. "(Kuddus) has cited family grounds for resignation and the board of directors has accepted his resignation letter," said Ahmed, a former air force chief. Kuddus, also a former air force officer, was appointed on Sept. 16 last year. Before that, he had served as the chairman of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh from 2002 to 2005. His was appointed by the Biman's board of directors at a meeting chaired by Mahbub Jamil, the former special assistant to chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Jamil then had said the government was looking for a strategic partner to run and manage Biman, which has bled billions in recent years thanks to chronic inefficiency. He said they wanted Biman to be run by a foreign airline through partnership. That airline could opt for a stake in Biman or just take responsibility for management. Jamil also had said a new CEO was likely to be appointed if the airline took over the management. And the new chief executive may be hired from abroad once Biman entered international partnership. Singapore Airlines, a 'prime target', was supposed to give its decision by the end of 2008, but it did not come. The government turned Biman into a public limited company in July last year and retired 1863 staffers through the so-called golden handshake programme. bd
