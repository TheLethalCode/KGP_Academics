 JERUSALEM, Tue Apr 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police said they shot dead a Palestinian who attacked them during the demolition on Tuesday of part of the East Jerusalem home of a Palestinian who killed three Israelis in a bulldozer rampage last year. It was the first such demolition since a military commission determined in 2005 that a policy of destroying a Palestinian attacker's home was ineffective as a deterrent against future strikes on Israelis. A police spokesman said paramamilitary border police who set up a roadblock in Arab East Jerusalem's Sur Bahir neighborhood, where the demolition took place, shot and killed a "terrorist" who ran into them with his car. He said three policemen were injured. The home belonged to the family of Husam Dweiyat, who in a July 2 attack drove a bulldozer into a commuter bus, cars and pedestrians on Jerusalem's busy Jaffa Road, killing three people and wounding 20. Police and passersby shot him dead. Police called it a "terrorist attack." Hussein Ghanyem, a lawyer for Dweiyat's family, told Reuters the bulldozer driver suffered from mental illness, a condition he said had been certified by a court during a criminal case against him in 2000. Last month, Dweiyat's parents lost an appeal in Israel's Supreme Court against an order to demolish the part of their home where their son had lived, in Arab East Jerusalem. Heavy machinery with a steel claw tore into the top floors of the stone home. Rubble crashed to the ground and police armed with assault rifles kept onlookers at a distance. Human rights groups described the renewed demolition policy as collective punishment. Israeli leaders have said the measure was needed in response to a series of attacks by Palestinians from East Jerusalem, who have wider freedom of movement than brethren in the West Bank. Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the area in a move that has not won international recognition. Palestinians in East Jerusalem are issued the same identity cards that Israelis carry. Three weeks after the Jaffa Road incident, another Palestinian bulldozer driver from East Jerusalem went on a rampage in west Jerusalem, injuring 16 people, before he was killed by police gunfire. Last month, the driver of a bulldozer crushed a police car and attacked other vehicles on a busy Jerusalem road before police and a taxi driver shot him
