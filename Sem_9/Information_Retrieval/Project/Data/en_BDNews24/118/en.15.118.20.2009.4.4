Speaking at a news conference Mourinho expressed sympathy for Adriano, who has talked publicly about his drinking and personal problems, but refused to go into details on his failure to return to the Serie A leaders for Sunday's game at Udinese (1700 GMT). Adriano was an unused substitute in Brazil's 3-0 win over Peru and a 1-1 draw with Ecuador during the week. "Everyone has understood that this is not an easy situation," Mourinho said. "It's not a player who has decided to return late and it's not because he missed his flight. It is not a joke, it is not indisciplineIt's something more than that." The 27-year-old was loaned to Sao Paolo last season by previous Inter coach Roberto Mancini following discipline problems. He had edged back into Mourinho's good books after similar difficulties this season. "I am neither angry nor critical. I am only sad and the best thing is to say nothing. We will see how things end up for him but at the moment I think about the person more than the player," Mourinho said
