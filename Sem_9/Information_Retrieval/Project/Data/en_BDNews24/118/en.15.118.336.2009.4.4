 Chandpur, Apr 4 (bdnews24.ccom)  Labourers in Hajiganj, Chandpur, have unearthed a huge pile of ammunition, which police say may have been stashed by freedom fighters during the 1971 liberation war. "Most of the ammunition was damaged after being underground for so long," said Hajiganj police chief Md Jashimuddin of the 1,500 bullets found at Truckghat on Friday. The owner of the land, Abu Taher, hired day labourers to dig earth for a construction project. "The labourers felt something hard hit their spades that turned out to be a huge pile of unused bullets," said Jashimuddin. "Abu Taher informed the Hajiganj police, who recovered some 1,500 bullets and brought them to the police station." Hajiganj police sub-inspector Farid Uddin, who led the recovery, said the ammo might have been hidden during the war. bdn
