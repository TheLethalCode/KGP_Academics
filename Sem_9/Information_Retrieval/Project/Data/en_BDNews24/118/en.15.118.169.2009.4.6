 COLOMBO, Mon Apr 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka said on Monday more than 2,100 people fled a no-fire zone where the military expects to destroy the Tamil Tiger separatists, the first sign of an exodus that will make the job of ending the 25-year war easier. The Sri Lankan military said it had killed at least 453 rebel fighters during a three-day battle that on Sunday took the final scrap of rebel-held land outside a coastal strip the army declared as a no-fire zone for civilians. The United Nations says tens of thousands are being held as human shields by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), and has urged the military to protect them during a final offensive in the 17 sq km of coastal coconut groves. "Yesterday, 2,127 came out from the north of the no-fire zone at Chalai," military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said, referring to one of three land routes out of the northeastern coastal area, which is mostly surrounded by water. He said civilians were streaming out of the area on Monday, but that the exact numbers were not available. Two military sources told Reuters that a number of LTTE combat unit leaders had surrendered in the past few days. With the Tigers confined to the no-fire zone, Asia's longest-running civil war is in its final stage. Diplomats have warned the war could end in a bloodbath if the LTTE stages a mass-suicide attack or the military proceeds indiscriminately. Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa told Reuters on Sunday that soldiers were not going to hurry to wipe out the Tigers, so they can move cautiously to protect people and take advantage of what he said was growing civilian anger with the LTTE. At least 64,200 people have fled from Tiger areas since Jan. 1, nearly half since the army neared the no-fire zone. That is despite the Tigers shooting at them, according to those who have escaped. The LTTE insists people are staying by choice. The Tigers, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations have all accused the military of shelling civilian areas, which the government denies as a propaganda ploy to try and build international pressure for a truce so the LTTE can re-arm. The pro-rebel web site TamilNet.com said on Monday said at least 71 civilians were killed and 143 wounded since Saturday night by Sri Lankan forces. It did not cite sources but published pictures of people including children it said were the victims. Battlefield reports are nearly impossible to verify since the area is usually off-limits to outside observers and both sides have repeatedly distorted accounts to their benefit. The Tigers emerged as the most ruthless of several Tamil militant groups that sprung up in the 1970s to fight against discrimination by successive governments, all led by the Sinhalese majority since independence from Britain in 1948. Since the war erupted in 1983, they have landed on numerous terrorism lists for dozens of assassinations and suicide bombings of opponents including a Sri Lankan president, a former Indian prime minister and rival Ta
