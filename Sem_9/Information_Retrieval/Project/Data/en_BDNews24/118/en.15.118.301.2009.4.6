 Dhaka, April 5 (bdnews24.com)A new bus service from Uttara to Azimpur is set to start operating "within days" with the first ever auto-ticketing system, said the communications minister on Sunday. Syed Abul Hossain, in reply to a question, told parliament, "These buses will operate on a franchise system." "The first such auto-ticketing system is being introduced as part of the Digital Bangladesh plan." Out of 100 buses, 40 will be air-conditioned and 60 will be non-AC. The minister also said that a study on the metro rail line from Uttara to Jatrabari would start soon. Replying to another question, the minister said the government was thinking of issuing bonds to raise funds for construction of the Padma Bridge at Mawa. "A committee has been formed in this regard. An assurance of about Tk 7,935 crore in loan assistance has already been obtained from different development partners." He also said that there were plans for a rail line across the proposed bridge. On another query, Hossain said a shortlist to appoint consultants for a proposed road link with Myanmar has been finalised. "The proposal would be sent to Myanmar through the foreign ministry. Appointment of consultants will begin after their opinion is obtained," he added. bdnews24.com/sm/
