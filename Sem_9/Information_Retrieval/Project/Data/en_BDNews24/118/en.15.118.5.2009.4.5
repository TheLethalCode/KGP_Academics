 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)Despite the global recession, Bangladesh received $881.3 million in remittances in March 2009, the highest ever for a single month, the central bank governor said Sunday. The March figure broke the record of $859 million earned in January, according to Bangladesh Bank figures. February saw $784.5 million. "The foreign reserve of the Bangladesh Bank has crossed $6.03 billion dollar due to the rise in remittances," central bank chief Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Sunday. "The global economic downturn is yet to cast its spell on remittance inflow. This is very positive for our economy," he said. The World Bank, IMF, ADB and local economists have all predicted a dip in remittances, one of the economy's main indices, in the face of the global crisis. The governor, however, is optimistic that remittances will maintain an upward curve in the remaining three months (Apr.-Jun.) of the current fiscal year According to central bank figures, the first nine months (July 2008-March 2009) has seen remittance earnings of $7 billion, a 34 percent jump over the same period of the previous fiscal (2007-08). Total remittance for 2007-08 was $7.9 billion, and $6 billion for 2006-07. bdne
