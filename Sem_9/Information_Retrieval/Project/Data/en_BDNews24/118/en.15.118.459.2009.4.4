 Islamabad, April 04 (bdnews24.com/BBC Online)- Several people have been killed by an explosion at a security post in the heart of Pakistan's capital Islamabad. Gunshots were heard after what officials described as a suicide bomb attack which killed at least six paramilitary police. The BBC's Barbara Plett in the city said the explosion struck a police mess tent and was followed by gunfire. Police cordoned off the location and live television footage showed ambulances attending the scene. This was the second attack on the security forces in Islamabad in two weeks. A suicide bomb attack on a police station on 23 March left one policeman dead and another injured. Violence in Pakistan has surged in recent months amid a wave of attacks blamed on Islamist militants. Last June a massive bomb blast in Islamabad's Marriott hotel killed at least 53 people and injured more than 250.
