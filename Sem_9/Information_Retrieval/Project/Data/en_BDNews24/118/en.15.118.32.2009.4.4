 Seoul, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poor weather may have caused North Korea to put off the launch of a rocket on Saturday, the first day of a five-day planned window for lift-off, a South Korean official was quoted as saying. North Korea has said it would launch the long-range rocket from Saturday to Wednesday between the hours of 0200 GMT to 0700 GMT to put a satellite into orbit. The launch is viewed as a disguised test of a long-range missile that violates U.N. resolutions. "We thought the launch was likely today, but weather conditions at the rocket base may not have been favourable," South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted a presidential Blue House official as saying. South Korea's meteorological agency said the area on the North's north-eastern coast, the location of the missile base, was under mostly cloudy skies with occasionally strong winds. A slightly clearer day is forecast for Sunday and Monday with less wind
