 Sherpur, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government will fix paddy price after Boro harvesting, keeping Tk 1-2 a kg in profits to offset production costs of farmers, the agriculture minister has said. "We won't announce any decision in advance," Motia Chowdhury said at a VGF card distribution programme at Nakla Upazila in the district. She said diesel prices would also be slashed to bring down production cost. The past caretaker government cut the diesel price by Tk 2 a litre and Awami League-led government on its 20th day in office further cut it by another Tk 2, she pointed out. Chowdhury also said farmers got relief this year as fertilisers were available to them in time. The minister distributed rice to VGF card holders chosen through lottery at Ganapaddi and Talki Union She also distributed 'Jadur Faad' or magical net to farmers to kill insects at crop fields at Baleshwari Union. bdn
