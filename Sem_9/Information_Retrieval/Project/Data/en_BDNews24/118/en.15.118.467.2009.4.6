<TITLE> Kuakata goes off road link </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Patuakhali, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)Road link between the southern sea resort Kuakata and the rest of Bangladesh has snapped since Sunday night when a truck laden with felled logs fell on the river bank as it was trying to get on to the bailey bridge at Lebukhali ferry crossing on the Patuakhali-Barisal highway, an official says. Abdul Quddus, Lebukhali ferry supervisor, said the accident took place when a truck from Barisal overly loaded with felled logs broke the bridge as it heaved to get on to it. It resulted in disconnecting the two southern districts, Patuakhali and Barguna including Kuakata from the rest of the country since 9pm. Over a hundred passenger buses, trucks and other vehicles are stuck on both banks of the river at Lebukhali ferry crossing. The long-distance bus passengers and other travellers are suffering immensely, as the repair and salvation work will begin only after heavy duty cranes arrive from Barisal and pull the bridge up. bdn
