 Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)The government will not continue with the 100-day employment-generation programme in the current fiscal year because the flaw-ridden scheme needs more review, the food minister has said. "The programme has been withheld as it faced criticism and its transparency and accountability have been questioned," Abdur Razzaq told reporters Sunday, emerging from a workshop on the scheme he launched. Razzaq said on Mar 19 the government was probing alleged irregularities in the scheme and four allegations had already been proved. The interim government initiated the programme in the last budget, allocating Tk 2000 crore for employing 20 lakh unemployed rural poor under the Social Safety Net Scheme. The minister said Sunday out of a Tk 1200 crore fund available, Tk 900 crore have been spent in the first phase of the scheme, a total 52 days spread through the months from Oct to Nov. "The remaining Tk 300 crore would be allocated for the 'Food for Work' programme," he said, in reply to a question from the media. Razzaq said several flaws and irregularities had been identified in the scheme. He made it clear that the ongoing fiscal year would not see anymore spending on the programme, and said the programme needed more review to wipe out the flaws. The minister however said the next budget would address the issue. Razzaq took a swipe at the donors as he said only 44,000 tonnes of food came in aid during the food crisis against an expected 4,00,000 tonnes. "We want the donors to contribute in this scheme next time...they only advise us," he added. A recent evaluation by the FAO and BRAC Research Group, presented in the workshop, says the scheme is reaching the extreme poor and having a positive effect but there are some areas in design that needs attention to further boost its performance. The workshop, co-organised by the World Bank and the food ministry, stresses on ensuring governance and transparency for maximising benefits of the employment-generation scheme. WB country director Xian Zhu told the workshop that it was necessary to ensure transparency for safety net programmes to prevent the problem of leakage. "World Bank is ready to help the government to introduce digital technology which can help to improve transparency." He also said bank was keen on providing more financial and technical support to expand social safety nets. Others at the workshop emphasised more transparent information sharing to make both implementers and beneficiaries fully aware of the selection criteria. The opening session of the workshop also heard from WB official Mansoora Rashid and food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman.
