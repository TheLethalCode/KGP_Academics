<TEXT>
 Bhola, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com) - A Bhola court has granted 10 days for police to grill British-based prime suspect in the Bhola arms haul case, Faisal Mostofa, along with his aide Saifuddin Badal. Rapid Action Battalion arrested the two on Monday from Pubail in Gazipur, handing them to Borhanuddin police on Tuesday morning. Judicial magistrate Aminul Islam granted the full 10 days sought by police, who produced them in the district court at 2:30pm, said recording officer Shahadat Hossain. RAB had been hunting Faisal, who allegedly finances the Green Crescent Madrasa and Orphanage in Borhanuddin, Bhola, since the elite anticrime force unearthed a huge cache of firearms, ammunition, bomb-making equipment and jihadi literature at the heavily secured compound on Mar 24. Madrasa teacher Russel (30) caretaker Hamid (30) Abul Kalam (32) and Jasim (35) were arrested during the raid. Police filed two separate cases under arms and explosive acts naming 11 people as accused in the case. The other accused included Mufti Mohiuddin, Humayun Ahmed, Hasan Saifuddin, Yunus Sharif and Mizanur Rahman. On Mar. 27, a Bhola court remanded Russel, Hamid, Kalam and Jasim into police custody for 10 days of interrogation. They gave up information about the UK-based Faisal, who reportedly heads the British charity Green Crescent that in turn runs the Bhola madrasa-cum-orphanage. bdnews24.com correspondent reported crowds of people thronging the Bhola district court as news spread that Faisal would appear on Tuesday. The two were shown arrested in both the arms haul cases, said Shahadat. The court officer, standing in for the investigation officer who was absent on the day, told the court it was a matter of urgency to question them in connection with the cases. Advocate Abdul Hamid, leading a team of eight lawyers for Faisal and Badal, said no arms or ammunition were recovered from them. Hamid said their inclusion in the cases was harassment. The charges against his clients were fabricated, he claimed. Police took the two into custody at 4:15pm. bdn
