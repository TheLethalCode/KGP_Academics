<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)The food minister apologised Tuesday for the anomalies in the VGF card distribution after media reports. "Some irregularities might have taken place because of the party affiliations of some people involved in card distribution," Abdur Razzak said. "A few ineligible persons may have been given the VGF cards just because they are party supporters. We have instructed the people concerned to look into such allegations." He however dismissed the allegations that substandard rice was being supplied against the Vulnerable Group Feeding cards. The quality of rice supplied was all right, he said and invited the media to enquire into the matter. He also declared cancellation of the 100-day programme introduced by the caretaker government to generate jobs in rural areas. "The remainder of that programme due to start in March-April stands cancelled." "We may see similar programme kicking off next year again. He added that Tk 900 crore from a total Tk 2,000 crore allocated for the 100-day programme was spent in the very first year. "We plan to implement a new project under the food security programme next year taking Tk 800 crore from the rest of the funds. The World Bank will provide financial and technical assistance in the new project, he added. About irregularities in programme implementation in the immediate past, Razzak said, "Well, it's not only the local government representatives, but government officials were also involved in the alleged corrupt practices." "Investigations have been ordered into the allegations and the culprits will be taken to task when found guilty." About the Boro season rice and wheat procurement from the local market, the minister said, "The government hasn't yet fixed the procurement rates. The Boro price is likely to be fixed in the second week of April." On not introducing the discussed OMS for the garment workers from the first week of this month, he said, "As we did not perceive the three million RMG workers asking for the OMS of foodgrains, the government hasn't quite been convinced that the sector needs such help." "So, we are waiting. "As the prices of essential commodities including rice and wheat have gone down, the RMG workers aren't craving for the OMS assistance," elaborated Razzak. "That's why the need for reviewing the OMS commodities has arisen. We'll soon take necessary measures." He said the OMS of foodgrains introduced on April 1 in 11 towns including the six divisional cities has not been able to draw huge consumers. bdne
