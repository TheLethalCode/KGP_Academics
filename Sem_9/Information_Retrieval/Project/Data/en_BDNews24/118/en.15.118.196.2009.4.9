<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP is set to launch countrywide demonstrations on Thursday with rallies in the capital's Naya Paltan party headquarters in the afternoon and in five divisional cities against the government's decision to cancel the lease on the cantonment house of Khaleda Zia in 1981. Protest rallies will be held in districts and upazilas across the country on Saturday. Office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com Thursday secretary-general Khandker Delwar Hossain returned from Singpaore Wednesday night and will join the protest rally slated for 3pm. The decision to stage demonstrations came from a meeting of BNP senior leaders chaired by Khaleda earlier on Wednesday. The government committed a heinous crime against humanity by cancelling the lease on the house given away to widow of martyred president Ziaur Rahman, the party spokesman said. 'Abnormal, vindictive' A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina earlier in the day, decided to cancel the lease on the 6 Moinul Road bungalow in Dhaka Cantonment that was given to Khaleda Zia after the May 30, 1981 murder of her husband, BNP 'founder' and army chief-turned-president Zia. Hasina argues that the house was allocated to Khaleda in violation of the Cantonment Board Law. But a senior BNP leader in an immediate reaction said the government's decision was "abnormal" and "vindictive". "It will create political instability in the country," Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP told reporters in an immediate reaction at his Mohakhali office. "The people will never accept such an irresponsible decision which has been taken from a politically vindictive stance." "It is not intelligible to me why the government is focusing on a martyr's family home when there are so many problems in the country, like power and employment to look at," said Chowdhury. It is the 'digital decision' of an 'abnormal' government, he added. "I believe the government has taken this decision to repay debts to certain quarters." Hasina had previously said the government would build apartments on the 2.72-acre plot and allocate two apartments to each family of army officers slain in the BDR mutiny, should the opposition leader return the house. Chowdhury said: "It is a condemnable decision. I don't think it will help at all to reduce instability in the army that was created by Peelkhana incident." "Has the government thought what the reaction may be among the army where Zia has a place in everyone's heart from soldiers to officers?" Similar arguments for Khaleda to surrender the house were made by Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, who originally offered the house to Khaleda after her husband was killed. "I think she (Khaleda) should leave the house for the sake of democracy," he told reporters in Rangpur earlier this month, after Hasina first made made the suggestion. On Ershad's comments, Chowdhury said Wednesday, "Who is he to say? All political parties, including BNP and Awami League, unanimously took the decision to allot the house to Khaleda during the second parliament." BNP joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said, "The present government has fulfilled the 1/11 instigators' unfulfilled task through this decision." "The government has shown vindictiveness by taking away the house that the countrymen gave to a martyr's family." Plot to 'wipe out' Khaleda, cries JCD The pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal has said the government's decision to cancel the lease on Khaleda's cantonment bungalow is an attempt at "political humiliation", with one JCD leader even claiming it to part of a plot to "wipe Khaleda out". JCD activists took out immediate demonstrations on Dhaka University campus as news of the cabinet decision spread earlier in the day. bdnews24.
