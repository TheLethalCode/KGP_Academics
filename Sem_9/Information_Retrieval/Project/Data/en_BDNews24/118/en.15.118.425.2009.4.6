<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Test and one-day captain Andrew Strauss has been left out of England's preliminary 30-man squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in June, which was announced at Lord's on Monday. England will host the tournament from June 5-21. England national selector Geoff Miller said in a statement: "Andrew Strauss had an outstanding tour of the West Indies during a difficult winter. Andrew and the selectors believe his game is better suited to test and ODI cricket and it is for that reason he has not been selected in the squad." "The selectors will name the England Twenty20 captain once a comprehensive review of the recently concluded West Indies tour has taken place." The 30-man squad, which will be trimmed to 15 on May 1, contains four players yet to be capped at international level - Joe Denly (Kent), Eoin Morgan (Middlesex), Graham Napier (Essex) and Adil Rashid (Yorkshire)
