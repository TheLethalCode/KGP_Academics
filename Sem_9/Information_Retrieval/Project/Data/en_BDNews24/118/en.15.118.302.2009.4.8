<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government's decision to cancel the lease on the cantonment house of opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is "abnormal" and "vindictive", said a senior BNP leader on Wednesday. "It will create political instability in the country," Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP told reporters in an immediate reaction at his Mohakhali office. "The people will never accept such an irresponsible decision which has been taken from a politically vindictive stance." A cabinet meeting, chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina earlier in the day, decided to cancel the lease on the 6 Moinul Road bungalow in Dhaka Cantonment was given to Khaleda Zia after the May 30, 1981 killing of her husband, army chief-turned-president Ziaur Rahman. The prime minister has said the house was allocated to Khaleda in violation of the Cantonment Board Law. "It is not intelligible to me why the government is focusing on a martyr's family home when there are so many problems in the country, like power and employment to look at," said Chowdhury. "It is the 'digital decision' of an abnormal government." "I believe the government has taken this decision to repay debts to certain quarters." Hasina had previously said the government would build apartments on the 2.72-acre land of Khaleda and allocate two apartments to each of the families of army officers slain in the BDR mutiny, should the opposition leader return the house. Chowdhury said: "It is a condemnable decision. I don't think it will help at all to reduce instability in the army that was created by Peelkhana incident." "Has the government thought what the reaction may be among the army where Zia has a place in everyone's heart from soldiers to officers?" Similar arguments for Khaleda to surrender the house were made by Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad, who originally offered the house to Khaleda after her husband was killed. "I think she (Khaleda) should leave the house for the sake of democracy," he told reporters in Rangpur earlier this month. "It is not right to run political activities in the cantonment. The cantonment is a restricted area," said Ershad, another army chief-turned-president. Ershad had said, "I would not have decided to allot the cantonment house to Khaleda Zia if I knew she would do politics there." On Ershad's comments, Chowdhury said Wednesday, "Who is he to say? All political parties, including BNP and Awami League, unanimously took the decision to allot the house to Khaleda during the second parliament." Blaming Ershad for the cabinet decision, he said, "Ershad's irresponsible comments encouraged the prime minister to take the decision." BNP Joint Secretary General Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said, "The present government has fulfilled the 1/11 instigators' task through this decision." "The government has shown vindictiveness by taking away the house that the countrymen gave to a martyr's family." BNP MP Asifa Ashrafi Papiya, former BNP MPs Ilyas Ali and Habibul Islam Habib were also present. b
