 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak has been drafted in the Bangladesh preliminary squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in June after serving a four-month ban for a suspected bowling action. The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Saturday named a 30-member preliminary squad with the inclusion of 10 uncapped players as well as old horses like Hannan Sarkar and Tareq Aziz Khan. Ziaur Rahman was also included in the Bangladesh squad for the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in South Africa two years ago, but the pacer did not play a single match. The other uncapped cricketers are Shamsur Rahman, Suhrawardi Shuvo, Shahagir Hossain, Marshall Ayub, Mohammad Mithun, Rony Talukder, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny and Robiul Islam. However, the 30-member squad will be reduced to 15-member and Bangladesh are scheduled to leave home on May 23. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam said Hannan Sarker has been rewarded with a preliminary squad place for his form in the domestic competitions. "Hannan played very good cricket in all domestic competitions in the last one year. His 138-strike rate in the Premier Twenty20 League really impressed us, so we picked him," said Alam adding that Hannan had a very good chance to make it into the final squad. Bangladesh were placed in the Group A along with defending champions India and ICC associate member Ireland. Bangladesh will begin their campaign against India on June 6, two days before facing Ireland. Preliminary squad: Mohammad Ashraful, Masrafee bin Murtaza, Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Roqibul Hassan, Sakib al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Imrul Kayes, Mahmudullah Riyad, Nazmul Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Rubel Hossain, Dollar Mahmud, Ziaur Rahman, Tarek Aziz Khan, Hannan Sarker, Shamsur Rahman, Sohrawardi Shuvo, Shahagir Hossain, Marshall Ayub, Mohammad Mithun, Rony Talukder, Nasir Hossain, Arafat Sunny and Robiul Islam. bd
