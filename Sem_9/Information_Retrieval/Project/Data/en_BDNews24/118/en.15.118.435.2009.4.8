"We have ended our agreement with Mr Vandereycken after discussions today," Nicolas Cornu told Reuters. Belgium suffered consecutive defeats by Bosnia-Herzegovina last week to leave them 11 points adrift of leaders Spain in Group 5 and five points behind second-placed Bosnia. Assistant coach Franky Vercauteren will take charge of the team until a new coach is found, the Belgian FA said. Vandereycken, a former Belgium international, took over as coach in January 2006 after the country missed out on the World Cup finals for the first time since 1978.

"We do not doubt the professionalism and effort of Vandereycken, but the results were not good enough," Belgian FA president Francois De Keersmaecker said in a statement.
