 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)  Conservationists have announced that some 6,000 rare Irrawaddy dolphins, living in the freshwater regions of Bangladesh's Sundarbans and adjacent Bay of Bengal waters, make up the largest population of these endangered sea mammals found in the wild. The Wildlife Conservation Societyrevealing the discovery earlier this week at the First International Conference on Marine Mammal Protected Areas in Mauisaid the largest known populations of Irrawaddy dolphins had previously numbered only in the low hundreds. "With all the news about freshwater environments and state of the oceans, WCS's discovery that a thriving population of Irrawaddy dolphins exists in Bangladesh gives us hope for protecting this and other endangered species and their important habitats," Dr. Steven Sanderson, president of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said on Tuesday. "WCS is committed to conservation of these iconic marine species from dolphins, sea turtles, sharks to the largest whales," he said. Authors of the study, undertaken in an area where little marine mammal research has taken place to date, include Brian Smith, Rubaiyat Mansur Mowgli, and Samantha Strindberg of the Wildlife Conservation Society, along with Benazir Ahmed of Chittagong University in Bangladesh. Despite finding this large population, the authors warn that the dolphins are becoming increasingly threatened by accidental entanglement in fishing nets. During the study, researchers say they found two dolphins that had become entangled and drowned in fishing nets - a common occurrence according to local fishermen. The Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, grows up to eight feet and lives in large rivers, estuaries, and freshwater lagoons in South and Southeast Asia. In Myanmar's Ayeyarwady River, these dolphins are known for "cooperative fishing" with humans, where the animals voluntarily herd schools of fish toward fishing boats and awaiting nets helping fishermen increase their catches. The dolphins appear to benefit from this relationship by easily preying on the cornered fish and those that fall out of the net as the fishermen pull it from the water. In 2006, WCS helped establish a protected area along the Ayeyarwady River to conserve this critically endangered mammal population. The New York-based WCS says it is now working closely with the Ministry of Environment and Forests in Bangladesh on plans for establishing a protected area network for both Irrawaddy and Ganges River dolphins in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Funding is critical to sustaining these activities along with WCS's long-term efforts to study the effects of climate change on this habitat, support sustainable fishing practices, and develop local ecotourism projects, says the conservation gr
