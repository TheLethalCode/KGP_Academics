<TEXT>
 LONDON, April 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas has recovered from the knee injury that kept him out for more than three months and should return to the squad at home to Manchester City on Saturday (1400), the club said on their website (www.arsenal.com). Leading scorer Robin van Persie is out with a groin strain picked up on international duty with Netherlands this week. Theo Walcott (knee), Emmanuel Adebayor (hamstring) and defender Mikael Silvestre (calf) are all fit again. Manchester City could be without striker Craig Bellamy who missed Wales's defeat by Germany on Wednesday with a knee injury while Robinho is a doubt after limping off during Brazil's 3-0 win over Peru. Liverpool, who will go top if they draw at Fulham on Saturday (1630), have a doubt over defender Sami Hyypia who injured a knee playing for Finland against Wales last Saturday. Leaders Manchester United face Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday (1500) without suspended trio Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes and Nemanja Vidic. United manager Alex Ferguson also has concerns over Dimitar Berbatov (ankle) and Brazilian Anderson (knee) although club captain Gary Neville could return after recovering from an ankle injury. Aston Villa, who have gone eight matches without a win in all competitions and slipped out of the Champions League places, are likely to be without striker Emile Heskey who injured his hamstring playing for England against Slovakia last week. Gabriel Agbonlahor, who received a late call-up by England for Wednesday's match against Ukraine, should return to the attack after being dropped for Villa's game at Liverpool two weeks ago
