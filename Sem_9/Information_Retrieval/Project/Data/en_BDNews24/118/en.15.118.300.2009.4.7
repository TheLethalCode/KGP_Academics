<TEXT>
 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com) - Nokia, the world's leading mobile manufacturer, is likely to help the Bangladesh Football Federation in its youth development programme. After a meeting with Nokia officials on Tuesday, BFF president Kazi Salahuddin said they had positive discussions about youth development as well as sponsorship of the national team, but nothing was finalised yet. Salahuddin said that the BFF sought a one-year partnership deal and hoped to sign it in a few days. "We have been trying for a long time and today (Tuesday) we had fruitful discussions with BFF officials. We showed our interest in youth development as well as the national team," Nawfel Anwar, Nokia's head of marketing, told bdnews24.com. Anwar said that they had intended to become a BFF youth development partner, by which the national team would be strengthened in future. He, however, said that nothing was yet to be finalised and the amount of money would depend on the terms and conditions of the commercial aspects. Nokia had been eager to hold talks with the BFF during the Citycell B. League, but federation high-ups kept them waiting till the Citycell Super Cup final, which saw an approximately 45,000 turnout. It was also understood that the BFF is not keen on having a long-term agreement with anyone considering the rising popularity of football and as such it might be valued higher in future. A source preferring not to be mentioned said that the agreement might be worth more than Tk one crore. Nokia had earlier sponsored the national team for the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers, SAFF Championship in Colombo, Merdeka Cup in Malaysia and Grand Royal Challenge Cup in Myanmar. bd
