 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)RAB says it arrested Faisal Mustafa, who allegedly channelled funds through a British charity to finance terror activities from Bhola-based Green Crescent Madrasa and Orphanage, and another man at Gazipur early Monday, 11 days after his family said he was arrested on Mar 26. RAB media wing director AK Azad told bdnews24.com, "At around 4 am, a RAB contingent detained [London-based NGO Green Crescent chief] Faisal Mustafa and Saifuddin Badal from Gazipur." Badal was reported to be an aide to Faisal. Later, at a media briefing at RAB headquarters in the afternoon RAB additional director general Col Rezanur Rahman Khan said no charges had been brought against Faisal and Badal. He said Russell Howladar, who was arrested at Green Crescent Madrasa on Mar 24, said Faisal owned the madrasa and Badal was Faisal's close associate Rab-8 and the intelligence wing of Rab jointly conducted an operation and arrested the two from Pubail, Col Rezanur added. Faisal's arrest in Dhaka was widely reported by the media on Mar 26. He was not named an accused in either of the two cases filed against four Bangladeshi employees of the madrasa, despite the fact that his UK-based charity Green Crescent funds the Bhola madrasa-cum-orphanage. RAB seized a massive cache of arms and ammunition on Mar 29 at the madrasa at Ram Keshobpur in Sachra union, Borhanuddin, some 20 kilometres from Bhola district headquarters and arrested four suspected militants who had been preparing for a major operation. The recovery included two pistols, two revolvers, four shotguns, eight magazines, two binoculars, two remote-control devices, 700 pistol and 200 shotgun bullets, 3000 splinters, six life jackets, 20 masks, two walkie-talkies and as many mobile phones. A number of Jihadi books were also seized. Eleven children, aged between 5 and 6 years, were at the madrasa, which was heavily secured, during the raid. A modern bridge that links a big pond to the madrasa remains closed at night. Locals had no idea what was happening inside, Major Mamun Ur Rashid Mamun who led the operations had said. Green Crescent constructed the madrasa-cum-orphanage on the 12 acre site four years ago. These started operations three months ago. Faisal who lives in London funds the institutions and oversees the operations, according to RAB. Finance minister AMA Muhith said on Mar 18 the government will examine NGO financing and activities and take strict measures against those found to be channelling funds to militants in Bangladesh. He said funding of militants came through many sources, through individuals and organisations. The minister mentioned "the large number of NGOs" approved during the past four-party alliance government by the then social welfare minister Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojaheed. The government would audit the accounts and activities of those NGOs meticulously, he added. 'Arrested earlier Faisal's father Golam Mostafa, who lives in the UK, told the BBC on Mar 27 he heard from people that his son along with an aide was arrested in Dhaka. "I'm not sure from where he was arrested or who arrested him, but I'm sure he was arrested," said Golam. Faisal was cleared as a terror suspect in 1996 and 2002 in British courts but spent 18 months in jail for possessing illegal firearm in the UK. Faisal's father-in-law, Shahidul Haq Naqib Chowdhury, who lives in Dhaka, told bdnews24.com he had no confirmation on whether Faisal had been taken away by authorities, or of his whereabouts. "One of Faisal's uncles told me that RAB had arrested him as he was going to Gazipur from Dhaka." But Shahidul said another relative told him he had been arrested him from Kalabagan in the city. Media reports gave similar conflicting accounts. One newspaper said Faisal was "understood to have been arrested at Dhaka airport." Almost none gave any official quote. The Times was one exception, quoting a junior RAB officer, Captain Shafiul Alam, as saying Faisal was detained along with a Bangladeshi "agent". The report did not say where. The British newspaper also said The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was still to confirm the arrest. bdn
