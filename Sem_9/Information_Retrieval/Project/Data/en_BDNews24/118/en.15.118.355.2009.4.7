 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)The first session of the ninth parliament was drawing to a close on Tuesday with prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia attending a full House. The ninth parliament has so far made history by forming all its parliamentary standing committees in the first session. None of the previous eight parliaments could form the parliamentary watchdogs on different ministries, to ensure parliamentary transparency and accountability, at the first session. In some cases, they took up to three years to form them. Hasina and Khaleda were scheduled to deliver thank you speeches Tuesday on president Iajuddin Ahmed's address in parliament on Jan 25. Khaleda's press secretary, told bdnews24.com the occasion marked only her third appearance in the House since that first sitting. Meanwhile, some 170 MPs belonging to the Awami League-led alliance have delivered their official thank-you speeches on the president's address, parliament officials said. The treasury bench spent 1,335 minutes (over 22 hours) for the speeches. Some 19 opposition MPs gave thanks on the address, taking 186 minutes (about three hours). The former president, however, received few "thanks" in actuality, as many MPs have bitterly criticised his controversial role before and after the 1/11 changeover. Up to Monday, the House has passed 30 bills, mainly with a view to validating the ordinances made by the previous interim government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. The House is expected to pass another bill on Tuesday on land acquisition for Padma bridge, according to the day's draft order. Speaker Abdul Hamid will read out an address of President Md Zillur Rahman before the 39-day session draws to a close. bdnews
