 ISLAMABAD, Mon Apr 6, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's prime minister summoned officials on Monday to work out ways to check a slide in security after a weekend of violence which is likely to top the agenda of talks with US envoy Richard Holbrooke. Pakistan is crucial to US efforts to stabilise neighbouring Afghanistan and frequent attacks by militants linked to al Qaeda and the Taliban across Pakistan are reviving Western concerns about the stability of its nuclear-armed ally. Holbrooke, special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, is due in Islamabad after talks in Kabul. He is travelling with Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and they are expected in India on Tuesday. In the lastest violence in Pakistan, 24 people were killed in a suicide bomb attack on a gathering of minority Shia Muslims on Sunday, a day after eight paramilitary soldiers were killed in a similar attack in the capital, Islamabad. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani called chief ministers and police chiefs of the country's four provinces, and intelligence chiefs for special security talks, an official said. Surging militant violence has raised fears for nuclear-armed Pakistan's prospects a year after a civilian government came to power ending eight years of military rule. President Asif Ali Zardari, the widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, and the coalition government are also struggling to revive an economy propped up by a $7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan. The political party that backed former president Pervez Musharraf called for an all-parties conference saying existing security systems had collapsed or failed. Despite such worries, stocks were firmer on Monday as investors looked for bargains and the rupee was flat, dealers said. PRESSURE ON MILITANTS US President Barack Obama has made the region a top foreign policy focus and has promised to send 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. Last month, he unveiled a strategy to turn the tide of militant violence with a new emphasis on Pakistan. Analysts said the recent rise in violence across Pakistan could be a response to the new US focus, including the reinforcements and a spate of attacks on militants by US drone aircraft in Pakistan. "The presence of additional US forces in Afghanistan is certainly to put more pressure on these militant groups and they would in turn escalate their activities," Tasneem Noorani, a former Interior Ministry secretary said. Mullen said on Sunday the extra troops being sent to Afghanistan would start to turn tide against the insurgency. The suicide bomb attack on minority Shia on Sunday in the central town of Chakwal was apparently aimed at stoking sectarian tension but that was unlikely to happen, analysts say. "There is general sectarian harmony in the country and I think, as in the past, this attack won't escalate the sectarian issue," Noorani said. Several thousand Shia mourners gathered for funerals on Moday shouting "Sunni and Shia are brothers" and "Down with the Taliban". India, which shares close ties with Kabul and competes with Pakistan for strategic space in Afghanistan, is seen as central to Obama's plans for a regional approach to the conflict. India has welcomed the US strategy but analysts said New Delhi may not be entirely happy with Holbrooke visiting India a second time in as many months. "Why is he coming to India so often at a time when elections are just round the corner and not much government business is being exchanged?" said Brahma Chellaney of the Centre of Policy R esearch, a New Delhi-based think-tank. "That is because he is trying to define his turf and re-hyph enate India and Pakistan." Analysts have said addressing Pakistan's fears about old rival India's involvement in Afghanistan and finding a solution to divided Kashmir, the main dispute between the nuclear-armed neighbours, would help Pakistan focus on its Afghan border. But India rules out third-party involvement in Kas
