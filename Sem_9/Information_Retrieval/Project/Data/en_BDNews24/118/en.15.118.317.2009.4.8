 BERLIN, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bayern Munich's Franck Ribery will stay on for at least another year despite speculation the Frenchman could move to another club at the end of the season, coach Juergen Klinsmann said on Wednesday. Ribery, who has a contract with the German champions until 2011, has been on the wish list of many major European clubs even before his 2007 move to Bayern. "For sure he will stay with us next year," Klinsmann told Sueddeutsche newpaper. "I cannot tell you more about this other than that I told him 'you are an exceptional player and you will define the year 2009.'" Klinsmann said that by staying on at Bayern, Ribery would also climb up the European Footballer of the Year rankings. He had been in 16th place in last year's vote. "My wish is that at the end of 2009 he will in the top three," Klinsmann said. Ribery has been inspirational for Bayern steering them to the domestic title and Cup double last season. He has been less impressive, however, in the league this season with Bayern in fourth place, three points off the top with eight matches left. Ribery has also said Bayern need to boost their roster next season to remain competitive in Europe. While the midfield supremo has said he could be tempted to play for another major European club, Bayern have insisted he is not for sale. "Bayern are obviously one of the biggest and best clubs in the world," he said late last year. "Obviously there are other clubs that would be a dream: Real Madrid and Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester United." "I certainly love Real Madrid because of the great tradition but I feel happy here at Bayern. We will have to wait and see what the future holds.
