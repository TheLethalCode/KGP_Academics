 NEW YORK, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  A man opened fire in a building where services are provided to immigrants in the New York town of Binghamton on Friday and ABC News said 13 people were killed. New York Governor David Paterson said 12 or 13 people were killed. "An individual went into an American civic services center .... and has killed 12 or 13 people," Paterson said. ABC News, citing federal and state authorities, said 26 others were wounded and that a number of people were still being held hostage. Other local media reported between four and 13 dead in the incident. Binghamton, about 150 miles northwest of New York City, has a population of about 45,000. Two men were taken from the scene in handcuffs, News 10 Now television reported. The area was surrounded by police with rifles, some carrying shields. A crowd gathered beyond the police line cheered when the two were taken away and placed in a police car, News 10 Now said. The two men taken away were Asian, Bob Joseph, the news director for WNBF radio, said in an interview with CNN. As many as 41 people were inside the building when a man entered and started shooting, WBNG television news said, citing police scanners. It said some fled to a basement and more than a dozen were hiding in a closet, adding that emergency dispatchers had been in contact with people inside. Four people were removed from the American Civic Association building on stretchers and taken to hospitals, the Press & Sun-Bulletin newspaper reported on its website. "About 15 or so employees of the Civic Association came out crying with their hands behind their heads and they were escorted by the police and they took them to ambulances and took them away," a witness told WNBF radio. "Quite a few people got out but I hear there's more (inside)," she said. The American Civic Association building is used to teach English and provide other services to recently immigrants to the United States who are preparing for U.S. citizenship. Authorities requested a Vietnamese translator to speak with the shooter, according to the witness interviewed by WNBF. A police special weapons and tactics team was on the scene and the shooter was still inside, the newspaper said, citing police. Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan, who was at the scene, said the shooter had a high-powered rifle, the Press & Sun-Bulletin said. The FBI in Albany was providing help including agents skilled in hostage negotiation to what it said was a "rapidly developing situation," the FBI said in Washington. Television coverage showed police armed with rifles, some carrying shields, deployed around the building. Police closed surrounding streets and locked down a high school, WBNG said. Bob Joseph, the news director for WNBF radio, said in an interview with CNN that his sources described the shooter as an Asian man in his 20s, and that the shooter may have blocked the rear entrance to the building with a parked car. Last month, a man killed 10 people, many of them family members, in a shooting rampage in Alabama. Mass shootings have become more frequent in recent years in the United States, where guns are widely available for purchase and the right to own weapons for self defense and hunting is defended by many. On April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech, a university in Blacksburg, Virginia, became the site of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U.S. history when a student gunman killed 32 people and himself.
