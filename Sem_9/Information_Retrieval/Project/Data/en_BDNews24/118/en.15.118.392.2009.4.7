 LONDON, Tue Apr 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Tamil protesters staged an overnight protest outside Britain's parliament on Tuesday calling for London's help in securing a ceasefire between Sri Lankan forces and Tamil Tiger separatists. Police marine units and lifeboats were on standby after two protesters jumped into the River Thames which runs through the heart of the British capital. Police said the men were quickly recovered and taken to hospital. Police arrested four people -- one for violent disorder -- after scuffles broke out when officers moved around 500 protesters off a major bridge and into Parliament Square, directly outside the Houses of Parliament in central London. "There are approximately 500 protesters remaining in Parliament Square. We have a contingency plan in place should numbers start to grow again," a police spokeswoman said. All roads in the area were now open and traffic was moving, she added. The protest began on Monday, when an estimated 3,000 people -- some of them bringing young children with them -- began to occupy Westminster Bridge and the road leading to it alongside parliament's clock tower, popularly known as Big Ben. Several hundred demonstrators stayed all night, blocking roads until police moved them in the early hours of Tuesday, and were vowing to continue their protest for as long as possible. "We want the British government to use their power as a member of the (United Nations) Security Council to bring about an internationally monitored ceasefire in Sri Lanka," protester Arjunan Ethirveerasingam, 26, told Reuters.

"The bombing should stop, the war should stop. People should start talking to each other," its spokesman Suren Surendiran told Reuters. The United Nations says tens of thousands of people are being held as human shields by the LTTE, and has urged the Sri Lankan military to protect them during a final offensive in the 17 sq km (7 sq mile) of coastal coconut groves. Palitha Kohona, permanent secretary at the Sri Lankan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told BBC radio the government could not stop the offensive until LTTE agreed to lay down arms. "The government wants to preserve the civilians, we want the civilians out, but the only decent thing that the LTTE can do now ... is to let the civilians go," he said. "The solution we have offered is very simple. LTTE must lay down its weapons, and then there will be no need to fire at anybody any m
