 PRAGUE, April 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Czech FA sacked national team coach Petr Rada on Wednesday after a string of poor results and also expelled six players for a breach of discipline after the World Cup qualifying loss at home to Slovakia last week. The FA said it had banned forwards Milan Baros, Martin Fenin and Vaclav Sverkos plus midfielders Radoslav Kovac and Marek Matejovsky and defender Tomas Ujfalusi from the national team. Rada last year replaced Karel Brueckner, who led Czech Republic to the Euro 2004 semi-finals. They are fourth in World Cup qualifying Group Three with eight points from six matches, trailing leaders Northern Ireland by five points with a game in hand. The Czechs lost 2-1 at home to Slovakia on April 1their first defeat by the former federation partner and a result that seriously dented their chances of reaching the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa
