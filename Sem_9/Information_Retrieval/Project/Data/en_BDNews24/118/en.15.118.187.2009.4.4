 Dhaka, April 4 (bdnews24.com)The Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner has directed his force to ensure proper running of the existing community policing service throughout the capital within two months. Commissioner Shahidul Haq told police chiefs of all metropolitan stations Saturday that enactment of a law was not enough. "The service must be properly implemented and managed under the organogram of the metropolitan police." City residents were already paying for the service, said the DMP chief. "Receiving such funds, the police have a duty to serve the community fully." Other top police officials at the meeting also stressed the need of a permanent organisational structure for community policing. They said running such a service was a complex task in the capital, compared to district headquarters, in terms of social environment and conditions. The DMP commissioner had earlier unveiled a book on community policing at the Police Telecom Auditorium in Rajarbagh.
