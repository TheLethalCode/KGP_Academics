 NEWCASTLE, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcastle United's temporary manager Alan Shearer said he needed to restore confidence among his players and stop them gifting goals to the opposition after Saturday's 2-0 defeat by Chelsea. Second-half strikes from Frank Lampard and Florent Malouda left 18th-placed Newcastle in deep trouble in the relegation zone, three points behind local rivals Sunderland in 17th.

Television replays suggested Michael Owen's late effort that was cleared may have already crossed Chelsea's line. Newcastle have not won a home game since December but Chelsea's own temporary manager Guus Hiddink said he had seen positive signs for Shearer.
