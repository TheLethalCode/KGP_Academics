 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Apr 5 (bdnews24.com)Despite the global recession, Bangladesh received $881.3 million in remittances in March this year, the highest ever for a single month, the central bank governor said Sunday. The March figure broke the record of $859 million earned in January, according to Bangladesh Bank numbers. February saw $784.5 million. "Our foreign reserves have crossed $6.03 billion dollar due to the rise in remittance," central bank chief Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com Sunday. "The global economic downturn is yet to cast its spell on remittance inflow. This is very positive for our economy," he said. The World Bank, IMF, ADB and local economists have all predicted a dip in remittances, one of the economy's main indices, in the face of the global crisis. The governor, however, is optimistic that remittances will maintain an upward curve in the remaining three months (Apr.-Jun.) of the current fiscal year According to central bank figures, the first nine months (July 2008-March 2009) has seen remittance earnings of $7 billion, a 34 percent jump over the same period of the previous fiscal year (2007-08). Total remittance in 2007-08 was $7.9 billion, and $6 billion in 2006-07. bdne
