 Dhaka, April 8 (bdnews24.com) - Basundhara Group is about to sign a three-year deal worth Tk 4.5 crore with the Bangladesh Football Federation to revive the district football leagues. "They are keen to sponsor all the district football leagues as a local company," BFF president Kazi Salahuddin told reporters at his office on Wednesday. The BFF boss said they would sign an agreement on April 12 that would be renewed annually as Basundhara would provide Tk 1.5 crore each year. He said they would distribute the money among the district football associations to run the local leagues smoothly, but it would depend on the activities of the respective DFA. "We will evaluate their performance before releasing funds," said Salahuddin adding that the expenditure of the DFAs would be closely monitored.
