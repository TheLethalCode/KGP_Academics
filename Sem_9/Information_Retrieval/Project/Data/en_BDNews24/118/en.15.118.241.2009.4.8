 News Delhi, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The following is a snapshot of recent developments in India's general election campaign. (The sources are mentioned in brackets). A Sikh journalist threw a shoe at India's home minister during a news conference after getting angry with the minister's reply to a question about 1984 riots in which hundreds of Sikhs were killed. The reporter took off one shoe and threw it after the minister began answering a question about a federal investigation into two leaders from the minister's Congress party accused of leading rioters against Sikhs. -"If the shoe-hurling episode that Union home minister P Chidambaram was subjected to on Tuesday is any indicator of the anger within the Sikh community...it may cost the party dear in Punjab and Delhi." (The Economic Times) Police have filed a case against India's federal railway minister Lalu Prasad, in connection with a speech against a scion of India's powerful Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. In his home state of Bihar, Prasad told an election rally he wanted to run a roller over Varun Gandhi because of an alleged inflammatory speech he made against Muslims. Gandhi is a member of the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). (All newspapers) Amar Singh, a general secretary of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP), hinted he would quit over a feud with a party rival. The SP is a Congress ally that propped up India's ruling coalition after the Left walked out last year. (All newspapers) Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray has said he will not attend any election rallies because of his poor health and that his son Uddhav would head the party in the future. Thackeray, a key alliance partner of BJP in the state, also said he supported Varun Gandhi's alleged comments against Muslims. (Indian Express)
