 Jakarta, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong earthquake struck north of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, although there was no tsunami warning issued or immediate reports of damage or casualties, the country's meteorological agency said on Saturday. The quake measured 6.5 on the Richter scale and was at a depth of 10 km (6 miles) with the epicentre 117 km (65 miles) northeast of Melonguane in the Talaud islands, the agency said. Indonesia suffers frequent earthquakes, lying in an area of intense seismic activity straddling a number of tectonic plates.
