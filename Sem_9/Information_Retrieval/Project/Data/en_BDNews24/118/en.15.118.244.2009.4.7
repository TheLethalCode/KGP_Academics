 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)  The government will no more keep confidential annual evaluation of work of civil servants to ensure transparency, a secretary said Tuesday. The establishment ministry has already started an experimental project, secretary Iqbal Mahmud told reporters at the Secretariat. "The annual confidential report system lacks transparency. If a new system is introduced the evaluation of competence of the civil servants will be more transparent," he said. The public servants will be set annual targets, Mahmud said. The evaluation paper will be prepared in consultation with the concerned employee, leaving no room for confidentiality, the secretary added. bdnews24
