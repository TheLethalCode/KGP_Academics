 Dhaka, Apr 4 (bdnews24.com)  At least 12 people were injured Saturday as two groups of Bangladesh Chhatra League clashed at Jagannath University. "We want peace on the campus. I have asked police not to spare those responsible at any cost," vice chancellor Mesbah Uddin told bdnews24.com. The violence sparked off at around 11:30am in front of arts faculty between activists led by JagU's BCL unit president and supporters of the unit's general secretary. Kotwali police rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control. "We are trying to keep things calm," said Kotwali police chief Salauddin Ahmed. Additional police have been deployed on campus, he said. President of the JagU BCL unit, 'Kamrul', told bdnews24.com a group of activists had "instigated the incident" for their interests. General secretary Gazi Abu Sayeed declined to comment as he was not present during the clash. The injured, all of whom were involved in the clashes, were admitted to a local clinic. 'Stern warnings' JagU's BCL unit, among other university units, has already faced several stern warnings from central BCL leaders. Units of the ruling party-backed student organisation have been involved in factional clashes at campuses countrywide since January, when Awami League came to power. JU clashes continue Jahangirnagar University saw another bout of violence on Friday as BCL activists wielding machetes, hockey sticks and other lethal weapons in factional clashes that left at least 10 persons injured and some eight dormitory rooms vandalised. Central leaders were forced to dissolve BCL's JU unit on Feb 17 after recurrent clashes over control of residential halls. But factional clashes have continued on the campus. "No BCL leader was involved in the incident. It was only juniors settling their personal scores," Mahmud Naser Johnnie, general secretary of the dissolved unit, told bdnews24.com on Friday. bdnews
