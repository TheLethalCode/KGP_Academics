<TITLE> 2 boxing coaches almost get physical at BKSP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Two boxing coaches almost got into a scuffle over the training schedule of the camp for the upcoming South Asian Games at BKSP on Tuesday. It was learned that a BKSP and NSC coach first exchanged heated words defending their respective training schedules. But the argument soon escalated into a physical confrontation before the pair had to be restrained by BKSP staff. As many as 33 boxers have been training under the supervision of four coaches at the sports institute for the SA Games to be held in Bangladesh in early 2010. "We are aware of the incident and we will visit the BKSP on Wednesday," Bangladesh Olympic Association vice-president and training committee chairman Mizanur Rahman Manu told bdnews24.com. Manu said, "We came to know that two coach argued over the training schedules and we will keep one of them whom the federation wants so that the camp runs smoothly." The BOA vice-president hinted that they might shift the boxing camp to the NSC dormitory from the BKSP if needed. He also said that they intended to hire a foreign coach from Cuba or Korea by June. Manu, however, didn't think that the incident would hamper the boxers' training. bd
