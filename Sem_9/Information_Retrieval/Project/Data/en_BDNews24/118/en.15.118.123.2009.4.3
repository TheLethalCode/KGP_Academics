<TEXT>
 Starsbourg, France, April 03 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama was mobbed by cheering crowds after arriving in France Friday for a NATO summit, where he hopes to secure backing for his new strategy over Afghanistan. Obama helped broker a deal at a G20 summit in London on Thursday to tackle the global financial crisis and will be hoping for a similarly broad accord at the two-day NATO summit on how to turn the tide against the worsening Afghan crisis. "He will talk about a strong partnership with Europe, but in that partnership there have to be mutual responsibilities," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters traveling with the U.S. president from Britain to France. "We have to understand there are real threats out there in the world." Obama was cheered by well-wishers squashed behind security barriers when he arrived in the city of Strasbourg, receiving a kiss from a woman in the crowd as he headed for talks with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. The U.S. leader unveiled a new Afghan strategy last week that aims to get a grip on rising violence by Taliban militants driven from power in 2001 but never completely defeated. It broadens the focus to include Pakistan and puts the highest priority on the defeat of al Qaeda militants who Obama says are plotting new attacks on the United States. Having already announced plans to add 17,000 U.S. combat troops to the 38,000 already there, Obama said he would send 4,000 more to help train Afghan officials to combat problems such as the booming narcotics trade and government corruption. The NATO mission has been criticized for disorganization but European leaders have been reluctant to commit more forces to a war that is increasingly unpopular with voters. Obama will use a U.S.-style town hall meeting with French and German youths in Strasbourg later Friday to appeal directly to the European public for support for the Afghan mission, the White House said. POLICE FEAR VIOLENCE Obama will also put Afghanistan high on his agenda in talks with Sarkozy and later with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The NATO summit, co-hosted by Germany and France, starts with a dinner in the evening across the border in Baden Baden. Anti-NATO demonstrators have vowed to disrupt the summit and riot police clashed with hundreds of protesters Thursday in Strasbourg, repeatedly firing tear gas and rubber bullets and arresting around 300 youths. Obama has said countries that felt unable to commit more military forces to Afghanistan should at least boost help for the civilian effort. NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer has called on other allies to send up to 4,000 more troops to safeguard August elections. He also wants them to make up a shortfall in training teams for the Afghan army and police force. Obama's national security adviser, Jim Jones, said U.S. allies were signaling better cooperation on military matters, especially concerning security for the election and he expected additional troop contributions. He told reporters on a conference call with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that there was a new mood in NATO that "we're all in this together, and we'll wait and see exactly how far that takes us." The summit marks NATO's 60th anniversary and its venue straddling the frontier of former foes France and Germany will be packed with symbolism aimed at celebrating an alliance originally created to defend Europe's borders. Leaders will usher in new members Albania and Croatia and also look at ways to rebuild ties with Russia, whose help it sees as vital in a host of global security issues. De Hoop Scheffer is due to stand down in July and NATO had wanted to name his successor at the summit, but efforts to identify a candidate have run into Muslim sensibilities. Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen is the frontrunner, but Turkey is unhappy with his handling of a 2006 row over cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that caused riots in the Muslim world. "I take a negative view (on Rasmussen's candidacy)," Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said in London.
