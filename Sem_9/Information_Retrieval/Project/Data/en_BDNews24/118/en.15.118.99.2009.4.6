 ANKARA, April 06 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President Barack Obama told Turkey's largely Muslim but secular democracy on Monday the United States was not at war with Islam and that it wanted to reinvigorate efforts toward creating a Palestinian state. Obama reiterated the US position after the new Israeli foreign minister said last week Israel was not bound by a U.S.-backed deal to start talks on establishing a Palestinian state. "Let me be clear: the United States strongly supports the goal of two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace and security," he said in a speech to Turkey's parliament. Chief Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat welcomed Obama's words, saying he had made a major commitment to the two-state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel was committed to reach peace and would cooperate with the Obama administration to achieve that goal. Obama is on the last leg of his debut trip on the world stage as president. Turkey is also his first to a Muslim country as president, a visit closely watched in the Islamic world. He is trying to rebuild ties with Muslims after anger at the invasion of Iraq and war in Afghanistan, made more urgent by a resurgent al Qaeda and Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. "Let me say this as clearly as I can: the United States is not at war with Islam. In fact, our partnership with the Muslim world is critical in rolling back a fringe ideology that people of all faiths reject," Obama said. "But I also want to be clear that America's relationship with the Muslim world cannot and will not be based on opposition to al Qaeda. Far from it. We seek broad engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect. We will listen carefully, bridge misunderstanding, and seek common ground." Turkey is a major transit route for U.S. troops and equipment destined for Iraq as well as Afghanistan. As the United States reduces its troops in Iraq, Incirlik air force base is expected to play a key role and Obama discussed this with Turkish leaders. TURKISH INFLUENCE Obama's visit is also a nod to Turkey's regional reach, economic power, diplomatic contacts and status as a secular democracy seeking European Union membership that has accommodated political Islam. "Given Turkish activity and credibility in the wider region stretching from Afghanistan to the Middle East, passing over energy transit routes, Obama wants to give new blood to a real strategic partnership with Turkey," said Cengiz Candar, a leading Turkish commentator and Middle East expert. The U.S.-Turkish relationship suffered in 2003 when Ankara opposed the invasion of Iraq and refused to let U.S. troops deploy on its territory. Turkey has also criticized Washington for allowing Kurdish separatists to be based in northern Iraq. Obama offered to improve cooperation in the fight against PKK separatist rebels and backed Turkey's troubled EU bid. "Turkey's greatness lies in your ability to be at the center of things. This is not where East and West divide, it is where they come together," Obama said. "It is a member of NATO and it is also a majority Muslim nation, unique in that position and as a consequence has insights into a whole host of regional and strategic challenges we may face," he added. Turkey was not the venue for Obama's promised major speech in a Muslim capital, but his two-day visit will still be a way to emphasize his message of goodwill to Muslims. "The United States has been enriched by Muslim Americans. Many other Americans have Muslims in their family, or have lived in a Muslim-majority country I know, because I am one of them," Obama said in his speech to parliament. Obama also called Iran a "great civilization" and said he sought engagement with the Islamic Republic. But he added: "Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a weapon or build a better future for their people." ARMENIA Obama stood by his views on mass killings of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915, but said he expected a breakthrough in talks between Turkey and Armenia. "My views are on the record and I have not changed those views," he said, without mentioning the word "genocide." Ankara and Yerevan are engaged in negotiations aimed at restoring full diplomatic ties after nearly a century of hostilities, and may be on the point of reopening their border. "I want to be as encouraging as possible around those negotiations which are moving forward and could bear fruit very quickly, very soon, so as a consequence what I want to do is not focus on my views right now," Obama said, seeking to strike a balance over the issue while adding pressure on the talks. Turkey accepts that many Christian Armenians were killed by Ottoman Turks during World War One but denies that up to 1.5 million died as a result of systematic genocide.
