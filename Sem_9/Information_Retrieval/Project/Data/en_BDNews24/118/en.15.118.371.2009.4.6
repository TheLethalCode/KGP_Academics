<TITLE> BDR chief says reform delay may cost the country </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 6 (bdnews24.com)Delay in reorganising the BDR after the bloody mutiny at the border guards' headquarters might cost the country, its chief and head of the paramilitary force's reorganisation sub-committee Maj Gen Mainul Islam Monday. "The sooner we finish with the reorganisation the better it is for the country because the mistrust that had caused all the troubles had better be dispelled as early as possible," he told reporters after a meeting with home minister Sahara Khatun. He briefed the minister on his recent New Delhi tour where he had meetings with India's border Security Force, and the status of the reorganisation process. The sub-committee is culling the opinions of the BDR members about the reorganisation, which will all be collated in recommendations, Gen Mainul added. "Soon we'll be done with gathering opinions and feedbacks. We'll then formulate our recommendations based on the information gathered and place them before the government for approval," the BDR chief said. Asked when the sub-committee would be presenting the recommendations, he said, "Soon." "Changing the force's name, uniform are only part of the reorganisation." Questioned why the army officers deputed to BDR were not wearing the BDR uniform, the general said, "It doesn't matter. I'll explain it later if people get really curious about it." The BDR chief himself was donning army uniform as he was speaking to the media. Asked if any steps were being taken about the absconding BDR members, Gen Mainul said, "We'll be sending their complete lists to the police stations within a day or two." "Once that's done, arresting the runaways will not be a very challenging job." He said there had been much headway in accounting for the looted and lost arms and ammunition. bdnew
