<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India were on the verge of claiming their first series victory in New Zealand in 41 years as the hosts lurched to 167 for four at the close of play on the fourth day of the third and final test on Monday. Bad light forced the abandonment of play with 21 overs still to be bowled. Play had begun 30 minutes early after bad light forced players off with 8.1 overs remaining on Sunday. Already 1-0 up in the series, India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni declared their second innings closed on 434 for seven after 75 minutes play in the first session and set the hosts an improbable 617 to win the match at the Basin Reserve. Ross Taylor was 69 not out at stumps while James Franklin was on 26 for New Zealand, though it appears only predicted bad weather for the final day on Tuesday will prevent India from wrapping up the match and sealing a 2-0 series victory. Earlier in the day, India's Rahul Dravid had broken the world record for catches by a fielder when he snared Tim McIntosh for four at third slip to take him to 182 catches, moving him past the 181 he had shared with Australia's Mark Waugh. Dravid added his 183rd catch in the afternoon session when he snapped up Jesse Ryder for a duck off Harbhajan Singh, who had also trapped Martin Guptill in front for 49 two balls earlier. TAYLOR RECALLED New Zealand could have been in deeper trouble at stumps had Taylor not been recalled after being given out while on nine. After capturing the wicket of Daniel Flynn (10) after lunch, India thought they had dismissed Taylor when he was given out by umpire Simon Taufel following a catch in close by Gautam Gambhir off Harbhajan, reducing the hosts to 65 for three. After consultation with square-leg umpire Daryl Harper, however, Taufel referred the decision to third umpire Tony Hill, with a perplexed Taylor half way between the wicket and boundary. Television replays showed there was doubt as to whether Gambhir had closed his fingers around the ball before it touched the ground and Taylor was recalled. Harbhajan, however, quickly reduced the hosts to 84 for four when he trapped Guptill then snared Ryder two balls later. Dravid had claimed the world record when he snapped up McIntosh off Zaheer Khan before lunch. The visitors had resumed on 349 for five with Yuvraj Singh on 15 and Dhoni on 16 before New Zealand fast-medium bowler Chris Martin took two wickets in one over. Martin had Yuvraj, who had earlier smashed Iain O'Brien for three boundaries and a six in successive balls, caught by Taylor at first slip for 40, then dismissed Harbhajan three balls later. Harbhajan was caught at fine leg by Tim Southee, who bobbled the ball twice before grasping it with his fingertips. Gambhir top-scored with 167, while Vangipurappu Laxman (61) and Dravid (60) also scored half centuries for the visitors, who won the first match in Hamilton by 10 wick
