<TITLE> New Zealand not counting on rain to save them - McCullum </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, April 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand would not be counting on the possibility of poor weather on Tuesday to save them from a heavy third test defeat and series loss to India, vice-captain Brendon McCullum said on Monday. The hosts, down 1-0 in the best of three series, require another 450 runs on the final day to win the match and prevent India winning their first series in New Zealand since 1968. Chasing an improbable 617 to win, they will resume on the fifth day on 167 for four with Ross Taylor 69 not out and James Franklin with him on 26. While winning is a virtual impossibility, rain and gale force winds are forecast to sweep across Wellington on Tuesday, and with light now fading quickly at the end of the day, it is highly unlikely a full complement of overs will be bowled, which could halt India's push for victory. "You can't pray for rain or you can't expect rain to get you out of a sticky situation," McCullum told reporters. "I think for us if we find ourselves waking up in the morning with a big blue (sky) overhead then we've got a fight on our hands. "Obviously we haven't found ourselves in the ideal situation but tomorrow's an opportunity for guys to stand up and show some character. Strangely, India chose to continue to bat on Monday, despite holding a 531-run lead, and they eventually declared at 434 for seven after 75 minutes of play, with their lead 616. All-rounder Yuvraj Singh said it was always their plan to set a target in excess off 600. "We heard it's going to rain (tomorrow) so we wanted to get 600 runs on the board and declare quickly so we could have enough overs to bowl at New Zealand," Yuvraj said. "Rain is always predicted, sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn't. Fingers crossed we should get enough overs tomorrow.
