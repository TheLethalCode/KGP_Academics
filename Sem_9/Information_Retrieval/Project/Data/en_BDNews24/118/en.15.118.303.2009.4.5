<TEXT>
 CENTURION, April 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa crushed Australia by seven wickets to level the five-match one-day international series at 1-1 on Sunday. Australia's comprehensive defeat stemmed from a poor batting display with 19-year-old left-arm swing bowler Wayne Parnell claiming career-best figures to help bundle the touring side out for just 131. Parnell, playing his second one-dayer for his country, took four for 25 in eight overs and fast bowler Dale Steyn's claimed four for 27, setting up South Africa's victory with more than 20 overs to spare. Graeme Smith (40) and Jacques Kallis (31) posted a run-a-ball second-wicket stand of 69 and it was left to AB de Villiers to steer the hosts to their target with an unbeaten 36. Callum Ferguson top-scored for Australia with 50, he and Mitchell Johnson (30) bringing respectability to the visitors' total with a seventh-wicket stand of 63 after they had slumped to 40 for six. Australia captain Ricky Ponting failed to take the batting powerplay during the Ferguson/Johnson stand and the touring side were all out before he could utilise it. TOP ORDER Ponting had earlier won the toss for the seventh successive time against Smith and elected to bat but Parnell and Steyn roared through the top order. Steyn struck at the end of the first over when Brad Haddin's hesitant drive caused the ball to deflect into his own stumps. Parnell then had Ponting caught behind for eight in his second over and trapped Michael Clarke lbw for five. The Australia innings continued to unravel as David Hussey (1) edged an ambitious slash off Steyn to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher and Michael Hussey (3) was deceived by a slower away-swinger from Parnell and trapped lbw as the visitors slumped to 19 for five. Ferguson's half-century, off 83 balls with three fours, pulled Australia out of the mire but once Johnson was trapped lbw by off-spinner Johan Botha and Ferguson was caught off a lifter from Steyn, the innings soon ended with 58 balls left. The teams meet in the third one-day international in Cape Town on Thurs
