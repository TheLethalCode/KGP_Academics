 Dhaka, Apr 8 (bdnews24.com)Allegations of favouritism and nepotism in appointing a record number of 306 law officerspublic prosecutors and government pleadersto Dhaka judge's court have surfaced. The lawyers have been posted to the Dhaka District Sessions Judge's Court, Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, the speedy trial tribunal and women and children repression prevention tribunal. The Dhaka district public prosecutor has not yet been appointed. All these appointments have allegedly been influenced by a state minister and a public prosecutor. To hear at least 100 of the district and metropolitan court lawyers, experienced in handling criminal and civil litigations, tell it, the newly-appointed law officers are simply going to muddle up cases because of their inexperience and vulnerabilities. For example, advocate Syed Ahmed Gazi, a senior lawyer, told bdnews24.com that the juniors who had been formerly attached to the law chambers of incumbent home minister Sahara Khatun, state minister Qamrul Islam and the Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court PP Abdullah Abu have now been appointed government law officers through nepotism. These recent appointees have never been seen conducting any case trial and none possesses more than two years' experience, said advocates Abul Kalam Azad and Manjur Alam Manju. Such huge numbers of appointments will only deplete the state coffers and the government will be losing in both civil and criminal cases, the senior lawyers observed. Advocate Mashiur Malek said appointing the juniors of ministers will only jeopardise the government's performance, as no lawyer possessing less than five years' court experience should be recruited as a government lawyer Belal Hossain, former assistant public prosecutor of Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court, told bdnews24.com that the BNP-led coalition government had appointed only five additional PPs to the court, whereas the AL-led government has already hired 13. The BNP government had recruited two PPs to Dhaka District and Sessions Judge's Court, whereas the AL government has appointed 19. Besides, 200 assistant PPs have been appointed to the same courts. Nineteen special PPs have been posted to the four speedy trial and five women and child repression prevention tribunals, a letter issued by the office of deputy solicitor of justice ministry said. Also, 52 including Dhaka Bar Association's former president Fakir Delwar Hossain have been appointed as additional GP and AGPs. Appointments of a further 200 APPs are being actively considered. The total number of PPs, additional PPs and APPs in service during the BNP-led coalition's rule was over 200 and a little over 100 during the caretaker government's rule. bdnews24.
