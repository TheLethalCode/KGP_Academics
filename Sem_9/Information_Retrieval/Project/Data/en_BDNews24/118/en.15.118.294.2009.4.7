<TITLE> Chavez backs Obama's conflict-free call </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Apr 7 (bdnew3s24.com/Reuters) - Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez supported on Tuesday a call by U.S. President Barack Obama for a conflict-free 21st century, but added that the United States should apologize to Japan for the atomic bombs it dropped at the end of World War Two. "Obama said about 48 hours ago that the 20th century was a century of conflicts, and that the new century should be one of peace. That was a good statement," Chavez told a news conference in Japan, in the latest conciliatory statement ahead of an Americas Summit next week. Chavez, who has said he wanted to "reset" relations with Washington after nearly a decade of tension, took a cautious stance on North Korea's weekend rocket test, calling for patience and caution. Japan is ambivalent about atomic weapons, being the only country to have suffered nuclear attacks, but at the same time benefiting from the protection of the nuclear-armed United States.
