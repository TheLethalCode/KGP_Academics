<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 7 (bdnews24.com)Leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia on Tuesday once again voiced strong criticism of Sheikh Hasina's handling of the BDR mutiny and questioned whether the prime minister should remain in charge of the defence ministry. Khaleda, on the closing day of the first session of the ninth parliament, also came down hard on the prime minister and the ruling Awami League for the recent "bloodshed" caused by the pro-AL Bangladesh Chhatra League on campuses countrywide. In a 100-minute address, Khaleda said the Feb 25-26 massacre at the BDR headquarters was an "undeclared war against Bangladesh" and those who perpetrated, planned and instigated the killings were "the enemies of the country". She demanded stern actions against them, otherwise such attacks on the nation would be persistent. Khaleda said the probe committee into the mutiny incident has been "tied-up with limitations in terms of reference and appointment of controversial persons". Criticising Hasina's handling of the first day of the mutiny, she said, "We think the prime minister failed to protect the life of army officers." She said the slain officers could have been saved if a military operation was carried out. "Questions have been raised whether she should remain in charge of the defence ministry." BCL 'bloodshed' "[The Awami League] came to power on pledges of bringing back peace and law and order in the country, but blood is being shed on the campuses," Khaleda said of the recent factional clashes of the student front. "Their loyal student body has become desperate to occupy educational institutions and establish supremacy in halls." Khaleda highlighted the successes of her past coalition government criticising the immediate past caretaker government and the incumbent AL government. The leader of the opposition was speaking ahead of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who too later had hard words for the opposition leader. Khaleda, who attended parliament only three times during the just-ending 39-day session, asked the government to make parliament more effective "for the sake of democracy". "We want to cooperate with the government, not just criticise. We want to put forward suggestions for the sake of the nation." On the Jan. 11 2006 'changeover', Khaleda said the army was not involved in violating the constitution or delaying the election as emergency was declared. "As a member of an army family, I would like to say country's patriotic armed forces were not involved with these misdeeds, except for a few ambitious individuals who tarnished the image of the army." Khaleda termed the government's decision to give legitimacy to the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led caretaker government under a state of emergency, "illegal and unconstitutional". "The Fakhruddin administration brought the country near to chaos." "The decision to give it legitimacy was a mistake." Khaleda also criticised former president Iajuddin Ahmed for appointing himself caretaker head and for his decree of emergency on 1/11. She said both Iajuddin and Fakhruddin should be tried for "despoiling Bangladesh's image abroad" over the past two years, by portraying the country and its leaders as corrupt to the international community. No thanks to Iajuddin The BNP chairperson, under whose past tenure Iajuddin was elected president, accused him of "exiling democracy" and violating the constitution. "He sent democracy into exile. This parliament cannot thank him," said Khaleda, referring to the formality of 'thanks-giving' for Iajuddin's Jan 25 inaugural address as the ninth parliament convened. "We elected Iajuddin Ahmed as president. We respected him as a citizen. He had a role in the anti-autocracy movement," said the former prime minister. "We expected that he would respect his oath of office," she said. "But when he had full authority (of the state), he could neither protect the constitution nor his oath of office," she said of the president under whose term the country saw an unprecedented two-year caretaker administration and emergency rule. Her address also touched on the AL government's actions since coming to power, economic conditions, prices of essentials, corruption and the law and order situation. The leader of the opposition attended the Jan 25 inaugural sitting of the ninth parliament. She appeared again on Mar 1 to condole the deaths of the army officers killed in the BDR mutiny. Tuesday marked her third appearance. First JS session draws to a close The ninth parliament, whose first session drew to a close on Tuesday with a full House, has so far made history by forming all its standing committees in the first session. None of the previous eight parliaments could form the parliamentary watchdogs on different ministries, to ensure parliamentary transparency and accountability, at the first session. In some cases, they took up to three years. Up to Tuesday, the House had passed 32 bills, mainly with a view to validating the ordinances of the caretaker government. bdnews24
