 Dhaka, April 7 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP staged a walkout Tuesday, the last day of the first session of the ninth parliament, protesting the government's decision to name an opposition MP for a standing committee without BNP's consent. They walked out around 9.38pm as the treasury bench rejected their demand to change the nomination of Andaliv Rahman, an MP of BNP's ally Bangladesh Jatiya Party, to the parliamentary standing committee on the home ministry. As the speaker gave floor to chief whip Abdus Shahid to read out the names of the committee, opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque objected saying Andaliv's name was included in the standing committee without the opposition's consent. The House was adjourned for the session on their walkout. bdnews
