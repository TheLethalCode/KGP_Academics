On the concluding day, Sports Minister Ahad Ali Sarker was present as the chief guest while Grameenphone deputy CEO and chief financial officer Arif Al Islam and Special Olympics Bangladesh's vice-chairman advocate Lutful Hye also attended. The sports minister said that they had to create more and more avenues for persons with disabilities and that they had to help them to stand on their feet, become self-sufficient and earn social respect. Islam said that Grameenphone's investment strategies were thought through beyond mere balance-sheets to act as a catalyst for prosperity and innovation that could spur economic growth for the country. Under the guidance of specially trained coaches, some 161 athletes and officials from nine special schools and other organisations participated seven disciplines  swimming, athletics, badminton, bocce, football, table tennis and cricket.
