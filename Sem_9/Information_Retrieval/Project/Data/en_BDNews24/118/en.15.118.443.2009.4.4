 KHARTOUM, April 04 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The new U.S. special envoy to Sudan said on Saturday the country's Darfur region was on the brink of a deeper humanitarian crisis and would need new aid groups to replace those expelled by the Khartoum government. Speaking to reporters from north Darfur, envoy Scott Gration said he had just visited Zamzam refugee camp in Darfur, and warned that water there could run out in a matter of weeks. "We are on the brink of a deeper crisis in Darfur," Gration said. "We have to come up with solutions on the ground in the next few weeks... we have to increase the capacity and number of aid agencies that are able to move aid assistance from the warehouses to the distribution points and then to the hands and mouths of the people in these camps." President Omar Hassan al-Bashir expelled 13 foreign aid organizations and closed three local groups in March, accusing them of helping the International Criminal Court issue an arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Darfur, in western Sudan. The groups deny working with the court. It is Gration's first visit since Obama named the retired Air Force general last month as special envoy to war-ravaged Sudan, picking a close adviser with broad experience in the region to lead U.S. efforts on the worsening humanitarian situation in Darfur. International experts say at least 200,000 people have died and more than 2.7 million have been driven from their homes in almost six years of ethnic and politically driven fighting in Darfur. Khartoum says 10,000 people have died. Gration's predecessor Richard Williamson, appointed by former president George W. Bush, had stormy relations with Sudan and suspended talks on normalizing relations last year, saying northern and southern Sudanese leaders were not serious about reconciliation after a decades-long civil war.
