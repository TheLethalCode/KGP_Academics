<TITLE> Govt will probe 'controversial' ACC actions: Faruq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 3 (bdnews24.com)A day after the Anticorruption Commission chairman resigned, the government says it will take measures against the 'contentious actions' of the commission over the last two years. The commission's activities have given rise to questions not only among the ruling party MPs, but also the opposition MPs, politicians, businessmen and the masses, commerce minister Faruq Khan said Friday. "The anti-graft body will also be made more functional, as the government is determined to prevent corruption," he told reporters after attending a reception to the university freshers accorded by a coaching centre in the capital. Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury stepped down as the corruption watchdog chairman without citing proper reasons after months of an uneasy relation with the Awami League-led government since it came to power through Dec. 29 general elections. Faruq said, "He [Chowdhury] has resigned on personal grounds and he has the right." "I think you all know the situation now prevailing; there's no need for me to explain it," the former army chief told had reporters after he stood down. Chowdhury was appointed on Feb 22, 2007 by the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led army-installed caretaker government. He led the anti-graft body in its drive against top political figures, including AL president and prime minister Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, businessmen and civil servants. In the opening session of the ninth parliament, Hasina on Feb. 4 told parliament that the ACC should be "reconstituted" to ensure its own accountability, giving rise to widespread buzz that it might be a resignation call for the ACC chief. Faruq also talked about the late Feb. BDR mutiny and the violent politics of the AL-backed student front Bangladesh Chhatra League. Faruq is the coordinator of post-mutiny probes. "New information is coming in. Once the probe report is out, everything will be cleared about who are behind the incident," the minister said. Asked about the recent factional clashes of the BCL, he said, "The government has taken necessary steps, you'll see everything will be alright." The current situation is still better than it was in 2001, he said indicating the BNP-backed student front JCD's factional clashes in that time, when the BNP-led government came into power. "However, we don't want any kind of violence," he added. bd
