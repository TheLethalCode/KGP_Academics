 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court sent five top executives of private land phone operator Dhaka Phone to jail on Monday following their arrests the night before in an illegal VoIP case. The Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court sent company chairman Hayatuzzaman, director general (engineering) Harun-al-Atahar, director KM Shahidullah, senior manager (engineering) Ikramuzzaman and manager (billing) Hari Podder after refusing them bail. A team of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) and Rapid Action Battalion had raided the Mohakhali offices of the company on Sunday, Kawser Ahmed, a junior consultant at BTRC told bdnews24.com. They searched the offices located on the 18th floor of Rupayan Tower from around 5pm to midnight. Evidence of VoIP operations, a mobile switching centre (MSC), was found, Kawser said. Kawser said a case had been filed on December 24 last year with Badda Police Station against the Dhaka Phone officials for illegal exchange of foreign calls. Banned equipment was also seized at that time. The BTRC allege that although the company officials were warned at that time, they have again started operating illegal VoIP services. The five detainees were on Sunday shown arrested in connection with the case filed last year
