<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque filed a general diary with the Gulshan police on Friday night after receiving a series of death threats. The threats came after Farroque had called for a probe in to corruption allegations against the prime minister's son. Sub inspector Tuhin Hossain of the police station told bdnews24.com that Farroque had been receiving death threats since 2.00pm in the afternoon. Farroque told bdnews24.com, "I feel very insecure after having received repeated death threats. So I filed a general diary with the police." Nitai Roy Chowdhury, Farroque's lawyer, told bdnews24.com, that the opposition leader had been receiving calls threatening to kill him and his family members. The callers had apparently told the senior BNP leader that he would be taught a good lesson for speaking against Wazed. In parlaiment on Thursday, Farroque had accused the prime minister's son, Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, of being involved with illegal VoIP, or internet telephony, operations. Farroque had then demanded investigation into the alleged operations and offered the opposition's assistance in this regard with "all kinds of information". He had told reporters that the business originally began with a relative of Sheikh Hasina through a company called Spectra Solutions. The BNP student wing, Jatiyabadi Chhatra Dal, protesting against the threats declared that it would demonstrate outside the party's office in Naya Paltan on Saturday at 10.00am. bdnew
