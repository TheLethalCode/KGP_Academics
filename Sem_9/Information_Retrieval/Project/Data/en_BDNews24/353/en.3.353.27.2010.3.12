 Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Bangladesh would always respond to the United Nations' call for securing peace around the world. Delivering her address as chief guest at a workshop on formulation of a strategy on UN policing at Hotel Sheraton, the foreign minister also stressed that the personnel deployed in the UN international policing must have knowledge on human rights to make the UN peace efforts acceptable. "The policemen deployed in the peace keeping operations can use force when necessary." "Therefore, they should have basic knowledge on human rights, arrests and detention," Dipu Moni told the concluding session of the workshop. The police headquarters organised the five-day workshop attended by policemen from 35 countries. The foreign minister said Bangladesh, as a peace loving country, was trying to play its role in promoting world peace. "It (promoting peace) is also enshrined in our constitution. We will always respond to the request of the United Nations for marinating global peace," said Dipu Moni, who has a degree on human rights laws. She said Bangladesh had already become the leading country in contributing policemen to the international peace keeping missions. According to the police headquarters, around 1,600 police personnel from Bangladesh have been serving in different peace keeping operations. Bangladesh is also the second largest troops contributing country to the international UN peace keeping missions. Over 10,000 Bangladeshi troops are currently serving in different countries. Brig general Walter Wolf, head of standing police capacity of the UN, in his speech said 15,000 policemen had been engaged in the international policing since they were first deployed in Kosovo in 1999. He said 1,500 more police personnel would be deployed in quake-hit Haiti to maintain peace. Doctrine Development Group workshop The five-day workshop was on developing a common curriculum on international policing, which is called Doctrine Development Group (DDG). The Dhaka meet is the third of its kind and it adopted a common curriculum for international policing. Similar workshops took place in Italy in 2008 and the US in 2009. The common curriculum will be made final after further examination at the UN headquarters. If the curriculum is finally adopted, all policemen will study same subjects and operate same brand of weapon in all peacekeeping activities. "Development of a doctrine is an absolute necessity for effectiveness of international policing," said Brig. Wolf.
