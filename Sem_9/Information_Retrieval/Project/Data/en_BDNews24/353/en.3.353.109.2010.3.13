 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com) - Petrol pumps across the country will be closed, and transport of the fuel suspended, for six hours from 6am to noon on Sunday. Petrol station owners last month warned of a countrywide shutdown of pumps unless the government met certain demands within two weeks, including hiking their commission from 2 to 7 percent. Announcing the 13-point charter of demands and an ultimatum to the government on Feb 28, they said pumps would be closed for six hours on Sunday March 14 if their demands were not met. The United Council of Petrol Pump Station Owners and Workers on Saturday duly announced enforcement of the shutdown the next day. "The government has not even discussed our 13-point demands that include increase in commissions for fuel sales, our work stoppage will go ahead as planned," Muhammad Nazmul Huq, convener of the committee, told bdnews24.com on Saturday. Petrol tankers and pumps throughout the country distribute and sell fuel, including petrol, diesel and octane, from three oil companiesMeghna, Jamuna and Padmaunder the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation on a commission basis. Huq said their demands include a raise in commissions from 2 to 7 per cent, formulation of guidelines in setting up petrol pumps, a testing laboratory at every pump depot, increase in fares of tanker-lorries and stopping police harassment in the name of "examining papers". "Despite our written intimation to the government on February 10 presenting our 13-point demands, we had no response from the government." CNG stations will remain open. bdnew
