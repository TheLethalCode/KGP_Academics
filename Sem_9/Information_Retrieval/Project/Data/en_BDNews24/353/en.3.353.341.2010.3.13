<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  State minister for law Qamrul Islam on Saturday warned that anyone who claims Ziaur Rahman declared independence will face charges for violating the constitution. BNP leaders have long claimed that party founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, who was an army major during the liberation war, made the first public declaration of Bangladesh's independence in 1971, on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, after capturing a radio station. The High Court on June 21 last year ruled that Sheikh Mujib, Bangladesh's independence leader and founding president, not Ziaur Rahman, proclaimed independence from Pakistan in 1971. The Supreme Court later upheld the ruling. Islam said: "The government did not take any step till now. But from now on it will take action against the violators of the constitution." "Everybody should obey the Supreme Court ruling," he told a workshop in the capital's BIAM auditorium. The minister was asked whether religion-based parties are now banned in the country following another recent Supreme Court ruling that the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution was illegal. "The Fifth Amendment ruling has cleared the way to return to the 1972 Constitution. If it is implemented the religion-based parties will not have any scope to pursue politics." "The government, however, can only take the next steps on this after getting a copy of the ruling," Islam said. All religion-based parties were banned by Bangladesh's original 1972 Constitution. Later they were allowed back into politics through amendment to the constitution. Jamaat-e-Islami, a member of the BNP-led opposition coalition, is the largest religion-based political party in Bangladesh. b
