 Sylhet, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)India's Border Security Force have once again intruded into Bangladesh, digging bunkers at Goainghat in Syhlet, but were forced back after a flag meeting on Saturday. The chiefs of the two border forces have just concluded bilateral talks in the Indian capital during Mar 7-11, during which the Bangladesh side had expressed grave concerns over continued BSF intrusions into Sylhet over the past month. BDR chief Gen Mainul Islam said it went against the spirit of greater cooperation between the two neighbours following prime minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January. The talks between the two border chiefs had concluded with a pledge by both sides to deepen cooperation in line with a joint communiqu issued by Hasina and Indian counterpart Manmohan Singh. Despite this, BSF intruded 100 yards inside Bangladesh at Pangtumai on the Padua border area in Goaingha on Friday (Mar 12) night and dug 15-20 bunkers. Bangladesh Rifles protested the construction and asked BSF to return to their territory. They also requested the flag meeting on Saturday. The commanders of BDR's Battalion-21 and BSF's Battalion-1 led their respective sides. Lt Col Khandaker Zahirul Alam, commander of Rifles Battalion-21, told bdnews24.com that a previous meeting in September 2009 between the two border forces had drawn a line keeping 200 yards between the borders. "But BSF on Thursday and Friday crossed the line and started to set up bunkers 100 yards inside the Bangladesh border, which the BDR protested," Alam said. BSF had retreated after the meeting, but both the forces had taken up face-to-face positions between Pillars 1270-1273 at the Padua border, Alam said. Saturday's meeting agreed on a permanent solution to the problem through "higher level discussions", he added. bdnew
