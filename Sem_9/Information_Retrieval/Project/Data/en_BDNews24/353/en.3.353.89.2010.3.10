 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)An international bankers' group has committed to reach financial products to a billion customers, most of who have been left out of traditional banking services. The Global Alliance for Banking on Values, an independent network of 11 sustainable banks, made the commitment on Tuesday at the end of a three-day conference in Dhaka. "The members of the GABV have committed to touch the lives of one billion people by 2020," Fazle Hasan Abed, founder-chairperson of BRAC and co-founder of the GABV, told a press conference. "This is a major new pledge that could transform lives on a truly global scale, and make a substantial difference in our efforts to combat climate change," he added.
