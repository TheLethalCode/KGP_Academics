<TITLE> Schumacher has nothing to fear from me, says Hill </TITLE>

 MANAMA, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While Michael Schumacher returns to Formula One racing at the age of 41, Damon Hill could find himself running the rule over his old rival as a grand prix steward later this season. The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said at the Bahrain season-opener that Hill would be one of the stewards at the Monaco Grand Prix in May as well as at least one other race. The Briton, 49, world champion with Williams in 1996 after some epic and highly controversial battles with German Schumacher, assured Reuters Saturday he would be impartial. "There are more important things than individual relationships. The important thing is the sport, and that the sport has got credibility," he said at the Sakhir circuit where seven-times champion Schumacher is making his comeback with Mercedes. "If judgments are made, and which are perceived to be glaringly unbalanced, then it damages the sport, so we have to avoid that. "The people have to make decisions based on the analysis of right and wrong, irrespective of who those people might be," he added. "I think I'm sufficiently distanced from it." Hill never won in the principality, beaten into second place by Schumacher in 1995, whereas his late champion father Graham was dubbed "Mr Monaco" for his five victories there. In 1994, Hill and Schumacher collided in a title-deciding race in Adelaide that eliminated both from the race and handed the German his first crown. Stewards judged it a racing incident, although some observers saw a more deliberate intent. The appointment of drivers as one of four race stewards follows controversies in recent seasons and a feeling that decisions could be improved with the involvement of former racers. Four-times world champion Alain Prost of France is one of the stewards at the Bahrain race. Hill, who pointed out that FIA President Jean Todt was previously Schumacher's team boss at Ferrari and that it had not influenced his decisions in his new role, said they could make an important contribution. "It's important drivers give their perspective on the sport," he said. "They have a valid input into things, and I think this is a good step. "If the criticism is that the people who are making those decisions are not fully equipped, then you have to then put your hand up and say, 'Okay, I would like to contribute to that knowledge base'. "As drivers, people who have really enjoyed the sport and have got that insight, that driver perspective, it's really important they make that contribution back to the sport to try and give that unique angle on things," said Hill
