<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  The United States has tracked a large amount money laundered out of Bangladesh, the central bank chief said Sunday. Atiur Rahman, the Bangladesh Bank governor, however, refused to divulge any further details including the amount of money sent out illegally. Rahman was briefing the press at Sonargaon Hotel on his recent tour of the US. He accompanied Law minister Shafique Ahmed and attorney general Mahbubey Alam to the US on an official visit. While the governor returned at the weekend, Ahmed and Alam have stayed back apparently to gather more information on the issue. An initiative was taken during the caretaker government regime to retrieve the laundered money, but the move didn't succeed. The present government, after coming to power last year, has made renewed efforts to recover illegal money from abroad. There are allegations of money laundering against BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco and Giasuddin Al MamunTarique's business partner. The governor said they had sought help from the US authorities to get membership of Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units during the visit and requested them to include Bangladesh as their member. "Once we become a member we will be able to access their anti-money laundering information bank. They can also help us by giving information on 'terrorist financing'," Rahman said. In 1995, a group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) met at the Egmont Arenberg Palace in Brussels and decided to establish an informal group. The meeting resulted in the birth of Egmont group, which now has 117 members. Its goal is to facilitate international cooperation on financial activities. The FIUs meet regularly to find ways to cooperate, especially in the areas of information exchange, training and the sharing of expertise. b
