 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday ordered Detective Branch police to look into an allegation of extortion against an investigating officer who was heading an extortion case against his own informer. IO Zakir Hossain, a sub-inspector and officer in-charge of Syedabad Bus Terminal Police Camp, is accused of attempting to extort money from the plaintiff of the case he was investigating. The initial case said that Moni Begum, Hossain's informer, demanded a bribe from a businessman Shahidul Islam Rana on Dec 30 last year. She reportedly managed to extort Tk 15,000 from him. Rana filed an extortion case against Moni Begum at the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court on Jan 15 and, inexplicably, Zakir Hossain was put in charge of the case. Hossain is accused of siding with his informer during the investigation and beating up the plaintiff and his wife on Feb 27. He also demanded a Tk 20,000 bribe from them and confiscated their tea stall at the bus terminal with all its goods. The IO also reportedly drove Rana and his wife out from the bus terminal and threatened to kill them. Rana's wife Asma filed a second extortion case at the same court on Mar 2 accusing the IO and six others. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Zulfikar Hayat ordered DB's deputy commissioner to investigate and submit a report by May 10. b
