 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)--Dhaka stocks dipped on Sunday as the index fell by over 2 percent due to a slump in the shares of banks and heavyweight Grameenphone (GP). Investors are in the mood to exit from the market causing the stocks to fall, according to market experts. Banking shares, which accounts for over 40 percent of the total market capitalisation, fell 2.06 percent on average. NCC Bank suffered the most, losing 4.43 percent, followed by BRAC Bank and Trust Bank, which fell by 3.45 percent and 3.42 percent respectively. GP fell by 3.82 percent or Tk 12.80 to end on Tk 326.80. According to the market trend, the index loses 3 points if GP price falls by Tk 1. The benchmark, general index or the DGEN, which maintained a downward curve across the day, fell 2.26 percent or 124 points to end on 5375.07. The daily turnover also sank to Tk 6.23 billion from Thursday's Tk 6.72 billion-- hitting the lowest in six months, signalling decreasing market participation. The day's trading session left almost nine out of every ten shares to fall. As many as 214 issues out of the 240 traded lost--the largest number of falling issues on a single day since January last year. On Jan 19, 2009, prices of 210 companies took a knock. All the major sectors including lease financers, mutual funds, energy and pharmaceuticals fell on Sunday, with market participators saying investors have lost confidence in the market. "Investors' confidence is at its lowest ebb. Small-scale investors are leaving the market due to the fear of uncertainty," said mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed. If the market was going on a rational profit-taking or price correction then there was nothing to worry, he said. "But a price correction can happen for a maximum two days and profit-taking does not happen in a falling market, " he added. According to the CEO of asset management firm AIMS of Bangladesh, there is a good probability that investors are selling off to avoid further losses. "If that's what is happening then the market will be in for a long bearish trend." Brokerage house officials echoed Sayeed, and said the fewer number of investors are coming on the trading floors by the day. "Every day we are seeing fewer number of orders from our clients," an official of brokerage firm Latif securities told bdnews24.com. The official, asking not to be named, said that most of the investors were engaged in selling even if they were in losses.
