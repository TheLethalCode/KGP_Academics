 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com) - Petrol pumps across the country remained closed from Sunday morning due to a six-hour strike enforced by the pump station owners and workers. The United Council of Petrol Pump Station Owners and Workers called the strike starting from 6am to press for their 13-point demands. The stations in the capital refrained from selling fuels. But the CNG stations were operating normally. Petrol station owners last month warned of a countrywide shutdown of pumps unless the government met certain demands within two weeks, including hiking their commission from 2 to 7 percent. Announcing the 13-point charter of demands and an ultimatum to the government on Feb 28, they said pumps would be closed for six hours on Sunday March 14 if their demands were not met. Muhammad Nazmul Huq, convener of the committee, said on Saturday that they were compelled to go for work stoppage since they did not get any response from the government. Petrol tankers and pumps throughout the country distribute and sell fuel, including petrol, diesel and octane, from three oil companiesMeghna, Jamuna and Padmaunder the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation on a commission basis. Other demands include formulation of guidelines in setting up petrol pumps, a testing laboratory at every pump depot, increase in fares of tanker-lorries and stopping police harassment in the name of "examining papers". b
