<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9(bdnews24.com)  The Dhaka Metropolitan Police chief said on Tuesday that he would personally do all in his power to prevent criminals from securing nominations for the upcoming city corporation elections as allegations of crime and corruption have long been rife against elected DCC councillors. In a short interview with bdnews24.com on Tuesday, the DMP commissioner AKM Shahidul Haque made the pledge when he was asked if he would hold talks with political parties and the Election Commission to prevent undesirables running in the upcoming city corporation. "Holding formal talks with political parties and EC involves some difficulties," he said. "Though local government elections are not officially political elections, political parties still back their favourite candidates." Talks with the political parties will be held on a "personal level" to prevent them from nominating identified criminals, he said. "The EC will also be handed a list of potential candidates which will detail the number and categories of cases filed or pending against them, if any, or whether they were arrested or prosecuted before." "The commission will decide on the eligibility of the candidates on the basis of the list provided," Haque said "There are some candidates in the capital whose nomination may pose some difficulties," he said, adding that voters do not want them to win nominations. "The voters are forced to back for them under certain circumstances though they know the candidates are not good," he said. ALLOWING GUNS 'WAS A MISTAKE' The police commissioner earlier briefed the reporters after a monthly crime meeting at Rajarbagh Telecom Auditorium. He said candidates have no chance of being allowed "gunmen" as councilors, formerly known as ward commissioners, had been allowed under the past BNP-led government, following gun-related deaths of many on city streets. "The law and order situation is not so bad that a candidate will need a gunman," said Haque. "Many ward commissioners then, themselves having alleged links to terrorism and crime, were given private gunmen for protection," he said, adding that the government's decision at that time was not befitting. "It does not look decent if elected representatives of local government roam around under protection of gunmen," he said. Haque said his force will talk frankly with all final nominees ahead of the upcoming elections about what police can to do to protect the candidates. "The candidates will also be given some suggestions on what they should do to avoid unwarranted situations," he added. "But if, in the end, the government deems it necessary to provide someone with a gunman, it will do so." On the monthly crime statistics, Haque said a list of 511 "young criminals" in the capital has been prepared, adding that the police would move arrest those who were caught red-handed in crime. The commissioner also said robbery, rape and theft rose in February compared to January. The number of reported killings remained the same during the two months. Nineteen murder cases were reported in January and February, he said. bdnews
