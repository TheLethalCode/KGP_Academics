 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)A regional network focusing to enhance social accountability and governance initiatives, both in public and private organisations, through project grants to civil society organisations has been launched in Dhaka. The Affiliated Networks for Social Accountability (ANSA), currently functioning in Africa and East Asia Pacific, funded by the World Bank Institute, extended its operations in the South Asia on Thursday. Institute of Governance Studies (IGS) of Brac University is coordinating ANSA's regional chapter, under which 18 organisations, primarily from three countriesBangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, were distributed around $ 0.9 million as grant. IGS signed separate memorandum of understanding (MoU) regarding the grants after announcing the formation of ANSA-SAR (South Asian Region) at a press briefing at Hotel Serina in the capital. The number of participating countries will be increased gradually, Manzoor Hasan, director of IGS, told reporters. Argentina, Egypt and Kyrgyz Republic will be included later on, while countries out of these three regions will be included under the South Asian part, he added. The three year programme, with a yearly fund of $ 1.5million, will work in the fields of adaption and mitigation of climate change, right to information and public procurement (third party monitoring). Manzoor said ANSA-SAR will also provide academic fellowships to young scholars, especially journalists, for their contribution to good governance. Gopakumar Thampi, chief operating officer of ANSA-SAR, said with a view to translate the plans into action, awareness programmes through generation of knowledge products, learning and sharing capacity building events and strengthening of communities' practices had been undertaken. This will help improve efficiency of the citizens and different government agencies towards establishing social accountability practices, Thampi added. The formation procedure of ANSA-SAR began in July 2009 after the fund had been collected in April.
