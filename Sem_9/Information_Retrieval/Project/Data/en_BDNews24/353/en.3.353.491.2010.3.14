 MADRID, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola accused officials of lying in their match report following his sending off during last weekend's 2-2 draw at Almeria in La Liga. Guardiola will have to watch Sunday's game at home to third-placed Valencia from the stands after the club's appeal against his dismissal for protesting a decision was rejected by the Spanish football federation (RFEF).

"There will be more (sendings off) because I know myself," Guardiola said. "I try to stay calm because of the institution I represent but sometimes I can lose it and they send me off." The 39-year-old, who led Barca to six titles in 2009, said Real would be sure to pick themselves up after their elimination from the Champions League on Wednesday and would be unlikely to drop many points in the remaining league matches. "I am very clear about the fact that we will need a lot of points to be champions," he said. "They are the favourites, like us, to win the title.
