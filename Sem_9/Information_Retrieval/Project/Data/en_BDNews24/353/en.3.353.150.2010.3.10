<TITLE> Small is still beautiful in farming, says researcher </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)Small farms can be more efficient and highly productive provided they are given the required inputs and incentives, says one researcher. Iqbal Ahmed, an officer of Oxfam Bangladesh, found in his research in four districts  Noakhali, Comilla, Bogra and Tangail  that 82 percent of the small farms were highly productive. He was presenting his study at a discussion on credit and investment in agriculture on the second day of a three-day symposium at the National Press Club Wednesday. The symposium is being organised by the Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods, a platform of about 200 national, local and grassroots level development organisations. Although not producing at full capacity, the small farmers owning less than 2.5 acres (250 decimals) were more efficient than those with larger land ownership, said Iqbal. He observed that the reason for their high efficiency was most likely because small and marginal farmers mainly produced for their own consumption. "Therefore, intensive labour makes up for other costly inputs, which are relatively small compared to big farms." He said that the small and marginal farmers could also produce even more efficiently and in higher quantities if they were assisted with cheaper inputs like fertilisers and irrigation facilities that they cannot afford on their own. Discussants agreed with him and said that there was no doubt that the government should provide farmers with financial assistance for the genuine development and sustenance of agriculture as a whole. Manzur Ahmad, a consultant of FBCCI, said the current system of assistance was like 'poultry feeding'. "We feed chickens and fatten them up so that we can eat them later'. Ahmad said it was almost a parallel case for current short term assistance to farmers only to boost their output. He said farmers are being 'fed and fattened' not for their benefit but for the benefit of the market. Abu Ahmed, a professor of economics at Dhaka University, said loans and easy credit were absolutely imperative for agricultural development in Bangladesh. Ahmed also said the distinction between industry and agriculture would gradually disappear with the growth of agro-processing and agro-based industries. Abul Kalam Azad, vice president of the Bangladesh Krishak League, said one of the main reasons of farmers' marginalisation was high-interest loans. He said exemptions and interest rescheduling are normally given to large industrial units when they fail to perform. The wealthy businessmen can have their crores written off as bad loans citing the excuse of 'sick industries'. "But there is no such provision for the farmer who has lost everything to cyclones like Aila or the Sidr." Ziaul Hoque Mukta, CSRL member secretary called for withdrawal of subsidies and incentives from certain sectors that were essentially harmful for farmers and mentioned the shrimp industry in particular. b
