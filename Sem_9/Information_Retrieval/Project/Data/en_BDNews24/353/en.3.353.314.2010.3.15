<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)The Small and Medium Enterprise Foundation needs to be strengthened with a view to nurturing industry, Syed Rezwanul Kabir, the newly appointed managing director of the foundation, has said. Kabir, who took office on Monday, told bdnews24.com imports are still too high despite presence of many industries in Bangladesh. "We will be driven by the vision to increase manufacturing of a variety of products in the local industries and to find new destinations to boost exports," the new SME Foundation chief said. "We want to assist entrepreneurs with suggestions regarding this." The SMEF can also lobby the National Board of Revenue and other government agencies to assist local small and medium enterprises, Kabir added. Kabir is a former official of Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Limited, a Canadian-based oil-exploration company, which has been embroiled in two corruption cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. The two cases, filed by the Anticorruption Commission in December 2007, accused the two of corruption in dealings with Niko. The High Court just last week quashed the Niko case proceedings against Hasina. Kabir also served in Karnafuli Fertiliser Company Ltd. He was also part of the Bangladesh Rural Enterprise and Agriculture Development Project, a concern of the Canadian embassy and is the general secretary of the Canada-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industries. bdn
