<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  The election commission is planning to declare schedule for the Dhaka City Corporation polls by the end of next month. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain on Monday told reporters, "It means the election will be held by the end of May". Election schedule for the vacant Bhola-3 constituency also would be declared within the next few days, Hossain added. DCC election was due to be held in April but was delayed as a number of writ petitions on demarcation of wards were filed. The High Court, however, dismissed all the five petitions last month, clearing the way for holding the election. Sohul has hinted that the number of DCC wards might increase to 92. "Operation to demarcate each wards of the DCC with Geographical Information System is under way in the Ministry for Local Government. Integrity of area and administration with population size is being maintained under this system," Sohul added. He also hoped that primary work of demarcation will be finished by next week. Earlier, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda also hinted on the possibility of DCC election by May. "EC is firm in it's previous position on holding DCC election in May" added Sohul. He also said that there is a plan to hold Chittagong city corporation election after the DCC polls. In response to another question Sohul said, "Final voter list of Bhola district has been published on Monday. Schedule of vacant Bhola-3 constituency will be declared within two-three days." "The polling date will be decided on Tuesday in the EC meeting." added Sohul. Bhola-3 constituency seat was declared void in February after the High Court ruled that the nomination of Awami League MP Mohammad Jashimuddin was unlawful. bd
