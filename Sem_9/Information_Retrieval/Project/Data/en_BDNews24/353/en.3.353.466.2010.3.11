<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spaniard Rafa Nadal is set to play his first competitive match on grass since winning the 2008 Wimbledon title at the Queen's Club tournament in June. "This year there is even more motivation because I could not defend my titles last year," Nadal, who was plagued by knee problems last season, said in a statement on Thursday. "No one was more disappointed than me that I couldn't play because I love those tournaments," added the six-time Grand Slam winner, who has not played since retiring due to a knee injury in his Australian Open quarter-final against Andy Murray in January. "Queen's is a big, important tournament played at a very nice, traditional club and it was an amazing feeling to win it in 2008," the 23-year-old said. "To not defend my Wimbledon title last year was one of the toughest decisions in my career, but this is a new year and now I have the chance to go back to England and to compete on the grass again." Argentine US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro has also been confirmed for the tournament in west London from June 7
