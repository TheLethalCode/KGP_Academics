 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a 13-member committee to contain the "unexpected" hike in prices of poultry and eggs, a senior government figure said on Sunday. The committee, comprising representatives of the commerce ministry, fisheries and livestock ministry as well as poultry farm owners, will formulate a policy to set the prices. "The committee has been asked to monitor market and recommend set prices considering issues such as production costs of poultry and eggs," fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting. He said the government would set the final market price based on the committee's recommendations. "Nobody will be allowed to hike the price without permission of the government." It costs Tk 17.60 to produce a one-day old broiler chicken which hatchery owners sell at Tk 45 to dealers, according to Dhaka zone livestock department. The poultry farmers have to pay Tk 65 to the dealers. Including the price paid to the dealer it costs the poultry farmer a total Tk 155 to raise a day-old chick to a 1.5 kg adult. According to this calculation, a kilo of chicken costs Tk 103 to produce, but it is currently selling from Tk 151 to 165 in the market, whoch is too high according to the government. An egg is sold from Tk 6 to Tk 6.25 against the production cost of Tk 4.91. The minister said the present demand for chickens is about 6.5 million a week while only 4.5 million chickens are produced by both public and private poultry sources. To meet the crisis, the government has moved to increase production capacity by installing new machines in 12 hatcheries, he said. The current production capacity of these 12 government hatcheries is about 8.3 million a year. A decision on the new machines will be finalised within 15 days, the minister said. "The government is working to keep poultry and egg prices at a tolerable level for consumers," he added. b
