 MIAMI, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African Ernie Els held a one-stroke lead at the WGC-CA Championship after a six-under 66 in Friday's rain-affected second round. Els, who has not won a tournament in two years, delivered a confident display that augurs well ahead of next month' U.S Masters. The three-times major winner's 10-under par performance so far is impressive given his poor display at the Honda Classic where he finished tied for 67th. "These have been two really good days for me especially when you look at where I was last week," he told reporters. "I worked really hard, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and really tried to find something. "I did find something so I'm sticking with that. I putted quite nicely and managed my game quite well." A relaxed-looking Els said he felt confident he can make an impact this year. "For some reason I feel really good mentally. I feel a little bit more fresh than I have been. I'm up for it a little bit more this year. "My putting is coming around, my short game too and so I've got a lot more hope than I have had maybe in the last couple of years. I feel I can have a good one this year." Australian Robert Allenby, who started on the back nine, recorded a hole in one at the par-three 13th and an eagle on the first but was in second place on nine-under 135 after another disappointing finish. He bogeyed his last four holes on Thursday while on Friday he closed with bogeys on two of this final three holes. Allenby struck his ace with a five wood - the same club he used for his last hole-in-one at the World Match Play Championship in Spain last year. The poor weather has resulted in poor crowds and Allenby said few witnessed his feat. "The four people who were out there were pretty happy," he joked. "It landed perfect, about 15 feet short of the hole and then sort of checked up and rolled up into the hole." Overnight leader Charl Schwartzel eagled the par-five first before he slipped back into a share of third place on seven-under after a double-bogey seven at the 12th. Schwartzel and American Bill Haas (66) were three shots behind Els while Dane Soren Hansen (69) and Irishman Padraig Harrington (68) were a further stroke adrift. Last year's champion Phil Mickelson, who was one of 18 players that had to wait more than two hours to finish the round after lightning and heavy rain suspended play, was six shots off the lead following his steady 69 on Friday
