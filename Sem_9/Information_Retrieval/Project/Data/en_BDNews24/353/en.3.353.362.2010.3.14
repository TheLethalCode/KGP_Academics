 Sylhet, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  India's Border Security Force have once more reportedly breached the Jaintapur border in Sylhet giving rise to an exchange of fire with the Bangladesh Rifles on Sunday. The incident is the latest in a series of similar intrusions by BSF in recent weeks to escort Indian fishermen to fish in Dibir Haor on the Bangladesh side. The latest intrusion took place just days after the director general-level five day talks concluded between the two border forces on March 11 in the Indian capital, in which both sides had vowed greater cooperation. BSF agreed to stop intruding into Bangladesh and to exercise restraint aimed at preventing loss of innocent lives on the shared borders. But at least eight Bangladeshi citizens were injured in the border shooting on Sunday, Bangladesh Rifles Sylhet sector deputy commander Maj Kohinur Alam said. He told bdnews24.com that the injured, who could not be immediately identified, Bangladeshis were admitted to the Zaintapu Upazila Health Complex. Alam said that the incident took place when Bangladesh border guards, along with some local people, were trying to take action against 50 Indian fishermen who had illegally entered Bangladesh to fish in Dibir Haor with a contingent of BSF guards at around midday. He said, as the BDR guards tried to stop the illegal action, the BSF started firing at them. The firing continued until around 4pm, said Alam. According to BDR officials, 13 Bangladeshis have been killed by India's Border Security Force since January this year and 65 in 2009. On Friday, BSF reportedly intruded 100 yards inside Bangladesh at the Padua border in Sylhet and dug 15-20 bunkers before being forced to retreat after a flag meeting. bdnews24
