 KABUL, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and US Defence Secretary Robert Gates traded barbs on Wednesday during briefly overlapping visits to Afghanistan, where Washington has troops at war but Tehran has growing clout. Ahmadinejad, who arrived as Gates was wrapping up a three-day visit, told a news conference alongside Afghan President Hamid Karzai that US and Western troops would never defeat terrorism by waging war in Afghanistan. Gates said earlier in the week Iran was playing a "double game" in Afghanistan by being friendly to the government while trying to undermine the United States. He said on Wednesday he had passed those concerns on to Karzai. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband joined the fray during a speech in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that was focused on strategies to end the war in Afghanistan. Miliband rapped Ahmadinejad's latest comments in Kabul as "unhelpful posturing and bombast." Washington, which will have 100,000 troops in Afghanistan by the end of 2010, says it believes Iran provides some support for militants there, although not nearly on the same scale as in Iraq, another Iranian neighbour where US troops are fighting. The Afghan insurgency is mainly led by Sunni Islamists, who are sworn enemies of Shi'ite Iran. But Tehran blames Western military intervention in Afghanistan for causing instability and Ahmadinejad turned Gates' earlier comment around. "Why is it that those who say they want to fight terrorism are never successful? I think it is because they are the ones who are playing a double game," Ahmadinejad said. "They are the ones who set the terrorists on their course and now they say: 'Now we want to fight them'. Well they cannot, it is impossible." As if addressing Gates, he said: "What are you even doing in this area? You are from 10,000 km over there. Your country is on the other side of the world. What are you doing here?" Shortly before the news conference started, Afghan security guards anxiously collected half-empty bottles of mineral water from reporters. One said it was to prevent anyone from throwing the bottles at Ahmadinejad. 'UPFRONT GAME' Gates left Kabul shortly after Ahmadinejad landed. Before leaving, Gates described the timing of the Iranian leader's visit as "clearly fodder for all conspiratorialists." "I told President Karzai that we want Afghanistan to have good relations with all of its neighbours. But we also want all of Afghanistan's neighbours to play an upfront game dealing with the government of Afghanistan," Gates said. Iran has wide and growing influence in Afghanistan, especially the west of the country where it has important economic ties. Millions of Afghans were refugees in Iran during three decades of war and a dialect of Iran's Farsi language is one of the two state languages in Afghanistan. Karzai said at the news conference with Ahmadinejad that "we assured our brothers in Iran that we do not want our soil to be used against our neighbours." Iran was the only major regional country to reject an invitation to an international conference on Afghanistan in London in January. Miliband called that decision "completely short-sighted" on the part of Iran's leadership. "The Iranian regime ... must acknowledge that the best way to protect its investments or promote the interests of Afghans that share its Shia faith is to work to promote peace, not undermine it," Miliband said in a lecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Despite their suspicions, Western countries have praised Tehran's efforts in combating the drug trade. Iran has a serious heroin addiction problem, while Afghanistan produces nearly all the world's opium used to make heroin. Karzai was due to fly to Pakistan later on Wednesday, meeting the leadership of another big neighbo
