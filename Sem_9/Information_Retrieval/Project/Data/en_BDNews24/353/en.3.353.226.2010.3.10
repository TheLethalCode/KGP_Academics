 INDIAN WELLS, California, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former world number one Justine Henin will have the top seeds looking warily over their shoulders when she continues her fairytale comeback at the Indian Wells WTA tournament starting on Wednesday. The Belgian has reached successive finals since returning to the circuit in January after quitting the game in 2008 and lurks as a dangerous wildcard entry at the desert venue where she won the women's title in 2004.
