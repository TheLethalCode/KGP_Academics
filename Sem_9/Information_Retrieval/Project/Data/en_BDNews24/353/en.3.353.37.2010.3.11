He told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with a delegation of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries he was satisfied with progress in budget implementation so far, but inflation worries remained. He said he would place a progress report of the budget implementation of the first two quarters (July-December) before parliament on Mar 16.

Muhith, however, was happy with GDP growth, which now stands at 6 percent, he said. "Agricultural production is good. People are also moving towards investment.

Export orders and revenue netting are performing well," the minister said.
