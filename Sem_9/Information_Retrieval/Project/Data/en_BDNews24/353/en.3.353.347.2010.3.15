 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com) -- Bangladesh were battling to save the first Test against England as they ended the fourth day on 191-5 at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Monday. The hosts were indebted to an unbroken sixth wicket stand of 81 runs between Junaid Siddique (68) and Mushfiqur Rahim (47) as the home side still required 322 runs for an unlikely win.

England had resumed on 131-5 and lost overnight batsman Prior (seven) in the fourth over, but Ian Bell and Swann batted aggressively to help the tourists declare their second innings with an hour remaining in the first session.
