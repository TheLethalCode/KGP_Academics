 Rajshahi, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  Police recovered a homemade bomb from Rajshahi University campus on Sunday. The bomb, found at the north side of the university stadium, might have been placed there to create panic, Motihar police chief Tofazzal Hossain told reporters. Passers-by-became suspicious when they noticed an unopened mobile phone set box on the roadside. When the police went to the spot, they opened the packet and found a bomb wrapped in red tape, Hossain said. It was then submerged in water and taken to the police station. Police have so far recovered 10 bombs since last month's violent clash at the university between the pro-Jamaat student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir and the Awami League's student wing, the Chhatra League, which resulted in the death of a Chhatra League activist and the injury of scores of students. Police have arrested a number of leaders from Jamaat-e-Islami and its student wing in connection with the killing. bdnew
