 LONDON, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Cameron said on Sunday he would be able to fire his close friend George Osborne as the Conservative Party's shadow chancellor if he had to. The comment raised media speculation that Osborne might not be Cameron's automatic choice as chancellor of the exchequer if the Conservatives win an election widely expected on May 6. Asked in a television interview if he was capable of firing Osborne, who he has been friends with for years, Cameron said: "Yes, and we had this conversation. A number of times over the last four years." "To be fair to George, he said: 'Look, if ever you want to move me to another job or sack me, that is your decision ... that is your right," Cameron said in an ITV interview with Trevor McDonald to be broadcast later on Sunday. "I have friendships in politics of course but that will never stop me making the right decisions about people and jobs," he said. Britain's budget deficit has swelled to more than 12 percent of gross domestic product as the government spent billions to lift the economy out of its worst recession since World War Two. Osborne wants action to cut the deficit starting this year while the Labour Party says immediate cuts could sabotage the fledgling recovery. A poll last month found two-thirds of Britain's business leaders thought Osborne would make a better chancellor than Labour incumbent Alistair Darling but a growing majority worried that the 38-year-old lacked experience. SLIPPING POLL LEAD The Conservatives' once comfortable opinion poll lead has narrowed and many now point to an indecisive election with no party able to command a majority in parliament. Osborne, who combines the roles of Conservative shadow chancellor and election coordinator, is one of Cameron's small group of close advisers responsible for strategy. The drop in the polls has led to criticism of Osborne in pro-Conservative media and reports of discontent in Conservative ranks over Cameron's reliance on a close-knit inner circle. Cameron appointed Ken Clarke, chancellor in the last Conservative government between 1993 and 1997, as the party's business spokesman last year to strengthen his economic team. Asked what he would say if Cameron asked him to be chancellor if he won the election, Clarke said: "I'd say 'have you slightly lost your marbles? What's wrong with George?'" "I think he is quite obviously going to appoint George Osborne as chancellor. I would advise him to appoint George Osborne as chancellor. I actually think that George Osborne would be an extremely impressive chancellor of the Exchequer," he told the BBC on Sunday. Darling said he would not disagree with Cameron if he had thought about moving Osborne from his current job. "He's a nice chap. I just think he's wrong. His judgement on Northern Rock (a bank nationalised two years ago during the financial crisis) was wrong. His judgement on the recovery programme was wrong," Darling told Sky News. "His judgement on how we get the deficit and the borrowing down is wrong. I just disagree with him," said Darling, who said he hoped there would be a pre-election debate among the main parties' finance spokesm
