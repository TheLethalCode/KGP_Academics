 Chittagong, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  A worker was killed early Friday as a steel plate fell on him at the Bhatiari ship-breaking yard in Sitakundu. The accident refocused attention on the precarious working conditions in the ship-breaking industry, which claimed around 500 lives since 1990. The latest casualty is almost certain to further step up demands from the rights group to improve safety condition in the yards. The dead worker has been identified as Saroj Das, 25, of Bara Thakurpara village of Bhatiari upazila in Chittagong. Workers said the heavy plate fell on Saroj at around 2.30 am when he was working at the Bhatiari Steel and Ship Breaking Yard. He was immediately admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital in a critical condition. He died in the morning. bd
