 Auckland, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - Australia retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy after beating New Zealand by 6 wickets on Thursday, media reports said. Captain Ricky Ponting and Cameron White secured the win by scoring half centuries as they take the lead to 3-1 in the series, reports Cricinfo. Rain played some part in the outcome but it was mostly New Zealand's watered-down batting display that left their fans feeling gloomy and consigned Saturday's fifth match in Wellington to dead-rubber status. The hosts failed to bat out their overs and after rain reduced the target from 239 off 50 overs to 200 from 34 overs, Australia found their way home with 17 balls to spare. Cameron White and Michael Hussey completed the chase, which was set up by Ponting and Shane Watson, and despite a couple of quick wickets in the middle from Daniel Vettori the visitors were on track for most of the evening. The Man of the Match, White scored an unbeaten 50 and Hussey finished on 28, easing any tension the Australians felt when Adam Voges (34) was caught at midwicket with 50 runs still required. Shane Bond had kicked things off well for New Zealand with Brad Haddin caught at slip in the first over but Ponting and Watson cruised from there. Ponting should have been lbw for 19, but reached his fifty from 34 balls before being trapped in front by Vettori. Watson (32) was also lbw to Vettori, hurried by an arm ball, but in the reduced contest New Zealand needed a bigger run of wickets to have a good chance. It was tough for New Zealand to defend their total after they were sent in first and failed to bat out their overs for the second consecutive match. They enjoyed a quick start by Brendon McCullum and an entertaining finish courtesy of some clean hitting from Daryl Tuffey, but in between they struggled desperately and for 22 overs through the middle of the innings, failed to strike a boundary. Nathan Hauritz picked up three wickets and Watson, James Hopes and Mitchell Johnson took two each. It was a deeply disappointing outcome for New Zealand following a promising start in which McCullum and Guptill raced to 63 for 0 in the eighth over. Australia sparked in the field and they collected five wickets in 11 overs. The debutant Stewart went too hard too soon and was caught at long-on off Hauritz for 4, before the key wicket of McCullum, who chipped Hauritz tamely to short midwicket for 61. A procession of wickets followed and New Zealand found it too difficult to climb back in to the game
