 LONDON, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's science academy said on Wednesday it would take part in a review of UN climate science intended to restore trust after a 2007 report was found to have exaggerated evidence for global warming. "I can confirm that we are one of the parties (on the review panel)," Bill Hartnett, a spokesman for The Royal Society, said. The independent review will be launched at the United Nations headquarters late on Wednesday in New York. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) acknowledged in January its report had exaggerated the pace of Himalayan glaciers melting, and last month said the report also had overstated how much of the Netherlands is below sea level. The errors cropped up in a report of more than 3,000 pages which cited more than 10,000 scientific papers. The next such report on climate change will be published in 2013 and 2014. "The Royal Society is a member of the InterAcademy Council," Hartnett added, referring to a grouping of the world's science academies which would lead the review. Surveys suggest public conviction of global warming's risks may have been undermined by the errors and by the disclosure last year of hacked emails revealing scientists sniping at sceptics. The IPCC shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with former US Vice President Al Gore, and produces the main scientific document driving global efforts to agree a new, more ambitious climate treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol, and switch from fossil fuels to cleaner, low-carbon supplies of energy. But its 2007 report wrongly said Himalayan glaciers could vanish by 2035, a prediction derived from articles which hadn't been reviewed by scientists before publication. An original source had spoken of the world's glaciers melting by 2
