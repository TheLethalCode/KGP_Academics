<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Outgoing Russia coach Guus Hiddink wants to end his contract with the Russian FA as soon as possible so he can consider an offer to coach Ivory Coast at this year's World Cup, his adviser said Thursday. "I hope his contract situation would be settled before the end of this month or even sooner," Cees van Nieuwenhuizen told Reuters by telephone from Amsterdam. Hiddink's contract with Russia expires on July 15, and he is set to start as Turkey's new coach from August 1.

The National Academy Fund (NAF), sponsored by Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, was paying Hiddink's 7-million-euro ($10 million) salary through the end of last year under the agreement with former RFU president Vitaly Mutko. Fursenko, who succeeded Mutko as RFU chief last month, last week said "no comment" when asked by Reuters if he intended to pay Hiddink's salary this year. "It's true my client hasn't been paid since January but right now I'm not going to put any legal pressure on the Russian FA to pay up, there's still time to solve that problem," said van Nieuwenhuizen. "First, we must work out the settlement with the Russian FA. I'm willing to fly to Moscow or if Fursenko prefers he could come here to Amsterdam to work out the details," he a
