<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)Weavers have expressed their concern over the spiralling price of imported yarn and urged the government for yarn and dye at lower prices. They said the rising cost, which has more than doubled in the last three weeks, would adversely affect the cottage industry. The price of yarn, mostly imported from Pakistan, has been increased due to a rise in import costs, sources at the ministry of textiles and jute said. Pabna district weavers' association members placed the demands before industries minister Dilip Barua at a meeting in his office on Wednesday. Some 2.5 lakh families, mostly in the northern part of the country, are directly engaged in the industry, they mentioned. The association members demanded exemption of the outstanding loans and to provide easy loans through cooperatives. In addition, they asked for introducing rationing system for yarn and government support towards rehabilitation of those affected by natural calamities. To further widen the market for weavers, they sought government initiative for setting up display centres around the country. Barua assured them of gradual assistance to address the problems. The minister said his government will take effective measures to improve productivity of the sector, which will eventually help stop migration of the rural people to the urban areas. Association president Akmal Hossain and general secretary Abdullah Al Mamun were present at the meeting.
