<TITLE> Alonso leads Ferrari one-two in Bahrain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com) -- Fernando Alonso led Felipe Massa to a stunning Ferrari one-two after the Red Bull of Sebastian Vettel hit trouble at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday, reports BBC Sport. Alonso trailed the German from the start but swept by as the Red Bull struggled with a broken exhaust. Massa followed the Spaniard past on the next lap and Lewis Hamilton benefited from Vettel's problem to take third. Vettel eventually finished fourth, holding off the Mercedes pair of Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher. On his return after three years in retirement, the seven-time world champion was in better form in the race than he had been in qualifying. But Schumacher was unable to keep pace with team-mate Rosberg in the early stages of the race and spent the afternoon holding off the faster McLaren of Jenson Button. The reigning champion finished seventh ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber, with the Force India of Vitantonio Liuzzi and Rubens Barrichello's Williams taking the final points under the new scoring system in ninth and 10th. On the evidence of this race, Button faces a tough battle to hold on to his crown, with McLaren unable to match the pace of the Ferraris and Red Bulls. Vettel had taken an impressive pole position on Saturday and appeared to have the race under control as he inched away from Alonso in the early stages of the race. But eventually the reliability troubles that had blighted the team's pre-season preparation, and their practice running here on Friday, bit them again. Alonso passed Massa, who started one place ahead of him in second, around the outside of Turn One at the start, but he could not initially keep pace with the Red Bull. Vettel built up a lead of 5.5 seconds over the Ferrari before his sole pit stop on lap 15, a lap before the double world champion. By lap 18, Alonso had the lead down to 3.5secs and, although he edged closer, by lap 28 Vettel's advantage was still 2.4secs. Two laps later, though, Alonso was just 1.1secs behind. The Spaniard lost a second on the next lap as his car struggled in the turbulence behind the Red Bull, but the prospects of a thrilling battle for the lead were dashed on lap 33 when Vettel's car suddenly started to sound rough and Alonso swept by on the penultimate straight on lap 34. Massa followed him through at the start of the following lap and the Ferraris controlled the race from then on. The two men appeared closely matched before Vettel's exhaust trouble, although Alonso always seemed to have Massa under control, extending the gap again whenever the Brazilian closed in a little. As the race ran to a conclusion Alonso built a lead of more than 14 seconds, as Massa presumably settled for second, in a formidable performance by the man many are tipping to win a third world title this season. "It's a special day for me," said Alonso. "Coming back to the top of the podium is always special and it's even more special with Ferrari, with all the history behind the team and the expectations a driver has driving for Ferrari. "There is no better way to start the relationship. I am in the best team in the world. "To be first and second is the result all the guys in Marinello and all the guys here at the track deserve." Hamilton and McLaren had been off the pace in qualifying but appeared much more competitive in the race. He spent the first stint trapped behind Rosberg but, once past him at the pit stops, the Englishman was able to keep pace with the Ferraris - if not close the 11-second gap. Nevertheless, it was an encouraging performance from McLaren after they had been more than a second adrift of Vettel and Massa in qualifying. "I had quite a good race," said Hamilton. "But I lost a bit of ground at Turn Four and Rosberg got past me. "I was held up behind him for the first half of the race - I was much faster but it's very difficult to follow here while trying to look after your tyres. "If I was ahead of him I may have been able to follow the train Ferrari were creating. It's more than we expected this weekend and we need to continue to push." Button, stuck behind Schumacher for much of the race, was unable to show his true pace. "I caught up with Schumacher but I couldn't do anything behind him," Button told BBC Sport. "I didn't have enough pace in the middle section to stay with him and have a go at him in the last section. "The tyres seemed to be holding pretty well - they were better than I thought. It's a good first race, I'm reasonably happy with that." Schumacher matched Rosberg's pace after their pit stops but he remains a long way from the imperious form he showed as he racked up a record 91 victories in his first stint from 1991-2006. Lotus won the battle of the new teams by virtue of lasting the race, which the cars of Virgin and Hispania did not. The Virgin of Timo Glock was leading that private race but it retired with gearbox trouble and left Heikki Kovalainen to lead home team-mate Jarno Trulli at the back of the f
