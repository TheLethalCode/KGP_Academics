 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  A delegation of BNP parliamentarians is visiting the hill tracts on Monday, 20 days after the ethnic clashes that left at least two indigenous and one Bangali resident dead. A parliamentary team had earlier visited the area on Mar 6, but no members of the leading opposition party, BNP, was included. Zainul Abdin Farroque, opposition chief whip and leader of the delegation, explained to bdnews24.com, that the BNP have been forced to form a separate delegation since "The government disregarded our demands for an all-party parliamentary team to visit and only sent their MPs." The six-member delegation, which includes Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, Abul Khayer Bhuiyan, Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie, Ashraf Uddin Nizan and Nazim Uddin Ahmed, left for the hill tracts by road Monday morning. Farroque said "We will visit the areas of the clash at Khagrachhari and Rangamati's Baghaichhari and talk with the affected. We will hand over our report to the opposition leader." Last month, clashes erupted between the two communities in Baghaichhari in Rangamati. Entire villages were torched and two indigenous people were killed in the violence on Feb 19-20. Within days, the violence spread to neighbouring Khagrachhari where a Bangali settler was killed in the district town during similar clashes on Feb 23. Both areas came under a clampdown as district authorities imposed restrictions on public gatherings. A curfew was also imposed for three successive nights at Khagrachhari district town. The Parbatya Chhattagram Jana Samhati Samiti (PCJSS), an indigenous political group, blamed the military posted in the areas for the killings of the two indigenous people at Gangaram Mukh. bdn
