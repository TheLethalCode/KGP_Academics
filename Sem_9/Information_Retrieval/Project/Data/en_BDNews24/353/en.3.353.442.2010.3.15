<TITLE> SEC raises margin loan ratio </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Securities and Exchange Commission has raised the margin loan ratio to 1:1.5, allowing merchant banks and brokerage houses to lend up to one and half times the value of shares that a trader has in his or her possession. The decision was made Monday at a meeting of the SEC's committee for market supervision in order to "protect investors' interest", SEC executive director Anwarul Kabir told bdnews24.com. "After reviewing the current market situation, the committee has decided to raise the ceiling for margin loans," he said. The new ceiling will be effective from March 18. Since the last SEC directive on margin loans in early February, traders could borrow up to a maximum ratio of 1:1, or an amount equivalent to the value of shares owned. The stock market regulator has in the recent months repeatedly changed its policy on the ceiling for margin loans, ostensibly to cool the overheated market. On December 12 last year, the SEC prohibited margin loan facilities altogether for what it termed "overvalued" shares - those with a price earning (PE) ratio above 75 points, to try and rationalise their prices. A PE ratio is a company's current share price compared to its earnings per share. The higher the PE ratio the more likely the share price is overvalued. Then again on February 1 this year, the market regulator extended the bar on margin loans for purchase of shares with a PE ratio over 50 points. Also on that date, it reduced the ceiling on margin loans from 1:2 to 1:1.5. Two days later on February 3, the ratio was further lowered to 1:1. bd
