 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  The special court set up at Pilkhana to try some 300 BDR mutineers was adjourned just three hours after it opened on Monday at 10 am. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam, who presided over the proceedings, adjourned the trial until 10am Tuesday. He ordered arrest of the rest of the 69 accused, currently working in the border guard force. He also asked authorities to produce all the accused on Tuesday, including those 241, who are now in detention in several jails. At the start of Monday's proceedings nayek subeder Md Giasuddin, the complainant in the case, read out the charges against the 310 accused, all of them members of the 36 Rifles Battalion under the Dhaka Sector. He alleged that 104 of the accused were in the Darbar Hall on the day of the incident while the others were engaged in looting outside the Hall. The trial of the Pilkhana mutiny suspects started on Feb 23 but was adjourned after just two days. Over 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, were killed during the Pilkhana mutiny of Feb 25-26 2009. The government formed six special courts last year, including two in Dhaka, to try approximately 3,500 border guards who have been accused in 40 separate cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. bdn
