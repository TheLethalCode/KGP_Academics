<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)The Microcredit Regularity Authority will make public the interest rates that the lending organisations are imposing on their borrowers. "We've prepared a policy and organisations will have to inform us of the details of their interest rates" Leela Rashid, director (operations) of MRA told reporters at a press conference in Sonargaon Hotel on Sunday. "We'll gather the information and then publicise it," she said MRA has sent the draft proposal to the government for approval. Many accuse micro credit lenders of imposing too high a level of interest rates. Meanwhile, Leela claimed that the "effective" rate of interest of micro credit lenders tends to be around 25 to 30 percent. Lending organisations have so far lent a total of around Tk 20,000 crore, according to Khandakar Muzharul Haque, executive vice chairman of MRA. The press conference was organised to announce the launching of a three-day international summit, organised by MRA and starting on Monday, which will be attended by representatives from 20 countries. Eight working papers on Bangladesh and the global perspective will be placed in the summit, which is the first of its kind in Bangladesh. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said, "Bangladesh is a pioneer in microcredit, it's a laboratory. It's a matter of satisfaction to organise such a programme." bd
