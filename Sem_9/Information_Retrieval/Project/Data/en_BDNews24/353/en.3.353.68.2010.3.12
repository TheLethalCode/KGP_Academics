 BEIJING, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China accused Washington of hypocrisy on Friday for its criticism of Beijing's restrictions on the Internet and dissent, blaming the United States for the financial crisis and saying its own rights record was terrible. In its annual survey of human rights in 194 countries issued on Thursday, the US State Department criticised China, along with Cuba, Myanmar, North Korea and Russia.

China has intensified restrictions on the Internet, imposed tight control over people seen as threats to Communist Party rule, and increased repression of Uighurs after ethnic violence and riots in Xinjiang, the country's restive far-western region, said the State Department report. China's Communist Party authorities have shown little patience with Western criticisms of Beijing's punishment of political dissidents and protesters. Late last year, US officials decried the sentencing of prominent Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo to 11 years in jail on charges of "inciting subversion".
