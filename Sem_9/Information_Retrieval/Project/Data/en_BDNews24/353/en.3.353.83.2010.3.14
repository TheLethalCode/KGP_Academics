 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com) - There is no bar to making public all available information on past coups and army takeovers in Bangladesh, AK Khandaker, the minister in charge of defence affairs in parliament, said on Sunday. Replying to a question by Md Israfil Alam MP from Naogaon, Khandakar told parliament that after independence a number of coups and rebellions, "big and small", took place in the army at different times. "In a real sense, no coup or rebellion took place in the navy. Neither was there any instance of a major coup in the air force," he added. "But a good number of people had to die in the army because of coups and rebellions  Many have been punished for their involvement," said Khandaker. According to the law of the land, assistance was given in the form of grants and monetary support to their families, he added. There was no legal or military bar to revealing details of the past coups, he said. "But thirty nine years have elapsed since the country became independent," said Khandaker, who was deputy commander of the liberation forces in 1971 and is now convenor of the Sector Commanders Forum. "Collating all this information is a time-consuming matter ... Still, if need be, a full list and details of the past coups and rebellions can be released in days to come," said the minister. Regarding the navy, the minister said, "On November 7, 1975, some self-seeking sailors of the navy, out of their personal ire, took position against a number of officers at Chittagong and Khulna. One officer died." Regarding the air force, he said "On November 3, 1975, some unruly members of the air force took part in a rebellion in Dhaka." "Those involved were identified and they were tried by court martial under the air Force Act 1953. They were punished with different terms, including loss of jobs." On October 2, 1977, some unruly members of the air force revolted leading to death of eleven officers and injuries to several others, the minister said. bd
