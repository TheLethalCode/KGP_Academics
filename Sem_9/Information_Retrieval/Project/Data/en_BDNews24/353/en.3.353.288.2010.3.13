 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has proposed a system of provincial government in Bangladesh, dividing the country into eight parts. "There is no other alternative to provincial government for the establishment of good governance in Bangladesh," he told a seminar in the capital on Saturday. He proposed eight provinces: Northern, Barendra, Jahangirnagar, Jalalbad, Chattala, Mainamati, Jahanabad and Chandradwip. According to the proposal, the provinces would each have a council of 600 members and a separate cabinet with a chief minister at the head. The central government would be a federal one. Each province would have a High Court, which would function under the Supreme Court located in the federal capital Dhaka, said Ershad, a former president and martial law administrator. The federal government would oversee the administration through a governor for each province. "I am raising the proposal as a party chief, but it is not presented from the party's point of view," Ershad told the seminar on 'Planning a provincial government system in Bangladesh' at the Hotel Sonargaon on Saturday. b
