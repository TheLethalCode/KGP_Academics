 Rajshahi, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  Shibir leader Ikram Hossain, arrested for suspected involvement in murder of Chhatra League activist Faruk Hossain, recorded a statement at a Rajshahi court on Friday. Member of Islami Chhatra Shibir, student wing of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami party, Ikram Hossain reportedly confessed his involvement with the violence at Rajshahi University. He gave his statement to Rajshahi Metropolitan Magistrate Ziaur Rahman. His lawyer Abu Raihan Al Beruni Minhaz visited Ikram after the hour-long confession from 5.45pm and told journalists afterwards, "Ikram was not given three hours' time with his lawyer before recording his statement which is stipulated by the law." But Rajshahi Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner (AC prosecution) Humayun Kabir said that he was taken to court in the afternoon after he expressed his intention to give a "voluntary statement". Ikram Hossain was arrested from a house in Dhamrai's Kamalpur area Monday morning. Hossain, a masters student of RU's Islamic Studies, has admitted to his involvement in the killing according to RAB. He gave a detailed description of the Feb 8-9 violence between Shibir activists and the BCL, student wing of the ruling Awami League. Shibir and BCL clashed at the university on Feb 8. Shibir activists, allegedly instigated by Jamaat, attacked BCL members on campus. Faruk Hossain was killed during the attack. His body was recovered from a manhole next to Shah Makhdum Hall on Feb 9. Scores of Shibir suspects have been rounded up in a countrywide drive in connection with the violence. bdnews
