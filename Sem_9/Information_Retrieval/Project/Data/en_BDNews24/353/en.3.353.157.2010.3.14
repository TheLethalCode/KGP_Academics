 Chandpur, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Chandpur court on Sunday sent former BNP state minister Ehsanul Haque Milan to jail in a case filed for vandalising an Awami League leader's car seven years ago. Chandpur Judicial magistrate Asaduzzaman Nur issued the order rejecting the BNP leader's bail petition after he surrendered to the court. "This government is worse than the past military-backed interim government. They have filed case against me on charges of stealing purses and wallets. What can be worse than that?" Milan told reporters at the courtyard. Earlier on Mar 11, the High Court bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque ordered Milan to surrender to the lower court within the next eight weeks. The plaintiff, a local Awami League leader, Kalimullah, filed the case against the ex-minister on May 6, 2009. The plaintiff accused Milan of vandalising AL leader Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir's car and stealing mobile phone when the Khan was going to attend a party meeting on Oct 16, 2003. Advocate Iqbal-bin-Bashar, Kamrul Islam, Samsul Alam Mantu, Kamal Hossain and other pro-BNP lawyers argued for Milan in the hearing. bdne
