 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)The US State Department's 2009 Human Rights Report on Bangladesh, released Thursday, raised concerns over reports of rising political violence. It also highlighted unlawful killings by security forces and the government's failure to investigate the deaths in custody of alleged BDR mutineers. The report recognised that "the government's human rights record improved somewhat due to the return of a democratically elected government and the repeal of the state of emergency." The elections in December 2008 and the peaceful transfer of power in January 2009 ended two years of rule by a military-backed caretaker government. "Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces," the report said. But despite the return of a democratically elected government there remained cases of "serious abuse", the report said, including custodial deaths, arbitrary arrest and detention, and harassment of journalists. With the return of an elected government, reports of politically motivated violence also increased 3.3 percent, the report said
