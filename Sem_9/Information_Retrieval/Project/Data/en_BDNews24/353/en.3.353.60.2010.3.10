<TEXT>
 LONDON, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England bowler Graham Onions will miss the first Test against Bangladesh with a back injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Wednesday. Onions hurt his back in practice last week ahead of the two Test-series which gets underway on Friday in Chittagong, and is a blow for the tourists whose bowling options are running thin. Fellow pacemen James Anderson and Ryan Sidebottom are out of the tour to aid recovery of leg injuries, while Stuart Broad missed the third one-day international with a back problem he picked up in the second ODI. The second Test in Mirpur starts on Mar 20, before both countries head to the West Indies for the Twenty20 World Cup from April 30-May
