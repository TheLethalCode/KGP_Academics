<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has quashed proceedings of the Niko graft case against Sheikh Hasina, the latest in a series of corruption cases against the prime minister to have been cancelled. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui gave the ruling on Thursday following a petition by Hasina challenging the legality of the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station in 2007 against Hasina and six others for incurring losses of Tk 13,630 crore to the state by improperly awarding Canadian oil firm Niko Resources Ltd a deal to explore three gas fields in Bangladesh. The court in its ruling said that the case was filed without following proper legal procedures. The court further said that it was obvious from the First Information Report and the charge sheet that Sheikh Hasina did not embezzle a single taka and that the case should be quashed in the interests of justice. Hasina's lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh told bdnews24.com that it proved that yet again a case was filed against Hasina simply to harass her. He pointed out that the court had asked for the government to amend the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) regulations in order to prevent any vested quarter from misusing power in the future. Khurshid Alam Khan, representing the ACC, said that the Commission had yet to consider whether or not to appeal the decision. The ACC had pressed charges against Hasina in December 2007. They were stayed in July 2008 by the High Court following Hasina's petition to dismiss the case. This is the fifth criminal case against Hasina to have been quashed by the High Court in the last eight days. The previous four cases were filed during the BNP-led four-party alliance government. One of the cases involved alleged corruption in the purchase of MiG-29 warplanes during her previous administration and the other three were related to the construction of Bangabandhu Novo Theatre. bdnews
