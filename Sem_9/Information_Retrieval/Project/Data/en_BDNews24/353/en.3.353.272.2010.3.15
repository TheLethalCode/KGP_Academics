 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  A freedom fighter died on Sunday when he fell seven-stories down a lift shaft in a building owned by the Freedom Fighters Welfare Trust in the city's Gulistan Complex on Monday. Mohammed Abul Mia, 78, who was born in Sylhet's Jaflong area had been visiting the Trust's office on the sixth floor. He has suffered injuries during the 1971 war. Paltan's police chief Mujibur Rahman told bdnews24.com that, "Abul Mia was on the sixth floor and wanted to descend by the lift. The door of the shaft opened but the lift itself was stuck on the eighth floor, and he fell down the shaft." The Trust's director general SM Lutfor Rahman confirmed. "Abul Mia had visited the Trust's office before he had this accident." Local shop officer Al Amin said, "I ran to the spot hearing the hubbub and saw that someone had died after falling down the lift shaft." The body has been sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. bdne
