<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)Star batsman Mohammad Raqibul Hasan stunned the cricketing world on Wednesday when he submitted a letter to the sport's authorities announcing his retirement from the game at the age of just 22. Bangladesh Cricket Board spokesperson Jalal Yunus told bdnews24.com the young cricketer cited "personal reasons" in the letter to the chairman of BCB's operations committee. "The letter has not been accepted yet", Yunus said. "We are trying to persuade him to withdraw the resignation letter and continue with cricket for the country's sake," said the BCB official. Cricket board chairman AHM Mostofa Kamal is out of the country at present. "On his return, he will try to talk Raqibul into continuing with his cricketing career," said Yunus, chairman of the board's media committee. The batman's elder brother, Shafiqul Islam, told bdnews24.com that Raqibul had suddenly announced to the family at around midday, "I'm not capable of playing cricket. I won't play cricket anymore." Shafiqul told bdnews24.com that there were no family-related problems. "The reason could be he has taken personal offence or is angry about some cricket-related matter," Shafiqul speculated. "We tried to make him understand, but he is firm in his stance," the brother added. Raqibul played his first one-day international against South Africa on Mar 9, 2008 and his first test against SA in November the same year. bdne
