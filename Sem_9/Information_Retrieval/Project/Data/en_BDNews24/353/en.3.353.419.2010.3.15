 Sylhet, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  At least thirteen Bangladeshi civilians were injured by BSF fire in Sylhet as the Indian border force engaged in a two-hour shoot out with BDR after intruding into Bangladesh territory on Sunday. BSF's intrusion and shooting took place just days after director general-level talks concluded between the two border forces on March 11 in New Delhi, in which both sides had vowed greater cooperation. India's Border Security Force had assured they would stop such intrusions and exercise restraint in 'protecting' their border to prevent loss of innocent lives. Sunday's incident, however, was sparked as 50 Indian fishermen entered Bangladesh illegally to fish in Dibir Haor at Jaintapur around midday with a contingent of BSF guards for 'protection', BDR Sylhet sector deputy commander Major Kohinoor Alam told bdnews24.com. Major Kohinoor said, as the Bangladesh border guards, along with locals, confronted them, the BSF contingent returned to their side of the border, only to return later and "throw stones" at the Bangladesh Rifles guards. "As BDR did not respond to the stone-throwing, the BSF returned to their side again, but around 2.30pm, started firing at the Bangladesh side forcing our guards to return fire," said Kohinoor. Lt Col Khandaker Zahirul Alam, Commanding Officer of 21st Rifles Battalion, told bdnews24.com that the firing only ceased at around 4.30pm after BSF's 1st Battalion CO Shekhar Gupta was contacted. "The Indian CO has been asked to a flag meeting. He has agreed to meet on Monday morning. However the time has not been fixed," Col Khandaker said. Khandaker also said that at least 13 wounded, all civilians, were admitted to the Jaintapur Upazila Health Complex. "No Bangladesh Rifles members were injured," he said. The incident is the latest in a series of similar intrusions by BSF in recent weeks to escort Indian fishermen to fish in Dibir Haor on the Bangladesh side. On Friday, BSF reportedly intruded 100 yards inside Bangladesh at the Padua border in Sylhet and dug 15-20 bunkers before being forced to retreat after a flag meeting. bdnews24
