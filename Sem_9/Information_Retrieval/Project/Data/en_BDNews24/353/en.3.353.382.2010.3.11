 Lalmonirhat, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com) --- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday pledged steps to keep the Tin Bigha Corridor open for 24 hour access by inhabitants of the Dahgram  Angarpota to the mainland. The prime minister spoke to Dahgram-Angurpota residents by video conference from Gano Bhaban for one and a half hours Wednesday morning. She said her government was taking special measures to address all the problems there. During her Delhi visit in January, Sheikh Hasina said Bangladesh and India had agreed on electricity supply to the enclave. A team of specialist physicians of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust led by prime minister's health adviser Dr Syed Modasser Ali toured to Dahgram-Angurpota to open a free medical camp for the enclave dwellers. Hasina launched the programme through the video conference and exchanged views with the residents. The prime minister spoke with an octogenarian Abdus Samad, a freedom fighter Umed Ali, 75, and a headmaster Rejanur Rahman among others. The residents placed some demands to the prime minister including keeping the Tin Bigha Corridor open round the clock, inclusion of enclave inhabitants into national service programmes, jobs in the army and border force and nationalisation of the Bangerbari High School. They also sought a hospital, measures for preventing river erosion and other facilities enjoyed by mainland people. "I know the problems of the enclave and so the government is working sincerely to them." "You are going to get long-expected electricity and other modern amenities," Hasina said, adding that their inclusion in national development would increase. The prime minister agreed to nationalise Bangerbari High School and directed the state minister for primary and mass education present there to take steps to address the existing problems of the educational institutions there. Hasina also said India had agreed to construct an over bridge through the Tin Bigha Corridor during her visit to India. "There will be no barrier to keep the corridor open for 24 hours once the pedestrian bridge is constructed," she said. Health minister AFM Ruhal Haque, the coordinator of medical services of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust and the Bangladesh Medical Association president were among those present at the Dahgram-Angurpota programme. Around 3,500 people received free treatment. bdn
