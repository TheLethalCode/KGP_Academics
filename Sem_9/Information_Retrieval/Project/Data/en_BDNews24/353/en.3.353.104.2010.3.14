 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  BKMEA, the country's apex trade body of knitwear manufacturers, has formed an electoral board to hold polls for membership of its management committee. The six-member electoral board was formed at a meeting of the BKMEA management committee on Sunday. Abdul Haque, a director of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FBCCI) was made the chairman of the election board and Hossain Khaled was appointed as head of the appeal board. The electoral board will undertake all election related activities for the polls including making schedule and selecting voting centres. The committee on Sunday also approved a resolution condemning six of its 27 directors who earlier this month had resigned from their posts in protest over the delay in annual elections to the knitwear industry association. The Committee criticised them for stating false and intentionally misleading information in their resignation letter that defamed BKMEA. bdnew
