 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has allowed Faisal Morshed Khan, son of BNP leader and former foreign minister M Morshed Khan, to go abroad. In 2008, Faisal, the managing director of Pacific Motors, was sentenced to a total of 17 years in two graft cases. But he secured bail from the High Court last year. The bench of justices Syed Mohammad Dastagir Hossain and Zubair Rahman Chowdhury, on a petition filed by Faisal, ordered authorities on Thursday not to bar his travel abroad. Faisal filed the petition after he was stopped at Shahjalal International Airport from going to Singapore on Feb 24. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq argued for Faisal while additional attorney general MK Rahman represented the state. bdn
