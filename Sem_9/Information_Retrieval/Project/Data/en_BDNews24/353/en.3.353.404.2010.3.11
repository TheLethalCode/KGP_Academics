 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The land ministry has failed to set a date to start a land survey in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). Following a meeting at the ministry, the land minister Rezaul Karim Hira told reporters that the timing and modalities of the survey could not be decided as delegates of the Hill Tracts Regional Council or the hill district councils had not been present. The minister said he hoped the date for starting the survey would be finalised at the next meeting in mid-April which is being held in one of the three districts of CHT. The Hill Tracts Regional Council chairman Jyotirindra Bodhipriyo Larma, popularly known as Santu Larma, told bdnews24 that he did not attend the meeting as the Government had failed to respond positively to his letter of 7 March asking the government to delay the start of the survey until land disputes in the region had been dealt with. In August 2009, the land ministry had announced its intention to establish the survey. bd
