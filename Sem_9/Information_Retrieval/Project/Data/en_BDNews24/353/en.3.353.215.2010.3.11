<TITLE> 'Religion-based student politics' to be banned: Nahid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - The government is intending to ban Shibir, the student body affiliated with the religion-based politics of Jamaat-e-Islami, from campuses countrywide. "The government is serious about banning religion based politics in educational institutions," education minister Nurul Islam Nahid said in parliament on Thursday. The minister was responding to a question by Nasimul Alam Chowdhury MP. The announcement follows a home ministry order to law enforcers last month to "comb out" Shibir from educational institutions after the death of Faruq Hossain, a Rajshahi University mathematics student. Faruq was killed on Feb 8 following clashes between activists of the pro-government Chhatra League, of which Faruq was a member, and Islami Chhatra Shibir. It was alleged that members of the ICS were responsible for the killing. The government also subsequently blamed the Jamaat-e-Islami for instigating their student supporters, to violence on campuses, to "destabilise" the law and order situation. Hundreds of 'Jamaat-Shibir' leaders and activists have since been arrested across the country in the search to find those responsible for Faruq's death. bdn
