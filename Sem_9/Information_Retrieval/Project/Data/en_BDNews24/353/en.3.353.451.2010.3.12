 Savar, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  At least 40 people were injured when demonstrating garment workers clashed with the police at Savar on Friday. The police had to fire more than 20 rounds of blanks to bring the situation under control, said witnesses. Nearly 50 factories of the area shut down their operaitons for the day for security as clashes broke out in three factories. The agitating workers calmed down after being assured by a three-member delegation of the garment factory owners assciation, BGMEA, saying that their demands would be met. Police and workers said that around 1500 workers of Tex Town Group started demonstrations after placing their seven-point demand on Thursday, which included payment of pending wages. During violent demonstrations on Thursday, they torched the factory's main entrance. 20 people were injured in the clashes that ensued between the police and workers. On Friday, the workers resumed their demonstrations at around 8.00am and started advancing towards the BishmailJirabo road. Tex Town Group's sewing operator Sohel, quality control staff Paresh Chandra Barman and a number of other workers told bdnews24.com that their demands included payment of salary and overtime within the first week of the month, annual increment of 10 percent, yearly holiday by the end of the year, maternity benefits and tiffin worth at least Tk 15-20. They also demanded removal of three floor-in-charge who had a record of bad behaviour and manhandling workers including women. Meanwhile, a number of demonstrators threw brickbats at another factory of the Lusaka Group about 500 metres away at Pukurpar, at around 9.00am. They also tried to break down the main gate. Police fired 22 blank shots to bring the situation under control at around 9.15am. In the half hour clash that ensued, nearly 40 including three armed police members and two Ansars were injured. At around the same time, another group of demonstrators entered the nearby Arunima Sportswear factory over the boundary walls and wrecked a number of vehicles, including workers' transports, the accounts office and the security room. However, Alamgir Hossain, assistant administrative officer of the factory, claimed that there was no reason for the factory workers to be discontented. "A number of outsiders, posing as workers, led the attack and caused damages. We closed the factory to avoid further vandalism." BGMEA's joint secretary Rafiqul Islam, additional secretary Mansur Khaled and assistant secretary Abul Hossain visited Tex Town Group at around 1.00pm. They sat with factory authorities and workers' representatives for a two-hour meeting addressing the demands of workers. The authorities accepted the demands of the workers and paid them a month's pending salaries. Senior officials of the police and RAB were present at the meeting. The factory's manager Lokman Hossain said, "The workers' pending salaries have been paid according to their demands. The factory will resume operations from Monday after a two-day closure." Sirajul Islam, OC of Ashulia Police Station, said, "The situation is normal now. However additional police has been deployed, just in case." He also said no cases had been filed.
