 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Shane Bond and Tim Southee claimed four wickets apiece as New Zealand clinched a consolation victory in the final one-day international against Australia in Wellington on Saturday, reports BBC Sport. Scott Styris hit 55 as the Black Caps, who went into the game trailing 3-1 in the best-of-five series, recovered from 32-3 to set a target of 242.
