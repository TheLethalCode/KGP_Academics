<TITLE> 'Excessive adulation' could harm Tarique: Goyeshawar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said Thursday that excessive adulation being showered these days on Tarique Rahman, the party chief Khaleda Zia's elder son, could do him more harm than good. "None of us are Tarique's enemy. But we should get over our old habits of always trying to be his best friend. It is not good for Tarique to receive extreme flattery from tainted party leaders," said Roy. The top-ranking BNP leader was speaking at a meeting at the Dhaka Reporters Unity arranged by Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal to mark the third anniversary of Tarique's imprisonment. Terming Tarique as the 'future national leader', Roy said: "The scheme on Jan 11, 2007 was devised simply to destroy the martyr Zia's family. But Tarique's leadership is now established in both the party and the country. This is the reason why our opponents are spreading propaganda against him." Samsuzzaman Dudu, president of JKD, said, "Tarique was never willing to compromise with any conspiracy. He will sometime in the future be the prime minister of the country." Tarique, who is also the senior vice-chairman of BNP, was arrested from his house at Dhaka Cantonment on March 7, 2007. He now lives in the UK. He is accused in over 10 corruption cases, most of which were filed during the past caretaker government. He was released on bail by the past interim government so that he could seek medical treatment in London. bd
