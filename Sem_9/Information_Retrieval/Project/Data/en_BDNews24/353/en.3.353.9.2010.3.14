 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will discuss plans to connect Kunming with Chittagong by road via Myanmar during her four-day official visit to China beginning March 17. >> Briefing reporters at the foreign ministry Sunday Foreign minister Dipu Moni also suggested that the ruling Awami League would not abandon the previous BNP-led government's "look east" policy of deepening ties with South East Asian countries. "The prime minister will have talks with the Chinese premier on bilateral issues on March 18," Moni said. She said Hasina would also talk to Kunming city authorities about the road and rail link construction during her visit there. "China launched the Kunming Initiative. We want this road (Kunming-Chittagong) built," said Moni. In 1999, over 100 scholars from China, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar met in Kunming (capital of Yunan province) to discuss means of expediting economic cooperation and development. The conference, known as Kunming Initiative, adopted seven recommendations to boost development in the sub-region. Connecting the landlocked Yunan with Myanmar, Bangladesh and the landlocked North Eastern Indian states by road, rail, air and water ways was among the recommendations. China had already started construction of a road connecting Kunming with Myanmar's port of Sitwe, near Chittagong. There is no rail or road network to connect Chittagong with Myanmar. Experts say Chittagong port will play an important role in the Kunming Initiative. Products can reach to India's northeast and Kunming within five hours from Chittagong port if road and rail links are set up. Bangladesh has already agreed to let India use Chittagong port. Dipu Moni said the government was also open to allowing the Chinese to use the Chittagong port. "We want to make Chittagong a regional hub and must include China in this regard," she said, adding "We will not be able to make the proposed deep seaport viable without Chinese cargo". The foreign minister said the government wanted to strengthen relations with China and other South East Asian countries as Bangladesh is well positioned to connect South Asia and south eastern regions. "The previous (BNP-led) government abandoned many initiatives just because they were adopted by the Awami League government. "But we have continued many good programmes initiated by the previous governments," said the foreign minister replying to a bdnews24.com question about whether the government abandoned the "look east policy". Dipu Moni said the BNP government only spoke of improving relations with the eastern countries in the name of "look east policy". Three agreements may be signed The foreign minister said Bangladesh and China may sign three deals during Sheikh Hasina's visit. These would be an agreement on economic and technical cooperation, a framework agreement on building Shahjalal fertiliser factory and one on construction of the seventh Bangladesh-China friendship bridge
