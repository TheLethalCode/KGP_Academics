 LONDON, March 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Peter Storrie stepped down as chief executive of crisis club Portsmouth on Friday. "After talks with his family and friends (Storrie has) decided it is in the best interests of the club for him to leave his full-time employment," administrator Andrew Andronikou said in a statement. Storrie, former managing director at West Ham United, has been at Portsmouth since 2002. The south-coast team have been in turmoil this season, a series of unsuccessful takeovers culminating last month in Portsmouth becoming the first Premier League club to go into administration, with debts of around 78 million pounds. They are also bottom of the table and almost certain to be relegated if the Premier League imposes a nine-point penalty deduction for going into administration. Storrie, 57, will continue to assist Portsmouth on a range of matters including the sale of the club, said Andronikou
