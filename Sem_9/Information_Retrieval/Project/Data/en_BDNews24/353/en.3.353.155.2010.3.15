 Chittagong, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  Hundreds of investors laid siege to Chittagong Stock Exchange from midday Monday as share prices continue to plummet. They blamed "unnecessary intervention" by the government and market regulator Security Exchange Commission for the share fall. They demanded an end to such interventions. Double Mooring Police Station chief Ainul Haque, however, said the investors were protesting "peacefully". Later representatives of the investors had a meeting with CSE officials and submitted a memorandum. CSE manager Shahruz Alam told bdnews24.com that the investors were worried after reading media reports of new taxes to be imposed on shares and about the continued fall of share prices. "The investors, in their memorandum, have accused the SEC of unnecessary interventions in the market which they say have caused the continuous fall of share prices," Alam added. The investors decided to suspend their protest as they were given assurance that their demands will be notified to the authorities concerned. Newspapers have been reporting that the government will impose tax on share market investment. Until now, only profit from investment in shares was taxed by the government. bd
