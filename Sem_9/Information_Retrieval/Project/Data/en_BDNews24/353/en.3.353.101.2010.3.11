<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has quashed proceedings of the Niko graft case against Sheikh Hasina, the latest in a series of graft cases to be cancelled against the prime minister. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui gave the ruling on Thursday on a petition by Hasina challenging the legality of the case. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station in 2007 against Hasina and six others for incurring losses of Tk 13,630 crore to the state through irregularities in awarding Canadian oil firm Niko Resources Ltd a deal to explore three gas fields in Bangladesh. The High Court in the past eight days has quashed four separate corruption cases against Hasina. All the four cases were filed during the BNP-led four-party alliance government while the Niko case was filed during the subsequent caretaker government. bdn
