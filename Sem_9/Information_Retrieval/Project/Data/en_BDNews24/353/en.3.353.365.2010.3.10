 Habiganj, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Habiganj court on Wednesday granted the CID seven days to question suspected HuJI terrorist Mizanur Rahman Mithu in the 'Kibria murder case'. Mithu is accused of throwing the grenade that killed former finance minister Shah AMS Kibria and four others at Habiganj in January 2005. Habiganj's judicial magistrate Shamsul Islam gave the order following a petition, seeking a ten-day remand, made on Tuesday by CID's Rafiqul Islam, the investigating officer in the case. A similar application for a 10-day remand involving former state minister for home affairs, Lutfozzaman Babar, the other accused in the case, will be heard on sunday. The Harkat-ul Jihad-al Islami member Mithu was apprehended from Alipur village of Nabiganj upazila in Habiganj on Sunday by a special RAB team According to RAB, after preliminary questioning, they handed Mithu over to Habiganj Sadar Police Station on Monday. That same night, he was taken to CID's Habiganj office and subjected to further interrogation. Six men, including HuJI leader Mufti Hannan, are now detained in jail accused of the killing. Nearly five years ago, in April 2005, Abdul Majid Khan, general secretary of the AL district unit, had filed two cases in relation to the killing. Following an application from Kibria's family, the High Court in 2008 passed an order requiring the police to undertake further investigation. Last month, the Sylhet Divisional Speedy Trial Tribunal ordered the CID to submit its new investigation report into the killings on February 7. Three previous court deadlines for submitting the report have passed. bd
