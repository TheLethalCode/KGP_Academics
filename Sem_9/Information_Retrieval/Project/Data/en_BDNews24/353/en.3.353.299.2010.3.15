 By bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh and Indian army chiefs discussed greater defence cooperation during formal talks held in New Delhi on Monday. Bangladesh army chief Gen. Md. Abdul Mubeen reached New Delhi on Sunday for a five-day tour at the invitation of his Indian counterpart Gen. Deepak Kapoor. It is Mubeen's first visit to India after taking over as army chief last year. India's defence ministry officials termed the visit as "significant in the light of improving military cooperation between the two countries in consonance with India's growing relationship with Bangladesh". Earlier in the day, Gen. Kapoor formally welcomed Gen. Mubeen during the Guard of Honour on the South Block Lawns in New Delhi. They later held talks. A spokesman of the Indian defence ministry said the meeting between General Mubeen and General Kapoor focused on areas of future bilateral defence cooperation. "Military-to-Military cooperation between Bangladesh and India encompasses exchange of high- and medium-level visits, availing of training courses in each other's institutions, witnessing of exercises by military observers from both sides, exchange of War Veterans and sharing experience in disaster management, sports and adventure activities," a press-release issued by the Ministry of Defence said. During his stay in New Delhi, Gen. Mubeen will also meet the Indian defence minister AK Antony and National Security Advisor Shiv Shankar Menon. He is likely to visit important training establishments and field formations of the Indian Army. He will also travel to Jaipur, Ajmeer and Kolkata before returning to Dhaka. Gen. Mubeen's visit to India comes just two months after chief of Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal P V Naik had travelled to Bangladesh on a goodwill visit in January this year. Mubeen is accompanied by his wife and senior officials of the Bangladesh Army.
