<TITLE> No 'money whitening' next fiscal: Muhith </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith has said there will be no scope to "whiten money", or legalise previously undisclosed income, in the next budget. "We don't want to allow any opportunity of whitening money. But we have to consider prospective investors as well," Muhith told reporters on Thursday after a meeting with a delegation of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries. The current budget offers the provision for investment of previously undeclared income over three yearswith "no questions asked"in a number of sectors, including the share market, new industries, property. Muhith did not say whether the three-year provision under the current budget would be curtailed. Similar 'money whitening' facilities have previously been offered in Bangladesh on untaxed income for limited periods. But the inclusion of an extended provision under a national budget caused a stir last year, with economists, the business community and the public debating the ethics, despite the offer's aim to boost investment in crucial sectors. Even with the offer, investment has been slow to take off this year, in particular for the much-anticipated public private partnership projects. INFLATION WORRIES Muhith said on Thursday he would place a progress report on budget implementation in the first two quarters (July-December) before parliament on Mar 16. He said he was satisfied with progress so far, terming implementation so far "the best in the country's history". But worries about mounting inflation and low investment remained. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, point to point inflation was 8.51 percent in December 2009, the highest over the last 15 months. Muhith, however, was happy with GDP growth, which now stands at 6 percent, he said. "Agricultural production is good. People are also moving towards investment ... But the progress in public private partnership is low," he said. "We are hopeful about investment. Export orders and revenue netting are performing well," Muhith said. b
