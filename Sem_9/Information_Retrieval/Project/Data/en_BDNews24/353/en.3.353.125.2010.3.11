 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of a Rapid Action Battalion constable, missing for nine months, has alleged that her husband was murdered by members of the elite security force. RAB denies any involvement in the disappearance, with the current commanding officer of the missing man's battalion telling bdnews24.com on Wednesday: "Killing people is not our work". However, the same officer also claimed they were "too busy" to search for the missing man. Yasmin Akhter, wife of RAB constable Nurunnabi, told a press conference at the Crime Reporters Association earlier Wednesday, that on April 30 last year her husband was sent from RAB-3's Tikatuli office to RAB-1's Uttara office. She said that that she has not seen him since. She claimed that three days later her husband phoned her, saying that "I am in grave danger. Pray for me. I might not get the chance to come home and see you again in my life. Go to our village residence." On May 5, two days after she received the call from her husband, she said she went to the RAB headquarters in Uttara. "His colleagues told me that Nurunnabi was not seen after May 3, and that his mobile and clothing were left on his bed." she said. "I could not meet the commanding officer despite my efforts", she added. She also said that she filed a general diary with details of the incident to the police. The wife's concerns come against a backdrop of widespread allegations, and concerns raised by human rights groups, of extra-judicial killings carried out with impunity by the elite force. Lt Col Mamun Mahmud Firoz Chowdhury the current commanding officer of RAB-3, when approached by bdnews24.com for a comment, said: "Nurunnabi's wife has alleged that we have killed him and disposed of his body. But killing people is not our work" He said the incident occurred before he joined RAB-3. Lt Col Zakir Hossain was the commanding officer of RAB-3 at the time of Nurunnabi's disappearance. The missing constable had previously been transferred to RAB from Khulna Metropolitan Police. But, Chowdhury alleged: "As far as I know, Nurunnabi had psychological problems. His behaviour was not appropriate for RAB. He had been brought to the headquarters so that we could discharge him. But he escaped before that." The RAB-3 commanding officer also suggested that they were "too busy" to search for Nurunnabi. "We have a lot to attend to. It is impossible for us to search out missing RAB personnel," he said. However, a senior RAB spokesperson countered the commanding officer's comment. Cdr Mohammed Sohail, director of the force's legal and public relations wing, told bdnews24.com, "We are giving our fullest effort to search for Nurunnabi. All battalions were instructed to look for him. We have sent summons to all police stations." bdne
