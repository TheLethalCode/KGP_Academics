 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Sunday stayed a previous High Court order that prohibited Dhaka City Corporation from dumping any further garbage at its Aminbazar landfill. A four-member Appellate Division bench led by justice Md Abdul Matin stayed the Feb 28 High Court order upon a leave to appeal by DCC until disposal of a writ petition that is pending in the High Court.
