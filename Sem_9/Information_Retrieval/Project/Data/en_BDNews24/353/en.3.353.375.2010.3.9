 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com) ---The government is set to give a maximum of Tk 15 crore per parliamentary constituency for rural infrastructure development, to be allocated through MPs. An ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Tuesday gave the green signal to the total Tk 4,691 crore project. Planning minister AK Khandaker briefed reporters after the meeting. "Allocation will be made on the basis of recommendation of the local MPs," he said adding that the MPs were earlier asked to give a list of required projects. "Each constituency will receive a maximum of Tk 15 crore," the minister said. Asked why MPs were consulted, the minister said, "Public representatives know better what development projects are needed for the people." The local government division will finance the project stretching from February 2010 to June 2014. Including the development of constituencies, ECNEC endorsed a total of 10 projects at a cost of Tk 7844 core. Of the total figure, the Bangladesh government will finance Tk 6480 crore while the rest will come as project aid. Of the other projects, the meeting approved import 300 single-decker buses from South Korea for Tk 243 crore. The Korean government will lend Tk 207 core of this at 0.5 percent interest payable within 30 years. The other projects include a Tk 1481 crore south-western rural infrastructure development project, Tk 628 crore for bridge construction along upazila and union parishad roads under the local government division, and Tk 327 crore for road construction in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar districts. bd
