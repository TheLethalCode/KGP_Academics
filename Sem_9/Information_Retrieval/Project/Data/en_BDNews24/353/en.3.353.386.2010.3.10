 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government on Wednesday took steps to curb criminal activity by mobile phone, including stricter regulations for buying and selling of SIM cards, to be effective immediately. According to the decision, those under 18 will have to buy SIM cards through their guardians. Those over 18 will have to show their national identity cards to purchase a mobile SIM card, and also needs to provide a guarantor's address and contact number. Home minister Sahara Khatun said mobile operators had been asked to enforce the decisions from Thursday. "We have taken the decisions on recommendations by mobile operating companies and law enforcers," Sahara told reporters after a meeting on curbing 'mobile phone terrorism and extortion'. "There will be a committee with representatives of mobile operators to implement the decisions. Another committee of the home ministry will also work as observers," she said. Restrictions are also being imposed on traders, who must be SSC graduates to gain a license to sell SIM cards. The minister also requested people to immediately report any threats for extortion received by mobile phone to their nearest police station. The related mobile operators should be notified also, she said. Sahara said action would also be taken against mobile operators if their SIM cards are sold without proper subscriber registration. Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner Shahidul Haque, who attended the meeting, said around 200,000 SIM cards had been blocked for illegal activities, most of them for unlicensed VoIP operations. Around 3,000 were blocked for phone crimes including threats, blackmail and extortion, he added. b
