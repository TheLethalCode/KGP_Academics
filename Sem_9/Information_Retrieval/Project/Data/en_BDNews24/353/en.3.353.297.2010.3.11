 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  A criminal case was filed on Thursday against two police officers accused of killing a suspect in their custody. Shilpi Begum, wife of the deceased Zakir Hossain, filed the case against Ramna thana police chief Shibli Noman and sub-inspector MA Aziz. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Zulfiker Hayat ordered the special police superintendent of the criminal investigation department to investigate the case and submit its report by June 6. The complaint filed with the court stated that police detained Zakir on Mar 1 on suspicion that he was involved in a car theft. On 4 March he was remanded by the court into police custody. The complaint claimed that the police then demanded Tk 50,000 from him. When Zakir refused to pay the money, the police took him to court on 7 March and he was remanded in police custody for the second time. The statement alleges he was beaten up and murdered two days later on March 9. Human rights organisations in Bangladesh regularly raise concerns about police torture of accused in custody. The complainant named herself and six other people in the case. bd
