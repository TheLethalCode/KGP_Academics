<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  A human rights organisation on Sunday filed a petition asking the High Court to issue orders requiring the relevant government bodies to supply pure and germ-free tap water to the population. Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed the public interest petition with the bench of Justices Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Naima Haider. The petition claimed that the water supplied by Dhaka's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) is contaminated and harmful for health. As result the health and lives of the city dwellers are at risk, it states. The petition states that the environment directorate's failed to respond to a prior written application asking it to take steps into the matter. The Local Government and Rural Development (LGRD) state minister, Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute (BSTI) managing director, WASA chairman and Dhaka City Corporation mayor were marked as the respondents in the petition. Advocate Manjil Morshed acted for the petitioners.
