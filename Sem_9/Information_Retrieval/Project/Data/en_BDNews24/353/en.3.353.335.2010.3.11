 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  Charge framing against former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar in a tax dodge case was deferred on Thursday for a month. Judge ANM Bashirullah of Dhaka Senior Special Judges Court granted the extra time on a petition by the defence. The judge set Apr 11 for the next hearing. Babar's lawyer Sharfuddin Ahmed pleaded for more time saying that he had not received the necessary documents to prepare for the hearing. The accused is currently behind bars serving 17 years in an arms case. He has also been shown arrested in the Aug 2004 grenade attack case and the Kibria murder case. The National Board of Revenue filed the tax evasion case against Babar on Feb 14 this year. The case statement says the former state minister, as a director of Master Electronics Industry Limited, concealed income of around Tk 8.6 crore in 1999-2000 and 2008-2009 tax years failing to pay the tax counted on it. bdn
