 ISLAMABAD, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants attacked the office of a Western aid agency in Pakistan with a bomb and gunfire on Wednesday, killing up to 5 people, police said. The identity of the casualties in the attack on the office of the World Vision agency in Mansehra district, 65 km (40 miles) north of Islamabad, was not known, police said. "They first set off a bomb and then opened fire. We don't know the exact number of casualties but initial reports suggest four to five people were killed," senior police officer Sajid Khan told Reuters by telephone. A World Vision official said up to five agency workers had been killed, most of them believed to be Pakistani. Mansehra town has been a hub for relief efforts following an earthquake that killed 73,000 people in October 2005.
