 Rangpur, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  At least 20 students were injured in clashes between activists of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL) and the Islamic Chhatra Shibir (ICS) at Rangpur Carmichael College on Monday. Kotwali police chief Abdur Rashid told bdnews24.com that they were making efforts to bring the situation under control. Witnesses said that at midday, activists of the BCL, the student wing of the Awami League, had taken out a procession welcoming new students to the college. The clash happened when activists of the ICS, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami tried to bring out a procession at the same time. During the one-hour clash, both groups chased each other with clubs and hurled brickbats at one another. The injured have not yet been identified. Following this incident, BCL activists held a further brief rally on the campus which again led to clashes as it ended at around 1:30pm. Abdullah Khan Nannu, BCL convener of the college, alleged that the Shibir activists, living in three residential halls and were equipped with arms. He demanded that they should be arrested. Shibir's college unit president Al Amin Hassan blamed Chhatra League activists for the clashes. "As we were trying to bring out a procession, the Chhatra League workers and police attacked us," he said. BCL president Rashedunnabi Jewel, however, denied they had initiated the violence. "The Shibir activists attacked us first," he said. College principal Abdul Wadud said steps were being taken to quell the situation. bd
