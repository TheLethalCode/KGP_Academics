 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com) -- Chaminda Vaas wasted little time in adopting the essence of the previous IPL - first-ball wickets - but half-centurions Angelo Mathews and Owais Shah added 130 runs in less than 15 overs to take Kolkata Knight Riders to a challenging total of 161, reports Cricinfo. Good old-fashioned swing bowling, followed by rebuilding and the late surge were much-needed and much-denied relief from a rather unwatchable opening ceremony - featuring faded stars and a fading tribute band - that delayed the toss by 27 minutes. Thankfully, the cricket began with the class of Vaas. He started on target, swinging the ball late, and Manoj Tiwary fell over playing the first ball, and lobbed it straight to midwicket. Captain Sourav Ganguly edged to first slip in that double-wicket maiden, and Cheteshwar Pujara and Brad Hodge too departed after a 31-run stand. Pragyan Ojha and Andrew Symonds initially managed to keep Mathews and Shah in check. In eight overs between them, their accurate and smart mid-innings bowling went for 45 runs despite expensive last overs that went for 21. That was just the momentum the stumbling innings needed, taking Kolkata to 103 for 4 after 16 overs. Shah, who had been quiet until then, went after the returning Vaas, hitting him for a six and four and damaging his figures. Mathews, who had started with a top-edged six first ball but had punished the youngster Jaskaran Singh, followed it up and launched his countryman over long-off. With the score reading 121 for 4 after 17 overs, Gilchrist made two bold moves. T Suman bowled the 18th over, and was punished by Mathews, who reached his fifty in that over. He carried the momentum into the 19th over, hurting RP Singh too with straight, powerful hitting. Jaskaran, preferred to Vaas for the last over, bowled three yorkers and a good slower delivery, but still went for 10. It left the Kolkata bowlers with a target to bow
