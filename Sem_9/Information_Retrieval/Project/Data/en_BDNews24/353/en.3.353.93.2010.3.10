 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka special court on Wednesday withdrew its previous arrest warrant issued against former BNP state minister Fazlur Rahman Patal on Mar 1 in a tax evasion case. Judge ANM Bashir Ullah of the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court withdrew the warrant as Patal surrendered to the court and sought bail. The court fixed Mar 28 for the bail hearing. The withdrawal order said, as the High Court on Mar 8 ordered no harassment or arrest of the accused for a subsequent eight weeks, he could remain free during the period. The same court issued the warrant against Patal on Mar 1 in a case filed by the National Board of Revenue for evading tax by concealing income of Tk 27.46 lakh. Patal sought anticipatory bail in the case at the High Court on Mar 8. The High Court bench of justices Md Abdul Wahhab Miah and Md Abdur Razzaque granted eight weeks' anticipatory bail, but also ordered Patal to surrender to the lower court and file a bail petition there. bdn
