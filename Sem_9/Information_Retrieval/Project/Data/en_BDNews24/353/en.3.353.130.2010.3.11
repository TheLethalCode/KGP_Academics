<TITLE> BNP prevented prolonged military rule: Sircar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com)--The former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has told parliament that the country could have been under a prolonged military rule if the BNP did not take part in the Dec 29 general elections. He said parliament must be kept alive for the sake of the country's overall development. Sircar, an MP elected in a by-election from Bogra, also urged the treasury bench not to undermine the contribution of BNP's founder Ziaur Rahman. "The BNP took part in the election to uphold parliamentary democracy," said Sircar who claimed himself to be an "out and out" democratic person. "If the BNP did not take part in the polls (Dec 29), they (the military-installed caretaker government) would have told some countries that they needed six more months to hold an election with all party participation," said Sircar. The former speaker pointed finger at the former military ruler Gen H M Ershad. Calling him a "fox", he said Ershad clung to power for about nine years pledging an election in six months after curbing corruption from the country. Jatiya Party chairman Ershad, now Awami League's ally, overthrew democratically elected government of president Abdus Sattar in 1982. "He (Ershad) said he was a solider and told people that he would leave office after eliminating corruption from the society. "Then the fox could detect hen pen. Since then the foxes tried to come back again," Sircar said. "We have to be careful so that the foxes should not come again," he said. "We must uphold this parliament. Otherwise, there will be no development in the country". Sircar, who served as speaker from Oct 2001 to Jan 2010, said the treasury bench MPs used to hurl invectives at Ziaur Rahman. "We believe that Ziaur Rahman declared the independence of this country. You may differ with it. "But please don't belittle his contribution to the country," he said. Sircar defended Gen Zia's move of bringing 5th amendment to the constitution, claiming it helped bury the controversy over the country's identity crisis. "Bengali nationalism was enshrined in the 1972 constitution. But the Chakmas led by Manabendra Larma refused to accept the Bengali identity". "The Garos and Santals also refused to call them Bengalis. Therefore, Ziaur Rahman resolved the debate making Bangladeshi nationalism for all through the 5th amendment," he said. Sircar also praised Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, saying he had huge contribution to the country.
