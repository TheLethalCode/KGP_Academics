 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  BTRC have detained five officials of the private land phone operator Dhaka Phone, including its chairman and general manager, on charges of providing illegal VoIP service. A team of Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (BTRC) and Rapid Action Battalion raided the Mohakhali offices of the company on Sunday, Kawser Ahmed, a junior consultant at BTRC told bdnews24.com. They searched the offices located on the 18th floor of Rupayan Tower from around 5pm to midnight. Evidence of VoIP operations, a mobile switching centre (MSC), was found, Kawser said. The officials detained are chairman Hayatuzzaman, director general (engineering) Harun-al-Atahar, director KM Shahidullah, senior manager (engineering) Ikramuzzaman and manager (billing) Hari Podder. Kawser said a case was filed on December 24 last year with Badda Police Station against the Dhaka Phone officials for illegal exchange of foreign calls. Banned equipment was also seized at that time. The BTRC allege that although the company officials were warned at that time, they again started operating illegal VoIP services.
