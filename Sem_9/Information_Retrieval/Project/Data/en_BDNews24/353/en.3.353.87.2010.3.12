<TITLE> 'Coal compensation from July' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)  The government could start paying compensation from as early as July to locals of the Barapukuria coal mine area in Dinajpur, who however entered the second day of a hunger strike on Thursday demanding immediate pay. The government promised compensation last year to acquire land from the locals to start open-pit instead of underground mining at Barapukuria. But over 1,000 people of 15 villages, under the banner of the Committee to Protect Life and Property, began a 'fast-unto-death' on Wednesday demanding immediate compensation and permanent rehabilitation from the government for the damage already caused to the area by the mine. The hunger strike continued through the second day Thursday, with at least 50 people falling ill due to severe dehydration. Ibrahim Khalil, convener of the committee said they were striking peacefully. He said their fast would continue until demands were met. He also said the mine authorities were "cheating" the affected people of the area. "They are telling us the same thing over and over in the name of negotiation." Locals said top-ranking officials of Petrobangla signed a memorandum of understanding on May 15 last year for Tk 35 lakh an acre to recompense the locals and had assured them of meeting all their demands by last December. But, they said, the chairman of state-run Petrobangla, which owns the mine, at a meeting with the locals on Jan 17, asked for another month and again, on Feb 19, requested them to wait until July. Meer Abdul Matin, general manager (mining) for the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd (BCMCL), told bdnews24.com, "We have nothing to do right now. We have submitted a Tk 300 crore proposal to the government that covers land acquisition and rehabilitation of the affected people of the area." An inter-ministerial meeting on Thursday discussed the proposal to acquire a total of 646 acres around the mine, as concerns rise about the ongoing hunger strike. The government says it has been negotiating with 1,300 affected families of Barapukuria to acquire the land of seven villages in four phases between 2010 and 2013. Thursday's meeting decided to start paying compensation from July to August of this year. "The process is underway and hopefully we'll finalise the amount by June," an official said, quoting state minister for land Mustafizur Rahman Fizar, who is the local MP and attended the meeting. The meeting, headed by state minister for power Muhammad Enamul Huq, was also attended by energy adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, officials of the law ministry, Petrobangla and the coalmine. It decided to set the amount of compensation following both land acquisition law and the example of compensation plus relocation costs during the Padma Bridge project, in line with a directive by the prime minister. But one official who attended the meeting told bdnews24.com that new legislation may be required to settle the compensation and rehabilitation. This was also discussed in the meeting, he said. BCMCL began commercial operations in 2005. To extract the targeted one million tonnes of coal per year through open pit mining, to feed more coal fired power plants in Barapukuria, the government needs to acquire 300 acres of land around the mine immediately, according to the energy ministry. Currently, of the total extracted coal from the mine, 65 percent goes to a 250MW power plant at Barapukuria and the remaining is consumed by local industries such as brickfields and households. It is estimated that the mine has a reserve of 390 million tonnes in the 668 hectare (6.68 sq km) coal basin area. b
