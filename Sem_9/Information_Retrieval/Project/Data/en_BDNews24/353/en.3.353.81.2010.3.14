<TITLE> No relief to acute power crisis 'until June' </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)Loadshedding in towns and cities will continue for a few more months because of increased power supply to the agriculture sector, the energy advisor said Sunday. "We're supplying more power for irrigation and hence city dwellers will have to face interruptions in electricity supply," Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, prime minister's advisor on power and energy told reporters after attending a roundtable in the capital. The advisor said the situation is expected to improve after June. Bangladesh faces a year-round power crisis. But the situation worsens with the onset of summer when vastly more electricity is consumed to draw greater amounts of underground water for consumption as well as irrigation on farms, and for use of fans and air conditioners especially in densely populated areas. Peak power production has reached around 3900MW over the last few days, against a peak demand of 5100 MW. There is an average power shortfall of around 19 percent in the capital against the demand, while it is around 25 percent in other zones. FARMERS FACING CRISIS TOO Despite the "increased power supply" to the agriculture sector, farmers say they too are facing a crisis that is causing havoc for irrigation. Farmers in the Chalan Beel area of Pabna district have been unable to water some 20,000 hectares of Boro lands for the last one month as frequent fluctuations in electricity supply to farm lands have laid waste to pumps. Saifuddin Ehiya, president of a local deep and shallow tube wells owners association, said around 500 electric pumps have broken down in Chatmohor, Bhangura and Faridpur upazilas in the Chalan Beel area due to frequent 'load shedding' and 'low voltage' periods during the last one month. Officials of the PBS offices, under the Rural Electrification Board, responsible for local distribution, say they, in turn, are not receiving enough power from national supplier the Power Development Board, which is the cause of frequent blackouts and brownouts .
