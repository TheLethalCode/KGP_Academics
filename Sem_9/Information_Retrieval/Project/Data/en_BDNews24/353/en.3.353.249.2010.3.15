 BANGKOK, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of anti-government protesters started to move on Monday towards a military base in Bangkok where Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva has his crisis headquarters, putting pressure on him to call fresh elections. The red-shirted supporters of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra have given the government an ultimatum to call elections by midday on Monday or face crippling demonstrations. The protests, which began on Friday and involved more than 150,000 people on Sunday, have been peaceful so far, Monday's march could stoke local anger by adding to the congestion in Bangkok and violence could hurt financial markets. As elsewhere in Southeast Asia, foreign funds have been flowing into Bangkok's stock market -- to the tune of $812 million (536 million pounds) over the past three weeks -- despite the increase in political tension. Kosin Sripaiboon, an analyst at UOB Kay Hian Securities, said that might slow on Monday and the market could edge down. "No one really knows how this is going to end," he said. "Foreign inflows should slow as they gauge the situation. If all this fizzles out by midweek, we should see the flows pouring back in again." Foreign investors worry any violence could derail a nascent recovery in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy. Their recent buying was based on three factors: Thai assets are already trading at a substantial risk discount, the economy has rebounded well from the global downturn despite bouts of unrest; and, Abhisit is widely expected to survive the showdown. The protesters caused immediate congestion in parts of the capital as they started moving from their rally site in the centre before 9 a.m. (2 a.m. British time), mostly on motorbikes and pickup trucks, aiming to regroup at the military base by noon (5 a.m. British time). Protest leaders hope a powerful display of popular support will force Abhisit to dissolve parliament and call an election that Thaksin's allies would be well placed to win. They also want to convince wavering partners in his coalition to break away. "We will march over there, brothers and sisters. We will go to the infantry to get an answer from Abhisit himself," said Nattawut Saikua, a leader of the protest group, the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), at a rally on Sunday. "With this many people on the streets, I don't see how he still thinks he has any legitimacy," he added. Abhisit and his coalition are unlikely to bow to the pressure, the latest in a seemingly intractable political crisis pitting the military, urban elite and royalists, who wear yellow shirts at protests and back Abhisit, against mainly rural Thaksin supporters who wear red and say they are disenfranchised. Most of the protesters travelled from Thailand's poor, rural provinces, piling into pick-up trucks, cars and even river boats, illustrating Thaksin's influence despite his removal in a 2006 coup, a graft conviction and self-exile. MEDIUM-TERM RISKS Abhisit must go to the polls by the end of next year, which presents medium-term risks for economic stability. Thaksin's allies are likely to win those elections, just as they have won every poll held since 2001. The military and urban elite could seek to overturn that result, possibly with a coup, as in 2006, or a judicial intervention, as in 2008. In his weekly television address on Sunday, Abhisit indicated immediate elections were unlikely, citing the tense political climate and his coalition government's parliamentary majority. Authorities have deployed 50,000 police and soldiers to control the crowd across the city. Last April, protests by Thaksin supporters triggered Thailand's worst street violence in 17 years. In recent months, they have emphasised non-violence -- and Thaksin's rhetoric has softened since last year when he spoke of a "revolution." But without causing a big disruption, they may have trouble forcing elections, said Charnvit Kasetsiri, a political historian at Thammasart University. "It's hard to pressure the government if the crowd is under control," he said. The protesters say the British-born, Oxford-educated Abhisit came to power illegitimately, heading a coalition the military cobbled together after courts dissolved a pro-Thaksin party that led the previous coalition government. Adding to their anger, Thailand's top court seized $1.4 billion of Thaksin's assets last month, saying it was accrued through abuse of power. Thailand was plagued by political upheaval in 2008, when yellow-shirted protesters who opposed Thaksin's allies in the previous government occupied the prime minister's office for three months and then blockaded Bangkok's international airport until a court ousted the governme
