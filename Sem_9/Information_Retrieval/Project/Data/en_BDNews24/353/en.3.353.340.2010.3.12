<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 11 (bdnews24.com) - The market was mostly in the red in the past week, so was the daily turnover. Market analysts said this fall was a sign of decreasing market participation. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark, the general index or the DGEN, opened the week at 5640.94 points and closed at 5499.84, falling 2.5 percent or 141 points over the week. Of the five trading days, the bourse was up only on Wednesday. The week began with a slight drop in the index due mainly to fall in banking shares, which account for over 45 percent of the total market capitalisation. On Sunday, the daily turnover stood at Tk 9.6 billion. Experts, however, cited the fall in the index as an outcome of price correction. "Price correction, mainly in banks was the reason behind the fall as well as uncertainty over the DSE polls, which had had an impact over the market," according to Arif Khan, deputy managing director of IDLC Finance. Sunday's session at the Dhaka Stock Exchange saw rising trend for the first hour followed by a gradual decline towards the end, putting all sectors except energy into the red. Energy shares managed to gain on the news of the government's hike of 6 to 7 percent in electricity tariffs. Meanwhile, the High Court, on the same day allowed two DSE members, to take part in the bourse's board elections. The HC ruling paved the way for ex-DSE president Ahmed Iqbal Hasan and senior vice president Ahmed Rashid Lali to file nominations. On March 3, the Securities and Exchange Commission cleared 10 out of 13 aspirants for filing nominations. The ruling also asked SEC to explain its order regarding the DSE polls and why it should not be declared 'unlawful'. The market watchdog issued a directive on February 14 for all the contestants to obtain a 'no-objection' or 'clearance' certificate from them to take part in the polls. On Monday, the market dipped further with the benchmark general index losing 2.07 percent or 116 points--the largest single day fall since February 28. The day saw all the major sectors including financials, mutual funds, telecom and energy to fall. IT shares, however, rose. Market participators blamed random regulatory interferences for the slumping market. "General investors are quite nervous and uncertain due to frequent regulatory moves," mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com on Monday. The turnover fell 22 percent from the last session which stood at Tk 9.6 billion to Tk 7.46 billion, the lowest since December 24. Tightening credit facilities by the SEC also reduced the investors' purchasing capacity, according to brokerage house officials. Early last month, the SEC reduced the loan margin ratios for the brokers and merchant bankers to cool down the market. On Tuesday, the index plunged about 1.5 percent while the turnover hit a five-month low. The general index fell 1.56 percent or 86 points from the previous day with the turnover dropping by 15 percent to Tk 6.30 billion. All the major sectors suffered losses but banks gained marginally. Tuesday's trading left 178 scrips to decline out of the 243 traded. A section of frustrated investors staged demonstration in front of the DSE, chanting slogans against the market regulator. Market observers said that investors' confidence was rattled due to repeated bouts of regulatory moves over the last few months. "The continuous fall in turnover signals that investors are in a exit mode," said Zaid Bakht, research director of BIDS. Brokerage house officials said that the number of investors coming to the trading floor was decreasing everyday. On Wednesday, the market bounced back riding on banks and the market heavyweight, Grameenphone (GP). Rumours swirled on the day that the regulator might reset the margin loan criteria, which also contributed to the hike. Mercantile Bank led the banking sector with highest 6.71 percent gain, followed by Dutch Bangla Bank and AB Bank, which were up by 6.10 percent and 2.81 percent respectively. GP shares were up by 4.59 percent, reaching Tk. 339.40 per sahre at the end of the session. Meanwhile, mutual fund also moved up The daily turnover, continued to fall. It fell 0.78 percent to reach at Tk 6.25 billion, hitting a six-month low. The falling turnover indicates decreasing market participation echoed by brokerage house officials. "Small-scale investors' participation was low, only the high-rollers traded," an official of brokerage firm Latif Securities said on Wednesday. The closing day of the week was marked with a slight fall as the index edged down by 0.35 percent with almost 65 percent of the traded issues losing value. Volatility ruled on Thursday as the general index gained 30 points in the first hour followed by a slump of 60 points in the next hour. It somewhat recovered as the index ended 19 points lower than the last session's closing. Banks, the market bellwether, lost on that day, eroding the last two days' gains. At the same time, most of the insurers also lost. Oil shares fell on that day but power shares rose except the Power Grid Company of Bangladesh. Mutual funds and lease financers ended mixed with heavyweight GP moving up by 0.11 percent. Thursday's daily turnover edged up to Tk 6.72 billion from the previous session's Tk 6.25 billion. The daily average turnover of the week was lost by 11.73 percent from last week's average of Tk 8.22 billion to Tk. 7.26 billion. Lanka Bangla Finance, Beximco, Bex Tex, GP and Summit Power were the week's turnover leader.
