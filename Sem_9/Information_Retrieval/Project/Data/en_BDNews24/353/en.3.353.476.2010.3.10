<TITLE> Power boost provides no relief </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 9 (bdnews24.com)  Peak power production topped 4000MW over three days this week, for the first time since September last year, but with consumption rising too on some of the hottest days of the year so far, the surge brought no relief from the power crisis as load shedding continued unabated. Maximum generation ranged from 4025MW on Saturday to 4081MW on Monday, from an average of around 3700MW peak time power production last month. Although power development officials were pleased, ordinary consumers failed to feel the benefit of the extra 350 MW production as demand during the peak time rose by 450 MW. An official from the power and energy ministry explained that the reason for the power boost was more fuel being directed to the gas-run power plants. "The supply increased as the government has decided that the power sector will produce more electricity over the summer period to keep up with demand," Mohammad Hossain, director of the ministry's power cell, told bdnews24.com on Monday. The active gas-based power plants around the country consume around 700 million metric cubic feet daily (mmcfd) - which is around 35 percent of the country's total gas production. Ninety percent of Bangladesh's electricity comes from these gas-run plants. Despite this increased gas supply, however, shortages remain. On Monday, power production fell short about 772MW of capacity due to lack of gas. The 120MW Siddhirganj Power Plant, recently opened by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina, according to the plant's project director, generated only 32MW on Tuesday as a result of gas shortage. Abdul Aziz Khan, managing director of Titas Gas told bdnews24.com that along with the Power Development Board it was "closely monitoring the power generation status and deciding on whether to increase or reduce gas supply to the plants." The power ministry is also considering whether to halt production of inefficient plants which consume high levels of gas. Power cell director Mohammed Hossain explained that with just one-third of the gas currently supplied to the 60MW Shikalbaha power station, another plant of the same capacity could be operated. Meanwhile, maximum power production fell to 3900MW again on Tuesday, against the average peak demand of 5100MW in Bangladesh. bd
