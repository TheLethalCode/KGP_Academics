 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh were on the back foot after England declared their first innings one short of 600 runs and then snatched five wickets on the second day of the first Test at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on Saturday. By the close, Bangladesh were 154 for five with Tamim Iqbal unbeaten on 81. The hosts made a horrible start losing opener Imrul Kayes and Junaid Siddique to the bowling of Stuart Broad before tea. Bangladesh lost their first wicket with the score on 13 when Kayes was caught behind for four while Junaid was caught and bowled for seven with the Tigers on 27.

The left-hander was eventually caught and bowled by Mahmudullah to leave the tourists in a commanding position of 487-4 at lunch. Cook struck 16 fours and two sixes in his 283-ball knock.

Collingwood was eventually out for 145 off 188 balls with 10 fours and four sixes and his partner Bell (84) fell three runs later allowing Cook to end the run-feast 40 minutes before
