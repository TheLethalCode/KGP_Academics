 Syed Nahas Pasha, London London, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)A Bangladesh born computer software developer for British Airways appeared in a London court on Thursday accused of "planning suicide bombings and his own martyrdom". Rajib Karim (30) volunteered to work as a member of BA's cabin crew during a strike, the City of Westminister Magistrates Court heard. It is alleged he was plotting with his terrorist bosses abroad "to commit an atrocity". He faces three charges under counter-terrorism act: conspiring to prepare acts of terrorism in Britain, preparing for terrorism overseas and fund-raising for a terrorist organisation. One charge involves the UK and the other alleges that he plotted with contacts in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Yemen. Karim, of Newcastle upon Tyne, deliberately stayed in Britain, obtained a passport and getting a job at the airline to further the conspiracy, the court heard. He was arrested by officers from Scotland Yard's Counter Terrorism Command, working with colleagues in the North-East, on February 25. They swooped on the office complex where he worked in Newcastle and searched his home in the city in north east England. Forensic experts are continuing to sift through hundreds of files held on computers seized from his workplace and home. Inquiries are also understood to be under way in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Yemen to trace others allegedly involved. Prosecutor Colin Gibbs told the court that the charge sheet alleges Karim shared information about his work, including security measures, and offered to take advantage of planned strikes by BA staff to join the airline's cabin crew. All offences are alleged to have taken place between April 2006 and last month. At the city's court Karim, a well-built men with a thin beard and closely-cropped hair, wearing a black fleece, spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth in the 15-minute hearing. His solicitor James Nicolls said he did not want his client's address made public for fear of reprisals against his young family. He did not apply for bail. No formal order was put in place banning its publication. District Judge Timothy Workman remanded Karim in custody and the case was adjourned until 26 March at the Old Bailey court in London. Scotland Yard also arrested three men in Slough, Berkshire, during the inquiry. They were released without charge on Tuesday.
