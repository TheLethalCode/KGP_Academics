 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  Home minister Sahara Khatun on Saturday said drives against petty drug peddlers without apprehending 'godfathers' would not resolve the problem. She told the Rapid Action Battalion to find the actual godfathers to uproot the problem once and for all. She also urged the guardians, teachers and people's representatives to be more conscious of their children's activities. Sahara was speaking at the RAB-1 headquarters in the capital at a drug destruction drive. A total of 96,217 bottles of Phensidyl, an opiate-based cough medicine banned in Bangladesh, and 875 kg of marijuana were destroyed, as part of countrywide anti-drug programmes. Since RAB was formed in March 2004, the elite force has seized 2,06,984 Yaba tablets, 5,092 Ice pills, 182,779 kg heroine, 11,741 kg marijuana and 1,323,788 bottles of Phensidyl. It also arrested 19,402 drug dealers across the country in that time. But Sahara said on Saturday: "It is not possible to build a drug-free society arresting just the drug dealers. You have to expose the real godfathers." "Drug addiction can only be reduced if the godfathers, or major suppliers, are taken to task," the minister told the RAB officials. State minister for home Shamsul Haq Tuku, meanwhile, took the opportunity to hammer the past government, accusing the BNP four-party alliance for creating the scope for a flourishing illegal drug trade in the country. Indicating the main opposition BNP, he said that on one hand they added 'Bismillah' to the constitution, while on the other hand they introduced 'anti-Islamic' activities by patronising and 'licensing' the godfathers of the drug trade. Tuku said the border police and other law enforcing agencies were told to be alert to prevent drug smuggling across the border. Among others, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandaker and inspector general of police, Noor Mohammad, were also present. bdn
