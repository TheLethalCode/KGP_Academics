<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, March 11 (bdnews24.com)  Barapukuria residents continued their hunger strike for the second day on Thursday, demanding compensation and permanent rehabilitation from the government for subsidence caused by underground mining. Over 1,000 people of 15 villages around Barapukuria Coal Mine began a 'fast-unto-death' on Wednesday under the banner of the Committee to Protect Life and Property. Ibrahim Khalil, convener of the committee said they were observing fast peacefully. He said earlier that the fast would continue until the demands are met. The strikers cited the Barapukuria Coal Mine authorities "fraudsters" as they gave assurances but made no arrangement to rehabilitate the affected families. Officials of state-run Petro Bangla held talks with the affected people last year and signed a 10-point deal. They also assured the residents of fulfilling their demands by December. In January the Petro Bangla chairman talked with local people and took another month. In the February meeting he sought time up to July. Mir Abdul Matin, managing director (mining) of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd, told bdnews24.com that the matter was now no more in their hands. "We have submitted a proposal of Tk 350 crore to the government for the rehabilitation of the affected. The decision is now up to the government," he said. Matin said the government would sit in a meeting on the matter on Thursday. No untoward incident was reported till midday, additional police have been deployed to avoid any such incident, said Sanjit Kumar, senior assistant police superintendent. bdn
