 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The winner of a Boishakhi TV dance contest filed a case on Wednesday against the programme makers as the prize-money cheque was reportedly twice rejected by a bank. Srabanti, the winning contestant in an episode of the 'Padmakuri', filed the case with Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrates Court against the programme's chief executive Md Shahidullah Prince and chief coordinator Abul Kashem Shohag. Magistrate AKM Emdadul Haque took the case into cognisance and ordered the two accused to appear before the court. The case statement said despite the prize money being previously announced as Tk 1 lakh, Srabanti was given a Mercantile Bank cheque of Tk 85,000. The bank refused to honour the cheque on Dec 17 and then again on Dec 29 last year as there was not enough cash in the account to pay the amount, the case details said. Bidhan Chandra Saha, lawyer for the plaintiff, told bdnews24.com that the "fraudsters" did not respond though he had sent them legal notices. Boishakhi TV, in a statement, said the programme makers Prince and Shohag were not employees of the private channel. "They worked on a contractual basis," the statement said. The two accused bought airtime for their programme under the TV channel's previous management, it added. bd
