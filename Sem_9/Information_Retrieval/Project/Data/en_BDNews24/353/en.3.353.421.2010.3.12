 Rangpur, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  At least 50 potato farmers were injured after police tried to break up a demonstration in Rangpur on Friday. The farmers, demanding adequate storage facilities for their produce, laid siege on the Dhaka-Rangpur Highway for about four hours in the morning from 5.00am. Mithapukur police chief Altaf Hossain told reporters that the police was trying to bring the situation under control but did not confirm about the number of injured. Traffic resumed at around 10.00 am as the police finally managed to disperse the farmers. Potato farmers are in a precarious situation since market price of their produce has fallen sharply due to over production and lack of cold storage facility. According to the agriculture department, Rangpur produced about 1.5 million tonnes of potato this year. A large number of farmers had gathered at the gates of Shah Sultan Cold Storage under Mithapukur sub-district in Rangpur from Wednesday. But they began demonstrating when cold storage officials told them of their inability to provide any more space, according to locals and the police. Farmers told bdnews24.com that their potatoes would rot if they were not kept in a cold storage. They said that they had borrowed heavily to invest in potato cultivation. But if they did not get a good price for the produce it would spell doom for them. Shah Sultan store manager Mostafizur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the warehouse had a capacity of holding 210,000 sacks of potatoes, and had already taken in 180,000 sacks. Together with previously stored goods, the warehouse has already reached full capacity, he said. "At this point it is not possible for us store any more potatoes." bdne
