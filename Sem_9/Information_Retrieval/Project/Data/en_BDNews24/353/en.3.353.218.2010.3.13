 by bdnews24.com New Delhi correspondent New Delhi, March 13, 2010 (bdnews24.com)  Water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen will visit New Delhi next week to hold the first Joint River Commission (JRC) ministerial meeting in five years with his Indian counterpart Pawan Kumar Bansal. The meeting is being held against the backdrop of the recently concluded "successful summit" between prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Manmohan Singh in New Delhi in January. According to diplomatic sources, the 4-day talks scheduled for March 17-20 is expected to focus mainly on the sharing of Teesta water, a prime concern for Bangladesh. However, they will also discuss issues relating to other common rivers like Feni, Manu, Muhuri, Khowai, Gumti, Dharla and Dudhkumar. Officials at the Indian Ministry of Water Resources said that both countries were hopeful of making significant progress in resolving the issues related to sharing of Teesta water. Although the issue was expected to be settled before the January summit, Dhaka and New Delhi failed to do so because of disagreement between the two countries' respective positions. However, the India-Bangladesh Joint Statement issued during Hasina's visit to New Delhi did stress on early conclusions of the issues related to sharing of Teesta. "Recognizing the sufferings of the people of both sides in the face of scarcity of lean season flows of the Teesta River, the Prime Ministers (Hasina and Singh) expressed that the discussions on the sharing of the Teesta waters between India and Bangladesh should be concluded expeditiously," stated the Joint Statement. The two prime ministers had directed their respective water resources ministers to convene the ministerial-level meeting of the Joint Rivers Commission in the first quarter of 2010. India's Minister of State for Water Resources Vincent H Pala recently stated in the Lok Sabha that the 1996 Treaty on Sharing of Ganga / Ganges Water was being "implemented to the satisfaction of both the countries" since 1997.
