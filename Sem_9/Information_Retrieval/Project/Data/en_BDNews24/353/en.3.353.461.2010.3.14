<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  The Pilkhana mutiny trials will resume on Monday at Durbar Hall following a 48-day break. "Approximately 300 members of the 36 Rifles Battalion under the Dhaka Sector are accused of having taken part in the mutiny and will face trial in this coming period," Manjur Alam Manju, special prosecutor of the court, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam will preside over the trial taking place in Special Court-5, which has been set up at Darbar Hall under the Bangladesh Rifles Order-1972. The majority of those accused from 36 Rifles have already been detained in prison on charges of murder in a separate criminal case to be pressed by civil prosecutors for the Pilkhana killings. About five are absconding, Manju said. The trial of the Pilkhana mutiny suspects started on Feb 23 - but was adjourned after just two days. Over 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, were killed during the Pilkhana mutiny of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. The government formed six special courts last year, including two in Dhaka, to try approximately 3,500 border guards who have been accused in 40 separate cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts will only prosecute for the offences of mutiny and rebellion under BDR law. Trials involving other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, will be held in civilian courts. The first of the mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers.
