<TITLE> UK presses for MDGs by 2015 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, March 13 (bdnews24.com)The UK will press world leaders to agree to an ambitious action plan to get the Millennium Development Goals back on track for 2015. The plan is to target six countriesincluding Bangladeshwhich are home to half of all undernourished children in the world. International development secretary Douglas Alexander launched the new strategy at a conference in London on Friday. The meeting took place ahead of the publication of an international assessment of what is needed to achieve the MDGs of the UNDP. The report is expected to lay out in stark terms the areas where progress has been weak and set out concrete action to achieve the goals by 2015. The conference organised by the Department for International Development is aimed at tackling the most off-track MDGs  agreed in 2000 - including hunger and nutrition, maternal and child mortality and education. It is estimated that up to two-thirds of countries could fail to meet these crucial targets. Alexander used the gathering of development experts to put forward a number of bold proposals that will be incorporated into the international negotiations ahead of a key UN summit in September. "There has been some real progress towards the Millennium Development Goals but we must accelerate progress if we are to realise them by 2015", Alexander told the conference. "Business as usual is not enough. We need leaders from all countries around the table to endorse a global action plan which will benefit hundreds of millions of people in the developing world. "We are now just five years from meeting the MDGs  it's not too late but time is short". "I firmly believe there is more the international community can do and that is why I am using today's conference to identify how best we can work together to get the goals back on track." He proposed doubling of aid for basic education and health services for mothers and children. He also underlined Britain's commitment to playing its part to achieve the goals with funding for new vaccines that will protect children from pneumonia and diarrhoea in over 40 countries, saving 800,000 lives over the next five years. The new strategy will address the devastating impact that malnutrition has on life-expectancy, health and long-term productivity, and will have a direct impact on the life chances of 12 million children by 2015. Under the new strategy, efforts will be focused on Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. Each country will draft an action plan to address the particular challenges of local conditions. The efforts will first focus on India, a country which is home to 40 percent of the world's malnourished children. DFID will invest an additional 110 million over the next five years in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, where every second child is underweight. The plan will set out how to save two million children from malnutrition. Douglas Alexander said at the conference that the UN Summit in September must be used as a turning point towards achieving the MDGs. This conference will set out proposals for: -International partners to double aid for basic education in low-income countries from $3 billion to $6 billion per year;  a global programme to tackle malnutrition;  the global community to increase levels of aid to fragile countries from the current 30 percent to 50 percent by 2015; and,  a doubling of global aid for maternal, newborn and child health from $4 billion to $8 billion per year. Alexander said that the UK would continue to identify new and innovative programmes that would maximise aid efforts. He announced a package of measures to help developing countries tackle issues such as immunisation, climate change, lack of access to financial services, malnutrition and maternal health: The package includes:  New vaccines against pneumococcus in 42 countries and a vaccine against rotavirus in 44 countries, potentially saving 800,000 children's lives by 2015 from the biggest child killers  pneumonia and diarrhoea. An amount of 150 million would go to the GAVI Alliance (formally the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) for the purpose.  To fight global malnutrition, a new strategy will target 12 million undernourished children, whose lives would otherwise be blighted by physical stunting, reduced mental ability, and poorer prospects in education and employment. Measures to swiftly address malnutrition will include vitamin and mineral supplements for pregnant women and infants; promotion of breast feeding for newborns; providing zinc to combat the effects of diarrhoea and promoting better hygiene.  A push for more free healthcare in the developing world, by providing financial support and expert advice to help countries to deliver free healthcare for women through a new (5m) Centre for Progressive Health Financing. Through UK support, Sierra Leone will launch free health care next month
