 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  Finance minister AMA Muhith has expressed dissatisfaction over high interest rate charged by the micro finance institutions. "There are many allegations against the micro finance institutions including high interest rates that ensnare the borrowers in perpetual debt, and low rate of technology use," Muhith said in his address on Monday at the opening of a three-day conference in Dhaka titled 'Microfinance Regulations: Who Benefits?" He also alleged that micro finance activities could not help poverty alleviation. The poor should be benefited from microfinance regulations, the minister said. He said BRAC, the world's largest non governmental organisation, launched microfinance activities in Bangladesh in 1974, which got institutionalised through Grameen Bank later. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman stressed on minimising supervision costs to slash interest rate. He said the government and the regulators could help the micro finance institutions in minimising their cost. The central bank boss said that it was the 'populist political authorities' who criticise the relatively higher interest rates and fees, rather than the 'actual borrowers'. Rahman, chairman of the micro-credit regulatory authority, said the micro finance institutions provide financial services to around 24 percent of the adult population. On the other hand, 44 percent of the population are served by banks and 10 percent by co-operatives respectively. Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation chairman Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad alleged that many micro financing institutions lacked skill and transparency. "In reality, a borrower must give a total of 25 percent interest to pay back the loan in 46 instalments at 10 percent interest rate," he said. Representatives of 20 countries are taking part in the conference being held at the Sonargaon Hotel. Microcredit regulatory authority organised the conference in the country for the first time. b
