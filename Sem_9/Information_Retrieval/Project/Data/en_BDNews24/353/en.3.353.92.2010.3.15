<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  The special court resumed proceedings on Monday to try some 300 Pilkhana mutineers at Darbar Hall following an 18-day break. The court began at around 10am at Special Court-5, with BDR director general Maj Gen Mainul Islam in the chair. At the start of the proceedings nayek subeder Md Giasuddin, the complainant in the case, read out the charges against the 310 accused, all of them members of the 36 Rifles Battalion under the Dhaka Sector. He said that 241 of the accused are now detained in prison charged with offences over the Pilkhana killings. Gias sought a court order to arrest the rest of the accused. He alleged that 104 of the accused were in the Darbar Hall on the day of the incident while the others were engaged in looting outside the Hall. The trial of the Pilkhana mutiny suspects started on Feb 23 but was adjourned after just two days. Over 70 people, nearly 60 of them army officers deputed to the border force, were killed during the Pilkhana mutiny of Feb 25-26 2009. Rebellion spread to other BDR camps around the country. The government formed six special courts last year, including two in Dhaka, to try approximately 3,500 border guards who have been accused in 40 separate cases in connection with the Pilkhana mutiny and associated rebellions in different districts. The special courts will only prosecute for the offences of mutiny and rebellion under BDR law. Trials involving other serious crimes, including murder, rape and arson, will be held in civilian courts. The first of the mutiny trials began at Rangamati on Nov 24 against border guards accused of taking up arms in rebellion and solidarity with the Pilkhana mutineers.
