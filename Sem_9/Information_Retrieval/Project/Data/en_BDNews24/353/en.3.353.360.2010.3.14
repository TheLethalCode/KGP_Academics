<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling party Awami League on Saturday challenged the opposition BNP to show the proof to back aspersions of corruption they had aired against the prime minister's son. Local government minister and AL general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam went as far as to threaten the main opposition BNP of "hard action" if it fails to present evidence of any link between Sheikh Hasina's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed and the illegal VoIP business. "Show your documents and evidence to the nation by seven days," Ashraf said at a meeting on Saturday. "But if you fail, the grand alliance won't sit idle. It will react with tough action." "The nation won't accept the presentation of wrong information and propaganda," he added. Ruling party whip and Awami League standing committee member Mirza Azam, also warned the opposition not to make derogatory remarks against Sajeeb Wazed, known popularly as Joy. "BNP want to show that Tarique and Joy are 'equal'. We will take any necessary actions, both political and legal, if these kinds of remarks continue," Azam told reporters at a press briefing on Saturday. Azam claimed the opposition was spreading propaganda against Joy only to veil the "ugly face and stained politics" of their leader Khaleda Zia and her two sons Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque, speaking in parliament earlier in the week, alleged that Joy was involved in illegal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations. Azam refuted the graft allegations against Joy on Saturday. "Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed is a role model to the hundreds of thousands of young people in Bangladesh. On the other hand, Tarique has become another name for corruption," he said. Farroque had also called for probe into the allegations he brought up in parliament. "If the government wants, we are willing to help by providing all necessary data," he had added. Responding to a query by reporters on that comment, Azam said, "We accept the challenge. Tell them to make public all documents what they have." The AL leader also said the party forum would decide whether to file a defamation case against the allegation. Farroque made the allegation in parliament last Thursday. On Friday, he reportedly received death threats by phone for "speaking against the prime minister's son". bdne
