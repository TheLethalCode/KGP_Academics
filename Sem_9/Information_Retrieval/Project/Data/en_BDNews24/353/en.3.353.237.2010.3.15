 LONDON, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Gordon Brown strongly condemned on Monday a planned strike by British Airways cabin crew, putting him on a collision course with his main union backers weeks before an election. Brown, who is battling to maintain ruling Labour's 13-year-grip on power in an election expected on May 6, said the seven-day airline strike was "unjustified and deplorable" and should be called off. The Unite union which has called the strike is the largest financial backer for Brown's Labour party and its political director Charlie Whelan was once Brown's spokesman. "It's the wrong time, it's unjustified, it's deplorable, we should not have a strike. It's not in the company's interest, it's not in the workers' interest and it's certainly not in the national interest," Brown told BBC Radio 4. "I hope that this strike will be called off," he said in an interview on the Woman's Hour programme. BA cabin crew plan a three-day strike starting next Saturday, followed by a four-day stoppage from March 27, jeopardising Easter holiday plans for thousands of travellers. CONSERVATIVE ATTACK The opposition Conservatives, their opinion poll lead shrinking in recent surveys, accused Brown of hypocrisy. "Gordon Brown cannot have it both ways. He can't condemn the strike whilst at the same time taking money from the strikers' union and while at the same time allowing Charlie Whelan, the political director of that union, to have open access to 10 Downing Street," opposition finance spokesman George Osborne told a business summit. "In the end it's a question of leadership for Gordon Brown. He has to cut off the links with the Unite union which is a party within a party now for the Labour Party," he added. The Labour party was founded by the union movement, which remains its main financial backer. However, unions are far less powerful than in the 1970s when they used to hold regular policy meetings with the Labour government. The number of days lost to strikes is greatly diminished after the Conservatives curbed union power in the 1980s . The prime minister's spokesman declined to comment on a newspaper report that Brown had called Unite joint general secretary Tony Woodley over the weekend to discuss potential solutions to the strike. The strike centres on pay and staffing levels. British Airways said it welcomed Brown's statement but said it remained available for further talks with Unite A Unite spokeswoman told Reuters that "informal lines of communications remain open" between itself and BA and that Unite "stands ready" to talk to the airline's management if it wants the re-open official discussi
