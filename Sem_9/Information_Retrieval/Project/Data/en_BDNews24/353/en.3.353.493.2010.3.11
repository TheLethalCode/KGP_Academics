<TITLE> Optimist Ronaldinho eyes next two World Cups </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldinho is confident of a securing place in Brazil's World Cup squad despite coach Dunga's apparent dismissal of the forward as part of his plans. The 29-year-old AC Milan player reckons he can convince Dunga to give him another chance in South Africa after disappointing at the 2006 World Cup and 2008 Olympic Games. "I'm always very positive. If I'm playing very well at Milan... I believe I will take part (at the World Cup)," Ronaldinho told Radio 730 as reported on the Goiania broadcaster's website (www.radio730.com.br). "And not only at this World Cup, but also in 2014. It's my dream. I hope to remain at a very high level until then and I hope to play in both those World Cups." The 2014 finals will be hosted by Brazil. Dunga said last week after a World Cup warm-up against Ireland that Ronaldinho, who helped Brazil win their fifth world title in 2002, had his chance at the Olympics and now the choice was in the coaching staff's hands. Ronaldinho's form dipped after he inspired his former club Barcelona to the 2006 Champions League title but he believes he is back to his best and is prepared to play out of position to secure a place in the World Cup squad. "My level is the same, the difference is that in Spain we (Barcelona) won a lot of titles. The titles are missing here at Milan but I think my individual level is the same," he said. "As for my position, I've already played in the middle, I've played more up front. At Barcelona and here too I played more on the left. I've already played centre-forward and also more on the right. So, for me there's no problem adapting.
