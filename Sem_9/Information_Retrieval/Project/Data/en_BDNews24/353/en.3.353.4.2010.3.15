 Dhaka, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday asked the government to test the level of carcinogens in the tap-water supplied by Dhaka's Water and Sewerage Authority with assistance from the World Health Organisation. The court also asked the Bangladesh Standing Testing Institute (BSTI) to undertake other tests to determine the quality of the drinking water The order came following a public interest petition filed on Sunday by the organisation Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh which had asked the High Court to issue orders requiring the relevant government bodies to supply pure, chemical and germ free tap water to the population. Advocate Manjil Morshed, who acted for the human rights organisation, told the court that "According to the constitution, as part of the basic needs to sustain life, every citizen has the fundamental right to get pure and germ-free water." "It is the government's duty to protect the health of the people", the lawyer told the court. In its order, the High Court asked the secretary to the Local Government and Rural Development to test WASA's water at the WHO's laboratory and find out whether it contains the carcinogen, tri-halo-methane. It asked for the report to be submitted within four weeks. Tri-halo-methane (THM) is formed in drinking water as a by-product of the chlorination of organic matter that is present naturally in raw water. The Court also ordered the BSTI's managing director and the chairman of Science Laboratory to collect water samples from Lalbagh, Islampur, Gulshan, Banani, Khilgaon, Malibagh and Elephant Road and to test them at their facilities. It asked for a report to be submitted within two weeks. The High Court bench of Justices Mohammad Momtazuddin Ahmed and Naima Haider also asked the government to explain why it should not order the relevant government bodies to supply pure and germ-free tap water to the population and use permanganate, rather than chlorine, to treat the water. The LGRD state minister, BSTI managing director, WASA chairman and Dhaka City Corporation mayor have been asked to respond to this part of the ruling within two weeks. The state was represented by deputy attorney general Mostofa Zaman.
