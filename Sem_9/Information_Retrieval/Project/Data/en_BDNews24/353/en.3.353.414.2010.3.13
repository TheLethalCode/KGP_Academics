<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  At least 10 people were injured after clashes between police and pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League activists on Saturday in connection with the first year honours admissions process at Rajshahi New Government Degree College. College principal Farida Sultana told bdnews24.com that BCL activists were "obstructing the admission process" which only resumed after 12:30pm under heavy police presence. Police detained three BCL activists in connection with the incident. Chhatra Maitree, however, claimed one of the detainees as one of theirs. Rajpara police chief Anisur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they went to the college after its authorities informed them that a group of Chhatra League were obstructing the admissions process. As police tried to bring the situation under control the BCL activists locked in clashes with the law enforcers, he said. Additional police force arrived at the spot to quell the situation, Rahman said. The detainees were taken to police station, he added. Witnesses said BCL activists went to the campus and vandalised three rooms at around 11am. They also reportedly drove the aspiring entrants out of the college. They later damaged a number of vehicles in front of the college. As police tried to stop them, the BCL activists hurled brickbats at the law enforcers that sparked off the clash. Chhatra League had halted the admission process on Thursday too demanding a "quota system". bdn
