<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 09 (bdnews24.com)BNP senior leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP claimed in parliament that the judiciary had been "nakedly interfering" into the activities of the executive. While delivering his speech Tuesday on the president's parliamentary address, the opposition MP said parliament's constitutional mandate of enacting laws had gone to the Supreme Court. "We cannot perform our duties of enacting laws as has been enshrined in our constitution. "Parliament's responsibility of passing laws has gone to the Supreme Court," said Chowdhury who criticised the judiciary for declaring the 5th amendment void. The BNP MP defended the 5th amendment to the constitution and termed the High Court's ruling to revoke it, "unacceptable". The 5th amendment, passed in 1979, legitimised the martial law promulgated by the BNP's de facto founder Gen Ziaur Rahman and allowed religious parties to resume politics. It also changed the secular character of the original constitution. If the HC ruling on the 5th amendment is finally upheld by the Appellate Division, Bangladesh's original (1972) constitution would be revived  resulting in a ban on the politics of religious parties such as the BNP's ally Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, which opposed Bangladesh's independence in 1971. The BNP MP went on to say that parliament was the "highest court of the country". "But now, the judiciary asks the government to distribute blanket to the Aila victims in Satkhira. "This is a naked interference of the judiciary into the executive," said Chowdhury. Chowdhury also rejected the judgment on the warrant of precedence placing the district judges ahead of the secretaries. Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon MP, however, refuted Chowdhury's comment. "Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury defended the 5th amendment, but he and I walked out of parliament protesting the 5th amendment in the second parliament (in 1979)," Menon told parliament sitting two seats away from the BNP MP. Chowdhury was then a MP elected from the National Democratic Party, he reminded the House. Menon praised the judiciary for declaring the 5th amendment illegal. "The judgment on the 5th amendment will play a great role in the country's democratic practice. "We had been waiting eagerly for such a judgment," said Menon who was elected under the Awami League election symbol. He said there were instances in many countries that judiciary asked the executive to do something for public interests.
