<TEXT>
 TEL AVIV, Mar 15 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hollywood producer Jon Landau said on Sunday he and director James Cameron were considering a sequel to 3D blockbuster "Avatar" among several new projects. "This is the first week we are not thinking about 'Avatar'," Landau told reporters at a conference sponsored by the Israeli technology firm Matrix a week after the movie lost out to the Iraq war drama "The Hurt Locker" for best picture and director at the Oscars. "We are talking about an 'Avatar' sequel as well as a small love story called 'The Dive' and a movie called 'Fantastic Voyage'." Another project planned by the duo was "Battle Angel Alita," based on a Japanese novel set in the future and centering on a young female cyborg's quest for self-discovery. Landau said a decision on which project they would pursue first would be taken within six months.

With global ticket sales of $2.6 billion, "Avatar" is the highest-grossing film ever, eclipsing Cameron's Oscar-winning blockbuster "Titanic," also produced by Landau. Landau said he was not disappointed that "Avatar," which won three Oscars in technical categories, failed to net the major prizes. "We made 'Avatar' to communicate to the masses, not to please 6,000 Academy members," he said. Landau said he believed all screens would move to 3D, including mobile devices, computer screens and televisions, adding that he recently met officials from Internet telephony firm Skype, who were interested in 3D technology. He said he foresaw a future in which the audience would determine what path a film followed. "Imagine going to the same movie three times and having three different experiences because the audience you are with takes a different path," he sa
