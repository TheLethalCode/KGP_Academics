 NEW DELHI, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Holders Germany will meet Australia in the men's hockey World Cup final on Saturday for the third successive tournament. Olympic champions Germany thrashed England 4-1 in the first semi-final on Thursday to stay on course for a third straight title. World number two Australia, beaten in 2002 and 2006 by Germany, then edged out Netherlands 2-1 in a closely fought contest.

Linus Butt added a fourth goal 10 minutes from time. "We were just awesome together. We defended solidly as a team and allowed just one goal," said Haner. Luke Doerner scored his seventh goal of the tournament and Glenn Turner his sixth to put Australia on top against the Dutch before penalty corner specialist Taeke Taekema replied.
