 SINGAPORE, Mar 13 (Reuters) - Paying for extras has become routine for airline passengers but it doesn't mean they like it, with a poll showing more than half all travelers hate having to fork out to choose their seat. The online poll of nearly 2,000 people by website Airfarwatchdog.com, asked respondents which airline fees they despised the most. Paying for the privilege of picking their seat was the biggest bugbear for 52 percent of respondents, followed by paying to change flights -- something which irked a third of passengers.

According to Rick Seaney, chief executive of online ticketing website Farecompare.com, there are than a dozen different fees that airlines add onto the basic ticket price, including fees for ticket rescheduling, oversize bags and meals. One of the more controversial charges, put in place by Southwest Airlines and United Airlines in the United States following passenger complaints, involves asking overweight passengers to buy a second seat, which can be refunded if the plane is not full. Several major U.S. carriers, including American Airlines and Continental Airlines, have said they would continue to explore new fees and cost-cutting measures to enhance profitability while demand for air travel among business customers picks
