 Dhaka, March 25 (bdnews24.com)The government has appointed Nurul Alam Chowdhury as the next Bangladesh ambassador to Oman,. The post has been lying vacant since July 2009 when the former ambassador Abdul Hannan was posted to Geneva. Chowdhury was elected an MP in 1973 and contested the general elections in 1986 as an Awami League candidate. This is at least the sixth political appointment to senior diplomatic posts since the Awami League took office on Jan 6 last year.
