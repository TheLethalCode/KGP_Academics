<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com) - Cost of shipping containers to Europe has doubled since the present government came to power, a prominent businessman alleged on Sunday. Syed Manzur Elahi, Apex Group chairman and a former caretaker government adviser, said the cost of sending a container to Europe had fallen to $600 under the immediate past caretaker government. "It was $1700 during the previous BNP government and now, since the present government came to power, it has gone up to $1200 again. This is how the cost is increasing due to bribes," he told an Economic Reporters Forum meeting on 'financial crimes'. Elahi also claimed there was manipulation in the stock market by certain quarters and the SEC "knows about this but is not taking any measure". "Many small investors risk loosing their money and become paupers," he added. Elahi expressed his disappointment with the present situation. "In the future the situation will reach a point where it will be hard to run business honestly," he said. "I only see darkness in the future if the political leadership does not take any measure," he added. Moinul Islam, an economics professor at Chittagong University alleged former presidents Ziaur Rahman and HM Ershad were responsible for the corruption and criminalisation of politics in Bangladesh. He also raised concerns that the ACC has been kept "ineffective for the last one year" under the present Awami League government. Islam said during the last caretaker government real efforts were made against corruption. ACC chairman Golam Rahman said, "Financial crime is increasing in society day by day. This type of crime is becoming harder to detect." "Price of commodities has gone up astronomically. This is also a part of economic crime," Rahman added. "Most of the financial crimes do not fall under the ACC's schedule. In these cases the ACC cannot do anything." bdnew
