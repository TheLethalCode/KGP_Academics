<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)A three-day agriculture symposium concluded Thursday with calls for comprehensive agrarian reforms, to protect farmers' interests and ensure self-reliance in food production. The call came from every quarter including farmers, politicians, economists, researchers and activists. They agreed that the prevailing agricultural system was such that it gradually marginalised the farmers and needed an overhaul to make it friendlier towards the producers. Speakers pressed for formation of a commission, led by the prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to oversee those reforms executed in policies and laws. The symposium, organised by the Campaign for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods (CSRL), a coalition of about 200 national and local development organisations across the country, saw about 40 papers covering such varied topics as WTO and community forestry. Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, president of the Bangladesh Economic Association, present at special guest, stressed that development must be people-centric and the country's development initiatives had to prioritise the interests of the poor. He also said the typical mindset, of embarking on development initiatives with foreign funding, had to be done away with. Ahmed saw the main problems in agriculture, however, as lack of investment in research and a clear lack of coordination among ministries. Vice-chancellor of the Bangladesh Agricultural University, MA Sattar Mandal, said reform is absolutely necessary to protect the interest of farmers. He also called for the establishment of a commission. Shawkat Momen Shahjahan, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture, present as chief guest, said reforms had to be "sensible" and take in "the realities of the day". Shahjahan said he would propose formation of the prime minister-led commission at the parliamentary body he heads. CSRL convener Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, presented the keynote paper at the concluding session and also stressed on the importance of research. He called for the introduction of new crop varieties that could be more resilient to changing climate and pointed out that these could only be discovered through rigorous research. AM Bdrul Hassan, a former economic minister at Bangladesh's mission in Geneva, said there was no alternative to boosting domestic food production. He also said food security of the poor countries should be given highest priority in international negotiations led by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation instead of under the World Trade Organisation. CSRL member secretary Ziaul Hoque Mukta moderated at the symposium's closing session at the National Press
