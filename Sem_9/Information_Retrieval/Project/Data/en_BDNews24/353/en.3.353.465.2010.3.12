<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)The US State Department's 2009 Human Rights Report on Bangladesh, released Thursday, raised concerns over unlawful killings by security forces, which continued unabated, and reports of rising political violence. It also highlighted the government's failure to investigate the deaths in custody of alleged BDR mutineers. The State Department's latest annual human rights reports identified several general trends across the globe including government efforts to silence dissent. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the annual reports - legally required by Congress - as "an important tool in the development of practical and effective human rights strategy by the United States government". The reports hit out at current foes China and Iran, citing constraints on Internet communications; new and often "draconian" restrictions on civil society groups; and the persecution of vulnerable groups, such as minorities, women, children and the disabled. The State Department also said that over the past year many governments had applied "overly broad interpretations of terrorism and emergency powers" as a way of limiting the rights of detainees and other basic human rights. The reports carried a new concern this year too about growing anti-Muslim discrimination in Europe. It highlighted last year's ban on the construction of minarets in Switzerland as an example. RECORD IMPROVED 'SOMEWHAT' The Bangladesh report recognised that "the government's human rights record improved somewhat due to the return of a democratically elected government and the repeal of the state of emergency." The elections in December 2008 and the peaceful transfer of power in January 2009 ended two years of rule by a military-backed caretaker government. "Civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces," the report said. 'SERIOUS ABUSE' REMAINS But despite the return of a democratically elected government there remained cases of "serious abuse", the report said, including custodial deaths, arbitrary arrest and detention, and harassment of journalists. The reports notes that according to the Bangladesh government's statistics, there was a 3 percent increase in the number of killings by all security personnel. It states that despite public statements by high-ranking politicians that the government would show "zero tolerance" and would fully investigate all extrajudicial killings by security forces, "the government did not take comprehensive measures to investigate these cases." According to media reports, local and international human rights organizations, and the government, law enforcement officials were responsible for 154 deaths, 129 of which were attributed to crossfire, representing a 3 percent increase from the previous year. The RAB accounted for 38 crossfire killings; members of the police were responsible for 63; combined security units consisting of the RAB and police were responsible for 25; and the army committed three crossfire killings. In relation to killings by RAB in particular, the report said although there was a 40% drop in the number compared to the previous year  from 68 to 41 - it notes that the government has not prosecuted any RAB officer. Using figures provided by human rights organisations, the report states that the use of torture, which it says had decreased in the last year of the interim government, rose again last year. The report states that the RAB, military, and police "frequently employed severe physical and psychological abuse during arrests and interrogations." POLITICAL VIOLENCE "With the return of an elected government, reports of politically motivated violence increased 3.3 percent," the report said. The report states that political violence resumed following the end of the state of emergency, with opposition party supporters claiming harassment by ruling party supporters. Referring to a report by one human rights organisation, it stated that 251 deaths were suspected of being politically motivated. DISSENT Restrictions on holding rallies and processions ended with the withdrawal of the state of emergency in December 2008. The new government generally permitted rallies to take place but on occasion used Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code to prevent opposition political groups from holding meetings and demonstrations. Section 144 authorizes the administration to ban assembly of more than four persons; according to human rights groups, the administration used this provision at least 82 times during the year. At times police or ruling party activists reportedly used force to break up demonstrations. BDR DEATHS On February 25-26, members of the BDR staged a mutiny, alleging poor pay and benefits, as well as corruption among senior officers drawn from the army, the report noted. During the two-day mutiny, BDR soldiers killed 57 officers and 15 of their family members, including the director general and his wife. Security forces subsequently arrested more than 2,000 individuals allegedly involved in the uprising According to media reports, 59 BDR members arrested in the wake of the February 25-26 mutiny died in custody. "There were credible reports that many of the deceased had been tortured. To investigate these allegations, the government formed a committee, which concluded that only two members died as a result of torture. No other government action was taken," said the report. "Family members of the victims alleged they died after being tortured ... several BDR members taken into custody claimed the RAB and police physically assaulted and beat them, administered electric shocks, blindfolded them, and hung them upside down while in custody; NGOs alleged army personnel also were involved in custodial deaths." The report noted that the government announced an investigation and promised to publish a report by July regarding the nature of the deaths but failed to publish any report. The government investigation ruled that only two members died due to torture and that the others died as a result of illness or suicide. At year's end the government had not taken any action regarding the deaths or allegations of torture. ATTACKS ON JOURNALISTS Attacks on journalists continued to be a problem, the report said. There was an increase in individuals affiliated with the government or ruling party harassing, arresting, or assaulting journalists. According to human rights and media watchdog groups, at least three journalists were killed, 84 were injured, one was arrested, 45 were assaulted, 73 were threatened, and 23 had cases filed against them during the year. According to some journalists and human rights NGOs, journalists engaged in self-censorship for fear of retribution from the government. CORRUPTION AND TRANSPARENCY Referring to official corruption and government transparency, the report said the government "did not implement anti-corruption laws effectively". It also observed that approximately 1,817 cases filed mostly against ruling party leaders were withdrawn over the year, including cases filed against prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
