 LONDON, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burnley remained in the Premier League relegation zone after a 1-1 draw at home to Stoke City on Wednesday earned them their first point in five games. Mid-table Stoke went ahead with yet another goal from their long throw-in routine, Tuncay Sunli getting the finishing touch to Rory Delap's aerial delivery.

Burnley are third from bottom with 24 points from 29 games, behind Wolverhampton Wanderers on goal difference
