 Barapukuria, Mar 11 (bdnews24.com)At least 50 Barapukuria hunger strikers fell sick on the second day of a 'fast-unto-death' by locals demanding compensation and permanent rehabilitation from the government for the damage caused to the area by underground mining. The sick hunger-strikers initially refused to receive any medical facilities provided by the upazila administration. However, they were later treated with glucose and saline intravenously. Over 1,000 people of 15 villages around the Barapukuria Coal Mine in Dinajpur began their fast Wednesday under the banner of the Committee to Protect Life and Property. Ibrahim Khalil, convener of the committee said they were striking peacefully. He said earlier that their fast would continue until their demands were met. He said the mine authorities have been cheating the affected people of the area. "They are telling us the same thing over and over in name of negotiation." Locals said top-ranking officials of Petrobangla signed a memorandum of understanding on May 15 last year to recompense the affected people and assured them of meeting all their demands by December. But the chairman of chairman state-run Petrobangla, which owns the mine, at a meeting with the locals on Jan 17, ask for another month and again on Feb 19, requested them to wait until July, they said. Meer Abdul Matin, general manager (mining) fo the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Ltd, told bdnews24.com, "We have nothing in our hands now. We have submitted a Tk 300 crore proposal to the government that covers land acquisition and rehabilitation of the affected people of the area." Superintendent of police Sanjit Kumar, duty police officer in the mine area, said the hunger strike was very peaceful. However, police force was deployed to thwart any untoward situation. bdne
