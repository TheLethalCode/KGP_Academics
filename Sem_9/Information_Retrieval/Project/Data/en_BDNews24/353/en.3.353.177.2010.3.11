 New Delhi, March 11 (bdnews24.com)Chiefs of Bangladesh Rifles and India's Border Security Force on Thursday vowed to step up cooperation aimed at checking cross-border movement of terrorists and other criminals, while exercising restraint to ensure that innocent lives are not lost on the border between the two neighbours. Maj. Gen. Md. Mainul Islam, director general of the Bangladesh Rifles and his BSF counterpart Raman Srivastava said that the two border forces were keen to enhance mutual cooperation guided by the spirit of the India-Bangladesh joint statement issued during Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to New Delhi in January this year. Islam and Srivastava were addressing a joint news-conference at the end of the four-day border coordination meet in New Delhi. The BDR chief said that the he had taken up with Srivastava the issue of frequent intrusion and firing by the BSF personnel along the Indo-Bangla border resulting in the death of innocent Bangladeshi civilians. "We have got a very positive response and we hope to reduce the number of such incidents in future," said Islam. The BDR and BSF are also working on a Joint Border Management plan to ensure better coordination between the two forces. In the four-day meeting, the BDR chief is believed to have specifically raised the issue of recent troubles on the India-Bangladesh border at Jaintapur in Sylhet. Srivastava said that the BSF always took the BDR's complaints seriously and had in the past initiated actions against a few of BSF troops for illegally entering into the Bangladesh territory. He, however, added that the BSF would continue to seek cooperation from the BDR to check cross-border movement of terrorists and criminals. The issue of terrorists' movement came under sharper focus after the Rapid Action Battalion recently arrested five operatives of the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit JeM from Dhaka on Feb 28. One of the arrested JeM operatives, Nannu Mia alias Billal Mandal, reportedly told his interrogators that he had helped the terrorists involved in hijacking of the Indian Airlines flight IC 814 on December 24, 1999 to cross over to India from Bangladesh. The BDR chief presented to his BSF counterpart a draft Joint Border Management Plan. The BSF officials will now examine the draft and give their suggestions.
