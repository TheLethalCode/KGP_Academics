 Jessore, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  A local Bangladesh Chhatra League leader was stabbed to death on Sunday after clashes between two factions of the pro-government student body in Jessore. The assailants stabbed Ripon Hossain, convenor of a local BCL unit, in Jessore town's Kathaltola area around 5pm, Kotwali police chief Abdul Kader said. "Ripon's murder could be the aftermath of armed clashes that took place on Saturday night over formation of BCL's district committee," he said. "But nothing can be said for sure before investigating the matter." A bi-annual conference of the BCL's district unit on Saturday night was upset by violent fighting between two factions during the voting. Gunfire and explosions during the clash left 15 injured, including Beg. "The two factions are blaming each other for the clash on Saturday night. The situation is still heated," the Kotwali police chief said. Meanwhile, the residence of a local Awami League leader Imam Hossain Lal at Shashthitolapara was bombed twice on Saturday night and Sunday morning. "However no one was injured in the blasts", Beg said. A local AL leader Abdul Aziz was also stabbed at around 1.30pm on Sunday. He was admitted to Jessore General Hospital, police said. Police filed a case against 500 unnamed 'BCL activists' over the armed clashes on Saturday. Both factions of BCL held rallies in the city on Sunday "protesting the clashes". bdn
