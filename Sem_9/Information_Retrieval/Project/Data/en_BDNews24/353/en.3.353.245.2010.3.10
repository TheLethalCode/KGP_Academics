 NEW DELHI, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congress party head Sonia Gandhi said on Tuesday its ruling coalition was intact, despite a key ally breaking ranks to abstain as a bill to reserve a third of parliamentary seats for women was passed by the Rajya Sabha. Already under fire over issues such as food inflation and a proposed hike in fuel prices, the government has been hit by two days of turmoil trying to push through the legislation. While the Congress-led coalition still has a majority, the stand-off may give the government less breathing room over key pending economic legislation. Sonia Gandhi, seen as the country's most influential politician, was asked by reporters whether she was confident in the stability of the government. "I think so. One can never tell.

Trinamool faces an election in its stronghold state of West Bengal next year where about 20 percent of voters are Muslims. The women's bill is a test for Congress, which sees the quota as a cornerstone of its election-winning platform of inclusive growth, but which might lose some political capital needed to push economic reforms and maintain high growth. The bill, which was first introduced in 1996, is intended to speed up women's empowerment in a country where women lag far behind on many social and health indicators. Women lawmakers and activists shouted "we have made it" outside parliament. Seven lawmakers were suspended on Tuesday and physically evicted from the house, and the sessions adjourned several times as those against the bill besieged the speaker of the house to shout slogans and stall the de
