<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 15 (bdnews24.com)Home minister Sahara Khatun has told parliament that the government is addressing the killing of innocent Bangladeshis by the Indian Border Security Force. Replying to a question from independent MP Fazlul Azim, the minister said diplomatic initiatives were on to reach a permanent solution. "A total of 14 Bangladeshis have been killed by the BSF in 2010 so far," she said. "The government has been trying its utmost to resolve the problem. We want to a permanent solution," the minister said terming the murders "unfortunate". "Diplomatic initiatives are ongoing on in this regard." She said. Sahara said prime minister Sheikh Hasina during her Delhi trip in January discussed BSF killings with her Indian counterpart seeking a halt to civilian deaths. Director general-level talks also just concluded between the two border forces in New Delhi on March 11 with both sides vowing greater cooperation. BSF gave full assurances to stop intruding into Bangladesh and to exercise restraint aimed at preventing loss of innocent lives on the shared borders. BSF INTRUSIONS, SHOOTING UNABATED Despite these assurances, at least thirteen Bangladeshi civilians were injured by BSF fire as the Indian border force breached the Jaintapur border in Sylhet again, leading to a two-hour shoot out with Bangladesh Rifles on Sunday. BDR Sylhet sector deputy commander Major Kohinoor Alam told bdnews24.com that the incident was sparked as 50 Indian fishermen illegally entered Bangladesh to fish in Dibir Haor at around midday with a contingent of BSF guards for 'protection'. Last week, on Friday, BSF reportedly intruded 100 yards inside Bangladesh at the Padua border in Sylhet and dug 15-20 bunkers before being forced to retreat after a flag meeting.
