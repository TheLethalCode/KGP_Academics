<TEXT>
 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)  Nearly 50,000 new voter applications have been rejected in three southeastern districts with large Rohingya populations, for identity fraud, during the updating of voter rolls. The applications were rejected by a special scrutiny committee formed to re-examine the voter registration forms following the Election Commission's suspicions that thousands of illegal Rohingya immigrants from neighbouring Myanmar were trying to secure voting rights in Bangladesh. Publication of draft updated voter lists in 12 upazilas in Rangamati, Bandarban and Cox's Bazar districts has been suspended. The Election Commission will give its final verdict shortly on nearly 50,000 out of around 70,000 applications received for inclusion in the updated voter rolls of the 12 upazilas. EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar said that the special committee from January 4 to February 4 visited the addresses given in the application forms to check their authenticity. Election commissioner Muhammad Sohul Hossain told bdnews24.com, "After we heard allegations that the Rohingyas are registering as voters during the updating process, we ordered the formation of the special committee for re-inspection." After re-inspecting 62,509 registration forms the committee has rejected 45,866 applications in six upazilas in Cox's Bazar alone; out of 7,151 applications in four upazilas in Bandarban, 2,220 have been rejected; in Rangamati, nearly one thousand applications have been cancelled. The EC will not accept any appeal on the rejected application as the deadline to do so passed on March 8. An estimated 300,000 Rohingya refugees took shelter in 1991-92 as the Myanmar military launched a massive crackdown on the Muslim minority. Bangladesh and Myanmar, with the help of the UNHCR, repatriated most of the refugees in successive years. But over 28,000 refugees refused to return either fearing persecution or starvation there. They are now housed at Nayapara and Kutupalong camps maintained by the UNHCR. The Bangladesh government has since alleged that most of the repatriated refugees have intruded back into Bangladesh and are here as illegal immigrants without refugee status. The EC found evidence during the updating of the voter list in November that in some upazilas of Bandarban, Rangamati and Cox's Bazar districts illegal Rohingya immigrants were registering as voters. The special committee was formed in December to re-examine the voter registration applications in response to reports from intelligence services and the media too that Rohingyas were becoming voters using false identities. The committee is composed of voter registration officials, local government representatives and administration. Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) of Pekua, HAM Humayn Kabir, told the bdnews24.com, "As per the government instruction, 90 percent of the applications were rejected either because no evidence was found that they are local inhabitants or their failed to provide any land documents." The EC had started to publish the draft voter list from March 8. In the first phase, list of 17 districts will be published followed by the second and third phase with 20 and 26 districts respectively. Election commissioner Hossain said, "The list will be published in these areas after the scrutiny. Local body elections will be held in these places later." bdnews
