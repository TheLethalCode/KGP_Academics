 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)The government has agreed to undertake comprehensive wind mapping to assess the prospect of wind power in Bangladesh. The announcement was made by the prime minister's energy adviser Tawfik-e-Elahi Chowdhury at a roundtable on Sunday organised by 'Energy and Power' magazine. Chowdhury said that by 2021 renewable energy needs could contribute one-third of the total power generated in Bangladesh. The government's meteorological department does currently map wind strength, but the results are misleading as the equipment used was installed 30 to 40 years ago, Md Fazlur Rahman, managing director of Pan Asia Power Services Ltd, and contractor of the Kutubdia 1 megawatt wind power plant told the roundtable. Two previous wind-mapping reports  one by Dhaka University and the other by Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)  have indicated that a wind power is not feasible. Md Fazlur Rahman, however, said that to determine whether wind power could be effective in Bangladesh, integrated wind mapping of the 740km coastal belt in the South was necessary. Rahman is a strong advocate of wind energy, arguing that the cost of producing power from this natural resource is just Tk 12 per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to Tk 25-30 for solar plants. He also pointed out that wind turbines don't require much land and can be established in remote areas. Tajmilur Rahamn, an official of the Germany-based lending agency KFW, told the roundtable that there should be a technical evaluation of the existing pilot projects in Feni and Kutubdia. The 900W wind-power plant in Feni is currently non-operational due to technical faults, Mollah Amzad Hossain, moderator of the discussion told bdnews24.com. He said the plant will soon be revitalised. Syed Yousuf Hossain, chairman of Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission, said the sector has great scope to generate 'green jobs' as well as meet energy needs. "We've misused gas and it's high time for us to look for alternatives now," he added. The newly-formed Sustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA) is expected to start functioning in 3 to 4 months and will work to increase usage of renewable energy and to ensure greater energy efficiency, the advisor said.
