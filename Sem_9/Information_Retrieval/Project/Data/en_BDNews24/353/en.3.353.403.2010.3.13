<TITLE> Power flux causing headache for farmers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Pabna, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)As the power crunch worsens with the onset of hot weather, frequent fluctuations in electricity supply to farm lands are causing havoc for irrigation. Farmers in the Chalan Beel area of Pabna district have been unable to water some 20,000 hectares of Boro lands for the last one month. The huge Chalan Beel area consists of Chatmohor, Bhangura, Faridpur and Sathia upazilas of Pabna; Ullapara, Shahazadpur, Tarash and Rayganj upazilas in Sirajganj district; and Boraigram, Lalpur and Gurudaspur upazilas of Natore. Farmers attacked a sub-office of Handial PBS at Chatmohor last week demanding an end to the power crisis. The next day, in a meeting at Handial High School, they threatened to set fire to a Pabna Palli Bidyut Samity (PBS) office. Officials of the PBS offices, under the Rural Electrification Board, responsible for local distribution, in turn, say they are not receiving enough power from national supplier Power Development Board, which is the cause of frequent blackouts and brownouts. Saifuddin Ehiya, president of the deep and shallow tube wells owners association of Handial, said around 500 electric pumps have broken down in Pabna's Chatmohor, Bhangura and Faridpur upazilas in the Chalan Beel area due to frequent 'load shedding' and 'low voltage' periods during the last one month. Some 320,000 hectares of land are irrigated drawing water from 3,487 deep and shallow tube wells with power supplied by Pabna PBS, according to Saifuddin. He told bdnews24.com the paddy was "loosing colour" without water. "The samity is not taking appropriate steps despite our appeals." "We manage our food for the whole year from the rice we grow in the Boro seasons," he added. Saifuddin himself has cultivated Boro paddy on 50 bighas of land. Other farmers of the area, Abbas Ali, Abul Kashem and Zaher Ali, echoed his frustrations. But PBS officials say the Power Development Board does not supply even one quarter of the power they need to meet the local demand, which causes the problems, especially fluctuations and low voltage. General manager of Pabna PBS-1, Md Omar Faruque, told bdnews24.com they receive a maximum of 10 megawatts during the peak period and 14-15MW during low periods, whereas the demand is actually 34MW and 25MW during the two slabs respectively. The PBS distributes electricity to 620 deep and 2,786 shallow tube wells and 100 low-lift irrigation pumps, according to Faruque. "We've been trying to ease the problem by load management and installing capacitors," he said. The agriculture officers also want to see an end to the power crisis. Zaman Azam, deputy director of Pabna Agricultural Extension Division, said, "The issue needs to be addressed urgently." Citing government steps to provide fertiliser, seeds and pesticides at lower prices, he said, "If power supply improves there will be a bumper production of Boro this year." bdnew
