<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP is going to organise a grand rally in Chittagong on Mar 27 as part of its month-long countrywide 'mass communication tour'. "Khaleda Zia will inaugurate the countrywide assemblies from Chittagong on Mar 27. It will be followed by similar assemblies in other divisions," BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain told reporters at the Naya Paltan party office Wednesday. "It is from Chittagong that our leader Ziaur Rahman declared the independence in March 1971. At present, an unstable situation is prevailing in the Chittagong Hill Tracts." "A conspiracy is being hatched to give away Chittagong port to another country. Considering the circumstances, it was decided to start our programme from Chittagong," Mosharraf said. Mosharraf, responding to a query, said: "There is competition for the leadership, but no infightings within the party. All senior leaders of Chittagong were present in today's meeting. This proves that there are no factional feuds in Chittagong BNP." On Mar 5, BNP declared to initiate a 'mass communication tour' this month aimed at strengthening organizational activities and preparing for a tough movement against the government's anti-state activities. The tour will continue until April 17.
