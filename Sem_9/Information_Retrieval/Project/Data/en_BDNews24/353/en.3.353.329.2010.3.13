 Dhaka, March 13 (bdnews24.com)--Bangladesh will soon give Bhutan 18 of its products duty-free access, commerce minister Faruk Khan has said. The foreign ministry, in a statement Saturday, said Bangladesh would "soon implement its commitment, made by prime minister during her Bhutan visit, to give duty-free access of (Bhutanese) products". "We have already prepared a list of 18 Bhutanese products which will get duty-free access to Bangladesh," Faruk Khan told bdnews24.com. Bangladesh and Bhutan's foreign secretaries, after a meeting at the Burimari border on March 12, said the formalities for giving the facilities were in the "final stage". "The final list has now been forwarded to the National Board of Revenue through the finance ministry for necessary action," Khan said on Friday. Bangladesh enjoys duty-free access for all products to Bhutan, commerce ministry officials said. Despite this, its exports to the Himalayan kingdom total less than $1 million, and include warm garments, computer accessories, dry foods, pharmaceuticals, toiletries and textile items. Bhutan's exports to Bangladesh, on the other hand, totals around $14 million, according to the commerce ministry figures. Bhutan's main export items are mineral products, foodstuffs, fruits, beverages and oats. The commerce ministry has added vegetables, ginger, particle board, semi-finished iron and materials in the duty free products list. Faruk Khan told bdnews24.com that Bhutan's duty free access of the products would ensure smooth supply of vegetables and fruit products at cheaper prices in the country.
