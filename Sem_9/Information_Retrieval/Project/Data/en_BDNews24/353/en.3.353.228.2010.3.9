 Dhaka, March 9 (bdnews24.com)--The capital market is passing through an uncertain phase because of arbitrary intervention by the regulators, according to market experts. "General investors are quite nervous and uncertain due to frequent regulatory moves," mutual fund operator Yaweer Sayeed told bdnews24.com on Monday when the prime bourse of the country fell by 2 percent. Dhaka Stock Exchange saw its highest ever turnover of Tk 16.92 billion on Feb 2. But on Tuesday it dropped to Tk 6.29 billion, a 37 percent fall in 25 trading sessions. Under the law, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is obliged to protect the interest of the investors. However, its recent move to intervene in the Dhaka Stock Exchange's board election is seen by experts as unjustified. In a directive issued on Feb 14, the SEC made obtaining a 'no-objection' or 'clearance' from them mandatory before filing nominations in the board elections. The directive reads that the market regulator took the decision according to the section 20A of the Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969, which empowers the SEC to take such action. According to the aforesaid section of the ordinance, the commission can issue any order or directive to all stakeholders 'in the interest of investors or securities market or for the development of securities market'. Market observer and research director of BIDS Zaid Bakht said that such type of intervention over who can sit on the board of a company is not desirable. "It amounts to interfering in a company's autonomy." The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) is a public limited company, which is responsible for listing of companies, operating the market and facilitating trade of shares. The move does not ensure protecting investors' interest, Bakht told bdnews24.com. "It is more like interfering in a company's operation and in no way it can benefit the investors," added Bakht, who also is member of the SEC's advisory committee. There are allegations from some quarters that the current DSE president Rakibur Rahman was behind the SEC move in an apparent effort to influence the DSE board. The board elections were scheduled for March 3 and the deadline for filing nominations was on Feb 15. The SEC directive came just a day before that deadline. The SEC move prompted the current DSE board to postpone the elections, which will now be held on March 21. On March 3, the market watchdog cleared 10 out of 13 aspirants for filing nominations. The three who didn't get cleared were ex-DSE president Ahmed Iqbal Hasan, ex- senior vice president Ahmed Rashid Lali and Anwar Hossain. Despite several attempts, the SEC chairman Ziaul Haque Khondker could not be reached for comments on the matter; members of the commission also declined to comment. Speaking to the press, Ahmed Rashid Lali said that the decision would hurt the market badly. "As an aspirant for the DSE polls, I have the right to know why I was not cleared," he said. Transparency and accountability in all the realms of the capital market is needed to protect investors' interest, added Lali. SEC SPARKS DOUBTS WITH REGULATIONS According to market watchers, the SEC appears to be acting irrationally after the current chief took office in May 2009. On November 2009, the regulator asked issuers to refund IPO subscriptions directly to the investors' bank accounts rather than handing or posting the refund warrant. The move created a huge hassle for a good number of IPO aspirants of Golden Son, who are yet to get their refund, almost after four months. The same thing happened with some other mutual funds. Following the incident, the SEC recently directed issue managers to refund the IPO subscription according to investors' preferences. In another example regarding the High Court ruling on mutual funds' bonus and rights shares, the SEC said that it would appeal against the ruling. It caused a slump in mutual fund prices, affecting many investors. The regulator also seemed to shuffle decisions regarding margin loans to trade shares. Between October last year and February this year, the SEC gave at least six directives regarding issuing margin loans, which hugely affected the market
