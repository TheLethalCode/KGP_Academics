<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 10 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court will give a ruling on Thursday on a petition by prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the Niko graft case. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiqui set the date on Wednesday after the final hearing on the petition. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station in 2007 against Hasina and six others for awarding Canadian firm Niko Resources Ltd the work order for exploring three gas fields that incurred a loss of Tk 13,630 crore to the state. The ACC pressed charges against Hasina on May 7, 2008. The High Court stayed the case proceedings on Aug 7, 2008 following Hasina's petition to scrap the case. Barrister Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh stood for the accused and Khurshid Alam Khan represented the ACC in Wednesday's hearing. The High Court earlier quashed four corruption cases against Hasina. The court on Tuesday quashed the MiG 29 case and last week it quashed three cases, which accused her and former cabinet ministers of corruption and irregularities in the construction of the Bangabandhu Novo Theatre during her previous tenure. The court ruled that the case proceedings were "unlawful" and the cases were filed to harass Hasina. bdn
