 Dhaka, March 14 (bdnews24.com)  Moments after ending their six-hour strike at midday Sunday, owners and workers of petrol pump stations have threatened to call an indefinite strike if their 13-point demands are not met by April 10. "We'll call an indefinite strike if our demands are not met by this period," said Muhammad Nazmul Huq, convener of the United Council of Petrol Pump Station Owners and Workers on Sunday. Earlier in the day, petrol pumps across the country observed a six-hour strike starting from 6am to press for their 13-point demands including raising their commission from 2 to 7 percent. Huq said they would try to hold talks with the government during the time to resolve the crisis. Some 9,000 stations across the country refrained from selling fuels in support of the strike, Huq said. Petrol station owners last month warned of a countrywide shutdown of pumps unless the government met certain demands within two weeks. The demands include formulation of guidelines in setting up petrol pumps, a testing laboratory at every pump depot, increase in fares of tanker-lorries and stopping police harassment in the name of "examining papers". Huq, convener of the committee, said on Saturday that they were compelled to go for work stoppage since they did not get any response from the government. Petrol tank lorries and pumps distribute and sell fuel, including petrol, diesel and octane, from three oil companiesMeghna, Jamuna and Padmaunder the state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation on a commission basis. b
