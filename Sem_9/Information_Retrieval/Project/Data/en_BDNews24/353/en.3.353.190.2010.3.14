 Hobiganj, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  A Hobiganj court on Sunday remanded former home state minister Lutfozzaman Babar into police custody for another five days in connection with the Shah AMS Kibria murder case. Chief judicial magistrate Muhammad Samsul Alam granted the prayer for remand made by CID's assistant police superintendent Rafiqul Islam, the investigation officer of the case. He will be interrogated along with another detained banned Islami outfit Hurkatul Jihad leader Mizanur Rahman Mithu. Public prosecutor advocate Akbar Hossain Jitu told reporters that the police believe the real secret behind the murder case would only emerge if these two were questioned together face to face. Babar was taken to Hobiganj district jail from Dhaka Central Jail on Saturday and produced before the court Sunday. During the hearing, attorney general Mahbubey Alam argued for the state while Rafique-ul-Huq and Mahbub Uddin Khokan represented Babar. Babar was shown arrested in the case on Feb 2, following an order by a judicial magistrate in Habiganj on a request by the criminal investigation department. On Feb 11, Babar had previously been remanded for six days in relation to the same case. Babar is currently serving a sentence of 17 years following his conviction in an arms case. State prosecutors have previously said said that Babar had 'confessed' his connection with the killing of Kibria, while being interrogated in the August 21 grenade attack case. bd
