 Dhaka, Mar 14 (bdnews24.com)  The top brass of Radio Today's news management team quit en masse from the station over a period of 24 hours up to Sunday morning, in protest against 'intervention' by the general manager into newsroom affairs. Nine members, including chief news editor AKM Manjurul Huq, assignment editor Anwar Huq, a number of other news editors and producers, said they had handed in their resignations to authorities. Manjurul Haq told bdnews24.com that the decision was taken as the new general manager was "interfering with the work of the newsroom". "The authorities accepted the resignations on Sunday night", said Anwar Huq. He also claimed that members of the radio's reporting section are also preparing to leave. However, members of the reporting section declined to make any comment on this when contacted by bdnews24.com. Radio Today was the country's first FM radio station broadcasting news and entertainment programmes. bdnews2
