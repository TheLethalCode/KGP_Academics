 Anupam Deb Kanunjna Dhaka, Mar 13 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka City Corporation recently announced an ambitious project to construct 45 high-rise blocks at the site of the sprawling Geneva and Town Hall camps at Mohammadpur, to rehabilitate the Biharis who have been living in makeshift homes there for four decades. The announcement should have come as welcome news for the Biharis, or Urdu-speakers still referred to as 'stranded Pakistanis' nearly 40 years after Bangladesh's liberation from Pakistan. But many are apprehensive of the plan, fearing "ploys" to evict them from their current housing, and wonder where they will go during the massive, and no doubt lengthy, construction project. "Where will we end up if we lose this small piece of land on which we depend?" Faruk Khan, a camp-dweller, told bdnews24.com this week. According to a 2001 survey of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), a total of 250,000 to 300,000 Urdu-speaking people live in Bangladesh. The survey also said that some 50,000 to 52,000 Biharis are living in 30 camps in Dhaka. Of them, around 20,000 to 25,000 live in the largest, the 'Geneva Camp', a congested ghetto of shanties in the heart of the capital. The second generation of these so-called refugees, born since Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, finally received voting rights ahead of the 2008 general elections. They also got national identity cards as proof of citizenship, but most Bangladeshis still refer to them as Biharis, or outsiders. There is general belief that all the Urdu-speakers opposed Bangladesh's independence war. In the past, several attempts were made by vested quarters and also by the post-independence Bangladesh governments to evict the Biharis from the camps. Referring to those past instances, Faruk said, "Bangalis have always wanted to grab the land of the camps." He said the Biharis are now confused about the present government's decision to allocate them flats. "They think this might be another trick to displace them from the place they have called home for nearly 40 years." Neaz Ahmad Khan, a Bihari leader, urged the government to allay these confusions by giving allotment letters (of proposed flats) to each of the families before they are moved to alternative shelters ahead of construction. He also called on the government to make an updated list of Bihari families. "According to the latest government survey there are only 5,000 families living in the (Geneva and Town Hall) camps," he said, "But the real number will be more than 13,500." New enlistment is also needed prior to our eviction because there is always a chance of infiltration by 'fake Biharis', Neaz added. Most of the camp-dwellers interviewed claimed that there were always some 'corrupt Biharis' who refused Bangladeshi citizenship and do not want to be voters only because they will lose their refugee status and thus be deprived of relief. Arafat Rahman, a tea-stall owner, was more vocal. "Those who refer themselves as Pakistanis do not have any proof in support of their claim. But, we have evidence that they have manage to get relief and other facilities from the Bangladesh government." 'THERE ARE NO STRANDED PAKISTANIS HERE' 'Stranded Pakistanis' or 'segregated Bangladeshis'? The question plagues the hundreds of thousands of Biharis, not only in Dhaka but in a total of 76 'refugee camps' throughout Bangladesh. "Which would be the right term to describe our desperate situation?" Neaz asks ruefully. Neaz, chief patron of Bangladesh Bihari Rehabilitation Assembly, who was born when Bangladesh was just a year old, says: "There are no such people as 'stranded Pakistanis' anywhere in Bangladesh". "The Pakistanis left Bangladesh. Those who still identify themselves as Pakistanis now, have ill motives. They should be called relief-mongers," the Bihari leader said. Most of the camp-dwellers interviewed claimed that there were always some 'corrupt Biharis' who refused Bangladeshi citizenship and do not want to be voters only because they will lose their refugee status and thus be deprived of relief. "Those who actually refer to themselves as 'Pakistanis' do not have any proof in support of their claim," Arafat Rahman, a tea-stall owner, says. "But, we have evidence that these co-called refugees have managed to get relief and other facilities from the Bangladesh government on false pretences." Muhammad Ishaq, 49, who runs a grocery store at the Geneva camp, was born before Bangladesh's independence. He was 10 years old in 1971. He still claims: "Yeh mera desh hey (This is my country)." "Bangalis should accept us as their brothers," Ishaq said. bd
