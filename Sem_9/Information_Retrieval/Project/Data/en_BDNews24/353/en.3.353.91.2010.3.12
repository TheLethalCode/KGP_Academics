 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, March 12 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to issue 'emergency passports' as an interim measure till machine readable passports and visas MRP and MRV respectivelyare introduced fully. "Since it is taking a long time provisional, we will issue passports for urgent cases in the meantime," said Md Abdul Mabud, director general of the Department of Immigration and Passport, to bdnews24.com. "No one will be in trouble in case of emergencies," said Mabud. A proposal has been sent to the home ministry and a circular will be published after the approval of finance and law ministries, he said. These passports will remain valid for at least one year for a proposed fee of Tk 1,000. The government will begin the process of issuing MRP and MRV from April 1 following rules of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. "We want to start with receiving applications from April 1," said Md Refayetullah, a brigadier general, also head of the MRP and MRV project to bdnews24.com. "We will be able to start issuing the passports and visas by the end of April after setting up machines and modern technology," he said. "Hand-written passports are still being issued where there is much scope for forgery." Also, since there is no database of personal information, the same person may be given there is a tendency to issue several passports with the same name, said Refayetullah. There are about 1.25 core passport holders in the country. The ones that have already been renewed will remain valid until 2015. After that, holders will be issued MRPs. If introduction of MRP and MRV fails from April 1, then hand-written passports will still remain in vogue according to ICAO (document 9303 IQ), said Refayetullah. Passports renewed for five to ten years which are valid till March 31 this year can be renewed for one more year. MRP and MRV are already in use in over 80 countries. bdnew
