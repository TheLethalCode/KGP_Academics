<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 12 (bdnews24.com)  Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque on Friday demanded probe into prime minister's son Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed's alleged association with internet telephony. Although approved in principle, the government has not yet implemented any mechanism for Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations. The senior BNP leader was talking to reporters at a press briefing at his Gulshan residence in the capital. "Sajeeb Wazed Joy controls the banned VoIP trade from Canada and USA. The business started during the last AL tenure. But when we raised this issue in parliament, our mikes were switched off," the BNP leader alleged. He also accused that the internet telephony had begun with a relative of the prime minister through a company called Spectra Solutions. "The government is incurring a revenue loss of Tk 150 billion per year due to this illegal business. The entire amount is being laundered abroad," claimed Farroque. Demanding a fresh inquiry into the issue, the opposition whip said, "If the government wants, we are willing to help by providing all necessary data." Responding to a query, BNP MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie said that there were also allegations of financial corruption against Wazed 'for allowing the US company, Chevron, to get work without any tenders. The prime minister's advisor is also involved according to a newspaper'. bdnew
