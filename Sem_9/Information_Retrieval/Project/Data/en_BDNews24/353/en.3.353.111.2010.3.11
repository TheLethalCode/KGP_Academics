<TITLE> England without Onions for Bangladesh tests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England pace bowler Graham Onions will miss the two-test series against Bangladesh because of a back injury, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Thursday. Onions sustained the injury in practice last week ahead of the first test, which starts on Friday in Chittagong, leaving the tourists lacking experienced pace bowling options. James Anderson and Ryan Sidebottom are out of the tour with leg injuries while Stuart Broad missed the third one-day international with a back problem, though he was able to bowl in the nets on Wednesday. The injury problems have left Tim Bresnan, who has played two tests for his country, and uncapped 20-year-old Steven Finn in the frame for a call-up. The second test in Mirpur starts on March 20, before both countries head to the West Indies for the Twenty20 World Cup from April 30-May 16
