<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan said Monday that the Awami League was 70 percent successful during its first six months in office, despite "conspiracies against the government, conspiracies against the country". He urged the opposition party, which has been boycotting parliament, to return to the House and play its role there. "We have been 70 percent successful in the first six months. To achieve the remaining 30 percent will take time," said Khan. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with the Bangladesh Shop Owners Association, he said prices of daily essentials were lower in real terms "than any point in the past". "We are taking initiatives to keep the prices of daily essentials stable." "We have tough challenges before us. A conspiracy is going on against the government. Conspiracy against government is conspiracy against the country," he said. He called on the opposition for support. "Support the activities of the government and give constructive suggestions in parliament. It will be helpful for the country and the people," said Khan. BNP sees 'no success' Meanwhile, BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, speaking the same day, said the Awami League government had "no success" in the past six months. "The government has had no success ruling the country, and are only concerned with torturing the opposition," Delwar told reporters at the BNP's Naya Paltan office. Delwar claimed the ruling party was behind incidents of "torture and killing" of BNP leaders and supporters. Delwar said the government was promoting extortion, cronyism and extra-judicial killings instead of trying to keep its promises to the people. He blamed unrest in the garments sector and difficulties of farmers in selling rice on "government ineptitude". "The government has created a one-party parliament and are continually putting obstacles in the opposition's path to ensure it remains so," he said. "It is very clear that the government does not want cooperation from the opposition," said Delwar. bdn
