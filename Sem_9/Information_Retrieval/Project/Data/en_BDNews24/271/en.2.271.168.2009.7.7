<TITLE> Katich resolve stoked by 2005 Ashes flop </TITLE>

 LONDON, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The last time Simon Katich played a test series in England, Australia lost and he subsequently spent three years out of the team. Four years on, Katich is back as a key member of the national side with an added determination to succeed. Katich, 33, who has since reinvented himself as an opener, batted at number six for four of the five tests in 2005 when England won the Ashes for the first time in 18 years. He scored just 248 runs at a meagre 27.55. "If you had told me after the 2005 series that I would be back four years later I would have laughed," Katich told Reuters. "And having got dropped soon after I guess there would be a few people who would have agreed." "It was probably a good thing for me to get out of that environment and go away, work on things and enjoy my cricket to help me fight my way back. "Part of me knew there was a chance it could all be over because you never know if an opportunity will come again. I certainly didn't want to go out on that note and part of me knew that if I went out and tried to make a heap of runs you never know." EXPERIENCE PAYS One thing that gave left-hander Katich hope of a recall was the fact Australian selectors had a record for going back to experienced players, even if they had been out of the team for a prolonged period. Matthew Hayden, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn all enjoyed their best years after being dropped. Katich received his second chance when Hayden was injured on the 2008 West Indies tour. Although he was more accustomed to the number three spot, he knew the chance to replace Hayden as opener was his way back and he has since played the past 15 tests. "I guess it was pure luck it turned out that way," Katich said. "I was asked if I wanted to open and I said I would jump at the chance. "I had batted most of my first-class career at three so it probably suited me better than in the middle-order when you can sit around waiting to go in." In those 15 tests Katich has plundered five centuries. His form and the emergence of new opening partner Phillip Hughes meant the promising Phil Jaques was not even offered an annual contract by Cricket Australia for 2009-10. Katich now regards 2005 and the subsequent time out of the side as a blessing. "It gave me a different appreciation," he said. "Not that I ever took playing for Australia for granted but having a couple of years out of it, it does make you appreciate it more when you are in it. "In the downtime after the 2005 Ashes I just knew that every time I went out to bat I had to make the most of it. You just don't know if a couple of low scores are around the corner so having been through that it helps me to make the most of everything."
