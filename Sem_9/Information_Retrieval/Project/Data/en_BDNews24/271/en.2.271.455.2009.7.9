<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) Bangladesh decided to bat against West Indies after rain ruined the first session of the first Test at the Arnos Vale ground in St Vincent on Thursday. Bangladesh have handed Test caps to pacer Rubel Hossain and spinning all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad. After the toss, the dark clouds moved back in and the covers followed and it had been drizzling till the report was filed. Earlier, rain began prior to the scheduled start of play meaning no toss was possible and the official teams had not been announced though Bangladesh had earlier declared their playing eleven. West Indies have been forced to field a second string side, with nine uncapped players in the squad of 15, after their first choice players boycotted the game in protest over contractual issues. Bangladesh: Tamim Iqbal, Junaid Siddique, Imrul Kayes, Mohammad Ashraful, Raqibul Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim (wk), Mahmudullah Riyad, Mashrafe Bin Mortaza (capt), Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain West Indies: Omar Phillips, Dale Richards, Floyd Reifer (capt), Travis Dowlin, David Bernard, Chadwick Walton (wk), Darren Sammy, Nikita Miller, Tino Best, Ryan Austin, Kemar Roach bd
