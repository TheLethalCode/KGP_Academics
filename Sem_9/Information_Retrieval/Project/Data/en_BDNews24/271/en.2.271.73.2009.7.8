<TITLE> HC critiques Bangabandhu award </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Wednesday criticised the Awami League's decision to confer the Independence Award posthumously on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1996. A bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed said Bangabandhu himself is the unique symbol of independence. The independence war was played out in his name. The Awami League government bestowed the award on the slain independence architect Sheikh Mujib during their previous term. The court said Sheikh Mujib and the award itself were devalued by the act. The High Court said all Liberation War sector commanders should be given the award. The sector commanders risked their life and fought for the sake of the country, the court said. So, each of them should be endowed with the award to recognise their contribution, it observed. The High Court made the observations while giving a verdict upon a public petition for the preservation of two liberation war memorial sites in Suhrawardy Udyan. The two sites mark the sites where Sheik Mujib gave his historical speech on Mar 7, 1971, and where Pakistani forces surrendered on Dec 16 that year. The court in its ruling asked the government to preserve all such liberation war sites, including the two in Suhrawardy Udyan. Liberation war sector commander KM Shafiullah and historian Muntasir Mamun submitted their petition to the High Court on June 25. bdnews2
