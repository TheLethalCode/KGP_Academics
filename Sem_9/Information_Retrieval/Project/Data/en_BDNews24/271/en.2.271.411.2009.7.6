<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh gained valuable practice ahead of the first Test when they drew the three-day match against West Indies A at Kensington Oval in Bridgetown, Barbados on Sunday. Opener Tamim Iqbal starred with a fluent 72-run knock as Bangladesh closed on 233 for five off 81 overs in their second innings. It was a marked improvement for the tourists after they were dismissed for 195 on the opening day, with most of their remaining recognised batsmen spending time at the crease. The Tigers rallied on a century opening stand between Tamim and Imrul Kayes (44). Tamim hit nine fours in scoring 72 from 153 balls in little over three hours. Raqibul Hasan contributed 49 and Shakib Al Hasan 33, but there were single-digit failures for Mohammad Ashraful and Junaed Siddique. The West Indian off-spinner Ryan Austin continued his fine match, backing up a first-innings five-wicket haul with 4 for 65 in the second. Austin finished with match figures of 9 for 136 He snapped the 123-run opening partnership by having Kayes caught at slip and then got Siddique caught at mid-wicket and Tamim edging behind. Shakib and Raqibul then put on 61 for the fifth wicket. Earlier, West Indies A, resuming on 247-8, were bowled out for 248 in 82.5 overs, replying to the Bangladesh's first innings total of 195 all out from 63.5 overs. The batsmen dismissed were the overnight pair of wicketkeeper/batsman Devon Thomas and fast bowler Kevin McClean. McClean was the first to go bowled by pacer Shahadat Hossain without adding to his overnight score of 21 off the day's second ball. Three balls later, Thomas was caught by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim off the same bowler for 105, which was also his overnight score and maiden first-class century. Shahadat took three for 54 from 11.5 overs and left-arm spinner Shakib 3-72 off 28 overs. Bangladesh and West Indies meet in the first Test in St Vincent starting on Thursday. bd
