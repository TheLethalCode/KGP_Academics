<TITLE> Tigers hand Test caps to Rubel, Riyad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com) - Fast bowler Rubel Hossain will make his Test debut in the land of pace bowling when Bangladesh take on the West Indies in the first Test at St. Vincent which starts Thursday. The Tigers have stuck with the same combination that featured in the three-dayer against West Indies A in Barbados last week which means a Test cap for all-rounder Mahmud Ullah Riyad as well. The 19-year old Hossain is arguably the quickest bowler in Bangladesh and will complete a three-pronged pace attack with skipper Masrafe Bin Mortaza and Shahadat Hossain. Shakib Al Hasan is the main spinner in the side and will get off-spin support from Mahmud Ullah. Hossain has played five ODIS for Bangladesh while 23-year old Mahmud Ullah has appeared in 24 one-dayers. Bangladesh will face a very different West Indies side following a boycott by the West Indies Players' Association (WIPA). In the absence of its leading cricketers the West Indies board has announced a 15-man squad which will be led by top-order batsman Floyd Reifer of Barbados who played four Tests between 1997 and 1999 and now plays his cricket for the Combined Colleges and Campus team in the West Indies domestic tournament, according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. There are eight Barbadians in the West Indies team. Reifer, who will celebrate his 37th birthday on July 23, the bustling Barbados fast bowler Tino Best (12 Tests), St Lucian allrounder Darren Sammy (5 Tests) and Jamaican David Bernard Jr., also an allrounder (one Test) are the only players with Test experience in the squad which was announced at a press briefing on Wednesday. Reifer has 6689 first class runs and 13 centuries from 123 matches at an average of 35.02. He also played in the inaugural Test in St Vincent back in 1997 against Sri Lanka. This will be only the second Test match in the history of Arnos Vales and Reifer becomes the only player to play both matches. Best, who has been cleared by the WICB to play following his aborted stint with the Indian Cricket League (ICL), opening batsmen Dale Richards and Omar Phillips, off-spinner Ryan Austin, young pacers Kemar Roach and Kevin McClean as well as 16-year-old prolific schoolboy batsman Kraigg Brathwaite are the other Bajans in the team. Bangladesh captain Mortaza said he was disappointed with the situation. "Obviously we wanted to test ourselves against the full-strength West Indies team. Facing up to the likes of (Chris) Gayle, (Shivnarine) Chanderpaul, (Ramnaresh) Sarwan and (Dwyane) Bravo would have been a different challenge and we were looking forward to that. But it (the situation) is not within our control. We are nevertheless focused on our job which is to play Test cricket and I am expecting total commitment from the players," said Mortaza. West Indies coach John Dyson remained positive but reckoned Bangladesh were an improved side. "It's going to be an exciting time. We'll just have to do our best, won't we? But this is the way it goes in professional sport these days. We've got a new group of players, there's some exciting players amongst them and it's going to be an interesting series," said Dyson. "Bangladesh are not an easy cricket team. They have played some good cricket in the last 12 months, they are an improving team. So we'll have our hands full to do well against them," added the Australian. With the festive hangover of the annual St. Vincent carnival the Vincy Mas still fresh following its end on Tuesday and the boycott of top cricketers the first Test will reportedly struggle to draw fans at the 14,000 capacity Arnos Vales Ground. The weather is also a concern as it had been during the inaugural Test against Sri Lanka in 1997. That match was affected by heavy showers and rain also lashed the ground on Wednesday evening. TEN Sports will televise the Test live. The match is scheduled to start at 9pm Bangladesh Standard Time. Bangladesh: Masrafe Bin Mortaza (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Imrul Kayes, Zunaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan (Vice Captain), Mushfiqur Rahim (Wicketkeeper), Mahmud Ullah, Shahadat Hossain, Rubel Hossain. 12th man  Mehrab Hossain Jr. West Indies: Floyd Reifer (Captain), Omar Phillips, Dale Richards, Travis Dowlin, Chadwick Walton (Wicketkeeper), Darren Sammy (Vice Captain), Kemar Roach, Ryan Austin, Tino Best, Kevin McClean, Nelon Pascal, Andre Creary, Nikita Miller, Kraigg Brathwaite and David Bernard.
