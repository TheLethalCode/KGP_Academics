 WELLINGTON, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fast bowler Shane Bond has been recalled to the New Zealand national squad for their tour of Sri Lanka starting next month. Bond, who has only just rejoined the international fold after cutting his ties with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL) was included in New Zealand's one-day and Twenty20 squad but overlooked for the tests. Wary about his lack of match practice, the national selectors instead picked Bond for the New Zealand A tour of India, which will be held at the same time as the Sri Lanka tests, to get himself fit for the limited-overs matches. "Many of the squad will be coming off their winter break, so the opportunity to get game time in sub-continent conditions is ideal," New Zealand head selector Glenn Turner said in a statement on Tuesday. "Shane Bond will also have a good opportunity to get up to speed before returning to the Blackcaps." Auckland wicketkeeper Reece Young was the only uncapped player in the 15-man test squad, picked to provide cover for Brendon McCullum. Paceman Daryl Tuffey, who was also contracted to the ICL, was recalled after performing well in the domestic first-class competition while Craig Cumming was picked as a specialist reserve batsmen. The one-day squad featured seven limited-overs specialists including three spinners and separate back-up wicketkeepers for McCullum for both 50-overs and 20-overs cricket. Test squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Craig Cumming, Grant Elliott, Daniel Flynn, Martin Guptill, Chris Martin, Brendon McCullum, Tim McIntosh, Iain O'Brien, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor, Daryl Tuffey, Reece Young. One-day international and Twenty20 squad: Daniel Vettori (captain), Shane Bond, Neil Broom, Ian Butler, Grant Elliott, Martin Guptill, Gareth Hopkins (one-dayers only), Brendon McCullum, Nathan McCullum, Peter McGlashan (Twenty20s only), Kyle Mills, Jacob Oram, Jeetan Patel, Jesse Ryder, Ross Taylor.
