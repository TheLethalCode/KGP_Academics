<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday ordered the government to preserve all sites related to the memory of the independence war. The court ordered the government to form a committee within three months, with historians, archaeologists and sector commanders to identify all such sites. The bench of justices ABM Khairul Haque and Momtaz Uddin Ahmed gave the order on a petition, by Liberation War sector commander KM Shafiullah and historian Muntasir Mamun, seeking to protect two Suhrawardy Udyan sites. The two Liberation War sites mark the place where independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered a historic speech on Mar 7, 1971, and where Pakistani occupation forces surrendered to allied forces on Dec 16 the same year. The High Court also ordered the government to identify the places where Sheikh Mujib delivered a speech on his homecoming on Jan 10, 1972, and where the then Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi gave a speech on Mar 17, 1972. The court ordered authorities to erect statues of international standard at the sites, saying the places must be open for all local and foreign tourists. The court in its ruling mentioned constitutional obligations to preserve national heritage, citing Article 24 that says the state will take steps to protect cultural or historic objects or places with special value. The court said it had given its ruling to uphold the constitution as successive governments had failed in their constitutional duties. "The state is duty-bound to preserve the places that memorialise the nation's rise. Every civilised nation preserves its heritage for the next generations. It was a failure that we could not do this before," said the court. In an instant reaction to the verdict, Muntasir Mamun said, "I am not only happy with the judgment, but also amazed. We have been fighting for 35 years, but couldn't until now protect the memories of the liberation war." KM Shafiullah said no one had taken any initiative to date to preserve the sites that marked the turning points of the 1971 war. Advocate Manjil Morshed represented the petitioners, while attorney general Mahbubey Alam, additional attorney general MK Rahman and deputy attorney general Mostafa Jaman Islam represented the state. The petition was filed on June 25. The court served a notice on the government on the same day regarding the preservation of the two sites at Suhrawardy Udyan. bd
