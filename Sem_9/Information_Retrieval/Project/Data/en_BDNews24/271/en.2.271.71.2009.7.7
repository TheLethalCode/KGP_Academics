 WASHINGTON, Tue Jul 7, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Following are selected highlights from a report issued by a US Department of Agriculture attache in New Delhi: "The slow progress of the monsoon and its poor performance during the first quarter of the monsoon season (June-September) is causing serious concern among farmers as well as to the government. The window of opportunity for planting most kharif crops (rice, coarse grains, soybeans, peanut, cotton, and pulses) will be over by mid-July. If rains come in the next week, planting operations will pick up. Otherwise the country could be heading for a severe drought." Attache reports are not official USDA
