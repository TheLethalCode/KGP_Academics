 CORRECTION TO 3RD PARAGRAPH Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal's three Dhaka-based units were dissolved on Monday night, following protests against the new central committee announced without any council on July 1. Amirul Islam Khan, general secretary of the newly formed central committee, told bdnews24.com that JCD's Dhaka University chapter and Dhaka Metropolitan North and South chapters were shut down and four DU JCD leaders expelled on charges of indiscipline. The expelled leaders were the DU branch's vice president Mamunur Rashid, general secretary Saiful Islam Firoze, organisational secretary Sadiul Islam Nirob and joint secretary Akram Hossain. This was the first move of the 101-member central committee of the BNP-backed student body, whose top leaders were announced by BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at the start of the month. Factions of local JCD branches have since been protesting the formation of the central committee without holding council, and questioning the legality of the new appointments on the basis of being past proper age and no longer having student status. Some JCD units have even threatened to resign en masse in protest against the new appointments. bdnews24.
