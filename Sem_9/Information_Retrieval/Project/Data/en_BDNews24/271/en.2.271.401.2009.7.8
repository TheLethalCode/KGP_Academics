 Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com)Parliament on Wednesday passed seven separate bills to make the president rather than the prime minister chancellor of seven public universities. Nurul Islam Nahid, the education minister, made separate proposals for passage of the bills, after which parliament passed them by voice vote in absence of the main opposition BNP and its allies. These bills will make the president instead of the prime minister the ex-officio chancellor of the varsities, said Nahid. "The prime minister has expressed her willingness to relinquish the chancellorships and hand them over to the president, which the president has agreed to," Nahid told the House. The bills are similar in content to seven ordinances promulgated by the interim administration, headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. At the time, the caretaker government said the ordinances were a means balance power between the president and prime minister. The amendment bills are the Bangladesh National bill-2009, Sher-e-Bangla Agriculture University bill-2009, Jagannath University bill-2009. Islamic University bill-2009, Bangladesh Open University bill-2009, National Poet Kazi Nazrul Islam University bill-2009 and Sylhet Agriculture University bill-2009. b
