 RAIPUR, India, Thu Jul 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maoist rebels are extorting up to $60 million annually from business and industry across Chhattisgarh, home of one of India's largest mineral reserves, the state's chief minister said on Thursday. The Maoists have recently stepped up attacks against police, officials and civilians away from remote rural areas and closer to towns and cities across India -- a worry to potential investors as the country grapples with the global slowdown.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said the Maoist army of 22,000 fighters is one of the greatest threats to India's internal security.
