 Dhaka, July 09 (bdnews24.com)The United States has said it hopes to see the International Crimes Tribunal (Amendment) Bill, set to be passed in parliament Thursday, amended to international standards for trial of war criminals. US ambassador James F Moriarty said his government was also concerned about "politicisation" of war crimes trials. "I have said all along any war crimes trial should be held according to international standards." "We have also said repeatedly we hope that this process does not become politicised," Moriarty told bdnews24.com after opening a hospital in Uttara. Regarding upcoming passage National Human Rights Commission Bill on Thursday, Moriarty said all the human rights defenders would be happy to see the bill passed in parliament. He said that passage of the bill would usher in the functioning of an effective Human Rights Commission in Bangladesh. "I realise there are some criticism of the law as was finally drafted. But I would say the key is how it gets implemented and how effective the Human Rights Commission can be," he said. Moriarty was opening the American SuperSpecialty Hospital Limited, a joint Bangladeshi-American venture.
