 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Kunio Senga, of the Asian Development Bank, Tuesday said the ADB has proposed to provide financial assistance to Bangladesh in the communication, tourism and information technology sectors, aiming to boost the country's regional links. "The assistance will facilitate regional cooperation between Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Bhutan," the director general of the ADB's South Asia Department told reporters following a meeting with finance minister AMA Muhith. "Trade and economic links will be promoted among the four countries under the South Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation programme," said Senga. He said enormous development was possible across the SASEC region and with this in mind the ADB had asked Bangladesh to plan for future investment from the bank in the targeted sectors. "Bangladesh can formulate a guideline in this regard. And according to that, the ADB is ready to cooperate with Bangladesh," he said. Senga said the ADB was also ready to provide assistance towards construction of the planned Padma bridge at Mawa, 50 kilometres south of Dhaka. He said a Bangladeshi section of the Asian Highway would also hugely benefit regional cooperation. Muhith said a green light on the development finance institution's proposal depended on a political decision. bdnew
