 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Thursday granted bail to senior Awami League leader Abul Hasanat Abdullah in four cases on various charges including tax dodge and hiding wealth information. Another AL leader Mostafa Rashidi Suja and his wife Khodeja Rashidi secured bail in the case over concealment of wealth information. They surrendered to trial court on June 22. SM Rezaul Karim, their lawyer, told bdnews24.com later that says there was no legal bar to their release from prison since there were no more cases against them. The bench of justices Wahab Miah and Abdur Razzak made the order on their bail appeals. On June 21 Dhaka Metropolitan Special Judge's Court sent Hasanat to jail after the former chief whip surrendered to the court. A special judge's court in 2007 had sentenced him to nine years in a tax dodge case and 13 years in another case in 2008 for suppression of wealth-related information. A Barisal divisional special judge's court in 2008 sentenced Hasanat to 14 years in jail in two cases regarding freedom fighter certificate fraud and illegal cash hoarding last year. Another special judge's court in 2008 sentenced Suja, the ex-whip to 13 years in jail for accumulating illegal wealth and suppressing wealth information and his wife Khodeja to three years in jail for abetting her husband in accumulating the wealth. b
