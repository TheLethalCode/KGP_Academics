 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)The House passed a law to re-activate the National Human Rights Commission on Thursday with provisions intended to strengthen the watchdog's role. Law minister Shafique Ahmed proposed passage of the law with the recommendations that include the commission's right to investigate human rights violations by members of the disciplined forces. The Bangladesh Constitution defines a disciplined force as the army, navy or air force, the police force, or any other force declared by law to be a disciplined force. The Human Rights Commission was formed last year in line with the then caretaker government's National Human Rights Ordinance 2007, but the commission ceased to be effective as the interim ordinance expired on Feb 25, awaiting ratification by the new parliament. The parliamentary standing committee on law finally presented the bill with recommendations for passage on July 7. The previous ordinance allowed for the commission's chairman and members to be appointed from the judiciary. However, the new law allows inclusion of representatives from other professions. The preamble to the new law says the commission has been empowered to investigate any complaint relating to violation of human rights by any individual, state or government organisation or any other establishment or organisation. An allegation can be brought by victim themselves, or anybody on behalf of the victim. If the investigation of the commission proves the allegation, the commission may try to mediate or create consensus to settle the dispute. The commission will be vested with necessary judicial authority too so that damages can be redressed. The new law also outlines "in a definitive way the power and methodology of investigation into the allegation, (so) the authority of the commission has been consolidated and enriched." In a special provision, the new law also allows the commission on its own or on the basis of a petition to request a report from the government on suspected violation of human rights by members of a disciplined force. If any further recommendation is made by the commission, the government must inform it within six months on actions taken on basis of the recommendation. The Human Rights Commission will consist of one chairman and six members. But the chairman and one member will be full-timers and other members honorary. The commission will have district chapters too, who will receive complaints on violations, carry out primary investigation and commission necessary trials. Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, has said the present government wants to constitute an active and effective Human Rights Commission to deal with all human rights violation against Bangladeshis both at home or abroad. bdnews24
