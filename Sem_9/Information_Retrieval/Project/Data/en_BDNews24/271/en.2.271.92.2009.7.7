<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 07 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid Tuesday rubbished a recent Transparency International Bangladesh report that claimed over Tk 5 crore and 24-hours of parliamentary time had been wasted in the first session due to quorum problems. "The TIB should be more careful of the content of such reports," said Hamid after ruling party chief whip Abdus Shahid termed the report a "humiliation" following question time in parliament. TIB's 'Parliament Watch' report, released on July 4, also said the the House had started late every day, with an average of 40 minutes wasted daily as the minimum number legislative assembly members failed to properly attend. "This parliament did not suffer from a quorum crisis," said Hamid, adding that sittings had generally started no more than 12 minutes late. Hamid said Bangladeshis had a habit of arriving late for programmes, but the members of parliament had recently become more punctual. "I have attended many programmes organised by civil society members that have started up to an hour late," said Hamid. Chief whip Abdus Shahid, in an unscheduled standing after the question-answer session, had said, "I don't know how the TIB got the information that quorum crisis cost Tk 5 crore 40 lakh." "The TIB is in contempt of parliament and the people who have elected this parliament." "It has also humiliated people and the parliament through its report," said Shahid. The Dhaka chapter of the Berlin-based corruption watchdog also reported that 3.7 percent of total parliamentary time was spent discussing points of order, during which the party hierarchy was praised 251 times, criticised 342 times and unrelated issues were discussed 503 times. b
