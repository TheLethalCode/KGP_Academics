<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka Metropolitan Police have recovered 200 of 300 of cars stolen in the capital in the last six months, an official said Tuesday. Police say this marks the highest ever recovery rate of stolen cars. Detective Branch assistant commissioner Mokhlesur Rahman of the DMP vehicle theft prevention and recovery team told reporters at least 300 cars were stolen in the Dhaka metropolitan area since January. "Of these, 200 have been recovered and 200 people arrested," he said. Rahman said the rising incidence of vehicle thefts, despite tougher policing, was due to the swelling number of carjacking gangs. "There about 100 carjacking gangs operating in the city now, whereas at one time it was only eight or ten," he said. Rahman said car thieves these days were even killing drivers of private cars, which was rare in the past. The police official said criminal gangs were often linked to different rent-a-car organisations. "This makes it easier for them to rent a car and gang up to hijack more vehicles." "Many also act in connivance with used car dealers and owners or employees of car-repair shops who help them fix, show-case and dispose of the stolen vehicles." "Some of the criminals are even linked to corrupt police and dishonest BRTA officials too," he said, adding that the police were not sparing anyone involved in the crime cycle. Rahman said car recovery was becoming more successful because of better policing. He said the recovery rate of stolen motorcycles, however, was relatively low. bdn
