<TITLE> Old Federer spells doom for rivals </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer will set about extending his collection of grand slam titles way beyond the record breaking 15th he won at Wimbledon, after declaring on Monday that the 'old Federer' was back. Those words should have all his rivals quivering in their shoes. "(Eighteen or 19 slam wins) definitely seems possible. I've reached 16 out of 17 grand slam finals in a row now, so I definitely have a shot for the next few years," the 27-year-old, who beat Andy Roddick in five titanic sets in the Wimbledon final, told a small group of invited journalists on Monday. In case anyone has forgotten, the old Federer was ranked on top of the tennis world for a record 237 weeks, collected around a dozen titles a year and relished the opportunity to pulverise his opponents. By his own high standards Federer went through a lean patch in 2008, when he suffered a bout of glandular fever at the start of the season and then reached three grand slam finals but only lifted the U.S. Open. He lost his number one ranking to Rafael Nadal last August but recaptured that crown with his Wimbledon triumph. On Sunday Federer was hailed as "an icon and a legend" by Pete Sampras -- the man whose milestone of 14 slams he obliterated from the record books -- and the Swiss said on Monday he was eager to add more weight to his already creaking trophy cabinet. "I'm still young in tennis terms, I think. It's only after 30 the clock starts ticking, you know, how many more years you've got left in your mind... because normally it's also the body that gives," Federer said on Monday. "Pete always said one major a year is a good year. I really feel I have chances in all four majors to wins. That's what maybe gives me a bigger chance to win some." Federer has rediscovered his sublime touch and precise footwork. Four Sundays ago he became only the sixth man to complete a career grand slam of all four majors when he finally got his hands on the French Open trophy. On that day, Federer announced he could play the rest of his career without pressure. He has been true to his word and a relaxed Federer is an unwelcome sight for any of his rivals. The secret of his success? "I have no more back pain," laughed the genial Swiss, who also reclaimed the top ranking with his Wimbledon triumph. "I'm not scared anymore of going into the very corner of the court and digging out the ball, which I was scared of doing at times. That's why my serve sometimes faltered, like in important moments, because I did not have enough belief that my body was holding up. "Now I feel so much better, I can play the way I normally play. Use offence, use defence, my serve's clicking. I know in the important moments I will take the right decisions. "Now I feel like the old guy again." That 'old guy' was trying to come to terms with just how quickly he had surpassed Sampras's benchmark. It took the American 12 years to fill his trophy cabinet, Federer scooped up number 15 in just six. When Sampras broke Australian Roy Emerson's previous record of 12 at Wimbledon in 2000, and then extended it at the 2002 U.S. Open, most people thought that landmark would last a lifetime and Federer was almost apologetic for surpassing it so quickly. "Being on the same level in majors as Pete, that was kind of important for me and not really breaking his record. I almost feel a little bit bad if I'm quite honest," said Federer, who looked extremely fresh despite getting only two hours sleep. "It's like disbelief almost that I've got more slams then Pete, who's my hero.
