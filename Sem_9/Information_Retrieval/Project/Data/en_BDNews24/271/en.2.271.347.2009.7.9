<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 09 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition the BNP has rejected the parliamentary probe report on the alleged corruption of former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar, his deputy Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain. "We reject this report as it was prepared with the political motive of undermining the BNP," Zainul Abdin Farroque, chief whip of the opposition, told reporters in an instant reaction at parliament's media centre. He said the party would give a full official reaction later. An all-party parliamentary probe body, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, on Thursday recommended scrapping of Sircar's membership of the ninth parliament. Farroque said the probe was not carried out in line with parliamentary rules of procedure. "So, the committee has no legal basis," he said. The opposition chief whip said basic legal principles were violated while forming the probe body against former speaker Sircar, now a BNP MP. "According to law, complainants cannot be the judge. But one of the complainants was made head of the probe body," said Farroque. The probe body head Fazle Rabbi Mian and committee member Shajahan Khan had both raised allegations against Sircar in parliament. Farroque, who was also named a member of the probe body, said the Mian gave parliament untrue information about him. "He said I received a notice to attend the meeting of the committee. But no such notice came to me," said Farroque. bd
