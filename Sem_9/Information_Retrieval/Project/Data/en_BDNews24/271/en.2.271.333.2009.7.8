 Habiganj, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  Rapid Action Battalion arrested a suspected militant with bombs strapped to his body after he stormed into a Habiganj district BTCL office holding an employee and child hostage there for nearly three hours on Wednesday. "We have primary information about the militant," Habiganj police superintendent Akkas Uddin Bhuiyan told a press conference after the arrest. He named the suspect as Shahin Miah from Bara Bahubal village of Sadar Upazila. "Among the four local-made hand bombs strapped to his body, one went off and the others were defused by RAB members," said Bhuiyan. Police suspect Shahin, who was being held for interrogation, might be a member of the banned militant outfit Jamaat-ul Mujahideen Bangladesh, he said. The BTCL employee held hostage by Shahin was sub-assistant engineer Arab Ali, said his colleague Shirish Chandra Das who managed to escape from the office after the suspected bomber entered. Das said the man had entered the office with a child at around 5pm. RAB, police and fire service men quickly surrounded the office, said witnesses. Deputy commissioner Abul Kashem Talukder and superintendent of police Mohammad Akkas Uddin were also at the spot. Law enforcers coaxed him into talks and at one point in the negotiations managed to retrieve engineer Ali and the child, who has not been identified. A RAB team managed to capture the suspected miltant at around 8pm, said Das. Das and other witnesses said they heard up to five gunshots before the suspect was caught. "We have seen blood stains in the office. He was seemingly captured after being shot," said Das. Locals said the suspect was seen being taken to Habiganj Sadar Hospital by car. bdnews24.com
