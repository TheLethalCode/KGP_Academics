 JAKARTA, Thu Jul 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia's president said on Thursday, a day after his landslide re-election, that he would spur growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy to a target of 4-4.5 percent in 2009 as interest rates fall to 6 percent by year-end. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's targets for both GDP growth and interest rates are more optimistic than those of the central bank and the market. Bank Indonesia forecast economic growth of 3-4 percent this year and indicated it was close to the end of its easing cycle earlier this month when it cut its key rate by 25 basis points to 6.75 percent. But Yudhoyono told reporters in Jakarta that "hopefully" inflation this year could fall to 4 percent. "It's a good achievement. With that achievement, the interest rate may head to 6 percent by the end of this year," he told a news conference at the presidential palace in Jakarta. Indonesian stocks and bonds initially rallied on Thursday morning on news of Yudhoyono's re-election. Stocks, bonds and the rupiah currency had rallied in recent months on the prospect of a second five-year term for Yudhoyono, who has promised to quicken the pace and widen the scope of reforms in the economy. "Although the election went smoothly, the results had long been anticipated, so I don't see a strong stock market rally today," said John Teja, head of equities sales at Ciptadana. The rupiah -- the best performing currency in Asia this year -- jumped across the curve in offshore forwards on Thursday as investors bet that Yudhoyono's re-election would spur foreign investment inflows. Enrico Tanuwidjaja, a currency strategist at OCBC Bank, said the offshore market saw Yudhoyono's win as rupiah-positive, partly on a report that cited the president as saying he would announce a major plan to sell off state-owned industrial firms. But asked about the plans Yudhoyono told reporters it was too early to talk about overall plans for state-owned firms. "There will always be an overview from one period to another and within the next five years, what our SOEs (state-owned enterprises) will be like in terms of their infrastructure, the scope and size as part of consolidation...I will reveal this later on, but it's too early to comment."

That popular mandate may make it easier for Yudhoyono to put more able technocrats than politicians into his new cabinet, smoothing the way for reforms that would lure foreign investment, create jobs and lift economic growth. Yudhoyono, 59, has been criticized in the past for giving key posts to politicians from coalition parties to ensure support in parliament, even though these allies had little zeal for reform. "I think the president will make his (cabinet) decisions based on meritocracy, rather than the background of the party," said Saiful Mujani, a political analyst at the Indonesian Survey Institute. However, analysts and commentators said there could be no honeymoon for the former army general because formidable political hazards still stood in his way, not least the formation of a coalition government. "Despite the landslide victory, there is no guarantee the president can effectively govern given the roster of his present coalition, which consist of a hodgepodge of small parties dominated by religious factions," Meidyatama Suryodiningrat wrote in the Jakarta Post. Yudhoyono is backed by his Democrat Party and a coalition of mainly Muslim parties after cutting his ties with Golkar, once the party machine of former strongman president Suharto. Even though the Democrat Party lifted its share of seats in parliament to more than a quarter in April's parliamentary election there are concerns that Yudhoyono will still struggle to push legislation through parlia
