 Dhaka, July 09 (bdnews24.com)Former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar has said a parliamentary committee's recommendation to stripping membership of parliament away from him is "unconstitutional", and that he will take legal action if the recommendation was acted on. An all-party parliamentary probe committee, headed by Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, in a 784-page report placed in the House on Thursday recommended scrapping Sircar's membership for "misappropriation" of public funds. Sircar told bdnews24.com after the report was placed, "If the government attempts to implement the committee's recommendation to cancel my membership, I will resort to the Supreme Court to seek justice." "I think I will get protection from the court as the judiciary is free now." "Article 66 of the Constitution stipulates the conditions under which an MP is stripped of membership," said Sircar, who was speaker of the eighth parliament. "None can be striped of membership without the application of the article," he said. If a court declares an MP mentally sick, bankrupt or sentences them to two years or more in a criminal case, he/she would lose membership, he said. "But this recommendation for scrapping my membership is unconstitutional and illegal," said Sircar. Regarding the corruption charges against him, Sircar, now a BNP MP, said his predecessor as speaker had spent more than he had. "The speaker of the seventh parliament Humayun Rashid Chowdhury spent more than one and half times the money on vehicles." "Besides, he took Tk 35 lakh from the parliament secretariat for medical treatment. I took Tk 27 lakh for my treatment in a transparent way," he said. "The present speaker Abdul Hamid is also using vehicles as per the tradition I set in the eighth parliament," said Sircar. "There is no set standard for the speaker to determine his entitlement in using vehicles," he said. Sircar said he would refund the Tk 27 he spent on medical expenses as speaker if the Supreme Court instructed him to do so
