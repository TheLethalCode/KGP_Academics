<TITLE> Obama offers Russia partnership and challenges </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Jul 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama called on Tuesday for Russia to forge a true partnership with the United States, promoting democracy and the rule of law as ideals to follow but avoiding direct criticism of the Kremlin. Obama was speaking after a first meeting with Russia's most powerful politician, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. U.S. officials described the two-hour talks at Putin's forest residence outside Moscow as "very successful." In a carefully calibrated speech billed by the White House as a major set piece, Obama lavishly praised the achievements of Russian history and culture and said Washington wanted to see a "strong, peaceful and prosperous" partner in Russia. But he condemned in general terms corruption and authoritarianism -- ills which critics say afflict Russian business and political life. "People everywhere should have the right to do business or get an education without paying a bribe," Obama said. "That is not an American or a Russian idea -- that's how people and countries will succeed in the 21st century." Obama's remarks chimed with those of a delegation of visiting U.S. chief executives, who have complained that the weak rule of law and rampant corruption in Russia are holding back trade and investment. Despite the complaints, U.S. companies announced a series of business deals to coincide with the visit. The biggest was Boeing's pledge to spend $27 billion in Russia over the next 30 years, most of it buying titanium, a metal used in aircraft. Opinion polls have consistently shown Russian hostility to the United States and the audience of students at the New Economic School were muted in their response to Obama, listening to his words in silence and applauding politely at the end. The reaction formed a sharp contrast to the rapturous receptions Obama got in Cairo and Prague during previous big set-piece foreign policy speeches. "Obama tried to look really nice and politically correct when speaking about Russia, especially when speaking about democracy and free elections," said Danila, a first year student in the audience who refused to give his last name. "He should know as U.S. president that we have none of those." The U.S. leader was scheduled later in the day to attend a business summit in Moscow and to meet representatives of Russia's embattled political opposition and non-governmental organizations. Obama sought to reassure his student audience of his vision for better relations between Washington and Moscow but insisted that the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Ukraine -- regarded by Russia as part of its sphere of influence -- must be left to pursue their own policies within secure borders. But his overall message was conciliatory. "On the fundamental issues that will shape this century, Americans and Russians share common interests that form a basis for cooperation," he added. SPHERES OF INFLUENCE The speech was not shown live on Russia's main state- controlled television channels, appearing only on a cable news channel. The broadcast media, who mostly take their cue from the Kremlin, have generally given rather low-profile coverage to Obama, avoiding any sense of excitement. Obama is on the second day of a visit to Russia intended to "reset" relations between the world's two biggest holders of nuclear weapons following a period of tension and argument. "This must be more than a fresh start between the Kremlin and the White House," Obama said of the "reset" in his speech. "It must be a sustained effort among the American and Russian people to identify mutual interests, and to expand dialogue and cooperation." Christopher Granville of Trusted Sources Research in London commented: "This is reminiscent of the type of rhetoric we were familiar with during the Clinton era in the 1990s, of turning a new page, of a new partnership with Russia." U.S. officials said Obama and Putin, who kept a close personal rapport with predecessor, George W. Bush despite poor diplomatic relations, had formed the basis for good relations, though there were disagreements on some issues. Obama had been quick to praise Putin for "extraordinary work" but Putin avoided eye contact with Obama and looked down at the floor as he made opening remarks, saying there had been periods of greyish relations and confrontation between the two nations. Obama's meeting with Putin, a former KGB spy who served as president from 2000-2008 before handing over the top Kremlin job to his hand-picked successor Dmitry Medvedev, followed talks on Monday with Medvedev. They produced deals on a target for cuts in nuclear arms, a deal to let U.S. troops fly across Russia to fight in Afghanistan and the establishment of a joint governmental commission to improve relations between the two former rivals.
