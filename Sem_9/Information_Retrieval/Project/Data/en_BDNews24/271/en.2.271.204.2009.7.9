 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the food and disaster management ministry to prepare to protect the people against the imminent floods. "The ministry officials must play a vital role in saving the country and its people during the floods," said the prime minister in a meeting with them at the Secretariat on Thursday morning. She said river dredging and protecting river banks against erosion should also be ongoing. If necessary, foreign assistance should be sought in river dredging, canal excavation and river bank protection activities. "At the same time, we must resolve not to hanker after foreign help in managing matters that we should be able to manage ourselves from own resources." Beginning the meeting at 10am, food and disaster management minister Abdur Razzaq greeted Hasina and presented her with a rsum of the ministry activities undertaken and performed in the last six months. The prime minister congratulated the ministry officials on their success in handling post-Aila succour and rehabilitation activities successfully. She said, "More shelters have to built in the coastal belt with appropriate facilities so that people in distress can find shelter and protect their valuables." Hasina asked the officials to conserve rainwater as a measure to tackle drinking water scarcity. "Conserved rainwater, which is pure and natural at the same time, can be of great help in managing shortage of drinking water all over Bangladesh," she said. She urged the use of modern technology to reach calamity-related information to the disaster-prone areas. "People of this country have proved again that they can live and cope with calamities." Hasina stressed the construction of increased number of food silos for effective management of disasters and food shortages. "At the same time, the old food godowns have to be maintained well. Besides, our river ports need to be kept operational all the time so that foodstuff can be easily transported and distributed in emergency situations. "Food security and social food safety nets have to be further strengthened, so that the government is able to meet the food needs of the poor communities effectively. "The ministry officials must work hard to cope with food crises like the people concerned are fighting the financial meltdown."
