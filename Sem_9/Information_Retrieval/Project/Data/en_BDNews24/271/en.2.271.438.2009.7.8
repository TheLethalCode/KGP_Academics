 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Supporters of the four expelled leaders of the just dissolved Dhaka University committee of pro-BNP Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal brought out a 'coffin procession' on the campus on Wednesday. The protesters marched off at 1pm from Hakim Chattar carrying placards with the message 'Save Chhatra Dal' inscribed on them. Later, the students held a brief rally in front of Aparajeyo Bangla, where they called upon BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia to revoke the expulsion order. The leaders of the new committee were also present on the campus. Saiful Islam Firoz, expelled general secretary of the DU JCD committee, told reporters that it was always the JCD field workers who had come to the rescue of the party when it had encountered the debacles in the past. "Those who organised the issuance of our expulsion order were nowhere around those days." He said the expulsion was 'undemocratic' and conspiratorial' which could destroy JCD's student politics. On July 1, BNP announced the new central committee of the university chapter. The old committee leaders and activists staged protests and agitated over the new committee. As a result, four leaders of the dissolved committee: vice president Mamunur Rashid, general secretary Saiful Islam Firoz, organising secretary Sadiul Islam Nirab and joint secretary Akram Hossain of the former DU JCD unit were expelled on Monday. Two Dhaka metropolitan committees were also dissolved.. bdne
