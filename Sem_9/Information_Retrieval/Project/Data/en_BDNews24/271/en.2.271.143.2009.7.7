 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Thousands were at risk from river erosion in different districts as rain-swollen waters began falling after recent heavy downpours subsided, local officials said on Monday. In in Nilphamari, more than 50 houses were washed away in West Chhatnai village of Dimla Upazila in the last two days, due to erosion along the banks of the Teesta River, said local Union Parishad chairman Abdul Latif Khan. Khan said the flood protection barrier could be undermined at any time. Atikur Rahman, executive engineer of Dahlia Division Water Development Board, said the erosion in Nilphamari started when water levels in the swollen Teesta River suddenly fell. "A two kilometre stretch of the river bank was submerged over the last two days and when the water level fell the erosion took place," said Rahman. "Water levels in the Teesta River fell 41 centimetres in a day," he said. More than 2,000 people were also affected by erosion along the Dharala and Brahmaputra rivers in the Sadar Upazila of Kurigram district. Meanwhile, in Gaibandha, water levels were still rising in the Jamuna, Brahmaputra, Karatoa and Ghaghot rivers, with more than 900 families affected. Mir Mosharraf Hossain, Water Development Board executive engineer for Gaibandha, said water levels in the Bramhaputra, Ghaghat and Karatoa rivers were up by 68, 67 and 40 centimetres respectively over the last two days. In Sirajganj, the Jamuna River rose by 42 centimetres in a day, while severe erosion was already visible in Kazipur, Chouhali and Shahjadpur Upazilas. bdnews24.com/c
