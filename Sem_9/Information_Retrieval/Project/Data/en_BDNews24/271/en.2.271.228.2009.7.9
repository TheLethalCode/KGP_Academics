 NEW YORK, Thu Jul 9, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sales fell at many US apparel retailers and warehouse club stores in June as the weak economy and cool, rainy weather dashed interest in summer shopping for consumers across the country. Costco Wholesale Corp, the top US warehouse club retailer, posted a 6 percent drop in sales at stores open at least one year, in line with expectations, and pointed to tepid demand for such items as cameras and air conditioners. Demand remained stronger for food items, Costco said, pointing to consumers' cautious spending.

Same-store sales plunged 19.3 percent for snowboarding gear retailer Zumiez Inc. Children's Place Retail Stores Inc posted a 12 percent June same-store sales fall.
