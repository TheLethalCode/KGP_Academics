<TITLE> Pakistan to play in New Zealand, UAE over security </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KARACHI, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's "home" test series against New Zealand this year will switch to New Zealand because of security concerns, while the one-day matches will move to the United Arab Emirates, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Monday. "We have split the series into two parts," Board chief operating officer Salim Altaf told Reuters. Altaf said Pakistan would play four one-dayers and two Twenty20 internationals in the UAE in October and three tests in New Zealand in December. The International Cricket Council stripped Pakistan of its co-hosting rights for the 2011 World Cup after six members of the Sri Lankan team were wounded when gunmen attacked their team bus in Lahore in March.
