<TITLE> Indian players told to shun new 10-over tournament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Indian cricket board has warned players to keep away from a new private domestic tournament barely a month after the end of a major row over another unofficial league. "The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has not given an approval for a T10 Gully Cricket tournament, as is being claimed by the organisers of the same," board secretary N. Srinivasan said in a statement on Wednesday. "No current or former player registered with the BCCI should associate himself with the event." Last month, the BCCI and other national boards revoked suspensions on players after they quit the unofficial Twenty20 Indian Cricket League (ICL). The BCCI issued the warning after Sandeep Patil and Madan Lal, who both have just quit ICL, and Saba Karim attended the T10 event launch in Mumbai on Tuesday. The board also decided not to allow foreign players in India's domestic tournaments from the next season, reversing a decision taken two years ago to raise the standard of matches. The move is seen as a bid to help the 72 players who were granted amnesty after they quit the ICL.
