Rubel and Michael converted the spot kicks for Khulna. "Our dreams of playing in Brazil came into true. It was the target set by our coach Jahangir Junior (the former Abahani player)," said Raju, a son of a bus driver. Raju, who had never conceded a goal in the previous matches except in the final's penalty shootout goal, dreams of becoming a goalkeeper in future. Khulna, inspired by the kids from other districts football associations from the galleries, played better in the first half and came close twice to taking the lead, but they could not break the solid BFF development squad backline. The BFF development squad also could not find the back of the Khulna net guarded by tall Raju. "Our forwards could not take advantage of the chances created. We should have won the match at least 3-0," said BFF development squad captain Mithu, whose side burst into tears after losing the game.
