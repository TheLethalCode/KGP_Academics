 Rajshahi, July 7 (bdnews24.com)In an ongoing drive, law enforcers Tuesday arrested what they said was the No 2 man of JMB splinter group Islam and Muslim, a RAB official said. In a joint operation, members of Rapid Action Battalion and Bangladesh Rifles arrested 30-year-old Mohammad Selim from Belpara in Chapainawabganj Sadar Upazila. A foreign-made handgun and ammunition were also recovered during the operation, said RAB-5 commanding officer Lt Col Ishrat Hossain. "We made the arrest acting on information received from three recently detained leaders of the outfit," he told reporters at RAB-5 headquarters in Binodpur, Rajshahi. Hossain said Selim had fired on law enforcers during the arrest. Another RAB official, preferring anonymity, said Selim was involved in arms smuggling and would regularly travel to India where his wife lived. Three senior members of Islam and Muslim were arrested last month in Gazipur and Rajshahi, including the group's suspected chief organiser Abdur Rahim alias Shahdat. Law enforcers say Shahdat and Selim originally trained as members of the outlawed miltant outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, and formed Islam and Muslim following a rift with JMB leaders. Shahdat, a one-time Islami Chhatra Shibir leader, was arrested at Jaydebpur in Gazipur on June 30. Rajshahi police had previously arrested Shahdat on charges of militancy at the end of 2004. He spent three months in jail at the time. They say Shahdat was close to JMB's notorious military commander Siddiqul Islam, popularly known as Bangla Bhai, who was convicted and executed in 2007. bdnews24.com/
