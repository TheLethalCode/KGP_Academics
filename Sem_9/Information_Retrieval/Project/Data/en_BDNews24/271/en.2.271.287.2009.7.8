 Dhaka, July 08 (bdnews24.com)Food minister Abdur Razzaq said Wednesday that the government had decided to export 10,000 tonnes of fragrant rice in view of the healthy state of the nation's reserves. "There are currently ten lakh fifty-five thousand tonnes of reserve food grains in the country. This is why government has decided to export a certain volume of fragrant rice," Razzaq told reporters at his office. "A committee has been formed with joint secretaries from the finance, agriculture and food ministries who will finalise the export procedure after scrutiny," he said. On a separate issue, Razzaq said the vulnerable group feeding (VGF) programme would be resumed ahead of Ramadan, in which around 1,500 people in each union would receive food assistance. "Each family will receive between 10 and 20 kilogrammes of food assistance, and the entire programme will require around one lakh tonne of food," said Razzaq. He also said the government had decided to sell rice at Tk 16 per kilogramme under Open Market Sales to garment factory and tea garden workers. Razzaq said the government had procured 754,000 tonnes of food grains till July 4, which marked the highest amount any administration had achieved. bdne
