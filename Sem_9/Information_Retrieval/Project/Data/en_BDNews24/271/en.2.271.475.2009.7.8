 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Two men were shot by muggers in separate incidents in the capital on Wednesday, one in the leg and one in the head, while the two groups of assailants made off with nearly Tk 4 lakh. Armed robbers made off with nearly Tk 4 lakh after shooting an employee of Acme Laboratories in the leg outside the Shyamoli Ring Road Dutch Bangla Bank, police said. Thirty-five year old Mushtaque Ahmed, an official of the company's head-office accounts division, was admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment. The incident took place within 300 yards of Adabar Police Station at around 2:30pm as Ahmed was going to deposit the company's funds in the bank, Adabar police chief Shahidul Haque told bdnews24.com. Three men riding a motorcycle shot Ahmed in the leg when he arrived at the bank with Tk 375,000, said Haque. Speaking at DMCH, Ahmed told reporters that he had withdrawn the money from the Satmasjid Road branch of the National Bank before making his way to Adabar by auto-rickshaw. As he got down at the bank entrance from an auto-rickshaw, youths sitting on a motorcycle tried to snatch his sack of money and shot him in the thigh when he resisted. The muggers escaped with the money and he made his back to his Kalyanpur office with a bullet injury, said Ahmed. His colleagues later took him to the hospital. Shot in the head In another incident, in Khejurbagh in south Keraniganj, muggers shot Shakti Foundation junior officer Golam Ferdous, 35, in the head and escaped with his bag of money. Saidul Islam, a colleague of Ferdous, told reporters at the hospital that the two of them while returning from work were stopped by the miscreants in Khejurbagh at around 1:30pm. Islam ran away but the muggers shot Ferdous in the head and snatched his bag containing not more than Tk 6,000 and fled. Ferdous was taken to DMCH with bullet injury. South Keraniganj police failed to provide any information about the incident. bdnews
