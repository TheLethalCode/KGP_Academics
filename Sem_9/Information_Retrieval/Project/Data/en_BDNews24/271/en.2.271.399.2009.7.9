 TEHRAN, Thu Jul 9,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran said on Thursday five Iranian officials held by US forces in Iraq for more than two years had been handed over to Iraqi authorities and were expected to be released soon. The detention of the five Iranians contributed to a rise in tension between Tehran and Washington, which are also embroiled in a row over Iran's disputed nuclear program.

The five Iranians were detained on suspicion of being members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' elite Qods force, which Washington says backs terrorists. Iran rejects the charge of fomenting instability in Iraq. Qashqavi, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the five were diplomats who had been held contrary to "all international conventions." He said they had been in contact with their families and the Iranian embassy after being transferred to Iraqi cus
