 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh finally ended their gold medal drought in the 5th South Asian Shooting Championship when the women's team finished top in the 50m rifle three position event on Thursday at the BKSP Shooting Range. The team comprising veteran Sabrina Sultana, Tripti Datta and Sharmin Shilpa scored 1703, just a single point ahead runners-up India, who scored 1702 while Pakistan took the bronze medal with 1633. Sabrina narrowly missed the individual gold as Indian Tejaswani Sawant put Sabrina just one point behind to bag gold with 571 out of 600 points while Sabrina shot 570 points. Sabrina's team-mate Tripti Datta finished third with 568 points. It was the second 50m rifle three position women's event gold for country after the first gold came in the 1997 SAFF Games in Delhi. "It seemed to me that we could shoot a gold medal if I could guide my junior team-mates Tripti and Sharmin (Shilpa) and I asked them to pay attention to the wind before shooting and they tried their best and we finally got gold," Sabrina told bdnews24.com. The 1997 Commonwealth gold medallist, Sabrina, said that they had basically emphasised on the individual performance and it helped them to clinch the team gold. "We were very upset till the day before yesterday (Wednesday) as we could not hear our national anthem in the meet as well as hoisting the national flag despite being hosts and I had cried before going to bed and prayed for my best performance," said Sabrina, who bagged the 50m rifle three position individual gold in the 1997 SAF Games in Delhi. The veteran shooter, who won the 50m prone event gold in the 1997 SAF Games, said that she was happy to keep the country's image up as organisers were hoping something from her. Though Bangladesh found success on the concluding day, Indian kept their supremacy in the regional championship with 21 golds, 11 silvers and five bronzes. Pakistan followed the leaders with two golds, five silvers and nine bronzes. Hosts Bangladesh finished third securing one gold, six silvers and as may bronzes while Sri Lanka became fourth with two silvers and four bronzes. The fifth participant Bhutan failed to bag any medal in the five-day meet. bd
