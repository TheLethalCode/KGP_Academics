<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)Climate change and food security are the two main challenges facing South and Southeast Asian countries in the future, with rural communities worst hit, speakers at a CIRDAP seminar said Monday. The Centre on Integrated Rural Development for Asia and the Pacific organised the seminar, titled 'Changing rural livelihoods in the CIRDAP member countries', on its 30th anniversary. "People's livelihoods across southeast Asia have significantly changed in recent decades," said Dr Mokbul Morshed Ahmad, of the Asian Institute of Technology in Thailand, in his keynote presentation. "Gender and education disparities, health and sanitation issues and access to information and communication technology are some of the factors influencing rural livelihoods," he said. Ahmad said adapting to the effects of climate change with innovative farming practices and protecting forest and coastal areas were some of the major challenges facing the region. "However, problems such as food security can be solved by investing in high-yield varieties as well as modern irrigation and drainage systems," he said. "Unfortunately Asian countries seem to be reluctant to make these key investments," he added. SK Singh, a director of CIRDAP also presented a paper, which identified factors that influence livelihoods in South Asian countries. Focusing mainly on India, Singh said unemployment and poverty remained the major challenges for creating sustainable rural livelihoods. CIRDAP director-general Durga P Paudyal also announced an upcoming Asia-Pacific ministerial meeting on rural development, to be held towards the end of the year. "Four policy papers are going to be prepared for that meeting, and one will be on changing rural livelihoods," he said. Paudyal said the other three would be related to access to land, CIRDAP's activities in climate change and rural development
