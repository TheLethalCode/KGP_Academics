 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in a concluding speech as parliament's second session came to a close Thursday, called on the main opposition BNP to rejoin the House. "Speak out your words in the house," Hasina urged the opposition that has been absent throughout the current session, their boycott sparked by a seating dispute at the start of the first session in January. "The opposition remains absent from parliament not for any issue regarding the national interest, but because of a personal one." "They must return as they were sent to parliament with the people's mandate. They must agree with this." Hasina termed their absence 'illogical'. "They are not coming because of a first row seat and to protect a 180 katha cantonment house," she said, referring to the government's move to cancel the lease on a house of the opposition leader Khaleda Zia. The prime minister said, "We have to bring democracy to the fore." Referring to the two preceding years of emergency, she said conspiracies to destroy democracy were not over. Hasina also termed the 'Parliament Watch' report of Transparency International Bangladesh "one-sided". She criticised TIB's activities in strong terms. "TIB wants to underrate democracy and support an unconstitutional government," she said. Hasina spoke for an hour, ending just after 9pm, on the concluding day of the second session of the ninth parliament. Traditionally known as the budget session, it began on June 4. Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith presented the FY 2009-10 budget on June 11. Discussions on the budget totalled 47 hours 43 minutes. The budget was passed on June 30. During its 25 working days, the House enacted 23 bills, including the International Crimes (Tribunal) (Amendment) Act 2009 and the National Human Rights Commission Act 2009 on the last day of the session. In addition, finance minister AMA Muhith raised two bills in the house for strengthening the insurance industry. The Insurance Control Authority Act 2009 and the Insurance Act 2009 were passed by voice vote. Thursday also saw passage of the "Supreme Court Judges (Remuneration and Privileges) (Amendment) Act 2009.
