 ZURICH, Jul 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors bet on Thursday the United States would not go as far seizing UBS assets in a dispute over tax, instead expecting the Swiss bank to be hit by a hefty fine as part of a swift out-of-court settlement. Shares in UBS were higher midmorning after a US judge on Wednesday ordered the US government to say if it was prepared to shut the Swiss bank in the United States, though they underperformed the European bank sector. US District Judge Alan Gold, set to preside over a court hearing in a suit seeking to force UBS to disclose the identity of 52,000 secret account holders, gave the Justice Department until noon on Sunday to reply. Analysts and traders see an increased likelihood of a deal ahead of next week's hearing as they do not expect Washington to take the radical step of closing down the bank's operations in the country, which would risk potentially damaging consequences for the global financial system. How much UBS might have to pay in any out-of-court deal is unclear. But analysts point out the Swiss bank, one of the world's largest wealth managers, could afford up to about $5.5 billion without needing an immediate cash injection thanks to a recent capital increase and asset sales "People do not expect the United States to shut down UBS. That is why the shares should end up slightly up today," said a bank analyst who declined to be named. "There is a lot of pressure for a settlement to take place on Sunday." UBS employs about 27,000 people in the United States, or nearly one third of its global workforce. The court hearing is due to start on Monday, July 13. Shares in UBS were up 1.7 percent at 12.80 Swiss francs at 0850 GMT (4:50 a.m. EDT) against a 2.8 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European banking index. G8 FIGHT ON TAX EVASION The US case comes amid a global clampdown on Switzerland and other tax havens. G8 leaders meeting in Italy said on Wednesday they would continue to fight tax fraud and tax evasion, especially given the cost of stimulus measures in the crisis. "We cannot continue to tolerate large amounts of capital hidden to evade taxation," the G8 said in a statement. Switzerland, the world's biggest offshore center, vowed in filings to the US court this week to prevent UBS from handing over client information to Washington in an attempt to defend its bank secrecy laws, saying the tax case targeting its best-known bank is souring diplomatic ties. Despite strong language on both sides, analysts still see chances of a settlement that would most likely involve a sizeable fine for UBS. "There is still the chance of an out-of-court settlement ahead of the scheduled hearing next Monday," Julius Baer said in a research note on Thursday. UBS has repeatedly said speculation about potential settlement payments in the US tax dispute is unfounded, though Swiss ministers have openly spoken of a potential deal. Swiss Economy Minister Doris Leuthard told Reuters on Tuesday UBS had made mistakes and would have to pay a "price." Analysts say concerns that hitting UBS too hard could damage the global financial system as well as strong Swiss-US diplomatic ties could help pave the way to a manageable settlement
