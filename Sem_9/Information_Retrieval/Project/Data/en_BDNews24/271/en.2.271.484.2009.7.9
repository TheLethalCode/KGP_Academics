 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)The government will soon unveil an updated list of the firms that have defaulted on repayment of loans and many companies may be dropped off the current list, the finance minister has said. "The new list will be published after we get the data of the last month on the matter," AMA Muhith told reporters on Thursday after launching a programme on online income tax return submission. The minister rolled out a list of 2,196 companies on July 5 with classified loans totalling Tk 15,451 crore as of March this year "Many companies might be dropped off the list I have submitted in parliament after getting the latest data of May-June period," he said. The minister made the comment a day after Beximco Group contested the list. Several subsidiaries of the group were on the list of top defaulters. Muhith said that the list he revealed was updated to March 31, collected from the central bank's Credit Information Bureau. Beximco Group in a letter to the finance minister on Wednesday claimed that they were no longer loan defaulters. According that list, Beximco Textile was the largest defaulter with around Tk 353 crore loan followed by Padma Textile Mills Limited, another company of Beximco Group, with nearly Tk 293 crore. State-run Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation comes next at number three with Tk 267.5 crore, followed by another government-managed company, Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation which has defaulted on Tk 177 crore. SDS International Limited with about Tk 140 crore is the fifth largest defaulter. Beximco's Shinepukur Holdings comes sixth with Tk 134 crore loan default, while Beximco Knitting has Tk 81 crore. bd
