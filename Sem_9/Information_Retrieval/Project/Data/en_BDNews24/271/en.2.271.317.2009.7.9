 BARCELONA, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tour de France rider Sebastien Joly has thanked fellow cancer survivor Lance Armstrong for his support when he was diagnosed with the disease two years ago. "I took advantage of Sunday's stage to Brignoles to have a chat with Lance and thank him again for the e-mail he sent me when my cancer was revealed," Frenchman Joly told Reuters on Thursday. "He was extremely nice, asking me questions in French. We chatted for a little while. "Since he returned to cycling, I had not had a chance to see him again and I was afraid of being in the spotlight. I'm not too keen to talk about my cancer," the Francaise des Jeux rider said Joly, 30, was diagnosed with testicular cancer two years ago. The disease kept him out the sport for six months and he returned in 2008, winning a stage on the Circuit de Lorraine this season. "I'm not the only cancer survivor in the TdF. Sebastien Joly from Francaise des Jeux is as well. Give him a shout if u see him," Armstrong wrote on Twitter. American Armstrong won the first of his record seven consecutive Tour titles in 1999 after overcoming testicular cancer. He retired from the sport following his 2005 Tour victory but made his comeback in January.
