<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Certain groups are creating mass unrest in the garments industry with ill-motive and steps will be taken after investigation, prime minister Sheikh Hasina told parliament on Wednesday. Hasina, in reply to a question of Golam Dastagir Gazi MP, asked the owners as well as the workers to remain aware of this sort of conspiracy. The prime minister said government has taken initiatives to form an industrial police force. "The process is underway." Hasina said her government was also taking measures for better labour wages, rationing and housing for workers. To workers in the garments sector, the country's largest export industry, she said, "You have to be aware of those who are using you to play games." Thousands of protesting garments workers at Ashulia, in the Savar industrial belt outside Dhaka, clashed with law enforcers last week from Jun 28-30. The three days of rioting left two workers dead and a factory ablaze. Hasina's industries minister Dilip Barua has also put the riots down to "certain interest groups trying to attack the government" who have now "selected industrial areas and are focusing on small problems as huge." The Awami League government, which came to power in January after two years of emergency rule, has faced a number of trials in its first six months, including the BDR mutiny in February, which the ruling party frequently says are part of ongoing attempts to topple the government. Prime minister's questions began at 4pm Wednesday. Seven questions were scheduled and Hasina replied to two supplementary questions. bdnews24.
