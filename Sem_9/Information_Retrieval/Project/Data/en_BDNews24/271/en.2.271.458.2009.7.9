<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 09 (bdnews24.com)Finance minister A M A Muhith has asked all TIN holders to pay tax to some extent. "Only seven lakh out of 23 lakh TIN holders pay tax in the country which is very shameful. All TIN holders will have to pay tax to some extent to get rid of this embarrassment." He made the remarks at the inaugural ceremony of online income tax return submission programme of large tax unit (LTU) at National Board of Revenue (NBR) at Segunbagicha in the capital on Thursday. He said as much as 42 percent of the total revenue comes from the import sector alone. "Maybe nothing will come from the sector after 8/10 years," he feared. "Therefore, we will have to put emphasis on corporate income taxes." Initiatives will be taken to prevent tax dodge and collecting tax from all TIN holders is a part of that plan, Muhith said. He, however, would not say whether the tax will be collected in the current 2009-10 fiscal year. The minister said surveys will be carried out in 15 areas of the country to increase the number of taxpayers and revenue earnings as part of the plan laid out in the new budget. The government will also move to collect tax from fake TIN holders, he said. "The taxpayers of LTU will be able to submit their income tax return online [Thursday]. It will increase the revenue earning and will cut down on corruption and harassment. "But this opportunity should be there for all taxpayers of the country, not only for the big taxpayers," he said. He observed that if the revenue collection system, land registration process and the police record books could be digitised, then corruption would come down to a significant level. bd
