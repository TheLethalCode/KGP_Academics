<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 07 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has recommended that the government legalise the informal operations of asset management companies to recover thousands of crores in bad loans. The standing committee on finance ministry on Tuesday said allowing asset management companies to function will solve the banks' problems of bad loans. The committee also suggested a banking ombudsman under the central bank to settle the inter-bank issues, H M Mustafa Kamal, the committee chairman, told reporters at press conference at the parliament media centre. The chairman said the asset management companies would pay the banks a certain portion of money against the bad loans and recover the money as much as they can from the defaulters. He said such companies were functioning in many countries. "In Bangladesh, many banks have been informally doing the business. "So, we have asked the ministry to legalise their activities," said Mustafa Kamal, better known as Lotus Kamal. According to Bangladesh Bank statistics, repayment of loans worth about Tk 25,000 crore have been defaulted on. "Banks face many problems such as clearing houses and others. At present there is no authority to settle the inter-bank problems. "The proposed ombudsman will resolve the internal problems of the banks," said Kamal. "We will finalise our recommendations on this ombudsman at our next meetings," he said.
