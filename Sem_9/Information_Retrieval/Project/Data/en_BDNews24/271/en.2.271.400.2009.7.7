 GALLE, Sri Lanka, July 7 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara praised his bowlers after the team's dramatic 50-run win in the first test against Pakistan on Tuesday, but called for an all-round improvement ahead of the second match in the series. Pakistan appeared on course for a routine victory when play resumed on the fourth morning, starting the day on 71-2 and needing only 97 more for victory, but the tourists slumped to 117 all out after an inspired bowling effort from the hosts. "We knew if we were to have a chance then the first 5-6 overs were going to be crucial and that we needed two or three wickets, but we never expected it to happen so quickly," Sangakkara told reporters. "Until today, Pakistan outplayed us but this morning we really showed a lot of heart and character," he added. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath lead the attack with 4-15 figures to earn the man of the match award while left-arm quick bowler Thilan Thushara chipped in with 2-21. "The way Rangana and Thilan bowled was spot on... they put the balls in the right area they were patient and worked hard for their wickets," he added. He brushed aside pre-match criticism that the bowling lacked experience without veteran Chaminda Vaas and the injured Muttiah Muralitharan. "It is an inexperienced attack but also a fresh attack where the lack of experience was made up for by enthusiasm and a real hunger to do well and stay in the side," he said. IMPROVED BATTING He was critical of the team's batting, however, especially in the second innings when they were bowled out for just 217. "We have a lot of thinking to do about our batting because for the first time in a long time our batting line-up did not make the runs we usually do." "We've got to figure out where our off stumps are, what our mindset should be facing new bowlers we haven't seen before, and how to be as patient as possible to work through tough periods. "Those are areas we have to work on and work on quickly. "It's a great victory for us as a side but there is a lot of things we have to work on. We had one very good day today but other than that we were behind Pakistan." Sangakkara also thanked former skipper Mahela Jayawardene for the help he offered during critical periods in his first test as captain. "Mahela babysat me a little bit during the match and was brilliant with his advice and thinking at crucial periods," he added. Herath felt a positive attitude helped him perform well after receiving a last-minute call-up to replace Muralitharan in England, where he was playing in the Staffordshire League. "I was about to go to the gym for some training when I got the call from Sri Lanka Cricket," he revealed to reporters. "That gave me about 36 hours to get into the right mindset to play test cricket and I came here feeling really positive." Meanwhile, Pakistan were fined for a slow over-rate during the match with captain Younus Khan deducted 10 percent of his fee while the other members of his team were penalised half that amount after they were ruled to be one over short. The second test of the three-match series starts in Colombo on Sunday.
