 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid on Tuesday ordered checks on rundown primary schools across the country after seven children were injured the previous day as a chunk of plaster fell from the ceiling of a school in old Dhaka. The minister also ordered an investigation into the incident at Prashanna Poddar Lane Government Primary School at Tantibazar in old Dhaka. The school's acting headmaster Bhakti Rani Paul said no major repair work was done on the school building since it was built in 1967. Nahid instructed officers to visit all primary schools housed in old buildings and report on their condition, a senior education ministry official Subodh Chandra Dhali told bdnews24.com. A committee, headed by primary and mass education deputy secretary Shahidul Islam, was asked to submit a report within three days. Nahid later visited one of the injured school children, Rubina, at her home. bdne
