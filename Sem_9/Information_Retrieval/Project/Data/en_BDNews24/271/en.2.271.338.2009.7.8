 Brahmanbarhia, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Traffic movement along the Comilla-Sylhet highway was suspended at the Kharhera Bridge point in Kashba upazila from 6am on Wednesday after the bridge broke down. Brahmanbarhia Roads and Highways sub-divisional engineer Jahid Hossain said a Bailey bridge had replaced the ramshackle Kharhera Bridge only days back. The Bailey bridge collapsed as an overloaded truck carrying boulders tried to cross it in the morning, he said and added that the roads and highways department were repairing the bridge.
