<TEXT>
 Sirajganj, July 10 (bdnews24.com)The Jamuna's monsoon flow pushing heavily against its banks has breached the Sirajganj town protection embankment alarmingly on Friday morning, At around 10am, the town protection embankment caved in over a stretch measuring about 600 feet, the bdnews24.com correspondent said. Assisted by the local administration, the Water Development Board employees and the community members were dumping sand-filled bags in an attempt to repair the gaping breach. The location of the breach is only two kilometres away from the district township. The townspeople have been gripped by widespread panic. The Jamuna flow has of late been rushing downstream rather threateningly and on Friday morning it swept away about 600 feet of the embankment off the hardpoint zone. Seeing the bund disappearing fast, people began earthpacking to restrain the velocity of the devastation. The WDB personnel later joined the locals and started sandbag dumping along the breach. The locals, however, were heard blaming it all on the WDB people because they had not mended the weak points or stretches in time. Amirul Islam, WDB district engineer visiting the area in the morning, faced the wrath of the people. Upazila chairman Golam Kibria was seen supervising the embankment repair activities. The district administration, police and RAB officials have also reached the spot. In 2007, the town protection embankment had caved in, inundating Sirajganj town totally. bdnews
