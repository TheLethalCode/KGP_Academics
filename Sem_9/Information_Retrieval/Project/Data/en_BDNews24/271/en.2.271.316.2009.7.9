<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will host eight matches of World Cup cricket in 2011, the state minister for sports told parliament on Thursday. The opening match will take place in Bangladesh and the final in India, Ahad Ali Sarkar said in response to a written query from the MP for Dhaka-8, Rashed Khan Menon. Bangladesh Cricket Board is preparing for making venues and arranging diverse training programmes for the extravaganza, he said, replying to another query from woman MP Salma Islam. Bangladesh will also host two quarter-finals, a tournament's organising committee decided in Mumbai after the International Cricket Council removed Pakistan from the list of co-hosts for 'uncertain political situation.' Pakistan was supposed to host 14 matches including a semi-final, but their matches have been redistributed among co-hosts India (eight matches), Sri Lanka (three matches) and Bangladesh (three matches). Five matches including a quarter-final were originally allotted for Bangladesh at one venue, Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur) but now Bangladesh have got three more matches including a quarter-final and they now have to choose another venue for extra matches. bdnew
