 KARACHI, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The start of this year's Champions Trophy in South Africa has been brought forward by two days to Sept. 22. The International Cricket Council had orignally scheduled the eight-nation tournament from Sept 24. to Oct. 5. "But now on the recommendations of some countries who wanted longer gaps for their players between matches, the tournament will start two days earlier," a Pakistan Cricket Board source told Reuters on Wednesday. The tournament, which involves 15 matches in 14 days, was originally scheduled to be held in Pakistan in 2008 but was moved to South Africa because of security concerns.
