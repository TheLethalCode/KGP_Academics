 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)  The 2009-10 football season will begin in the second week of September with the Federation Cup. The decision was taken at the meeting of the B. League held on Thursday at the BGMEA Bhaban with Bangladesh Football Federation senior vice-president and league committee chairman Abdus Salam Murshedi in the chair. The month-long inter-club players' transfer will start on August 1. The meeting, however, could not take any decision on how many teams would play in the third edition of professional football league, which is expected to kick off from the third week of November after completion of the Bangabandhu Gold Cup football tournament in October-November. "The meeting has been adjourned today (Thursday) and it will resume on Monday and take a decision about the number of the B. League participants after the committee headed by BFF vice-president Kazi Nabil Ahmed meets new clubs invited by the BFF," said BFF general secretary Al Mussabir Sadi. Meanwhile, the BFF had earlier invited six new clubs for the B. League with five of them responding to the BFF invitations and the league committee kept Rajshahi Diganta Prasari off the list due to their insufficient documents. The winners of the Champions Club Cup Suktara Jubo Sangsad of Narayanganj, runners-up Feni Soccer Club, Dhaka Senior Division Football League champions Youngmen's Club Fakirerpool and Biyanibazar FC of Sylhet will sit with the committee on Saturday. The BFF general secretary said that the meeting also decided to keep the previous rule of playing three foreign players in each B. League match as no club except Abahani responded to their query of whether there was any need of the modification of the bylaws. The meeting also decided to hold the prize giving ceremony of second B. League on July 25. bd
