 SRINAGAR, Wed Jul 8, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Far from the violence and unrest that have marred the capital of disputed Kashmir, a group of young women swap their burqas for smart suits and stilettos and dream of a career in the skies. The inauguration of an international airport in Srinagar in February gave youngsters in Kashmir's main city an alternative to traditional careers in medicine and teaching, and the valley's first aviation academy is now grooming them for the skies. "When this institute opened, we got really excited," said Samiya Ayub, a trainee cabin crew at Viinzs Aviation Training Institute, which is located a short drive outside Srinagar.

Now, the militants' hold over daily life in the valley has eased, with violence ebbing since India and Pakistan, which both lay claim to the region and rule it in parts, began a peace process in 2004. A single cinema has reopened, traditional theatre and music are being revived and young Kashmiri women are abandoning their veils and considering careers like aviation. Shahida Bazaz, an instructor, said youngsters like Ayub were keen to make up for lost time and hold out hope for better times. "The present generation realises that we must go forward, we must go out of this valley, and see for ourselves what opportunities are available and take them with both ha
