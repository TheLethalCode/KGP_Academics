 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)  The cabinet has given the go-ahead to amend the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act 1973 for the trial of war crimes, to ensure "fair and neutral" trials. The cabinet gave approval for the amendment on Monday, which will be placed in parliament within one or two days, law minister Shafique Ahmed told reporters at his office. "There are provisions for trial of the armed forces and their associate forces under the 1973 act. We have recommended an added provision to try individual and group crimes for the trial of war crimes." A law ministry official told bdnews24.com that the draft amendment also proposed to reform the definition of "associate force" to include groups such as the Rajakar, Al badr and Al shams militias who collaborated with the Pakistani occupying forces in 1971. Shafique Ahmed said a provision for appeal against the tribunal's verdict has also been included in the draft amendment, which is not in the original law. "Amendment to the law was needed to ensure fair and neutral trials to make them globally acceptable," said the law minister. "A temporary tribunal will be constituted for the trials. A prosecution team of five to ten lawyers headed by a Public Prosecutor and an investigation committee will also be specially formed," Shafique said. English is proposed as the official language for the trials but the amendment keeps Bengali as well, he said. Trial of war crimes, perpetrated during Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War, was one of the election pledges of the present Awami League government. A resolution to try war criminals was passed in the first session of the ninth parliament in January. bdnew
