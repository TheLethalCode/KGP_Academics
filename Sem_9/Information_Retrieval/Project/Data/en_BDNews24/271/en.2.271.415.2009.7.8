 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Consumer-rights organisations have opposed the proposal of increasing the price of electricity of Rural Electrification Board (REB). At a public hearing arranged by Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) at its Karwan Bazar office on Wednesday, they said the proposal defies logic and that it is rather the quality of service not the price that should be raised. There is a huge gap between expectations and delivery, they said. Seven members from as many rural electrification committees said that the quality of the service is not satisfactory. "It should be mentioned in the price increasing proposal how the quality of the services can be improved and how an accident will be dealt with," said BERC member Emdadul Haque. The proposal also does not say if the subscribers will be informed of the timing of the load shedding beforehand, he said. "Because of a lack of best practice management the load of loss was imposed upon the subscribers for years," said Dr Tuhin Afroz on behalf of the consumer organisations. Besides, he said, the REB has given extra connections. There are many mismatches in the accounts of REB, said professor Shamsul Alam of the Consumers Association of Bangladesh. He said the REB's systems loss is 'unnatural' and added that emphasis should be on improving the distribution system. REB officials said that the quality of their service was good and action was taken as soon as any complaint was received from the subscribers. The distribution line went down in hot weather and so, the subscribers could not be informed in advance of load shedding, they said. REB said 66 out of 70 rural electrification committees in the country are incurring losses. If the price was increased according to the proposal some of the committees would be in making profits, they reasoned. On the household level, REB proposed to increase the price 15.19 percent from zero to 100 unit (each kilowatt hour), 26.19 percent from 101 to 300 unit, 18.24 percent from 301 to 500 unit and beyond. BERC said though the price of electricity was increased in the bulk level it was not increased at the customer level after 2002. REB submitted the price increase proposal on Dec 17 last year, on which an open discussion was held on April 21. High officials of REB including its chairman Bhuiyan Shafiqul Islam took part in the hearing directed by BERC member Mokhlesur Rahman. bd
