<TITLE> JS body recommends new tests to end 27th BCS dispute </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary committee has recommended the Public Service Commission arranges fresh oral tests to settle the dispute over the 27th Bangladesh Civil Service exams. The recommendation of the standing committee on the establishment ministry came Monday following a report of a subcommittee formed to settle the dispute. On Jan 21 2007, on orders of the past caretaker government, the PSC cancelled the results of the viva voce of the 27th BCS exams, after the final results came out, on allegations of favouritism and anomalies. The viva voce for those who passed the written test was re-taken, based on which many candidates who had passed the first time round were failed the second time. The failed candidates, calling themselves "deprived", have since been demanding the authorities take them back. The Public Service Commission on June 4 this year said that the first viva voce of the 27th Bangladesh Civil Service exams "had no legal validity". Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, however, directed the PSC to take measures to ease the long-standing dispute. The parliamentary subcommittee, on June 14, decided to request the PSC to recommended jobs for the deprived candidates considering the legal and ethical aspects. bdn
