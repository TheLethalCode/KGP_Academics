 Dhaka, July 6 (bdnews24.com)BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Monday that the Awami League government has had "no success" in the past six months since it came to power in January. "The government has had no success ruling the country, and are only concerned with torturing the opposition," Delwar told reporters at the BNP's Naya Paltan office. "The extent of their torture has surpassed Hitler," he said. Delwar claimed the ruling party was behind incidents of "torture and killing" of BNP leaders and supporters. "The BNP cannot be suppressed in this way," he said. Delwar said the government was promoting extortion, cronyism and extra-judicial killings instead of trying to keep their promises to the people. He also blamed unrest in the garments sector and difficulties of farmers in selling rice on government ineptitude. "The government has created a one-party parliament and are continually putting obstacles in the opposition's path to ensure it remains so," he said. "It is very clear that the government does not want cooperation from the opposition," said Delwar.
