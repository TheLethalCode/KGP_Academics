 MILAN, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sevilla's Brazil striker Luis Fabiano is AC Milan's only remaining transfer target but the clubs are some way apart on valuation, the Italian team's chief executive Adriano Galliani said on Wednesday. A move for Porto fullback Aly Cissokho collapsed after he failed a medical while VfL Wolfsburg refused to sell striker Edin Dzeko and interest in Real Madrid forward Klaas Jan Huntelaar has cooled. "The only talks that are continuing are for Luis Fabiano, a player our coach Leonardo prefers to Huntelaar," Galliani told reporters. "We are a few millions apart." Milan, who have faced fan protests after selling Kaka to Real Madrid, signed U.S. centre back Oguchi Onyewu on Tuesday.
