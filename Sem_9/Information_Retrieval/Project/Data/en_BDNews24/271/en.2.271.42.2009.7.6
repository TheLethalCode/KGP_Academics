Two construction workers aged between 20 and 26 died after they touched a live cable in a half-built house in Dhanmondi, said local police officer Abdur Rahman. On-duty doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital declared the victims dead on arrival. Both of the deceased, Arif Hossain and co-worker 'Lablu' were from Pabna, said a member of Arif's family.
