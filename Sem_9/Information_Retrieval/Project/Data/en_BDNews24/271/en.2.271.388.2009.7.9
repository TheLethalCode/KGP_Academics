 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)The House passed a law to re-activate the National Human Rights Commission on Thursday with provisions intended to strengthen the watchdog's role. The commission was formed last year under the past caretaker government's National Human Rights Ordinance 2007. But the commission ceased to be effective as the interim ordinance expired on Feb 25, awaiting ratification by the new parliament. HRC member Muneera Khan expressed frustration last month that the hands and feet of the HRC were tied. Suranjit Sengupta, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on law, meanwhile, has said the present government wants to constitute an active and effective Human Rights Commission to deal with all human rights violation against Bangladeshis at home or abroad. The commission will be vested with necessary judicial authority too so that the damages can be redressed. The national human rights watchdog will have its district chapters too, who will receive complaints on violations, carry out primary investigation and commission necessary trials. The caretaker government constituted the National Human Rights Commission on September 1 2008 under the National Human Rights Ordinance 2007. On December 1, 2008 the government appointed former justice Amirul Kabir Chowdhury as the chairman and Muneera Khan and Niru K Chakma as commissioners.
