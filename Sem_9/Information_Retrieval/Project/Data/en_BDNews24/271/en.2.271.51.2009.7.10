The hastily assembled West Indies team, brought together after the selected squad boycotted the game due to a dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board, finally took the field after lunch with seven test debutants. Thirty six-year-old Barbadian Floyd Reifer, who has not played in a test match for over 10 years, captained the West Indies team which also included all-rounder Darren Sammy. "We are just here to play cricket and to represent the people of the Caribbean," said Reifer, who had previously made just four test appearances. The Arnos Vale ground was virtually empty at the start of the game and although some fans did appear after lunch they saw little action. Pace bowler Tino Best made his return to test action and produced some lively deliveries during an opening spell with Kemar Roach but Bangladesh openers Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes progressed well. The two left-handers coped easily with change bowlers Sammy and David Bernard before rain interrupted their progress and tea was taken early. After a short return, torrential rain forced the game to be abandoned for the day
