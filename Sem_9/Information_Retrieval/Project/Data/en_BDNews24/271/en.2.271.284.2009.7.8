 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Detective Branch police arrested a doctor's wife and two sons in Dhaka on Wednesday for torturing a child employed in their home as a domestic worker. The victim, nine-year old Tanjina Akter, was in police custody after being rescued by a Detective Branch unit to check human trafficking and domestic violence in the capital. Police arrested 40-year old Halima Begum, wife of Dr Nurul Islam, and their sons Aminul Islam, 19, and Mominul Islam, 15. The three were picked up from their Azimpur residence after police were alerted to the situation by neighbours, said assistant commissioner Sadira Khatun, who led the special unit. "The little girl is said to have suffered brutally at the hands of this family," Khatun told a press conference at the Dhaka Metropolitan Police headquarters. Tanjina, who was also present, appeared too scared to speak. She looked stiff and bewildered. She had extensive bruising on her body, said police who suspected extreme physical torture. "They reportedly caned Tanjina everyday. If she cried, she was beaten harder," said Khatun. "Halima's daughter Parisha, a dental college student, is said to have tortured Tanjina the most." Police are looking for Parisha. Halima and her sons denied the allegations against them. The doctor's wife said Tanjina came to work for the family four months ago. bdn
