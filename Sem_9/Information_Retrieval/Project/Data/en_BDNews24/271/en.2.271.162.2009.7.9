 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Parliament passed the International Crimes (Tribunals) (Amendment) Act 2009 on Thursday for upcoming trials of war crimes, amid calls to ensure the new law conforms rigorously to international standards. Law minister Shafique Ahmed had presented the bill to the House the previous day, with the speaker urging quick passage before the end of the current parliamentary session. The bill was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry for overnight scrutiny. Speaker Abdul Hamid requested the committee to submit its report on the bill to the parliament secretariat for passage of the legislation on Thursday, the last day of the current session. Just ahead of the bill's passage, Shafique Ahmed said he was hopeful that the trial of war crimes will start within a month. "The 1973 Act has been amended to keep war crimes trials beyond question, and will be passed today," he told reporters at the Secretariat. The appointment of the investigation agency, prosecution team and other preparations would be completed within the month to start the trials, he said. Amendment for 'fair trials' "Amendment was brought to the law to ensure fair and neutral trial and to make them globally acceptable. No individual or political group will be politically persecuted under the newly amended act," Shafique added. The law minister had earlier said the 1973 act allowed for trial of armed forces and associate forces, but his ministry had recommended an added provision for trying "individuals and groups of individuals". A provision for appeal against the tribunal's verdict has also been included in the draft amendment, which is not contained in the original law. He also said English has been kept as the official language for the trials but the amendment introduces Bengali as well. The law minister has said a temporary tribunal will be constituted for the trials. A prosecution team of five to ten lawyers headed by a public prosecutor and an investigation committee will also be specially formed. Concerns Meanwhile, the US ambassador in Dhaka and the UK-based Human Rights Watch voiced concerns about the bill's hurried passage. US ambassador James F Moriarty called on the Bangladesh government to ensure its amendment to the law was updated in line with international law for the upcoming trials to be above all question. He said he hoped to see the law amended to prevent any question of "politicisation" of the trials. Human Rights Watch welcomed the tabling of amendments to make the law '"fair and neutral", but said additional amendments were necessary to ensure strict conformity with international law. In a letter to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, released on its website Thursday, HRW suggested the law's definition of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and its sections on rights of the accused, witness and victim protection be amended in line with the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) adopted in 1998. "While the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act may have been largely based on international standards at the time of its drafting, international criminal law has evolved significantly since," it said. "Justice for these atrocities is long overdue. But without additional amendments to the Act the process may not meet international fair trial standards. This could result in a lack of credibility for the process in Bangladesh and internationally, which would only benefit those responsible for the horrific crimes of this period," said HRW. bd
