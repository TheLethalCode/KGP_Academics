 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday sent convicted former BNP minister Aminul Haque, fugitive since emergency, to jail on surrender. Special judge Tanzina Ismail made the order after Aminul surrendered to the court in a wealth related case. A special court, on May 20 last year, sentenced Aminul, a former post and telecommunications minister, to 10 years in prison for amassing illegal wealth and concealing wealth information. The Anticorruption Commission had filed the case with Ramna Police Station against the former minister on Dec 21, 2007. In a separate case, a Rajshahi court on July 26, 2007 sentenced Aminul and 24 others to 31 years in jail for aiding and abetting militants.
