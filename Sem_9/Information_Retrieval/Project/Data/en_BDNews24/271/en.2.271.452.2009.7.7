 Dhaka, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com)Markets rose slightly higher on Tuesday as almost 60 percent of the traded scrips rose, after the bourses remained downbeat for the last two days. The Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index gained about 13 points, while the Chittagong Stock Exchange's key index jumped almost 33 points. Observers said fresh buying especially in insurance and non-bank financial institutions paced the day's spike. "Investors opted for buying in the wake of lower prices," said an official of brokerage firm Latif Securities, requesting anonymity. However, the market movers, the bank shares, were depressed, he added. All the bigwigs in the banking sector lost on Tuesday although some made slow gains.
