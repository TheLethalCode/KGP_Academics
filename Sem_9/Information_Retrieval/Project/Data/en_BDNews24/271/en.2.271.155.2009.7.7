<TITLE> Upazila Parishad Act to be amended: Ashraful </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam said Tuesday changes would be made to the 2009 Upazila Parishad Act following feedback from the local council chairmen and vice chairmen. Speaking to reporters at his office, Ashraful said his minsitry would investigate difficulties being experienced at various levels with the new law. "Project officers will identify problems with the Act and the difficulties being experienced by the local council representatives," said Ashraful. "They will submit their report to the ministry within three months and the law will be amended on that basis," he said. The Upazila Parishad Ordinance was passed under the tenure of the caretaker government; the current administration enacted the law last April with some alterations. Newly elected Upazila chairmen have complained that the new law gives too much say to members of parliament over the running of the local councils. It also currently renders local administration officers, or upazila nirbahi officers (UNOs), more powerful than elected vice-chairmen. Upazila elections were held in January under the newly elected government. But long-overdue city corporation and municipality polls have yet to held because of delays in passing the relevant legislation through parliament. Ashraful said the city corporation and municipality laws would soon be passed. bdnews2
