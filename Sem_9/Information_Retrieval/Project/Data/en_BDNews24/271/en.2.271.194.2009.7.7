 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)The government's revenue target and budget objectives will not be affected by cuts in duty and corporate tax rates from those originally proposed, said finance minister AMA Muhith on Tuesday. Talking to bdnews24.com in his office, he said "Budget amendments were brought about after careful calculation. There will be no negative impact on the revenue collection target as a result of these amendments." The final budget passed by parliament on June 29 made cuts in corporate tax, lowered proposed duties on a range of imports and revised the original money whitening offer down to a year instead of three years, raising some question about the revenue target that remained unchanged. "Our government has taken the fulfillment of budget objectives as a challenge. I mentioned this challenge in the post-budget press conference. The big challenge for the government will be to meet the goal of revenue collection," said Muhith. Muhith in his proposed budget, presented to parliament on June 11, offered the scope to legalise undeclared money for a period of three years with a fixed 10 per cent tax and mandatory investment in key development sectors. The final budget, passed on June 29, revised the period down to one year in the face of much public criticism over the length of the 'money whitening' offer. The budget amendments on the day also included duty cuts on import of small cars, motorcycles, newsprint and mobile phone sets. They also cut corporate tax to 42.45 per cent from 45 per cent for banks, insurance companies and financial institutions. Muhtih said he was optimistic that the revenue target would be achieved at the close of the financial year, as the administration would be revamped to step up earnings. The total size of the budget for 2009-10 is about Tk 1,14,000 crore, with a revenue collection target of Tk 79,461 crore. Of this, NBR is expected to raise Tk 61,000 crore. bd
