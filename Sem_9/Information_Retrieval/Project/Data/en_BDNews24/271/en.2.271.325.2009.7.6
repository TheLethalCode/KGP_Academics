Abdul Hannan, a businessman who ran against Rashid for BNP's Chandpur-4 nomination, accuses the MP of creating fake academic certificates in his name. He alleges that the Election Commission subsequently rejected his nomination as a result of the misrepresentation. Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Md Ehsanul Huq fixed Dec 21 to start recording witness statements. Hannan filed the case in December 2008.
