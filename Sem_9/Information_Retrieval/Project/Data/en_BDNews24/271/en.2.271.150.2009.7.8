 Chapainawabganj, July 8 (bdnews24.com)  Rail links between Chapainawabganj and the rest of the country were suspended for over ten hours on Wednesday after a carriage of an express train came off the tracks. Chapainawabganj Railway station master Mohammad Moniruzzaman said the carriage of the Khulna bound Mahananda Express derailed at around 4:40am at the Alinagar outer signal, minutes after it left the station. A relief engine from Amnura Junction, some 15km from the accident site, was dispatched to clear the tracks, he said. The rail line was restored at around 3pm, said the station master. bdnews24
