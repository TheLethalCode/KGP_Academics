 BAGHDAD, Jul 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two car bombs exploded within minutes of each other on Wednesday in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul, killing 14 people and wounding 33, police said. The first went off in a residential area of northern Mosul, home to minority Shabaks, killing one person and wounding six people, a police official told Reuters. The second exploded about 10 minutes later near a Shi'ite mosque several kilometers away in another Shabak area of the city, killing 13 people and wounding 27. Mosul, a volatile ethnic and religious mix of Arabs, Kurds, Christians and other minorities, has become Iraq's most violent city while the bloodshed that followed the US-led invasion in 2003 has declined in the rest of the country. US combat troops withdrew from central Mosul, as they did from the centers of other towns and cities, at the end of last month as part of a plan to withdraw all US troops by 2012. The withdrawal, mostly to bases at the edges of cities, shifts the burden for keeping Iraqi streets safe mainly on to local police and soldiers, whose ranks have been rebuilt after they were disbanded by US officials in 2003. On Wednesday, an Iraqi soldier was killed at an army checkpoint in Mosul. In a separate incident, police opened fire on a car, killing a civilian. The reason for the shooting was not immediately clear. North of the city, in another part of Nineveh province, two civilians were killed when their car exploded. Police suspected they might have been transporting explosives
