<TITLE> Hasina among 'top 10' global leaders at risk, says Motia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Motia Chowdhury said Wednesday that Sheikh Hasina numbers as one of the top ten people in the world at risk of assassination. "Hasina has opponents such as the (main opposition) BNP, who have repeatedly tried to assassinate her, both while in power and out of power," said Motia at her secretariat office. "Hasina is also under threat for being a symbol of secularism against extremism and militancy," she said. Motia's comments follow cabinet approval, on July 6, for a law to provide lifetime security for the family of slain independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina's father. "Hasina is one of the top ten people in the world whose life is threatened," said Motia. "This is the reason the government made arrangements to ensure her safety and the safety of other members of Bangabandhu's family by law," she said. This type of law exists in many countries in the world, she said, adding that Nehru's family in India was made subject to similar legislation following the murder of Rajiv Gandhi. Also present at the briefing was Abdul Mannan, minister for housing and public works, who said the government would try to allocate housing for members of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's family under the proposed law as soon as possible. Mannan said the government would seek advice from security experts regarding the allotment of housing. "One or more house could be allocated by bringing them under the special security system," said Mannan. Rehana and other members of the family stay with her at the state guesthouse Jamuna when they are in Dhaka, he said. If the law is implemented, Mannan said, they would be allotted housing wherever and whenever they want, and the government would make the necessary arrangements with security issues in mind. bdnew
