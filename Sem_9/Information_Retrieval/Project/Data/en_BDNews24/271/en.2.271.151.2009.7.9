 TOKYO, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan have scheduled World Cup warm-up games with the Netherlands, Scotland and African nations, Ghana and Togo, later this year. Takeshi Okada's side will face the Dutch on September 5 before playing Ghana on September 9 as part of the team's training camp in the Netherlands, Japanese officials said Thursday. Japan will host Scotland on October 10 in Yokohama and Togo in Oita four days later in the three-team Kirin Cup tournament. The Japanese have already secured their place at next year's World Cup finals in South Africa, as have the Netherlands. Ghana and Togo made their World Cup debuts at the 2006 tournament in Germany and are well placed to make it to South Africa. Scotland are on course for a playoff spot.
