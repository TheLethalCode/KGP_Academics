 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is mulling a division of the food and disaster management ministry, in a move that would aim to increase efficiencies, the food minister said Thursday. "The move is still under discussion, but the government will soon make a final decision on the issue," Razzaq told reporters following a meeting with Hasina at his office. "The food ministry's work is to procure, store and provide for the public's food demands, whereas disaster management prepares for natural calamities and conducts post-disaster work," he said. Razzaq said a formal split would inject pace into the current ministry's activities, although he gave no clue as to the appointment of ministers to any revamped ministry. Referring to another topic discussed in the meeting, Razzaq said the prime minister had not sought foreign aid after Cyclone Aila struck the country in May, although foreign assistance for long-term plans remained essential. Creating employment opportunities for disaster affected people, building cyclone shelters and protecting rivers all require long-term planning and foreign assistance, he said. He said the prime minister would soon meet donor representatives to discuss long-term planning. On a related issue, Razzaq said the prime minister had ordered the construction of new food silos with a capacity of 700,000 tonnes to mitigate storage shortfalls.
