<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 06 (bdnews24.com)Visiting Dutch minister Bert Koenders said Monday his country was concerned about reports of extra-judicial killings in Bangladesh, making specific reference to recent deaths of BDR soldiers in custody. Koenders, while praising the government's stated zero tolerance policy towards extra-judicial killings, nevertheless called for an investigation into the deaths of more than 25 border guards, some of whom were being interrogated in custody, in the wake of the BDR mutiny in February. The Dutch minister's concerns follow similar calls by local and international rights groups, while a visiting European troika mission also highlighted the issue in June. "It is imperative that all such deaths be thoroughly investigated and those responsible punished," said Koenders at a press conference to mark the conclusion of his two-day visit to Bangladesh. He said he hoped the government would also speedily establish a national human rights commission. "We believe that a human rights commission, with adequate power, would contribute to the human rights situation in Bangladesh," he said. Koenders also said his country would continue its partnership with Bangladesh on water management and land reclamation projects. Koenders, and the Dutch vice-minister of transport, public works and water management Tineke Huizinga, called on prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the afternoon. They also met foreign minister Dipu Moni, finance minister AMA Muhith and water resources minister Ramesh Chandra Sen during their visit. bd
