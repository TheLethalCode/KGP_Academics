 Dhaka, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com)Stocks closed downbeat for the second day in a row as rumours of regulatory interventions left investors skittish. Dhaka Stock Exchange's benchmark index dropped about 20 points, while the Chittagong Stock Exchange's key index shed almost 80 points. Observers said reports of the market regulator and central bank checking for manipulation by financial institutions and recent negative comments from analysts combined to spur the downturn. "News that the SEC and Bangladesh Bank would check merchant banks for signs of manipulation triggered today's sales," said an official of brokerage firm Anwar Securities, who requested anonymity. "We heard that the news caused quite a few merchant banks to sell their holdings against their will," he said. Monday's market witnessed almost 60 percent of trades listed on the twin bourses lose value. Dhaka stocks started downbeat from the opening bell, before buying in the midday session temporarily halted the slump, finally ending down.
