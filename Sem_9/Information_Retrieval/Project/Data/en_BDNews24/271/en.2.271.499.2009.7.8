<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former India captain Saurav Ganguly, who retired last year, wants to use his experience to make a difference in an administrative role, domestic media reported on Wednesday. "I'm convinced that I can play a positive role," India's most successful test captain told Times of India. "Having played the game at the highest level and being part of the system, I know what it takes to make a difference." The 37-year-old, who played 113 tests and 311 one-day internationals and led India to 21 test wins, could contest the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections in Kolkata later this month, it said. "At some point, I will find a way to get into the CAB where people have known me since I was a kid," Ganguly told the newspaper. "I have respect for them and I'm sure they will appreciate my concern for Bengal cricket and the difference I can make." Ganguly is already a member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) technical committee. Asked if he wanted to one day head the national board, he said: "It's a possibility, but right now I'm not looking that far ahead. I intend to take it step-by-step."
