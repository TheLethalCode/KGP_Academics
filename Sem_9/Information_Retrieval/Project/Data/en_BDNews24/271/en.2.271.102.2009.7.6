 MOSCOW, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States and Russia agreed on Monday an aim to cut deployed nuclear warheads to 1,500-1,675 within seven years of a new arms reduction agreement coming into force. "Within seven years after this treaty comes into force, and in future, the limits for strategic delivery systems should be within the range of 500-1,100 units and for warheads linked to them within the range of 1,500-1,675 units," according to the framework agrement. The deal was agreed during talks between U.S. President Barack Obama and Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev in the Kremlin. Estimates of current nuclear stockpiles vary but the U.S.-based Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimated that at the start of 2009 the United States had around 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads and Russia around 2,790.
