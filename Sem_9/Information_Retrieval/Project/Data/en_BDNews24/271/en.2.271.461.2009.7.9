<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)Human Rights Watch has called on the Bangladesh government to ensure its proposed amendment to a 1973 act is rigorously updated in line with international law for upcoming trial of war criminals. HRW suggested the law's definition of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, and its sections on rights of the accused, witness and victim protection be amended in line with a 1998 statute of the International Criminal Court for credible trials. In a letter to prime minister Sheikh Hasina, released on its website Thursday, HRW welcomed the tabling of amendments to the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act of 1973 by law minister Shafique Ahmed to make the law '"fair and neutral". "However, additional amendments to the 1973 law are necessary to ensure that trials under the Act are carried out in accordance with Bangladesh's international human rights obligations, international criminal law, and Bangladesh's constitution," said Brad Adams, executive director of HRW's Asia Division, in the letter. "While the International Crimes (Tribunals) Act may have been largely based on international standards at the time of its drafting, international criminal law has evolved significantly since, including with the adoption of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 1998 and its coming into force after ratification by 60 states in 2002," he said. "Justice for these atrocities is long overdue. But without additional amendments to the Act the process may not meet international fair trial standards. This could result in a lack of credibility for the process in Bangladesh and internationally, which would only benefit those responsible for the horrific crimes of this period," said the letter. Law minister Shafique Ahmed presented a bill for amendment of the 1973 Act in parliament on Wednesday, for upcoming trials of war crimes, with the speaker urging quick passage before the end of the current parliamentary session. Shafiq tabled the bill for tailoring of the original act in order to try war crimes committed by individuals or groups of individuals during Bangladesh's war of independence from Pakistan. The bill was sent to the parliamentary standing committee on the law ministry for overnight scrutiny. Speaker Abdul Hamid requested the committee to submit its report on the bill to the parliament secretariat by noon on Thursday for passage of the legislation on the last day of the current session. The cabinet gave the go-ahead on July 6 to amend the law to ensure "fair and neutral" war crimes trials. Shafique said on the day that the 1973 act allows for trial of armed forces and associate forces, but his ministry had recommended an added provision to try individuals and groups of individuals for war crimes in Bangladesh. He also said a provision for appeal against the tribunal's verdict has been included in the draft amendment, which is not contained in the original law
