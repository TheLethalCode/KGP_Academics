<TITLE> Ronaldo hits hat-trick in 4-2 win for Corinthians </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RIO DE JANEIRO, July 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ronaldo scored a hat-trick as Corinthians beat Fluminense 4-2 on Wednesday, taking his tally to 14 goals in 22 matches since his return to action in March after surgery early last year. "The three are my kids and I don't have a favourite," Ronaldo said of the hat-trick although his second goal, after a run from the Corinthians half including a one-two with Douglas and a dribble past two defenders, was reminiscent of his prime. Victory in the Brazilian championship match, postponed from the weekend, lifted Corinthians into fifth place on 14 points, six behind leaders Internacional after nine matches.
