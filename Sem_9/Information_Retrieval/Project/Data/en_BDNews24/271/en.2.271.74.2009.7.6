 GROS ISLET, St.Lucia, July 5 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India won the one-day series against West Indies 2-1 after Sunday's fourth and final match was abandoned due to heavy rain. After West Indies were put into bat, skipper Chris Gayle went from the second ball of the day caught behind off Ishant Sharma for a duck. Against some good Indian bowling, the home side reached 27 for one in the eighth over when play was stopped by a downpour. Although the rainfall later ceased, there was too much water in the outfield for play to resume and after over two hours of waiting the game was abandoned.
