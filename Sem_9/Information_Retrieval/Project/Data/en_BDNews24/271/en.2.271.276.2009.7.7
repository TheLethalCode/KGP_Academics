<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Commerce minister Faruq Khan said Tuesday that Chittagong and Mongla ports should be developed into effective regional hubs to promote trade and cooperation among south-Asian countries. "For the first time, all countries in the region have politically elected governments. It is time we pursued greater regional integration," Faruq said at the start of a two-day conference on South Asian integration at the Dhaka Sheraton Hotel. He said as part of the push for increased regional trade ties, Bangladesh was set to sign a new trade agreement with Pakistan, while another with China was also in the pipeline. "Trade is a development tool, but it is overlooked in this region. There are too many tariff and non-tariff barriers here," he said. Faruq said a lack of political will and good faith between nations was another reason trade remained underdeveloped in the region. South Asia is rich in resources such as energy and manpower, but trade issues are rarely discussed in our parliament, he said. Faruq dismissed those who term the proposed Bangladeshi section of the Asian Highway as an 'Indian corridor', saying it would promote trade links. Rehman Sobhan, chairman of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, stressed the need for discussions with other South Asian countries regarding tariff and non-tariff barriers and the extent of the nation's trade gap. "Bangladesh must play an active role in the integration process," said Sobhan. CPD executive director Mostafizur Rahman said difficulties faced by the business community concerning exports and imports had to be removed. "The seven north-east Indian states should be permitted to use Chittagong port," he added. The South Asian Network on Economic Modelling and Commonwealth Secretariat, UK organised the conference, titled 'Managing Regional Integration in South Asia'. bdne
