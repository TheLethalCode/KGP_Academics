 Dhaka, July 8 (bdnews24.com)Ambassador Mohamed Mijarul Quayes became acting foreign secretary on Wednesday. Quayes took charge of his new office at a ceremony in the afternoon, after arriving in Dhaka from Moscow earlier the same day, Md Touhid Hossain, the outgoing foreign secretary, told bdnews24.com. Asked to say a few words about his new job, Quayes referred to a famous comment by independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. "When Sheikh Mujib landed in London on Jan 8 1972, to be met with a sea of people, he said 'I'm here to be seen today, not heard'," said Quayes. Quayes was serving as Bangladesh ambassador to Russia when he was selected for the position of foreign secretary. Hossain, who was appointed acting foreign secretary on Dec 17, 2006 and later foreign secretary by the immediate past caretaker government, has been named principal of the Foreign Service Academy.
