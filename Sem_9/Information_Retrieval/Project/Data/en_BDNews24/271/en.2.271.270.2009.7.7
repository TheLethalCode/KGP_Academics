 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)  Former army chief General Moeen U Ahmed handed in his resignation as president of the Bangladesh Olympic Association on Tuesday. BOA chief executive officer and director, retired colonel Waliullah, said Moeen tendered his resignation to the state minister for youth and sports Ahad Ali Sarker, who is also patron of BOA. Waliullah said the association has called an emergency executive committee meeting on Thursday with the sports minister to preside. The new chief of army staff, General Md Abdul Mubeen, took up his new office on June 15. The army chief traditionally takes over the BOA helm, but he must first be nominated as a BOA councillor. General Moeen took over as the BOA president on July 7, 2005 and was again elected uncontested in the April 3, 2008 polls. Moeen also won the award of merit given by the Olympic Council of Asian with OCA president Sheikh Ahmad Al-Fahd Al-Jaber Al-Sabah handing over the prize in Dhaka on April 29, 2009. Moeen was also the chairman of the National Sports Council (NSC) from July 8, 2007 to April 20, 2009 before stepping down from the top sports governing body following a controversial deal between Bangladesh Football Federation and Bashundhara Group. The general came in for criticism for his presence in the deal signing ceremony between BFF president Kazi Salahuddin and Bashundhara Group chairman Ahmed Akbar Sobhan, who was convicted of corruption in absentia during the past caretaker government rule. During his nearly two year stint at the NSC, Gen Moeen held elections to all major sports federations including the BFF and Bangladesh Cricket Board. He also had 20 banks to support 19 cash-starved federations. bd
