 Dhaka, Jul 6 (bdnews24.com)The central bank chief has hinted that the Equity and Entrepreneurship Fund, intended to provide interest free loans to entrepreneurs will get more money. "I think Tk 200 crore is only the beginning, there needs more money in the fund," the Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman said on Monday. "The finance secretary has assured me that there is more money," he told a seminar in the capital hosted by Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services. The EEF was created in Dec 2000 to encourage investors to put money in promising start-up businesses in software, food processing and agro-based sectors in particular. Rahman said the fund would be made more effective by easing regulations. He said a draft of the new regulations had been sent to the finance ministry. "We're hopeful it will be a more effective fund in coming days," said the central bank boss. Bangladesh Bank was authorised by the government to manage the fund, until the state-run Investment Corporation of Bangladesh recently took responsibilities for distribution of the fund. A total of Tk 508 crore has so far been disbursed to finance 251 projects. Among the projects, 217 were agro-based and 34 related to IT. A crocodile farming project at Bhaluka in Mymensingh and a cow-fattening project at Sathia in Pabna were among the innovative projects financed by the EEF. The fund offers to finance 49 percent of a project if the remainder comes from the entrepreneur. The minimum budget for a project should be 20 lakh, which was earlier 50 lakh, and the EEF loan can be paid off over a maximum of eight years. bdne
