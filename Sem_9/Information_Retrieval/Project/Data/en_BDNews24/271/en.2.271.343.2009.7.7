 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Academic and social activist Professor Serajul Islam Chowdhury has called for a 'broader stage' at home and abroad to protest India's planned Tipaimukh dam. "The Indian government must stop the project as it is going to be harmful for the people of Bangladesh as well as India's Monipur and Mizoram states," Prof Chowdhury, a professor emeritus at Dhaka University, told a meeting at the Jatiya Press Club on Tuesday. "We have to garner global public support in this cause," said Chowdhury, who remains a prominent educationist. Water experts, environmentalists and sections of the media in Bangladesh have voiced concerns over the environmental impact of India's planned dam over the cross border Barak river. The main opposition BNP, and its right-leaning allies, have also been among the most vocal in the country to protest against India's planned dam, inviting criticism from some quarters of doing so for "political mileage" only. Chowdhury on Tuesday suggested forming a "greater stage" under the leadership of left-leaning leaders. "The project will undoubtedly leave a negative impact on the environment if implemented. We must take initiatives for a united movement along with the Indian people and the world," he said. The discussion meeting, on 'Tipaimukh Dam and the national interest', was organised by Somaj Rupantor Oddhoyon Kendra, a centre for social research. Leaders of left parties including the Communist Party of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Somajtantrik Dal (Bangladesh Socialist Party) and experts on water issues attended. Speakers also criticised recent comments by the Indian High Commissioner that were disparaging of Bangladeshi water experts. bd
