<TEXT>
 Dhaka, July 9 (bdnews24.com)The all-party parliamentary probe body looking into corruption charges against former speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, former deputy speaker Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and former chief whip Khandker Delwar Hossain, has recommended stripping Sircar of parliament membership. The head of the committee, Awami League MP Fazle Rabbi Mian, presented a 784-page report, compiled over three months, in parliament on Thursday. It recommended that they refund the public money they spent in violation of rules. The report also recommended taking legal actions against Sircar, Siddiqui and Delwar for wasting public money during their eighth parliament tenures. Speaker Abdul Hamid said parliament would discuss the report. "The committee recommends that the membership of Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar of the ninth parliament be cancelled. Besides, it also recommends taking legal actions against him," the report said. "It recommends initiating legal actions against Akhter Hamid Siddiqui and Khandker Delwar Hossain for their misdeeds," it said. Justifying the recommendation on scrapping Sircar's membership, the report said, "It is the inherent power of parliament to expel any member for misconduct no matter whether there is any specific provision for this." "The main objective of the recommendations is to protect the dignity of parliament and ensure people's trust so that the democratic system of governance becomes effective". Mian told parliament that Sircar, Siddiqui and Hossain were in contempt of parliament as they did not turn up at the June 27 meeting to defend the corruption charges. The report alleged that Sircar drew around Tk 28 lakh as medical bills without the approval of the former prime minister Khaleda Zia. Siddiqui and Delwar also took over Tk 1 lakh and Tk 6 lakh, respectively without proper approval. On "unauthorised" use of vehicles, the committee said Siddiqui wasted nearly Tk 59 lakh while Sircar spent about Tk 38 lakh as fuel bills. Delwar expended Tk 37 lakh for his authorised use of vehicles of parliament secretariat. "They must return over Tk 1 crore 33 lakh spent as fuel bills," the report said. "Sircar must return Tk 1 lakh 99 thousand 991 he spent as bill for an iftar party on October 3, 2006. "He must refund Tk 1 lakh 99 thousand 950 for dinner the same day," said the report. The probe body said Sircar appointed 42 staff in parliament secretariat "without justification". It also recommended filing departmental actions against six parliament secretariat officials who were the members of the selection committee for the staff appointed "violating" rules. The committee said Siddiqui wasted over Tk 3 lakh through construction of a cage for swans released in parliament's lake. The report said the chief whip's office spent over Tk 75,000 as entertainment bill though Delwar was in Singapore for his treatment. He, as president of the parliament members club, illegally drew Tk 18 lakh in donation, the report said and asked for return of the money. Besides, the committee said Delwar took away valuable goods like computers, fridge, furniture and others from the parliament secretariat. Speaker Abdul Hamid on March 19 formed an 11-member probe body to investigate the alleged corruption of Sircar as speaker from Oct 28, 2001 to Jan 25, 2009. Mian, the committee head, had told bdnews24.com last week that because Sircar, Siddiqui and Delwar did not turn up before the committee, they had prepared the report according to their own investigations. The parliamentary probe committee has convened 11 times, since its formation in March, to investigate charges brought by MPs of the eighth parliament and to prepare its report. Regarding the allegations against him, Sircar, MP for Bogra-6, had previously told bdnews24.com, "The allegations are vague and not specific. The probe body has been formed with an ulterior motive." Siddiqui is charged by the probe committee with misusing millions of taka of parliament by procuring vehicles beyond his entitlement. In a letter sent to the committee head, however, Siddiqui said he used the vehicles in line with the tradition set by his predecessors. Siddiqui also demanded punishment of the committee head Fazle Rabbi Mian for making "false statements" about him to the media. Former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain, now BNP's secretary general, is charged by the Mian committee of taking valuable equipment from the parliament secretariat and giving "false statements". Delwar has refused to give any reaction on the charges against him. bdnews
