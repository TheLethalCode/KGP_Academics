 Dhaka, July 7 (bdnews24.com)Health minister Dr AFM Ruhul Haque said Tuesday there was no cause to panic despite the fact that 18 swine flu cases have been detected in the country in the past 21 days. Replying to reporters' queries at the health ministry, Haque said the government has strengthened its supervision and monitoring of the swine flu situation. But, he said, the flu's spread could not be ruled out despite the government's best efforts. Haque told reporters that 18 cases have been identified to date. "They are being supervised and treated by the government and almost half of them have recovered," he said. Haque said all incoming passengers were undergoing screening at air, land and sea ports "The World Health Organisation declared a global swine flu pandemic as it spread through a number of countries in the world." "Even some developed countries failed to check its spread despite considerable measures," said Haque. "Therefore, its spread cannot be ruled out here despite governmental efforts," he said. He said symptoms only become visible some three days after contracting the virus. "Any infected person travelling during the incubation period is likely to spread the virus," he said. The health minister was speaking after a meeting with US ambassador James F Moriarty. Haque said Bangladesh would be benefited from US president Barak Obama's committment to the world health sector
