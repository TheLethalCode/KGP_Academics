 NEW YORK, July 6 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - American number one Andy Roddick will not play in this weekend's Davis Cup quarter-final against Croatia after injuring his hip during an epic five-set loss to Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final. Roddick's spot on the U.S. squad will be filled by world number 23 Mardy Fish for the tie in Porec, Croatia. "Mardy is a Davis Cup veteran and we appreciate his willingness to join the team on short notice," said U.S. team captain Patrick McEnroe in a statement. "He has been playing well and we are glad to have him back in the singles line-up. "Andy had a great run at Wimbledon. He battled for more than four hours yesterday and fought hard to reach the final. "Understandably, his body is not up for the rigors of Davis Cup in such a short turnaround. "Andy has been a stalwart for this team the past nine years and his dedication to Davis Cup and his team mates is unquestioned."
