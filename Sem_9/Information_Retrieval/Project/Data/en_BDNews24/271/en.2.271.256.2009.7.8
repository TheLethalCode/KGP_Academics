 LONDON, July 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United have completed the signing of Frenchman Gabriel Obertan on a four-year contract, the Premier League champions said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old, who can play in a number of different attacking positions, has joined United from French club Girondins Bordeaux. "Gabriel is a player we have tracked for a few years now, but because of his educational programme our efforts to get him here have always been delayed," United manager Alex Ferguson told the club's website (www.manutd.com). "We are delighted to get him now as he is an exciting prospect. We like to get young players and develop them and we will see that in Gabriel over the next two years." Obertan is Ferguson's third signing of the close season following the arrival of Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia and striker Michael Owen at Old Trafford.
