 BEIRUT Mon May 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lebanon's parliamentary majority bloc was expected on Monday to choose a prime minister to head a new cabinet that will be formed as part of an agreement ending 18 months of political conflict, politicians said. The majority is expected to nominate its leader, Saad al-Hariri, or Fouad Siniora, the existing prime minister, to lead the new cabinet in which the Hezbollah-led opposition is guaranteed effective veto power.

The conflict between the U.S.-backed ruling alliance, which has struggled against Syrian influence in Lebanon, and the opposition, led by the Damascus- and Tehran-backed Hezbollah, was brought to an end last week by a Qatari-mediated deal. The Doha agreement defused a crisis that had caused the worst civil strife since Lebanon's 1975-90 war, including fighting this month which killed 81 and ended in a military victory for Hezbollah over its ruling alliance rivals. Followers of Hariri, Lebanon's most powerful Sunni figure, were among those routed by Shi'ite Hezbollah, a political group with a powerful guerrilla army. Were he to become prime minister, Hariri would take up a post previously held by his father Rafik al-Hariri, whose February 14, 2005 assassination plunged Lebanon into more than three years of crisi
