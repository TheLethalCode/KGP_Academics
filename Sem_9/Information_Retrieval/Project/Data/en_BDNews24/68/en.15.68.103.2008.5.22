<TEXT>
 KARACHI, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court wants Salim Malik's appeal against his life ban from cricket to be heard again by a civil court. The Supreme Court said on Thursday it wanted a decision reached within two months. The lower court had previously rejected the appeal. Former captain Malik received a life ban from the Pakistan Cricket Board in 2000 after being found guilty of involvement in a match-fixing scandal that rocked international cricket in the late 1990s. The 45-year-old, who played 103 tests and 283 one-day internationals, said he was very happy with the directions issued by the court. "I now have hope that finally I will get a verdict against the ban in two months time, he told reporters after the hearing. "I have only wanted justice and I have maintained I am innocent. This case has lingered on for too long. But now I am confident my appeal would be heard and be successful." The batsman, who also played for Essex in the English county championship, acknowledged his playing career was over but said he wanted to get into coaching and give something back to cricket. The PCB's legal counsel Tafazzul Rizvi said the life ban would remain until the case was resolved
