 KINGSTON, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies trailed Australia by 316 runs with seven first-innings wickets remaining after seamer Stuart Clark claimed the hosts' top three batsmen on the second day of the first test on Friday. Clark's excellent spell of three for 18, including the prize wicket of captain Ramnaresh Sarwan, left the hosts struggling on 115 for three chasing Australia's total of 431. Runako Morton (23) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (25) saw West Indies through to stumps after they had struggled to 68 for three following a positive day with the ball. Clark bowled Devon Smith, after the West Indies opener made a bright 32, and provided debutant wicketkeeper Brad Haddin with his first test victim when he snapped up Sarwan who had flashed outside off-stump. Clark caused further damage with a beautiful delivery moving away from Brenton Parchment, who scored just nine off 60 balls. Morton and Chanderpaul got their heads down, though, and battled through to stumps but Clark said the Australians were happy. "It was good to get a few wickets, we are in a pretty decent spot in the game, if we can get a couple of early ones tomorrow, especially Chanderpaul, we can put them under a lot of pressure. AGGRESSIVE BOWLING Ricky Ponting's superb 158 had guided Australia to an overnight total of 301 for four but they ran into aggressive bowling from Fidel Edwards who ended with a five-wicket haul. It looked like a good comeback by West Indies with Australia having added just 98 runs for the loss of five wickets but all-rounder Andrew Symonds found his form to raise the target. Symonds hit eight fours and two sixes in his unbeaten 70 and scored 28 of the 32 runs in a 10th-wicket partnership with Stuart MacGill. Twenty-six-year-old Edwards, finding the kind of consistency he has usually lacked in his career, made the vital early breakthrough when he had Brad Hodge caught behind for 67. Nightwatchman Mitchell Johnson (22) then spooned a soft catch to Daren Powell at mid-on off the bowling of Darren Sammy. Sammy struck again just before lunch when he claimed Haddin for 11, caught by keeper Denesh Ramdin as he edged an attempted pull shot. Edwards picked up the wickets of Brett Lee and MacGill to complete his five-wicket performance -- which also included both Australian openers. Edwards felt West Indies had fought back well. "We had the better of today, the way we bowled out Australia and we have 115 for three wickets so hopefully we can build on that tomorrow," he sai
