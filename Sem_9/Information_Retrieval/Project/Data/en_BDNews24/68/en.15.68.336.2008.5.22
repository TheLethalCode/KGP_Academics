 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)Former US ambassador to Bangladesh Patricia Butenis arrived in Dhaka Thursday on a "personal visit". This was her second visit to Bangladesh after she ended her diplomatic assignment in Dhaka in June 2007. Amy Hart Vrampas, director of the American Centre, told bdnews24.com: "She has come to Dhaka on a personal visit." Butenis had earlier come to Dhaka on March 1 on her first "personal visit". Butenis started her assignment as US ambassador to Bangladesh on April 16, 2006. A witness to Bangladesh's bickering politics leading to a state of emergency, Butenis left Dhaka in June 2007, ending her 14 months of an "eventful and exciting" assignment. She is now working as the deputy chief of the US mission in Iraq. bdn
