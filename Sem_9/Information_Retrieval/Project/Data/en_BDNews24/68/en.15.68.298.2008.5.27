<TITLE> Myanmar junta praises UN aid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YANGON Tue May 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Army-controlled media in Myanmar praised the United Nations on Tuesday for its help to the 2.4 million people left destitute by Cyclone Nargis, suggesting a thaw in the junta's frosty relationship with the outside world. The English-language New Light of Myanmar said UN agencies took "prompt action" to provide relief supplies after the May 2 cyclone, which left 134,000 people dead or missing. The paper, the generals' main mouthpiece, also softened the government's line that the immediate relief phase of the disaster was over, saying instead that "rescue and rehabilitation tasks have been carried out to some extent". However, the junta arrested 20 people trying to march to the home of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Tuesday, the day her latest year-long stretch of house arrest is due to expire, a witness and opposition sources said. The arrests, and expected rolling-over of the 62-year-old Nobel laureate's detention order, are bound to create new tensions with Western nations who promised millions of dollars in cyclone aid at an unprecedented donor conference in Yangon on Sunday. Three weeks after the 120 mph (190 kph) winds and sea surge from Cyclone Nargis devastated the Irrawaddy delta, the U.N. says fewer than one in three of those most in need have received any aid. Thousands of beggars are lining up along the roads, with droves of children shouting "Just throw something" at passing vehicles. Witnesses say many villages have received no outside help, and waterways of the former Burma's "rice bowl" remain littered with animal carcasses and corpses, either grotesquely bloated or rotting to the bone. The stench of death is widespread, as are the swarms of flies. DELAYS Much of the blame for the aid delay rests with the junta, which has been reluctant to admit a large-scale international relief effort for fear of loosening the vice-like grip on power the army has held since a 1962 coup. However, top diplomats who helped coordinate Sunday's conference said there were small signs of the generals gradually overcoming their pride and paranoia and admitting outside help. "I can sense that there is a sense of urgency," Surin Pitsuwan, Secretary-General of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), told a news conference in the Thai capital on Tuesday. "A sense of appreciation that the world, after all, is not all that hostile on some issues, particularly on humanitarian issues," Surin said. Washington told the Yangon conference it was ready to raise its offer of $20.5 million in aid if the junta opened up, but added it was "dismayed" the generals went ahead with a constitutional referendum in the middle of the disaster. The result -- 92.5 percent in favor on a turnout of 98.1 percent in a poll held with no neutral monitoring -- is unlikely to enhance the credibility of the generals' seven-step "roadmap to democracy", that is meant to culminate in elections in 2010. After a promise to visiting UN chief Ban Ki-moon by junta supremo Than Shwe that all foreign aid workers would be given full access to the delta, foreign aid workers have headed out of Yangon to test whether anything has changed on the ground. Myanmar embassies are also granting more visas to aid workers, although the UN's World Food Program, which is spearheading much of the emergency relief push, says it is coming up against reams of red tape at every turn. "Yesterday was a record, red-letter day with seven visas applied for and seven issued," WFP spokesman Paul Risley said. "But every step of the way has been difficult. Every step has required agreement with the government, clearance from the government, approval by the government of virtually all of our actions.
