<TITLE> 'Big Phil' eyes his second final with Portugal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LISBON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luiz Felipe Scolari has set his Portugal side the ambitious target of reaching a second consecutive European championship final at Euro 2008. The coach known affectionately as "Big Phil" was in charge when Portugal reached the final of Euro 2004 as the widely-fancied host nation, only to suffer a 1-0 defeat by pre-tournament outsiders Greece in Lisbon. "We will go to Euro 2008 with the goal of reaching the final, but to get there is a long road," Scolari said recently. The Brazilian's contract ends after the finals and the Portuguese football federation are unlikely to keep hold of a tough, widely-respected coach who won the 2002 World Cup with Brazil and who is tipped for a return to club football. Playing down the speculation about his future, he said: "I have a contract until July 2008. Now I am concentrated on the European championship and after that I do not exclude any scenarioincluding staying in Portugal." Despite some controversial decisions when choosing players, Scolari has established an unprecedented record as Portugal's coach, having qualified the side for two consecutive European championships and a place in the World Cup semi-finals in 2006. On a popular level, the 59-year-old's success has certainly brought the fans back to support the national team. However, he has also experienced low points, notably when he was banned for three matches by UEFA for what European soccer's ruling body called an "assault" on Serbia's Ivica Dragutinovic following a 1-1 qualifying draw last September. He also had to run the gauntlet of the British press when the Football Association made a vain bid in 2006 to talk him into becoming the next England manager. Even his success with Brazil in 2002 had followed an initial period of uncertainty among his compatriots. Although Scolari had won plenty of major titles at club level, he had also gained a reputation for employing physical violence and gamesmanship. He was frequently sent from the touchline for arguing and even fighting, and had publicly encouraged his players to foul the opposition
