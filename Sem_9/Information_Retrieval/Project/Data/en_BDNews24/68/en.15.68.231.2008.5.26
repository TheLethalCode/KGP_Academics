 KATHMANDU, Mon May 26, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two small bombs exploded in Kathmandu on Monday as Nepal banned demonstrations in the capital, fearing trouble ahead of a special assembly meeting expected to abolish a centuries-old monarchy. "Two blasts went off in the gardens of the convention centre where the constituent assembly is to meet," Home (interior) Ministry spokesman Mod Raj Dotel said, adding no one was injured. He said the blasts were "symbolic" of the opposition to Nepal being declared a republic. Dotel said a pro-Hindu militant group, Ranabir Sena, had claimed responsibility for the blasts. Police said no arrests have been made. Nepal's Peace and Reconstruction Minister Ram Chandra Poudel had said earlier Monday that demonstrations in and around the royal palace, King Gyanendra's private home, the convention centre and the official residence of the prime minister were banned. "This is to control all types of provocations," he said. "Anyone could try to take the advantage of the sensitive situation and create trouble." Nepal's special assembly elected in April is expected to turn the land-locked kingdom into a republic on Wednesday, a key part of a peace process ending a decade-long civil war which killed more than 13,000 people. Supporters of the former Maoist rebels, who led the campaign against the monarchy, are expected to gather in the streets to celebrate the expected decision. "We have urged the people to come to the streets on that day to celebrate the republic day," said Dinanath Sharma, a senior Maoist leader. "This will mark the formal end of the feudal monarchy. It is a historic day." Hindu-majority Nepal has remained a monarchy all through its history and the king was traditionally revered as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu, the god for protection. But that popularity plunged since King Gyanendra fired the government in 2005 and imposed an absolute rule, only to give in to weeks of anti-king protests and hand power to political parties a year later. The Maoists, who secured a surprise victory in the April elections and are expected to head a new interim government, have urged Gyanendra to move to his private home before the meeting and help a smooth transition
