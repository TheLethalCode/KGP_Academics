<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com) - The Foreign Footballer XI held the Bangladesh national football team to a 1-1 draw in the first preparatory match for next month's SAFF championship at Narsingdi Stadium Thursday. Midfielder Abul Hossain capitalising on a Komol pass gave Bangladesh a lead in the 11th minute while Liberian Jeremiah taking a defence lapse levelled the margin for the foreign footballer XI in the dying minute. The match was an 80-minute affair following the rains and national coach Abu Yousuf almost fielded a second string team to avert the injury problems on the slippery pitch. Defender Hasan Al Mamun, Wali Faisal, medio Mehdi Hasan Ujjal and Aram Aziz sat out because of their injury problems. Coach Yousuf happy over the booters' performance of Thursday hoped that the team would have more shape in the second practice match against the former Bangladesh national booters on Saturday in Dhaka. The Bangladesh Football Federation has arranged the practice match for the national booters against the foreign footballers staying in Bangladesh. The national team is likely to leave here for Thailand to play two more practice matches on May 28 and 29.
