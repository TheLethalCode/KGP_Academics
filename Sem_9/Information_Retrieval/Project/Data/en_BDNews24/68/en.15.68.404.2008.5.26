 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com) - Outgoing chief justice Md Ruhul Amin welcomed his successor's appointment Monday, while urging all judges to discharge their judicial responsibilities in the light of the law. He addressed the judges at the unveiling of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh (Appellate Division) Rules, 1988 Amendment, at the Supreme Court Judge's Lounge. On the appointment of MM Ruhul Amin as this successor, the outgoing chief justice said: "The new has always to be welcomed." "Every thing has an end. If one is in charge of an office, it has an end. Reality has to be accepted as reality," Md Ruhul Amin said of his own departure from office. Speaking of the newly published amendment to the Appellate Division rules, he said laws and rules have to be made up-to-date in accordance with the age. Necessary amendments have to be brought about. "The Appellate Division Rules were formulated in 1988. Since then, no amendment has been made. In 2008, we felt that the rules needed to be amended." Speaking on what changes have been brought to the rules, the outgoing chief justice said they included fees for registration as lawyers and senior lawyers in the Appellate Division being increased, among other amendments. Newly appointed chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, judges of the Appellate Division, the registrar of the Supreme Court and other officials were present. bdnew
