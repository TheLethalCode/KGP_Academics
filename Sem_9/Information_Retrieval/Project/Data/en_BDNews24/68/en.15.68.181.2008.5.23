<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission has approved a final report to submit for eight Roads and Highways engineers, as the bribe-taking charges could not be proved against them, an official said. ACC director general (administration) colonel Hanif Iqbal revealed the news of approval to reporters Thursday, without disclosing further details. An anticorruption taskforce held the engineers and an official of a construction firm in a coffee shop in the city on Jan 10 on suspicion that the engineers shared bribes among themselves. It was initially reported that members of the taskforce had also seized Tk 13.99 lakh from their possession. A day after their arrest, a Dhaka court sent the arrestees to jail, and police told reporters at the time that they had confessed to taking bribes. The arrestees include RHD additional chief engineers Mozammel Huq (Dhaka Division), Mominul Huq (Comilla Division) and Md Rafiqul Islam (Comilla Division) and Abdullahel Kafi (Rangpur), and project coordinator of the firm Mamtajuddin. It was alleged that the firm was awarded the lease of toll collections for Rupsha Bridge and the firm offered the bribe to the RHD officials for extending the lease period. bdnews
