<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka moved into the final of the 28th National Cricket Championship with a tense 18-run win over Barisal in the curtailed-over first semifinal at Sylhet Stadium Monday. Dhaka bundled out Barisal for 93 in 19.5 overs after scoring 111 all out in 20 overs as the match was reduced to a 20-over-a-side affair following rains. Dhaka will play the final on Wednesday against the winners between Rangpur and Narayaganj. Barisal's Fazle snared a hat trick, but could not keep Dhaka beyond the triple figure as Faiyaz and Mithun scored 36 and 17 respectively. In reply, Saroz quickfired a 49-ball 48, but saw his Barisal go down by 18 runs in face of opponents' superb bowling. Saroz smashed three sixes and as many fours.
