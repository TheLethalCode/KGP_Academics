 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  League leaders Usha Krira Chakra made a flying start in the Super League of the Premier Division Hockey League with an emphatic 5-0 win over Ajax SC at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Tuesday. Usha, who started the Super League with all-win record in the first leg, raised their point tally to 30 points from 10 matches, eight points ahead of second-placed Abahani Limited, who, however, played a match less than the leaders. Pakistani recruit Akhter Ali, arguably the best player in the league, put Usha ahead in the eighth minute from a field goal while his compatriot Tareq Aziz doubled the lead in the 29th minute converting a penalty corner. The Old Dhaka outfit went to a breather with a comfortable 3-0 lead with striker Maksud Alam Habul scoring the team's third goal just one minute before the lemon break. Jahidul Islam Rajon widened the Usha margin in the 49th minute converting a penalty corner while veteran striker Rafiqul Islam Kamal sealed the match two minutes from time through a field goal.
