 JAIPUR, India Sun May 25, (bdnews24.com/BBC/Reuters)  At least 36 people have died in two days of clashes between security forces and ethnic Gujjar protesters in the Indian state of Rajasthan, police say. Police opened fire on demonstrators on Friday in Bharatpur district killing at least 15. One policeman also died. Unrest continued on Saturday in Sikandra as police stations were torched and 20 more people were killed. The Gujjars want official recognition to make them eligible for preferential recruitment in jobs and education. Road and rail traffic between the Indian capital, Delhi, and the city of Jaipur has been affected. $60m package The state government has now called for negotiations with the Gujjars, but there has so far been no response. Similar protests almost a year ago resulted in the death of 23 people. Last week the state government announced a financial package for Gujjars worth more than $60m. But they rejected the package, saying they must be included in the official list of the disadvantaged tribal groups, which gives them access to government jobs and other benefits. Nearly half of all federal and state governments jobs are reserved for the poor and disadvantaged groups. The issue of affirmative action is a sensitive one in India with many poor communities arguing it is the only way they can benefit from the country's economic growth. But those opposed to the policy blame politicians for using it as a tool to gain votes. State elections are due in Rajasthan later this year. Reuters initial report said, at least 31 people have been killed and scores injured in western India in two days of clashes between police and members of a farming caste demanding job quotas for their community, a state minister said on Saturday. The violence began on Friday when protesters belonging to the Gujjar caste lynched a policeman in Bharatpur district in Rajasthan, G.C. Kataria, the state's home minister, told reporters. Police shot at protesters as they tried to damage railway lines and government property, he said. At least 15 were killed. On Saturday, the army was called in to help calm the violence as another 15 people were killed when police shot at a mob protesters trying to torch a police in Sikandra. Thousands of protesters were blocking a rail route between Delhi and Mumbai, police said. Highways have also been blocked, and state authorities have cancelled many buses. Gujjars are already considered among the low born in India's complex caste hierarchy. They want to be thought of as even lower -- a so-called scheduled tribe -- so they can qualify for the nearly half of all government jobs and state college seats reserved solely for the lowest castes, who tend to be poorer than their high-caste compatriots. But a state government committee did not agree, and announced instead it would spend 2.82 billion rupees ($67 million) improving schools, clinics, roads and other infrastructure in Gujjar-dominated areas. The protesters do not want the money. "We do not accept the economic package," K.S. Bainsla, the head of the main Gujjar protest organisation, told reporters. He said the state government must write to New Delhi recommending Gujjars be recategorised. "We'll not accept anything less." A year ago, Gujjars in Rajasthan fought police and members of another caste that already qualifies for job quotas. At least 26 people were killed in that violenc
