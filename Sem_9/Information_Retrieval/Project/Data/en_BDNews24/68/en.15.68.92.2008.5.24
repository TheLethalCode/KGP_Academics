 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League said Saturday the government's dialogue with political parties had got off to a "bad" start. "Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed had been at the first meeting with the political parties for a short time. The seating arrangement for the talks was unpleasant and indecorous," acting AL general secretary Syed Asharful Islam told reporters after a presidium meeting. Presidium members held the meeting at acting AL president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home. The senior leaders expressed concern over a remark of election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain, as reported in a newspaper, that the Election Commission would not be responsible for any shift in the polls deadline, Ashraful said. According to a plan, an extended meeting of the AL set for a May 26 start will continue for 10 hours from 10am. Senior leaders will be present at the meeting, but will not make any speech. Any political decision will be taken at a meeting of the AL Central Working Committee after taking opinions from grassroots-level leaders, Ashraful said. The AL will take tight security measures for its extended meeting scheduled to take place at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. The AL will provide the participants of the meeting with special badges and reporters will have to show accreditation cards to cover the event. The reporters without accreditation cards will be able to cover only the inauguration of the meeting, Ashraful said. Senior leaders Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta and Motia Chowdhury attended Saturday's meeting. bdn
