 Gazipur, May 25 (bdnews24.com)A single-barrel shotgun snatched Thursday night from a police patrol in Gazipur was found abandoned Sunday, police said. "A police patrol retrieved the abandoned shotgun from a lakeside spot in the Ambagh area early Sunday. The gun lay hidden under a bed of grass. The cartridges taken with the gun were not found though," Gazipur police superintendent Abdul Baten told reporters. The shotgun was snatched Thursday night from Konabari, two kilometres from Ambagh. The gun was found based on information obtained after interrogating arrested suspects following the incident, police said. Unknown men swooped on a three-man police patrol at Konabari, Gazipur, on the Dhaka-Tangail highway in the late hours of Thursday night and snatched the loaded shotgun, seriously injuring constables Nayeb Ali (56) and Mosharraf Hossain (50). Following the incident, police arrested a number of suspects and a search operation was launched in the area. bdnews24.com/corr/ra/mi
