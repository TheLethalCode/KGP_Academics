<TEXT>
 JOHANNESBURG, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South African troops prepared on Thursday to enter townships to help end xenophobic attacks that have killed 42 people, and a top official of the ruling ANC criticized the handling of the crisis. President Thabo Mbeki's call for the army's intervention was an acknowledgment of the seriousness of unrest since May 11 that has driven thousands of African migrants from their homes and threatened to destabilize Africa's largest economy. The deputy leader of the ruling African National Congress, which ousted Mbeki as party leader in December, criticized the police delay in responding to the violence. "The delay encouraged people in similar environments to wage similar attacks against people who came from our sister countries on the continent," Kgalema Motlanthe said at an international media industry conference in Johannesburg. More than 15,000 migrant workers and their families have fled to refugee camps after 11 days of attacks by mobs armed who accuse the African immigrants of stealing jobs and fuelling crime. Several people have been burned to death and scores of shacks looted and torched. Motlanthe said the violence was an assault on the values of South Africa's democratic society. He is a close ally of ANC leader Jacob Zuma, who defeated Mbeki for the party leadership. "We are confronted by one of the ugliest incidents in the post-apartheid era," he said. Soaring food and fuel prices have helped push tensions to breaking point, prompting the intervention of the army in restive areas around Johannesburg. JOINT OPERATIONS Soldiers are expected to participate in joint operations with police, who have failed to prevent the anti-foreigner attacks from spreading from Johannesburg area shantytowns to other parts of the nation, including KwaZulu-Natal. The attacks on African migrants has increased political instability at a time of power shortages, rising inflation and disaffection over Mbeki's pro-business policies. The South African currency fell sharply earlier this week on the back of the violence. The rand was slightly weaker on Thursday at 7.75 to the U.S. dollar. Police said there had been no new reports of xenophobic attacks on Wednesday night in the area around Johannesburg. Some migrants are not waiting for authorities to gain the upper hand. "We must leave, It is not safe here," a Zimbabwean woman told Reuters on Wednesday as she left the Primrose informal settlement outside Johannesburg where gangs of youths burnt and looted migrants' shacks. Others, especially migrants from neighboring Mozambique, are also making plans to leave South Africa which has a population of about 50 million and is home to an estimated 5 million immigrants. South Africa's reputation as a haven for immigrants and asylum seekers is in tatters, and there are growing fears that the crisis could dent the country's lucrative tourism industry and cripple its hosting of the 2010 soccer World Cup. Government officials have raised the possibility that the attacks were not spontaneous but organized, possibly for political reasons. Four community leaders are among the more than 400 people arrested in connection with the violence
