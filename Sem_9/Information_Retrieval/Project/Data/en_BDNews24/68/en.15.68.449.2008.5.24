 YANGON, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Disaster relief officials said there was "no time to lose" to help Myanmar's cyclone survivors after the secretive military government promised the United Nations it would allow in more aid workers. The junta, criticized by the West for failing to accept a full-blown aid operation following the devastation of Cyclone Nargis three weeks ago, went ahead on Saturday with a constitutional referendum in the Irrawaddy Delta and Yangon. The rice-growing Delta and the former capital were hit by the vicious storm in which nearly 134,000 people were left dead or missing. The plebiscite on the army-drafted constitution was held in the rest of the country on May 10 with a 92.4 percent approval after voters were repeatedly told by authorities to vote "Yes". Voting started on Saturday in Yangon, the country's biggest city, but officials said many residents had voted in advance, including opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for five years. Disease, hunger, lack of shelter and medical treatment threaten up to 2.5 million people in the delta, according to United Nations humanitarian aid officials. "We have no more time to lose, so it's imperative that the Myanmar authorities immediately provide the international community with the practical details of the agreement," European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid Louis Michel said. Junta supremo Than Shwe gave an assurance to visiting UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Friday to allow in aid experts "of all nationalities" after weeks of restrictions in the delta. NAVY SHIPS REJECTED But it rejected offers of US, French and British Navy ships delivering supplies, UN officials said. They said the military vessels were "a very sensitive idea for them -- any suggestion they should dock", but that Than Shwe said Myanmar was open to receiving relief supplies and equipment from civil ships and small boats. French President Nicolas Sarkozy condemned the refusal to let the navy ship Mistral enter Myanmar territorial waters. "I profoundly regret this decision. Once again the junta has made the wrong choice," Sarkozy said during a visit to Angola. The United States said it would not keep its ships waiting off the coast indefinitely for the generals' permission. "We're going to continue to try to encourage them ... We're still hopeful," Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said. The reclusive junta has accepted relief flights into Yangon from many countries, including the United States, its fiercest critic. Supplies and medical teams from several Asian countries have also been allowed in, but many westerns working with humanitarian groups were denied visas or restricted to Yangon. Ban's mission to meet Senior General Than Shwe in his isolated new capital of Naypyidaw, 250 miles north of Yangon was seen as a breakthrough, but aid groups were waiting for details on how the agreement would work. The UN chief himself said he hoped that the deal "can produce results quickly. Implementation is the key." State-run TV showed officials from donor groups and diplomats of the UN and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) touring delta towns on Friday in preparation for a pledging conference in Yangon on Sunday. Myanmar has said it needs more than $11 billion in pledges. Ban, who was going to China on Saturday to show support for victims of last week's earthquake that killed 55,000 people, would attend the joint UN-ASEAN conference in Myanmar, officials said
