 ZAGREB, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's chances of making progress at Euro 2008 will be closely linked to the fortunes of the country's exciting young playmaker, Luka Modric. The 22-year-old has outstanding vision and supplies defence-splitting passes with impressive ease, though his tireless running and work rate are his greatest strengths. Born in the coastal city of Zadar, Modric started his senior career at Dinamo Zagreb but spent two seasons on loan with local rivals Inter Zapresic and Bosnia's Zrinjski Mostar. He score 11 goal in 40 games before returning to Croatia's most heralded club in 2005. At Zrinjski, he won the Bosnian League Player of the Year award in 2004 at the age of 18 and followed up with Croatia's Football Hope of the Year award at Inter after guiding them to second place in the league. Good performances in the Under-19 and Under-21 teams earned him a place in the World Cup 2006 squad and he made two appearances as a substitute. Modric then scored his first international goal in a 2-0 friendly win over world champions Italy shortly before starting Euro 2008 qualifying campaign, in which his incisive playmaking abilities and Eduardo da Silva's finishing drove Croatia to the finals. With Brazilian-born Eduardo having suffered a badly broken leg in February, Croatia will be hoping Modric can get forward more and shoulder some of the goalscoring burden. His international form, combined with a very respectable record of 25 goals in 87 appearances for Dinamo and the Croatian League Player of the Year award in 2007, inevitably drew the competing attention of foreign clubs. Tottenham Hotspur's bid of 21 million euros last month won the day, their coach Juande Ramos backing Modric to supply the creative spark in midfield which the Spaniard believes his side need to make a real impact in the Premier League. Before then, Croatia's hopes of emerging from a Group B that also features Poland, Austria and Germany rest largely on Modric's ability to inspire them to produce their best football
