<TITLE> Hasina trusts AL to make right decision on dialogue, says lawyer </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  Detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina said she had faith in the decision of leaders and activists of her party on whether AL would go to dialogue with the government. "They will take the right decision in the extended meeting (Monday)," the former prime minister told her lawyers in court during charge framing proceedings in the Niko graft case. "The government wants to keep me away from the election by sentencing me. That's why it is filing false cases one after another." "I will come back to my people in spite of all conspiracies," she was quoted by her lawyer as saying. Advocate Abdul Mannan briefed reporters after the conversation with Hasina. The party wants elections, she said, and asked her supporters again on Monday to be cautious about any conspiracy that might take place regarding the national elections. "The party should be united in any situation," Mannan quoted. "We want elections; power should be reinstated to an elected government for the resumption of a democratic system." The detained AL chief was upset that she had not been able to stand beside the people for a year, nor had any contact with her party's leaders and supporters, Mannan reported. "I did not commit any crime. What I did was for the welfare of people," Hasina was quoted by her lawyer as saying. "The people are currently in trouble. This is very painful for me," she said. bdnew
