<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  Detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia Saturday denied any involvement in the Barapukuria coalmine scam, her lawyer said. ACC deputy director Monirul Hoque, investigation officer of the case, interrogated the BNP chairperson in special jail at the Jatiya Sangsad complex. Khaleda's lawyers Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon and Advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas were present during the interrogation. Emerging from the jail, Khokon told reporters: "The former prime minister told the investigation officer that the case had been filed to harass her." "Khaleda Zia said that she had carried out her duty in line with government rules of business," Khokon added. "If cases are filed this way, no government will be able to work. Development will come to a halt," Khaleda was quoted as saying. Shimul Biswas said the lawyers talked to Khaleda on GATCO and Niko cases too. Khaleda trashed the cases as false, the lawyer said. ACC assistant director Shamsul Alam filed the Barapukuria case against 16 people with Shahbagh Police Station on Feb 26. Former ministers M Saifur Rahman, Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, Motiur Rahman Nizami, M Shamsul Islam and Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed were among the accused in the case. The accused persons allegedly resorted to irregularities and corruption to hand over the charge of the coalmine to a Chinese company. bdnew
