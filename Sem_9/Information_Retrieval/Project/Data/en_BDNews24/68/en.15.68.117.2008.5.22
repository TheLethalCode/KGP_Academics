 LISBON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch and Luiz Felipe Scolari in the dugout, Portugal fans believe their wait for a major trophy could end at Euro 2008. Losing finalists on home soil four years ago, Portugal should make a good start after a favourable draw alongside hosts Switzerland, Turkey and the Czech Republic in Group A. Though they have lost their last two friendlies to world champions Italy and European champions Greece, Portugal rose to the challenge when it counted in qualifying and Scolari clearly sees his side as potential champions. "Portugal are not the favourites," said the man who masterminded his native Brazil's 2002 World Cup triumph. But he added: "We think we are among the four, five or six teams who can fight for the title. "For me the great favourites are the countries who have participated in five or six Euros and World Cup finals, such as Italy, Germany and France. "Every team comes to the European championship with the aim of going as far as possible. The goal is the final." Scolari will use a two-week training camp at Viseu, Portugal to prepare his squad, several of whom will have come through a particularly gruelling season at club level. The Brazilian coach will at least be able to count on playmaker Deco, who returned to action with Barcelona last month after being sidelined for two months. Cristiano Ronaldo will join up after his 41 goals propelled Manchester United to the Premier League title and a place in the all-English Champions League final against Chelsea. "I will not be as I am now," Ronaldo warned Portuguese media towards the end of the English season. "I will have had more games in my legs and I will be more tired. "But I will play for Portugal with passion." Scolari, a firm believer in a mixture of youth and experience, will be working with largely the same squad as at Euro 2004, barring injuries. Each of them will believe in the team's chances of glory, which would be rewarded with a bonus of 300,000 euros each from the Portuguese football federation, according to media reports
