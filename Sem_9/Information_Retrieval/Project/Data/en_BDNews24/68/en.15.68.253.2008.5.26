 KINGSTON, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies believe they hold the upper hand in chasing a further 241 runs with nine wickets in hand to produce a massive upset and beat Australia on the final day of the first test, all-rounder Dwayne Bravo said on Sunday. "I think we're in a very good position at this point of time," Bravo told reporters after his side finished on 46 for one, chasing 287 for victory. "We're going to have to come tomorrow (Monday) and make sure we get a good start, make sure we don't lose early wickets. "If we win the first session I have no doubt that we will go out and win the game. We're in a position of strength." The Sabina Park surface has held up better than expected but remains a little inconsistent and Bravo said it was vital his team mates keep upbeat. "We have to go out and be positive and believe in ourselves and that we are going to get the runs. Once we all believe, then I have no doubt we are going to get it. "The track is up and down but we are happy to go out there and bat on the last day to try and get the runs." West Indies will start the day with skipper Ramnaresh Sarwan and Devon Smith at the crease after Brenton Parchment was dismissed for 15. With Chris Gayle missing through injury there is extra pressure on Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul to deliver. Chanderpaul, who was hit by a bouncer from Brett Lee on Saturday, did not field on Sunday but will bat in his normal position at number five on Monday. Australia, however, are confident they can skittle West Indies and silence those who believe the world's number one ranked team are a fading power. "I think Australia go out with the mentality of defending anything, whether we've got 150 or 280," said batsman Brad Hodge. "It's going to be a real testing day of test cricket tomorrow, each side will think they can win. "The Australians are fairly confident that on a fifth day wicket we can bowl West Indies out and hopefully win the test match
