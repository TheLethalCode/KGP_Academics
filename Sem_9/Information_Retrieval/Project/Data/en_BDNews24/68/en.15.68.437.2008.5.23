<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold fell in volatile trade on Thursday, as investors booked profits after pushing up the price to its highest level in more than a month above $930, but more gains may be on the cards with oil hitting another record peak. Spot gold dropped to $922.50/923.50 an ounce from $928.55/929.75 an ounce late in New York on Wednesday, having earlier jumped to $935.30 an ounce -- its highest level since April 18. Oil roared to an all-time high above $135 an ounce on supply worries and the weakening US dollar, triggering fears of inflation and raising gold's safe-haven appeal. "I think the confidence is back in the market. We broke $900, we broke $930," said Frederic Panizzutti, metals analyst at MKS Finance. "So definitely we see some potential for higher levels again. The psychological (resistance) is $950, then probably $980 and there is of course the psychological $1,000 level." Despite the gains, gold was still more than $100 away from the record high of $1,030.80 an ounce hit on March 17. Some analysts remained cautious. "There are enough supply constraints and there is no dearth of bullish views on crude oil from various institutions and organizations. This one-way outlook adds fuel to the fire, propelling gold along with it," said Pradeep Unni, analyst at Vision Commodities in Dubai. "Possibly, we could see $138-$141 in crude in near term, but extreme caution should be exercised as the rally seems to have over-extended itself and sharp reversals could be on board, meaning it could also succumb in the process." Gold futures for June delivery on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange lost $6.2 an ounce to $922.4 an ounce, having risen to $933 an ounce on Wednesday -- its highest level since April 22. "There's not much activity in the physical market. Jewellers seem happy to buy around the $900 level," said Ronald Leung, director of Lee Cheong Gold Dealers in Hong Kong. "I think there are only speculators and investors in the market." Jewellers sold more scrap gold to dealers and trade houses on Thursday as bullion rallied, but industry buying, notably by the electronics sector, remained steady. Gold shrugged off news that two workers of South Africa's fourth-ranked gold producer DRDGOLD were killed in xenophobic attacks that saw a drop in output at one of its three mines in the country. Spot platinum fell to $2,169/2,189 on ounce from $2,188.50/2,208.50 ounce late in New York, having earlier hit a two-month high at $2,216 an ounce. Precious metals refiner Johnson Matthey said this week the metal, used in jewelry and auto catalysts, could spike to a record high of $2,500 this year due to fears of a supply deficit. Platinum struck a record high of $2,290 on March 4 after a power crisis in main producer South Africa disrupted mining. Spot silver fell to $17.86/17.92 an ounce from $18.01/18.09 in late New York. Spot palladium dropped to $448.00/456.00 an ounce from $454/462 an ounce
