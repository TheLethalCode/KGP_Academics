<TITLE> Ronaldo goal spree lifts Portugal's hopes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LISBON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo's dazzling season of goals, awards and club glory has given Portugal real hope of becoming European champions next month. The winger rattled in a remarkable 42 goals as he helped Manchester United retain their domestic title and win the Champions League final against Chelsea in Moscow. Off the pitch, the 23-year-old was voted player of the year by his fellow professionals and also by the football writers, collecting each award for the second year running. "On a couple of occasions this season he has played as a centre-forward and he has got four goals which is a great strike rate," United manager Alex Ferguson said recently as he reflected on Ronaldo's tally for the season. "But to score those goals (predominantly) as a wide player is phenomenal." Ronaldo is now seen as Portugal's pivotal player for Euro 2008, in much the same way as Luis Figo at Euro 2004 and former great Eusebio was during the 1960s. With his clever step-overs, fast footwork and good heading ability, Ronaldo has displayed his array of skills to the full this season. In particular, his free kick ability has been second to none. After an astonishing dead-ball strike against Portsmouth in January, Ferguson told reporters: "It was a marvellous hit. No goalkeeper in the world would have saved that. It's the best free kick I've seen in the Premier League." Little has gone wrong for Ronaldo this season, his only setback being a potentially costly missed penalty at the Nou Camp in United's semi-final first leg against Barcelona. His step-overs and trickery brought criticism though during United's European campaign from Roma's Chilean midfielder David Pizarro, who accused him of lacking respect for his opponents. Support came from an unlikely quarter in Italy's 2006 World Cup winning coach, Marcello Lippi. "I must admit that I didn't like him much initially," Lippi told Italian television. "All these dummies and double-dummies irritated me. "But then I realised it is his way of playing. There is no disrespect to anyone, it is his way of presenting himself." Born on the island of Madeira, he was named Ronaldo as a tribute by his late father to former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. He left Madeira to join Sporting's youth academy and moved to Old Trafford as a teenager in 2003 in a 12.5 million pound transfer. It will rank with the very best investments the club has ever made
