<TEXT>
 Jerusalem, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli police arrived at Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's residence on Friday to question him for a second time as part of an investigation that has forced him to deny taking bribes from an American businessman. Israel's chief prosecutor said on Monday investigators suspected Olmert had taken envelopes full of cash from New York fundraiser Morris Talansky. Olmert, who was first questioned three weeks ago, has denied any wrongdoing but said he would resign if indicted. Police arrived at Olmert's Jerusalem home early on Friday. "Olmert will be questioned for the second time by investigators from the National Fraud Unit on Friday," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The mass-selling Israeli daily Maariv reported on Friday that police were trying to determine whether Olmert had helped Talansky advance business ventures in South America while in previous government posts. Israel and Syria, in a surprise move, announced on Wednesday that they had begun indirect peace talks in Turkey, a move many Israelis believed was meant to divert attention from Olmert's various corruption probes. On Thursday, Olmert briefly suspended a speech he was giving when demonstrators marched in front of him, carrying a banner saying "The people are with the Golan," in protest at the talks with Syria. Damascus has demanded the return of the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Olmert has not said publicly that Israel would give up all of the area. A police source, who declined to be named, said Israeli investigators would travel to the United States "in the coming weeks to continue the investigation in the Olmert case". Olmert acknowledged earlier this month that Talansky raised funds for his two successful campaigns for mayor of Jerusalem in 1993 and 1998, a failed bid to lead the right-wing Likud party in 1999 and a further internal Likud election in 2002. Prosecutors want Talansky to give evidence under oath on Sunday before a court order banning him from leaving Israel expires on Monday, but Olmert's lawyers will ask the Jerusalem District Court on Friday to delay the testimony by two weeks. The Israeli Supreme Court this week rejected Olmert's petition to stop a lower court from hearing preliminary testimony from Talansky. Olmert has said his former law partner handled the details, voicing confidence the attorney made sure proper procedures were followed. Israeli media reported that Friday's questioning of Olmert would focus on the attorney's testimony. A judicial source said the sums involved totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars. Olmert is also under criminal investigation into accusations that he gave favors in return for a discount on the purchase of a Jerusalem home, and appointed cronies to a state business authority. He has said the suspicions are baseless. Last November police concluded there was insufficient evidence against him over his role in the sale of state-owned Bank Leumi when serving as finance minister.
