<TITLE> Emily rescues national booters in warm-up match </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com) - A first-half strike from Jahid Hasan Emily guided the national football team to a lone goal win over Independent Sporting in a second warm-up match at Bangabandhu National Stadium Saturday. Capitalising on a left-side cross from defender Wali Faisal, Emily headed the ball home in the 10th minute. The match was arranged for the national booters ahead of their SAFF Championship campaign next month. The SAFF tournament is scheduled for June 3 to 15 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The team had played an earlier warm-up match Thursday that ended in a 1-1 draw against foreign footballers in Dhaka preparing for the Bangladesh professional football league. But the national players could hardly impress the 1,000 spectators at the big bowl on Saturday as Independent Sporting, comprising well-know booters outside the national side, gave them a run for their money on the rain-soaked field. The national team gave an uninspired performance, running behind the ball throughout the game and hardly making it through their opponent's backline marshalled by defenders Sujon, Titu, Shuvro and Parvez Babu. "The boys showed their natural performance in the first half, but they were asked to play a simple game in a bid to avoid injury in the second half," claimed coach Abu Yousuf after the match. Nevertheless, it was alarming to see the coach's defense line, comprising Ranaji, Saikat, Hasan Al Mamun and Wali Faisal, failing spectacularly to restrict the opposing strikers who, fortunately for the national players, sent the ball wide despite getting goalkeeper Biplob alone. Yousuf said he was a bit worried over his midfielders, who were failing to feed the ball on the time. "I'm not worried over the defense, but the midfielders are not providing the ball to the strikers on the time, so the forwards cannot increase the margin," Yousuf said. "We have to work more on this." Yousuf expressed his overall satisfaction with the match, however, and thanked the opposing side for playing a tough game that would, he hoped, help them in Sri Lanka. bd
