<TITLE> Usha edge Abahani 4-2 in premier hockey </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Usha Krira Chakra finished their first-leg Premier Division Hockey League campaign at top after handing a 4-2 defeat to Abahani Limited in their last match at Moulana Bhasani National Stadium Sunday. With straight ninth triumph, last year's joint champions Usha KC consolidated their lead with 27 points, five points in advance of the second-placed Abahani Limited, who tasted first defeat in nine matches. The five-team Super League will get underway Tuesday with Usha needing three wins out of four outings to clinch the most coveted domestic title. "We played in line with counter- attacks and came out successful in having the scoring chances," said Usha's Pakistani coach Rana Jahir. Jahir said that his players implemented his plan cent percent as the game of hockey was a 45 and 55 percent game for the players and coach respectively. Abahani coach Mahbub Haroon blamed his defenders and goalkeeper for going down against Usha despite enjoying a superior ball possession in the match. "We dominated the game but conceded goals because of lapse of the defence," Haroon said, "Besides, the forwards miserably missed the target." The national team's coach said they should have drawn the match at least. Abahani back-line marshalled by Mamunur Rahman Chayan, Faruque Ahmed, Hedayetul Islam Razib and Firoz Ahmed could hardly protect Usha's forwards Jahidul Islam Rajon and Maksudul Alam Habul. Besides, Usha took control of the midfield with Pakistani duo Tariq Aziz and Akhter Ali and Shahidullah Titu playing superbly to put Abahani at bay. Abahani forwards  Rasul Mahmud Jimmy, Moududur Rahman Shuvo and Pakistani Modasser  missed the target several times from close ranges. Habul gave Usha an 11-minute lead after capitalising on a Titu cross from the left while Akhter, who scored four goals against Mohammedan, doubled the margin in the next minute with a solo effort after dodging past three Abahani players including goalkeeper Jahid Hossain. Jimmy should have reduced the Abahani margin in the 20th minute, but the poor push from the national striker saw Usha goalkeeper Shakil foil the sitter. After all, it was a disappointment for Abahani, whose specialist Chayan missed the penalty stroke in the 25th minute. In a span of three minutes before the breather, Shuvo and Jimmy saw their attempts blocked by opponent's goalkeeper Shakil. However, Jimmy pulled one goal back three minutes into the second half with a little deflection of a fierce hit taken by Shuvo at the top of the box. Abahani conceded the third goal in the 49th minute following a goalkeeper's blander as Usha's Pakistani recruit Tariq did not hesitate to send the ball to the open net. Mudasser set by Ehasan Rana made it 3-2 for Abahani in the 61st minute before the game was halted for 10 minutes following a cancellation of Usha's goal. Unmarked Rajon being set by Akhter sealed the match with a gentle push two minutes from time to keep Usha on an unbeaten run in the league.
