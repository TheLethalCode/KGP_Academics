 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty reiterated his belief Wednesday that it would be difficult to hold elections amid the ongoing state of emergency. "I still continue to believe that, and my government believes, it is difficult to hold a free, fair and transparent election under a state of emergency," Moriarty told reporters Wednesday after a meeting with home adviser MA Matin at the Secretariat. The ambassador said he and his government were encouraged too by certain steps being taken by the government. "I hope elections will occur without emergency," he said. On the vows of the two major political parties, Awami League and BNP, to refrain from political dialogue without their leaders, the US envoy said: "There is room for compromise but I don't know what the compromise could be. Nobody gets a hundred percent in a compromise." Replying to a question, he said he had no reason to doubt the intentions of the government. "Ultimately it is up to the people of the country to decide." Earlier Moriarty met with communications adviser Ghulam Quader at his office. The two advisers are among those assigned to the dialogue between the government and political parties. bdnews
