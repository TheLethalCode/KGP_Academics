 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) - Narayanganj set their final clash of the 28th National Cricket Championship against Dhaka with a tense 5-run win over Rangpur in the curtailed second semifinal at Sylhet Stadium Wednesday. Narayanganj restricted Rangpur to 92 for eight in the stipulated 20 overs after making a modest total of 97 for eight in 20 overs. The final will be played Thursday at the same venue. After being put in to bat first, Narayanganj failed to cross the triple digits in face of some tight bowling from Rahman (2/21), Monirul (2/19) and Ejaj (1/9) after the match was reduced to a 20-over-a-side following rains. Monir topscored with 23 followed by Abdullah on 22 and Rony on 15. In reply, Rangpur were short of five runs from the target as Humayun (2/13), Monir (2/18) and Mostafa (2/23) shared six wickets. Tanvir and Salahuddin contributed 26 and 23, but their efforts were not enough to touch the target.
