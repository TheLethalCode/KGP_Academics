<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh Monday placed a 26-point proposal on the table in its dialogue with the government Monday, including withdrawal of all bans on political activity under the current state of emergency. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan said the government should withdraw all conditions imposed on politics and lift the state of emergency. The party also stressed the lifting of bans on trade union activities. "The dialogue was held in an open environment," Manzurul said, but added that the dialogue process should also include professionals, labourers, the business community and minorities so that a true democracy can be established. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said a separate dialogue with citizens at all levels of society would be held in parallel. On the trial of war criminals, the CPB chief said: "We have asked the government to take necessary arrangements for the trial of identified war criminals and bar them from contesting in the polls." On the reforms in the political parties he said: "This is not right to impose any decision in the name of political reforms. This is an internal matter of the political parties." On the chief adviser's address to the nation the CPB leader said: "In his speech there was a hint of the power distribution between the president and the prime minister. A decision should be taken after discussion and public opinions" On the national charter he said his party would not join the national consensus beyond its class position and leftist attitude. "The party will not sign in the national charter," he said. CPB supported the government's anticorruption drive, adding: "We have asked the government to ensure justice so that no partiality takes place." The party recommended a balance of power. Zillur Rahman agreed with CPB. "Our main motto is to create check and balance," the adviser said. The government sat in dialogue with CPB in a two-hour session from 10am to noon Monday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the government side at the dialogue, while CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan headed his party's delegation. The dialogue process began Thursday with the Workers Party of Bangladesh and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. The government sat with Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) on Sunday, and with the Liberal Democratic Party Monday afternoon. bdnews24.com/e
