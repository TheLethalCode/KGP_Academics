<TITLE> Opposition leader Tsvangirai arrives in Zimbabwe </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Harare, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai returned home on Saturday for an election runoff with President Robert Mugabe despite his fears that he might be assassinated by government agents. Tsvangirai arrived at Harare airport aboard a regular South African Airways flight around 1030 GMT after cancelling his homecoming a week ago over the assassination plot, which the government dismissed as a propaganda stunt. Tsvangirai has been traveling abroad since April 8 on a diplomatic drive to pressure Mugabe to surrender power following a March 29 presidential poll, which he says he won outright. But Zimbabwe's electoral commission says he did not get enough votes for a straight victory and must face Mugabe in a June 27 runoff.
