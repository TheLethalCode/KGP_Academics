<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League will launch a movement to get party chief Sheikh Hasina freed, if necessary, acting president Zillur Rahman said Friday. "Leaders and workers of the Awami League are united on the issue," Zillur said after prayers for the release and recovery of the former prime minister at the party headquarters. Zillur said Hasina was being implicated in false cases one after another to harass and isolate her from people. The AL leader again came down hard on the government on the national charter issue. "The job of the caretaker government is to hold polls. It does not have the power to prepare a national charter." Presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said: "The government has remained nonchalant towards those who siphoned out money in the last five years and killed 26,000 AL leaders and workers. But cases are being filed against Hasina one after another." "We are worried. Sheikh Hasina is being slandered," Amu said. People of Tungipara residing in Dhaka organised the prayers. Joint general secretary Mukul Bose said that there was no alternative for the Awami League but a street movement for the release of Hasina. bdnews
