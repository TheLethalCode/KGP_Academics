<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Workers Party of Bangladesh demanded an immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency, for the sake of a fair and transparent election, in formal talks with the government Thursday. A two-hour meeting between the government and WPB marked the start of the formal dialogue with political parties. WPB has also asked the government to make necessary arrangements for detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil to take part in the dialogue process. "The government has said it will take all required steps to ensure the participation of all political parties in the dialogue," party president Rashed Khan Menon told reporters Thursday after the dialogue. "The dialogue will be meaningful and effective only with the participation of all parties, the government has said," Menon added. "We have asked the government to reinforce democratic rights by lifting the emergency immediately for a congenial atmosphere for the polls and for the democratic process." The party also demanded holding all other polls after the national elections. "We have also proposed withdrawing ban on trade union and all direct and indirect control and interference on all kinds of professions including the print and electronic media," Menon added. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, one of the advisers in Thursday's meeting, said: "We have had a fine dialogue." But he did not comment on the proposal of the participation of Hasina and Jalil in the dialogue. On holding all other polls after the national elections, Hossain Zillur said: "The government is not considering doing anything to disrupt the national elections." Menon also said his party asked to form a tribunal for the trial of war criminals and bar them from contesting in the polls and halting the redrawing of election constituencies until the elections. "But the government delegation did not comment on it." On the national charter, proposed by the chief adviser in his address to the nation, Menon said: "This is a political understanding and a process of unity and will work as a moral force. This is not a matter of constitutional or legal obligation." On the women's development policy, Menon said: "The government should further itself from the hostile attitudeof the mullahs. It should take proper initiatives to implement the policy." He also stressed the participation of the indigenous community in the formal dialogue to ensure their participation in mainstream politics and ensure their rights. Not only civil society leaders, Menon said, but all walks of society including workers, farmers, students, women, journalists, lawyers and cultural activists should have some say in the dialogue process. On this proposal, Hossain Zillur said: "The government has a plan to arrange another dialogue in parallel." Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led four of the advisers, who had held pre-dialogue talks with the political parties, in the formal meeting with Workers Party of Bangladesh from 10 am Thursday. With political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, five advisers held informal talks in April leading up to the formal dialogue. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal were also present in Thursday's dialogue with WPB. Menon led the seven-member WPB delegation, with the party's general secretary Bimal Biswas and politburo members Haider Akbar Khan Rano, Anisur Rahman Mallick, Fazle Hossain Badsha, Hajera Sultana and Quamrul Ahsan. Fakhruddin in an address to the nation on May 12 hoped that national unity would be achieved on every important issue through the dialogue. bdnews24.com/
