<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Wednesday that he was sorry for the murder of a Bahraini national allegedly by a Bangladeshi. In the wake of the "racially-charged" murder, a new directive in Bahrain bars all new Bangladeshi nationals from receiving work permits. But Dhaka hopes Manama will lift the ban, taking into account Bangladeshis' contribution to the Bahrain economy. Bangladesh has once again reiterated that its workers must obey the laws of all Middle Eastern countries to work there. "We have come to know that Bahrain has decided to stop issuing work permits for Bangladeshis," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "All I can say is, we are sorry for the incident." The adviser said the Bahrain government was yet to inform Bangladesh officially about the ban. "I hope the ban would be temporary and the ban would go." There are 86,000 Bangladeshis in Bahrain, according to foreign ministry figures. The adviser telephoned Bangladesh's top diplomat in Manama and inquired about developments on the ban. Meanwhile, Saiful Islam, the Charge d'Affaires in Manama, Tuesday met one of the Bahraini ministers to reconsider the decision. The interior ministry of Bahrain imposed a ban on Friday on issuing work permits to Bangladeshis after Mohammed Jassim Dossary, a Bahrain national, was murdered. Following the incident, the Al Asala (Conservative Sunni) bloc in Bahrain parliament urged authorities to implement a yearly or quarterly quota for the number of Bangladeshi nationals allowed to work in the country. bdn
