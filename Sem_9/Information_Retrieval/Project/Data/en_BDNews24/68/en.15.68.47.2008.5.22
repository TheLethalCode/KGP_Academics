 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com) - A three-day football training camp named 'Just for kicks', conducted by coaches from Serie A and the AS Roma club, got underway in the city Thursday at the Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology. Participants from various schools aged 10 to 14 will receive training from the Italian coaches, who have come in cooperation with YKK Holding (Asia). The head coach will be Maurizio 'Remon' Turone, with former Italian national footballers Mauro Zironelli, Morris Pagniello and Joe De Martino acting as assistant coaches. The kids will be introduced to 'football Italian style', said err ip2 tmp The young footballers will receive at least three hours training from the coaches, who will also teach some 30 local coaches in up-to-date techniques. "It is important for YKK to contribute and work with the local community. I believe that this event will bring great joy to many children in Bangladesh," said YKK managing director Ken Nakano at a press conference Thursday. "We want to support their growth through this football event," he added. Having run the AS Roma Campus globally, Ramon Turone admitted the initiative would be a new kind of challenge for his coaching team because of barriers such as language and culture. However, he said his team was looking forward to the project. "We have never conducted football clinics in Bangladesh before. We know there's a huge support for AS Roma as a club in Asia, and this will be a great opportunity for us to reach out to local communities," said Turone.
