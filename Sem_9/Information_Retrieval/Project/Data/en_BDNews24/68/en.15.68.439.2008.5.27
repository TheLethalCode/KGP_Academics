 KINGSTON, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies captain Chris Gayle and pace bowler Jerome Taylor, who missed the first-test defeat by Australia through injury, have been named in the 14-man squad for the second test in Antigua, starting on Friday. Opening batsman Gayle has been sidelined with a groin injury he picked up during the one day game against Sri Lanka on April 15 while Taylor sat out the test in Jamaica because of a lower back injury. Spinner Amit Jaggernauth who made his debut at Sabina Park, in the test the hosts lost by 95 runs, was left out of the squad along with Barbadian all-rounder Ryan Hinds who did not play in Jamaica. Jamaican batsman Xavier Marshall, who was included in the first test set-up as cover, keeps his place in the squad. West Indies coach John Dyson said he was confident that both Taylor and Gayle would be fit to start at the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground. West Indies squad: Chris Gayle (captain), Dwayne Bravo, Sulieman Benn, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Fidel Edwards, Xavier Marshall, Runako Morton, Brenton Parchment, Daren Powell, Denesh Ramdin, Darren Sammy, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Devon Smith, Jerome Taylor
