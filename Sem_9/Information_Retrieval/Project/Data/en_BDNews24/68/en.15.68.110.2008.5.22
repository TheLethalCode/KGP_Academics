<TITLE> Ballack back with something to prove for his country </TITLE>

 BERLIN, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany captain Michael Ballack should feel ready to stamp his authority on Euro 2008 after finishing his second season in the the English Premier League with some inspirational performances. When you see Ballack at his best for Germany or Chelsea the word that springs to mind is "presence". The 31-year-old can command the midfield like few other players of his generation, as he showed six years ago in leading Germany to the World Cup final in South Korea and Japan. His performances in subsequent tournaments have been good rather than outstanding. He helped Germany reach the semi-finals of the last World Cup on home soil in 2006 but his influence was not great. At Euro 2004, he could not prevent Germany's exit in the first round. He comes into this tournament with the personal satisfaction of proving his many doubters in England wrong. His first season on a mind-boggling salary at Chelsea was indeed a disappointment, ruined as it was by injury and his struggles to adjust to the frantic pace of the English game. This season has been markedly better, as he has grown into the commanding figure in midfield, contributing the sort of important goals he made his trademark in four years at Bayern Munich. Ballack, who hails from the old East German town of Goerlitz and helped unfashionable Bayer Leverkusen all the way to the Champions League final in 2002, has a remarkable 35 goals in his 79 appearances for Germany to date. The man who wears the number 13 shirt will consider himself lucky whatever happens. Once the tournament is over, he plans to marry his long-term girlfriend Simone. It should be quite a party if he does so after lifting the Henri Delaunay Trophy in Vienna on June 29
