 WARSAW, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland will be looking for more of the same from Euzebiusz Smolarek after the striker fired his team to Euro 2008 with nine goals in 10 appearances. The 27-year-old was outstanding during qualifying, starting with both goals in a 2-1 win over Portugal that got Poland's lacklustre campaign firmly on track after they had taken only four points from their opening three games. The strikes also made him the first Pole to score against Portugal since his father Wlodzimierz in a 1-0 victory in the group stages of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico. The five goals "Ebi" Smolarek scored in Poland's final two home games secured Poland's place at Euro 2008 with a match to spare and made all the difference in a tight eight-team group. He grabbed a second-half hat-trick when Poland came from behind to beat Kazakhstan 3-1 and then both goals in a 2-0 defeat of Belgium, allowing coach Leo Beenhakker to take a second-string side to their final game in Serbia. Smolarek was born in Lodz, Poland, but grew up in the Netherlands where his father played for Feyenoord and later coached their youth team. Euzebiusz came up through the ranks at Feyenoord before moving to Borussia Dortmund in 2005. There was controversy during his spell at Feyenoord in 2002 when he tested positive for a substance normally found in cannabis products. He denied smoking cannabis and said the test result could have arisen from eating candy bars. He was banned for three months by UEFA. Smolarek, who has quick feet, good pace and exceptional dribbling skills, scored 25 goals in 81 league games for Dortmund before last year's move to the Primera Liga. He has found the going difficult in Spain, but his superb Euro 2008 qualifying form suggests he could be one of the players of the tournament if Poland reach the latter stages
