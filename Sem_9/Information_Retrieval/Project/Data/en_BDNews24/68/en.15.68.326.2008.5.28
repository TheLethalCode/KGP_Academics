 JERUSALEM, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Defense Minister Ehud Barak may call on Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step down from office or temporarily suspend himself after the latest testimony in a bribery case, Israel Radio reported on Wednesday. It said Barak, a senior partner in Olmert's governing coalition, was due to make a statement after US businessman Morris Talansky testified on Tuesday he gave Olmert cash-stuffed envelopes including personal loans that were never repaid. Barak, leader of the left-wing Labour party, was considering forming an emergency government with the right-wing opposition Likud party that would leave out Olmert's centrist Kadima party, said the radio. Talansky told the Jerusalem District Court he had passed $150,000 to Olmert over a 15-year period, praising the prime minister as "a man who could accomplish a great deal" for Israel and who deserved his support. Both Olmert and Talansky have denied any wrongdoing in the case, which has raised questions about the prime minister's political survival at a time when he is talking peace with the Palestinians and pursuing indirect negotiations with Syria. Olmert, 62, has said he would resign if indicted but Israel's chief prosecutor Moshe Lador said it was too early to say if an indictment would be issued and that a decision would be made only after completion of police investigations. Olmert, twice questioned by police in the past few weeks, has said he took cash from Talansky for two successful campaigns for mayor of Jerusalem in 1993 and 1998, a failed bid to lead Likud in 1999 and a further internal Likud election in 2002. A judicial source said the sums involved totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars
