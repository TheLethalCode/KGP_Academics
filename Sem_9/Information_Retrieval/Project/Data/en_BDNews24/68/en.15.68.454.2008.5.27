 KABUL Tue May 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eight civilians and four policemen were killed in two separate roadside bomb blasts in Afghanistan on Tuesday, officials said. One woman, a child and six men were killed when the blast hit a bus in Del Aram district of western Farah province, deputy provincial governor Mohammad Younus Rasuli said. The blast occurred on a road where Afghan and foreign troops have come under similar attacks and ambushes by Taliban insurgents in recent months, he told Reuters. Four policemen were killed and three others wounded in the second explosion which hit their vehicle in Logar province south of Kabul, a provincial official said. In another incident on Tuesday, US-led troops killed several Taliban militants in an operation in Helmand province in the south, the US military said in a statement. Violence has escalated in Afghanistan in the past two years, the bloodiest period since Taliban's removal from power in 2001. Some 13,000 people, including more than 370 foreign troops, have been killed during this period. The violence comes despite the presence of more than 62,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the US military as well as some 150,000 Western-reliant Afghan forces. The al Qaeda-backed Taliban are mostly active in southern and eastern areas along the border with Pakistan's tribal region where the militants have some bases
