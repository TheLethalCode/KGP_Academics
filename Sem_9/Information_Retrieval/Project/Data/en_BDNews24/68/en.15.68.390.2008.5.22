 Jerusalem, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel set terms for concluding a peace deal with Syria on Thursday, closing ranks with Washington in demanding Damascus distance itself from Iran and stop supporting Palestinian and Lebanese militants. Coordinated announcements on Wednesday by Israel and Syria that they had begun indirect talks in Turkey, the first confirmation of negotiations between the long-time enemies in eight years, drew a lukewarm response from the United States. Echoing US comments, Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said Israel wanted to live in peace with its neighbors but Syria needed to "distance itself completely" from "problematic ties" with Iran. Syria, she told reporters, must also stop "supporting terror -- Hezbollah, Hamas", groups backed by the Islamic Republic. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak, who as prime minister in 2000 took part in US-hosted talks with Syria that failed over the key issue of the future of the Golan Heights, said in a speech that both sides would have to make "painful concessions". The United States, in its initial public reaction to Israeli-Syrian contacts, said it did "not object" to talks but repeated its criticism of Syria's "support of terrorism". Many analysts say US hostility to Damascus, and to its Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies, makes a Syria-Israel deal unlikely before President George W Bush steps down in January. The United States and Israel also consider Hamas a terrorist organisation. The Islamist group, which seized control of the Gaza Strip last June, opposes Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's statehood talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. COMPLEX PROCESS Olmert, who revealed the discussions with Syria two days before he faces a police interrogation over bribery allegations he has denied, said the peace track would be long and complex. A television poll found 70 percent of Israelis opposed giving back the Golan Heights to Syria, and a majority also believed Olmert was using the talks to distract from the criminal investigation that could force him from office. Israel captured the strategic plateau in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed the territory in 1981 in a move that did not win international recognition. "Everyone knows that Olmert wants to end his term on a diplomatic note, not a criminal one. The question is, what will come first -- an indictment or a peace treaty," columnist Yossi Verter wrote in newspaper Haaretz. Barak, leader of Israel's centre-left Labour Party, said peace with Syria could be achieved only from a position of strength and self-confidence. Eight months ago, Israeli jets bombed what U.S. officials described as a North Korean-built nuclear facility in Syria. "Both sides, and I stress, both sides, will be forced in an agreement to make painful concessions and both sides know this," Barak said. The Israeli-Syrian talks that Barak attended in Shepherdstown, West Virgnia in 2000 broke down over control of the shore of the Sea of Galilee, over which the Golan Heights loom and where Israel draws much of its water. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said Israel had shown that it might return the plateau. "Without this commitment we cannot conduct any negotiation," he told Reuters. Among Olmert's vast army of domestic critics, supporters of the 18,000 Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights threatened to bolt his fragile coalition if he tries to give up the territory. Others wondered aloud if Wednesday's announcement was not timed to divert attention from Olmert's troubles with the police. They will interview him for a second time, on Friday, over suspicions he took bribes from an American businessman. Olmert has said he would resign if indicted
