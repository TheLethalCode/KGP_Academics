 FAIZABAD, Afghanistan, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fourteen Afghans were killed and 52 injured on Wednesday when a truck packed with mostly women and children plunged into a ravine in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, a traffic official said. The early morning accident happened on a narrow road in a district of the province that lies along the border with China and Tajikistan, said Mohammad Ibrahim, head of provincial traffic. "It was a truck carrying 70 mostly women and children who wanted to find a place for finding pasture for their herd. The report we have is that 14 have lost their lives and 52 more have been hurt," he told Reuters. Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, which has poor infrastructure due to 30 years of war
