 JERUSALEM, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich sacked manager Avram Grant because he realised the Israeli would not be able to take the club any further, former international midfielder Eyal Berkovic said on Saturday. Chelsea issued a statement on their Web site on Saturday saying the club had terminated Grant's contract. The decision came four days after Chelsea were beaten on penalties in the Champions League final by Manchester United. "I have already said that Avram made a number of serious mistakes: His inability to communicate with the English media  his failure to befriend the fans and the undermining of Jose Mourinho," Berkovic said. "All these led Roman Abramovich to understand that despite his affection and friendship with Avram, it would not be enough to improve Chelsea's fortunes," he wrote on the Hebrew sports Web site www.one.co.il. Berkovic and Grant fell out in 2004 after the coach dropped his outspoken captain from the Israel team, a move which ended Berkovic's international career. "I have no doubt that the day after he receives his severance pay cheque he will sit back at home and consider all the mistakes he made. He has been a consummate media operator, knows how to deal with players, but he failed badly at Chelsea in both these tasks," Berkovic said. "Nevertheless, he will take with him a life-long souvenir  I don't see any Israeli coach coaching a club the size of Chelsea in the next 20 or 30 years." He said Grant's rise to the top had been achieved too quickly and through the connections he had made. "A coach, just like a player, must advance step by step. Avram passed over many stages on his way (to the top), he got to the top because of friendships and machinations and it was a mistake on his part," Berkovic said. The former midfielder who played at nine clubs in England and Scotland said he did not think any other English club would consider hiring Grant "not because he is not a good coach, but because he made huge errors." Former Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur striker Ronnie Rosenthal also said he was not surprised by the dismissal. "Any Chelsea coachnot only Avramwho does not win titles will be replaced," Rosenthal told Israel Radio. "Had he coached another English club which was not expecting to win titles, it might have been different, but they were playing in four competitions and they didn't win any of them.
