 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Friday that his party would decide on whether to join dialogue with the government after it received the green light from party chief Khaleda Zia. "We didn't make any decision on the dialogue yet. My leader is in jail. I didn't receive any reply from prison authorities on my applications seeking permission to see her," Delwar told bdnews24.com. The secretary general of a faction of the divided party reiterated that the participation of Khaleda must be ensured to add meaning to the dialogue. Islami Oikya Jote, an ally of the four-party alliance, decided to go to the dialogue, said its secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami Friday. "A list of 10 representatives of the party has been sent to the Chief Adviser's Office. We have selected 10 delegates as Islami Oikya Jote is an alliance of many parties. Fazlul Haque Amini will lead our team," Nezami said. He said the party would demand release of two former prime ministers (Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia) at the dialogue. Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh is delaying a decision on whether to go to the dialogue as party chief Motiur Rahman Nizami is behind bars. A senior leader of the party preferring anonymity said Jamaat would take a decision on the matter in consultation with the BNP. The four-party alliance in a meeting Thursday discussed participation in dialogue and Oikya Jote made it clear that it would join in. The dialogue between the government and the political parties began Thursday, with Workers Party of Bangladesh and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh joining in on the first day. Communist Party of Bangladesh, two factions of JSD, Jatiya Ganotantrik Party, Samyabadi Dal, Islami Shashantantro Andolon, BSD, Unity for Political Reforms, Khelafat Majlish, Khelafat Andolon, Progressive Democratic Party, Ganotantri Party, Liberal Democratic Party, Islami Oikya Jote and Kalyan Party decided to join the dialogue. bdnew
