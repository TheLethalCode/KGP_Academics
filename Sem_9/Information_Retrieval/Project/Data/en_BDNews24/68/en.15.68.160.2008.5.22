<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cristiano Ronaldo has barely 72 hours to celebrate Manchester United's Champions League triumph before turning his attention to Euro 2008 and building bridges with Portugal team mate Ricardo Carvalho. The pair clashed during United's penalty shootout win over Carvalho's Chelsea in Wednesday's Champions League final. Late in the first half the Chelsea defender was booked for a lunge on Ronaldo which sparked an animated exchange between the two. After losing 6-5 on penalties after a 1-1 draw at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, Carvalho and his grim-faced team mates were anxious to just to get away. A beaming Ronaldo was already turning his attention to the Switzerland and Austria but also quashed speculation that he might leave United. "We will celebrate today but after the 24th I must start thinking about the European Championship," he told reporters. "I am so proud and happy. I want to stay." Ronaldo, who headed United into a 26th-minute lead before Frank Lampard's equaliser just before halftime, suffered five minutes of torture "for my head and heart" after missing his penalty in the shootout. "Of course there was anguish but I had confidence Edwin (van der Sar) would make a save," he said. United's Dutch goalkeeper saved Nicolas Anelka's penalty after Chelsea captain John Terry had missed the chance to win the Cup for the Londoners. Carvalho, who won the title under Jose Mourinho with Porto in 2004, admitted his team were devastated. "Apart from the first minutes we played better. We had more chances to score but we had no luck," he said. "That's football. It's bitter but we had no luck. We are very upset.
