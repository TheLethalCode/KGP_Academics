<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Wed May 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Member of the Gujjar community demanding job quotas blocked highways leading to the national capital on Wednesday, threatening to bring its protests to New Delhi, the sixth day of demonstrations that killed 37 people. Violent protests have roiled Rajasthan where at least 36 members of the Gujjar community were killed after police fired to quell rioting. A policeman was lynched. The Gujjars, already considered a disadvantaged group, want to be reclassified further down the complex Hindu caste and status system so they qualify for government jobs and university seats reserved for such groups. The government reserves about half of all seats in state colleges and universities for lower castes and tribal groups to flatten centuries-old social hierarchies, in what has been called the world's biggest affirmative action scheme. Gujjar protesters have squatted on roads and rail tracks in Rajasthan with bodies of some of those killed in the police firing for almost a week, saying the bodies would not be cremated until the government relented. "We urge the Rajasthan government to accord us the status we want as soon as possible to resolve the issue," Avatar Singh Bhadana, a top Gujjar leader told Reuters. On Wednesday, Gujjars living around New Delhi blocked several arterial roads leading into the capital city to show solidarity with the protesters in Rajasthan. Police swiftly cleared those blockades. Officials in New Delhi said they were prepared to tackle any violent street protests planned by the Gujjars on Thursday and held a meeting of security officials and police. The army and federal police forces patrolled the Gujjar-dominated areas, which continued to report stray incidents of protesters burning tyres and damaging vehicles. Gujjars say they deserve preferential treatment, but a state government committee did not agree, and announced instead it would spend 2.8 billion rupees ($67 million) improving schools, clinics, roads and other infrastructure in Gujjar areas. The Rajasthan government has warned the protesters to back down or face further police action. A year ago, Gujjars in Rajasthan fought police and members of another caste that already qualifies for job quotas. At least 26 people were killed in that violence
