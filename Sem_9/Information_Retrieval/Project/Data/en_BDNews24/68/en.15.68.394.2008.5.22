 PRAGUE, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mixed form in qualifying and a rash of recent injuries have left the often-fancied Czech Republic looking like outsiders at Euro 2008. Semi-finalists in 2004, where they were regarded by the likes of UEFA chief Michel Platini as having played some of the best football in the tournament, the Czechs came even closer to glory as finalists in 1996 against Germany at Wembley. Back for more in Group A with co-hosts Switzerland, Portugal and Turkey, the Czechs are still coached by 68-year-old Karel Brueckner, who steered them to the last four in Portugal. Just as before, the Czechs qualified for the championship as group winners. However, the performances were very different to those delivered four years previously. A slightly reshuffled team failed to impress during away draws in Ireland and Wales, a home defeat by Germany and a mere 1-0 home victory over Cyprus. Matters improved in the latter stages of the campaign with a 1-0 win over Ireland and a 3-0 victory over a relaxed Germany side who had already qualified for the tournament. The good fortune has not lasted, though, with captain Tomas Rosicky being ruled out of the finals by knee surgery. With Karel Poborsky having retired after the 2006 World Cup and former European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved following soon afterwards, the Czechs had been counting on Rosicky's playmaking abilities. The situation, which the Czech media incorrectly speculated would lead to a surprise return by Nedved, leaves much of the responsibility on midfielders such as Marek Matejovsky. There are worries, too, at the back due to a combination of poor form and injuries, with central defender Radoslav Kovac (shoulder) and left back Marek Jankulovski (knee) needing to reach full match fitness after injury. Though the national team can count on one of the best goalkeepers in the world in Petr Cech, good defending is the key to keeping a clean sheet as the Czechs discovered to their cost during a group stage exit at the 2006 World Cup. Up front, their hopes rest on the towering shoulders of Jan Koller, along with Milan Baros, the pair having scored 83 goals between them for their country. Martin Fenin, a 2007 under-20 World Cup finalist, will be waiting for his chance on the bench. Winners as the former Czechoslovakia in 1976, the Czech Republic will have to produce something really special next month if the feat is to be repeated in 2008
