<TITLE> Food crisis may worsen African child mortality: UN </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 YOKOHAMA, Wed May 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The global food crisis could reverse some of the progress Africa has made in bringing down child mortality, the head of the United Nations' children's agency said on Wednesday. "If more children become undernourished, that could contribute to additional child mortality," Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF, said in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday. "This is not a crisis for everyone. It's an impact on those who are the most vulnerable." Protests, strikes and riots have erupted in developing countries around the world in the wake of dramatic rises in the prices of wheat, rice, corn, oils and other essential foods that have made it difficult for poor people to make ends meet. In African nations such as Cameroon, at least 24 people were killed in protests in February while in Somalia, thousands protested earlier this month. Veneman is in Japan to launch UNICEF's State of Africa's Children 2008 report which says that five million children died in Africa before they reached the age of five in 2006. The sub-Saharan African countries accounted for nine of the 10 highest mortality rates for children under five in the world, said the report which was launched on Wednesday at the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD). The UNICEF report details conditions of child survival in African nations and warns that sub-Saharan nations in Africa, such as Sierra Leone and Angola, lag on meeting child mortality rates and health issues in the U.N. Millennium Development Goals. The development goals are a set of eight globally agreed targets aimed at eradicating extreme poverty. One of the targets is to reduce mortality for children under age five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. These goals, along with boosting growth in Africa and dealing with climate change, are key issues being discussed at TICAD, through which Japan is trying to build closer ties with resource-rich African nations and to win support for its long-withstanding bid for a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. Some 2,500 participants, representing 52 African nations, delegates from international agencies, and activists such as Irish rock star Bono, have gathered in Japan for the conference. DISPLACED CHILDREN Veneman also said that UNICEF is working to unite displaced children with their families and to find appropriate foster care for those affected by the Myanmar cyclone and the Sichuan quake in China. "Really what you worry about in these situations is that children not be moved out of these areas, so that they are not trafficked," she said about the situation in China. The May 12 earthquake, which struck China's Sichuan province, has killed over 68,000 people. More than 20,000 are missing. The government identified more than 70 orphans as of last week. Cyclone Nargis, which hit Myanmar on May 2, left 134,000 people dead or missing and another 2.4 million destitute. The U.N. said it has established that at least 2,000 children have lost both parents
