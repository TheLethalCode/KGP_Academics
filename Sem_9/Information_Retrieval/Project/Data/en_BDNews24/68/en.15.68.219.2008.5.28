<TITLE> BNP will also boycott dialogue without Khaleda, says Delwar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Wednesday his party would not join in dialogue with the government without its chairperson Khaleda Zia. "The dialogue will be meaningless without the participation of Khaleda Zia, nor will the election be acceptable without her," the Khaleda-nominated secretary general nominated told reporters at his NAM Flat. His party was of the opinion that the caretaker government would not be successful in its strategy of imposing its own views by using the dialogue as a shield, the BNP leader said. On BNP's view of Awami League's formal announcement Wednesday of boycotting the dialogue, Delwar said: "Awami League has taken the decision in its party forum. We have been saying the dialogue will not be successful without Khaleda." "We have said the same in the pre-dialogue session. How clear a stand do you want from us?" "BNP is an election oriented party. We want to participate in the elections. But we want to get Khaleda Zia and Tarique Rahman freed prior to that," Delwar said in reply to reporters' questions. On the chief adviser's address to the nation, he said: "There was no guideline in his speech." "We have raised demands, including the release of Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, lifting of the state of emergency and holding parliamentary elections prior to other polls, to make the dialogue meaningful and polls accountable." "But the chief adviser did not mention any of these issues in his speech." Condemning the chief adviser's mention of a 'national charter', Delwar said: "This is not acceptable in any way and contrary to the constitution and to law. It might be a policy to delay the elections." bdnew
