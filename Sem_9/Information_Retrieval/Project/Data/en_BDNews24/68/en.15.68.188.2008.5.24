 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.co9m) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Saturday announced the ticket rates for the coming tri-nation One-Day International tournament involving India, Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh. The tournament is scheduled for June 6 to 15 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, which hosts four matches including the final. The board has fixed the gallery ticket at Tk 100, a raise of taka 30 from taka 70, for the group-phase matches while the spectators have to pay Tk 50 more to watch the final match from the galleries. The BCB had earlier fixed Tk 70 for the gallery ticket for the last home series against South Africa two months back. The price of special enclosure tickets has been fixed at Tk 400 while the club house tickets will be sold at Tk 500 for each group match. The spectators, however, have to pay Tk 50 more for both special enclosure and club house for the final match, scheduled for June 14. The price of the VIP grand stand tickets have been fixed at Tk 1000 while the final ticket is taka 15000. The tickets will be available from June 14 in different branches of the AB Bank Limited.
