<TEXT>
 New Delhi, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India aims to issue guidelines for third-generation mobile (3G) and WiMAX networks by June and will allow foreign participation in them, telecoms minister Andimuthu Raja said on Friday. "By June the guidelines will be issued for 3G and WiMAX," Raja said in a speech at an industry conference, adding he expected the roll-out of such networks by January 2009. 3G wireless networks allow operators to transmit data, voice and video at high speeds, enabling Internet services on mobile devices. India is eyeing 3G network as a solution for lack of voice-centric 2G network capacity and slow growth of broadband. "All existing operators are ready for 3G rollout. It does not need new infrastructure," Raja told reporters after the speech. When asked if foreign players would be allowed to bid for 3G spectrum, he said: "If there is common auction, open auction, then there will be no bar." India allows foreign firms to own up to 74 percent in an Indian telecoms firm, and these partnerships can also start 3G services, Raja said. "Either way foreign players will be permitted," he said.
