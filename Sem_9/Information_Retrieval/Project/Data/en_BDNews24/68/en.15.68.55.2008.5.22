 WARSAW, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland can count on plenty of experience in the dugout when 65-year-old Leo Beenhakker prepares his side's tactics at Euro 2008. The Dutchman's top-level career has spanned several decades and included spells at Ajax Amsterdam, Real Madrid and Feyenoord as well as the Dutch national team before he took charge of Poland after their disappointing 2006 World Cup. He had three stints with Ajax, two with Real and qualified Trinidad and Tobago for the 2006 World Cup in a career that also features coaching Saudi Arabia and several lesser Dutch clubs. In Spain, he acquired the nickname "Don Leo" and was known for a fondness for cigars and his sense of humour. As reward for guiding Poland to their European championship debut, Beenhakker's contract has been extended until Nov. 2009, the end of the World Cup 2010 qualifiers. In February, the Polish government decorated him with the Polonia Resituta Order, an honour awarded for outstanding achievements in a number of fields including sport. Under pressure after the opening 3-1 home defeat by Finland, Beenhakker re-shuffled his team and got their campaign on track, notably by making Artur Boruc his first-choice keeper. The Dutch "total football" strategy worked for Poland as they easily adapted to his flexible formations ranging from a defensive 4-5-1 and orthodox 4-4-2 to an attacking 4-3-3 with pacy wingers and versatile midfielders feeding the strikers. Poland's impressive displays and their victory in a tough eight-team qualifying group that included Portugal, Serbia, Finland and Belgium, have clearly convinced Beenhakker his side could cause an upset at Euro 2008. The Dutchman told reporters after their final 2-2 draw in Serbia he believed they could reach the final. In a country starved of European success, that comment will further raise hopes of a prolonged stay at the finalsbut may yet come back to haunt him
