 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com) - Abahani Limited returned to the winning track in the Premier Division Hockey League when they crushed Sonali Bank 5-3 in their Super League opener at Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium Wednesday. The win meant Abahani maintained their second position in the point table with 25 from 10 outings, five points behind leader Usha Krira Chakra, who beat Abahani in the last match of the first leg. Defender Chayan put Abahani ahead in the very third minute converting a penalty corner while striker Jimmy doubled the lead five minutes later through a field goal. Stopper Firoz made it 3-0 in the 12th minute before Pakistani Imran Khan scored team's fourth goal in the 21st minute. With four goals down, Sonali Bank bounced back scoring two goals in a span of three minutes. Chandan converted a penalty corner in the 32nd minute while Rimon Kumar pulled another goal back in the 34th minute to end the first half with 4-2. After the breather, Rimon scored another field goal four minutes into the second half to reduce the bankers margin to 4-3 to sweat the Dhanmondi-based outfit, but Chayan sealed the match for Abahani converting another penalty corner in the 51st minute.
