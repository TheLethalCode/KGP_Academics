 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)All the six divisional commissioners have opposed the idea of holding upazila and national elections simultaneously, said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Monday. The CEC briefed reporters after holding a three-hour election-preparatory meeting with the divisional commissioners at the Election Commission. "The decision on holding the upazila elections will be taken by June. We have started meetings with the field-level officials to decide if the upazila polls will be held simultaneously with the national elections or separately." The divisional commissioners told the meeting that it would be difficult to hold both elections together, Huda said. Replying to a reporter's query, the CEC said: "We'll hold the upazila polls by the year-end. We'll decide in June on a precise date." "The decision may be possible to take even in the first week of June if we get the Representation of the People Ordinance 2008 and the relevant rules sooner," said the CEC. Saying that preparations are on for holding the city corporation and municipal polls, Huda said: "We'll sit in phases with the deputy commissioners, superintendents of police and other field-level officials to discuss ways of holding the national and upazila elections." The preparatory meeting was attended by election commissioners Muhammed Sohul Hussain and M Sakhawat Hussain, EC secretary Muhammad Humayun Kabir, Dhaka divisional commissioner Aziz Hasan, Barisal divisional commissioner Mohammad Haroon Chowdhury, Chittagong divisional commissioner Hussain Jamil, Khulna divisional commissioner Eunusur Rahman, additional divisional commissioner for Rajshahi Md Akhtaruzzaman and Sylhet's acting divisional commissioner JN Biswas. Deputy election commissioners of Barisal, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Mymensingh, Chittagong, Comilla and Dhaka and other senior EC officials also attended the meeting. bdnews24.
