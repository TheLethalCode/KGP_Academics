 LONDON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy, France and Germany will head to Euro 2008 grimly determined to ensure there is no repeat of Greece's fairytale run to the trophy four years ago. Two years after Italy beat France in a 2006 World Cup final hosted by the Germans, Europe's top trio will expect to resume normal service in a tournament hosted by two picturesque no-hopers in Switzerland and Austria. With England and their unpopular but often-maligned fans absent from the June 7-29 tournament, the only other countries with a clearcut shot at glory are Spain and Portugal. United by ambition, the leading candidates have been dealt very different hands by the draw. The place to avoid was Group C and there has to be some sympathy for a resurgent Romania. They are back at a major event at the fourth time of tryingonly to find themselves surrounded by Italy, France and the Netherlands. Now under Roberto Donadoni, Italy are looking to match France's feat of eight years ago by adding the European championship to a world title conquered two years previously. The fact that Italy were the beaten finalists by France at Euro 2000, floored by David Trezeguet's golden goal in extra time, will add further spice to the mix. With no major setbacks to report in recent months, along with early signs of an armed peace with the national media, Italy really will fancy their chances. The firepower up front of Luca Toni, the Bundesliga's top scorer as he steered Bayern Munich to the title earlier this month, the unfussy midfield class of Andrea Pirlo and the safe hands of keeper Gianluigi Buffon make them formidable opponents. FRENCH TALENT France had their struggles in qualifying, notably losing home and away to Scotland, and will be without talismanic playmaker Zinedine Zidane for the first time in over a decade. Yet, there is no shortage of quality in a squad featuring winger Franck Ribery, the revelation of the 2006 World Cup and another key figure in Bayern's title success. Karim Benzema, a rising 20-year-old talent, will be at his first major event, while a seasoned Thierry Henry will doubtless look to turn the page on a difficult first season at Barcelona. Germany, a force to be reckoned with at any tournament, were the first country to qualify for the finals in a convincing campaign under Juergen Klinsmann's successor Joachim Loew. After an unremarkable first season at Chelsea, Germany captain Michael Ballack ended the last campaign on superb form, showing real leadership in midfield and the eye for goal which made a success at Bayern Munich. However, he should not need to delve too deeply into that armoury to reach the quarter-finals from Group B. Austria have won only one of their last 14 friendlies, Croatia will miss injured Eduardo Da Silva, the 10-goal striker who steered them through qualifying, and the Germans need only muzzle Euzebiusz Smolarek, with nine goals in 10 qualifiers, to keep Poland at bay. Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal should be followed into the last eight from Group A by either the ever-skilful Czech Republic or a Turkish national side finally on the way back up. Switzerland, who have lost their last four friendlies, are highly unlikely to make the grade. The surprise package of this tournament could come from a Group D which includes holders Greece, Spain and Sweden. Zenit St Petersburg won the UEFA Cup in real style and they have provided a lot of players to the national side who pipped England to a place at Euro 2008. Watch out for Russia
