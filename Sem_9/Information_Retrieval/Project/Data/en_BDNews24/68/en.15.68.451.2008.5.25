 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Jail authorities have taken all preparation to take detained former prime minister Khaleda Zia to court Monday in the Niko scam case, a senior prisons official said. Some lawyers formed a panel to fight a legal battle in the Special Judge's Court-9 for Dhaka, sited on the Jatiya Sangsad complex, on behalf of the BNP chairperson. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general of prisons, said Sunday that Khaleda was doing well. "A panel of senior lawyers was working on the case," Khaleda's lawyer Barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon told bdnews24.com. Rizvi Ahmed, acting officer secretary of the BNP, said BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain would be in the lawyers' panel. TH Khan, advocate Khondoker Mahbubuddin Ahmad, advocate Habibul Islam Bhuiyan, advocate Abdur Rezzak Khan, advocate Joynal Abedin, barrister Mahbubuddin Khokon, advocate Sanaullah Mia, advocate Masud Ahmed Talukder, barrister Nawshad Jamir, advocate Ahmed Azam Khan, advocate Shamsur Rahman Shimul Biswas, barrister Nasiruddin Asim, Khurshid Alam and barrister Fatema Anwar are among the lawyers of the panel. Anticorruption Commission lawyer Mosharraf Hossain Kajal told bdnews24.com: "The hearing on the charges against Khaleda Zia and other accused in the Niko scam case is set for Monday." It would be her first court appearance after Khaleda and her son Arafat Rahman Coco were produced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka on Sept 3 shortly after their arrest. Mahbubul Alam, assistant director of the Anticorruption Commission, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 9 last year. The ACC submitted a chargesheet against Khaleda and 10 others in the case on May 5. Former law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed, state minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain, former principal secretary of the Prime Minister's Office Kamal Uddin Siddiqui are among the accused. Khaleda and 10 others stand accused of costing the state coffers Tk 13,777 crore in losses. The case alleged that Canadian company Niko Resources was "very inefficient" in different aspects, including technical know-how for oil explorations, but the deal was approved in violations of a proper procedure. The BNP-led government connived with Niko in implementing an "illegal" joint venture agreement soon after the four-party alliance assumed power in October 2001, it was alleged in the case filed against Khaleda. Niko applied to state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain to close the deal, but some experts of Petrobangla and Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration and Production Company opposed the agreement, according to case details. Khaleda, the then prime minister, allegedly ignored opinions of the gas experts and took sides with Niko on the deal, costing the state Tk 13,777 crore. bdnew
