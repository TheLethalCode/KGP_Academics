 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)The BNP-led four-party alliance Thursday demanded the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, which they say is necessary to add meaning to the government's dialogue with political parties. The demand was made following the first meeting between the alliance's secretaries general in 16 months, at the Nam flat of BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain. The leaders also demanded the release of Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, who was arrested with alleged ties to the GATCO scam case. The last meeting of the alliance, presided over by BNP chief Khaleda Zia, was held on Jan 22, 2007. Following the meeting, Delwar told reporters they had discussed economic and social issues as well as political matters. The BNP leader said the alliance had agreed on a 14-point charter at the meeting, which includes a demand to have the "false cases" against former ministers M Shamsul Islam, MK Anwar and Nizami withdrawn. Other demands include lifting the state of emergency, holding the national polls as soon as possible and halting the delimitation of parliamentary constituencies. The charter also called for the removal of any parts of the women development policy that were "contrary to the Quran", and ensuring the Election Commission works independently. He said the alliance did not take any decision on whether to enter into dialogue with the government, saying a decision will be taken in consultation with party leaders. "We believe Khaleda Zia's freedom and presence at the dialogue has to be ensured to make it meaningful," he said. Also attending the meeting were BNP standing committee member RA Ghani, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and assistant secretary general Abdul Kader Molla. Islami Oikya Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami, Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP) acting chairman Andalib Rahman Partho and secretary general Shamim Al Mamun, and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish chief Maulana Mohammad Ishaq and secretary general advocate Abdul Kader also attended the meeting. bdnews24.co
