 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com) - The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) said Sunday it demanded a national government after elections, in talks with cabinet members. The party held dialogue with the government as the makeshift administration embarked on a mission to shore up the sagging confidence of political parties in the run-up to the elections. The party also demanded that the government fully lifts the state of emergency and begins trial of war criminals before elections. Meanwhile, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said there was a possibility of allowing trade union activities on a limited scale like indoor politics. In the two-hour meeting, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed was present along with some other advisers while JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu led the party team. "We have told the government to fully lift the emergency rules to create congenial atmosphere for the elections. Besides we have asked for taking measures so that elections are held in December and all political parties join the race," Inu said. "The unelected government must go by December," he said. Inu said: "We have proposed a national government. The country needs a consensus of all political parties on reforms to the constitution, parliamentary system, administration and economic sphere so that no future government turns into an autocratic regime," he said. Inu said he demanded administrative action so that Sheikh Hasina can make her points in the dialogue with the government. "We have asked to lift all controls from the political activities and trade union rights." He said that they demanded the government forms a special tribunal in line with the 1973 law to try the war criminals. The JSD also asked the government to consult all before making a decision. Inu said: "We have asked the government not to take any policy decision alone." He said the government did not place any proposal regarding the so-called national charter. Responding to the issue, Hossain Zillur said: "The government has no orchestrated agenda. The issue of consensus will come through discussion. We hope a complete scenario will come in this regard." He further said: "Initiatives have been made so that all political parties can join the dialogue. We are hopeful." He said: "Efforts are on to examine legal clauses for easing the bans on trade union activities. I hope something will come up during the course of the dialogue." He said the JSD proposed to curb criminal activities across the country to create a proper environment for elections. "The government has fully agreed on that." bdnews24.co
