 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka stocks rallied to gains for a third day with the general index and the total turnover reaching new heights. DSE general index closed at 3133.49 points on Monday after hitting 3120.51 points on April 16 this year, while total turnover amounted to Tk 4.61 billion surpassing the previous record of Tk 4.17 billion on May 18. Certain scrips were highly overpriced posing risks to the market with investors, especially retail ones, betting on them without analysing the fundamentals, said an official with a merchant bank preferring anonymity. Analysts said the trend was leading to overheating of the market. "Prices of some issues are rising even after declarations and book closures, which is very unusual," said Yaweer Sayeed, managing director of AIMS of Bangladesh. The stock market analyst cautioned that the situation might turn risky for retail investors. "The country's stock market was basically rumour-driven, which is alarming. In the wake of this volatile situation, market gamblers might be reaping gains by manipulation," he added. Sayeed said the market had enough liquidity, which indicated that investors were interested in investing in the securities markets. "To yield benefit from this, the market needs constant supply of quality shares," he suggested.
