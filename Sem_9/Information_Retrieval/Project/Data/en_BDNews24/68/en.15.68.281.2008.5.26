<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The caretaker government is staging 'mock trials' in the name of justice with a view to barring leading politicians including Khaleda Zia from contesting the forthcoming national polls, said BNP leader Khandakar Delwar Hossain Monday. Speaking to reporters at his NAM flat Monday, after prison authorities failed to produce Khaleda Zia in court for the Niko case hearing, Delwar said: "The prosecution didn't produce any paper or document in the court explaining why Khaleda Zia wasn't produced in the court." "The government is holding 'mock trials' of politicians, including Khaleda Zia, only to deter them from participating in the ensuing elections, but people will not accept such conspiracies aimed at excluding BNP from the national polls." Calling the Niko graft case 'conspiratorial' charges, he said according to law no case proceedings can run before the accused is produced in court. The BNP Khaleda-appointed secretary general alleged that he had not received the case documents yet. "I have asked the court for permission to see my leader. I also applied to the jail authorities for permission to see her, but I was not allowed." On joining the ongoing political dialogue with the government, Delwar said: "I've said it before and now say again that the dialogue will not be fruitful unless Khaleda Zia is freed and her presence in the dialogue process is ensured." "We have not yet taken any decision about participating in the dialogue," he reiterated. Delwar was present at the Special Judge's Court-9 Monday morning along with around a hundred pro-BNP lawyers. Delwar is also on the lawyers' panel defending Khaleda Zia. bdnews
