 MOSCOW, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson bathed in the glory of a second Champions League success on Thursdayand immediately warned of changes next season. The Scot said the future wold mean diminishing roles for veteran players Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, both of whom he has coached for more than 20 years. Beaming with delight after seeing his side beat Chelsea 6-5 on penalties in a dramatic shootout after a pulsating final ended in a 1-1 draw, Ferguson told journalists he was "very, very proud" after lifting the European Cup for the second time. He added: "But the great asset I've got is that I won't get carried away with it and tomorrow morning I will be thinking about next season. "The euphoria drains away quickly for me, it drains away almost immediately. The moment for me came with the final penalty kick and the save from Edwin van der Sar. That was my moment." Ferguson showed little sentiment on the subject of old stagers Giggs and Scholes. "Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs are in the twilights of their careers and they will still contribute in a big way next season as they normally do, but they won't play as many games. "They will eventually be phased out which is what you have to do in this life. Ryan will be 35 in November, Paul will be 34 and they will play 25 to 30 games next season because we have the back-up, we have the young players now." GREAT SUCCESS Giggs and Scholes joined United around the same time as David Beckham, Phil and Gary Neville and Nicky Butt, who all went on to enjoy great success under Ferguson too. None, though, have enjoyed as much success as Giggs who replaced Scholes as a substitute in the 87th minute and scored the penalty that put United 6-5 ahead in the shootout. It was an extra special night for Giggs, who broke Bobby Charlton's all-time appearance record for United by playing in his 759th match for the club. In all he won the 20th major medal of his 18-year professional career which includes a record 10 league titles, 4 FA Cups and now two European Cups. Giggs will be hope to add to that haul next season, and Ferguson certainly was not ruling out the prospect of more European success for his side. "It is not easy to defend the European Cup but the young players who have tasted success tonight will want to do it again," he said. "Some teams have done, I hope we can do it. I think we are good enough.
