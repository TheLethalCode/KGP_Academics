<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court Tuesday rejected a petition filed by former prime minister Khaleda Zia to have the Niko scam case scrapped. The HC bench of justices Khademul Islam Chowdhury and Mashuk Hossain Ahmed passed the order after four days of a hearing on the appeal. "The appeal was not placed," the court said in the order. The BNP chairperson, now behind bars on charges of corruption, filed the petition on May 18. Another HC bench on May 20 said it was too embarrassed to hear the appeal. The Anticorruption Commission submitted a chargesheet in the case against Khaleda and 10 others on May 5, accusing them of scamming the state coffers of Tk 13,700 crore by signing a deal with Canadian company Niko Resources. ACC assistant director Md Mahbubul Alam filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 9 last year. bdnew
