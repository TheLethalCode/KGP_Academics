<TITLE> Loew ready to hit the heights for Germany </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - In the old tradition of the Liverpool boot room, the unassuming Joachim Loew has made a seamless transition from assistant to Germany's head coach and the results are there for all to see. Loew's profile was low-key even in Germany when Juergen Klinsmann took over in 2004 and chose him as his right-hand man. By the end of the World Cup, and Germany's exhilarating run to third place, he was a household name and the obvious choice to replace Klinsmann once he decided to head back home to California. Loew is Germany's 10th coach and still has a far lower profile than his extrovert predecessorBob Paisley to Klinsmann's Bill Shankly, if you like, although the scarf-wearing German is a nattier dresser than either. Jogi, as he is commonly known, is respected by everyone, however, after his decision to maintain Klinsmann's fast, attacking approach which saw Germany become the first team to qualify for Euro 2008. "Jogi has absolute authority," captain Michael Ballack said recently. "He has the team in his grip." The 48-year-old Loew, has, if anything, been even more daring than Klinsmann since the World Cup. He gave debuts to 16 players in his first 18 months, including such talents as Mario Gomez and Patrick Helmes, and has rehabilitated Kevin Kuranyi, who was distraught at being left out of the 2006 World Cup squad. The high point of his reign was a 2-1 win over the Czech Republic in Prague, when two Kuranyi goals virtually assured Germany of their place in Austria and Switzerland. After securing qualification, Germany eased off over the final few games and ended up finishing secondsomething that actually worked in their favour as they avoided a seeding and what would have been a much tougher group. As it is, Germany are in a clearly winnable Group B with co-hosts Austria, Poland and Croatia and it is hard to see any reason why they should not go through and maybe do even better than their semi-final at the World Cup. Liverpool fans know that while Bill Shankly put in the foundations it was Bob Paisley who went on to lead the club to their greatest successes, particularly in Europe. Perhaps the good times really are about to return for Germany
