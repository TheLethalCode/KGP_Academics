 MANCHESTER, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Monty Panesar took a test best six for 37 to lead an astonishing England fightback on the third day of the second test against New Zealand at Old Trafford on Sunday. After dismissing the Kiwis for just 114 in their second innings, England were 76 for one in their second innings needing a further 218 runs to go 1-0 up in the three-match series.

Jacob Oram (7) batted at number eight after staying back in the dressing room with a shoulder and neck injury sustained in practice on Sunday morning. Daniel Flynn who retired hurt after he was hit in the mouth by a James Anderson bouncer on Friday did not ba
