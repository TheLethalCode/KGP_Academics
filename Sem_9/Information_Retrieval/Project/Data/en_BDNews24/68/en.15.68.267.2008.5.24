 KINGSTON, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia seamer Stuart Clark took three important wickets on the second day of the first test against West Indies on Friday and said studying former team mate Glenn McGrath had helped him adapt to Caribbean conditions. Clark, playing his first test in West Indies, took time to watch video footage of McGrath, who retired after last year's World Cup and had a good record in the region.

The right-armer picked up West Indies openers Devon Smith and Brenton Parchment before grabbing the precious wicket of captain Ramnaresh Sarwan. The experienced Shivnarine Chanderpaul and the recalled Runako Morton battled through to stumps to leave West Indies on 115 for three chasing Australia's 431. "It was good to get a few wickets, we are in a pretty decent spot in the game, if we can get a couple of early ones tomorrow especially Chanderpaul we can put them under a lot of pressure," said Clark. "His record suggests that he is a very good player and he batted well again tonight. We've just got to grind him out somehow and we can get ourselves into a really good spot if we can get into the middle to lower order," he sai
