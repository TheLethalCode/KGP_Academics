Germany added a second 12 minutes later when David Odonkor's right-wing cross bounced in off Vladimir Korytko's foot for an own goal. Belarus, who failed to qualify for Euro 2008, pulled one back through Vitali Bulyga in the 61st minute. Bulyga then equalised with two minutes to go, dribbling past defender Christoph Metzelder before beating keeper Jens Lehmann who had kept the hosts afloat with a couple of excellent saves.
