 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken up a new project to construct a road linking Airport Road with Rokeya Sarani in an effort to ease traffic congestion in the city, adviser Anwarul Iqbal said Saturday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to inaugurate the construction of the road through Tejgaon Airport on May 31, the adviser said at a press conference. The LGRD adviser said the 2.6-kilometre long road would connect Ring Road in Shyamoli and Dhaka-Chittagong Highway, and cut pressure on Bijoy Sarani and Airport Road. The project will cost Tk 24.92 crore, with Dhaka City Corporation in charge of implementing it by December. Sixteen Engineer Construction Battalion (Special Works Organisation) of Bangladesh Army will construct the road. Anwarul Iqbal said that vehicles coming in the direction of Mohakhali would not be allowed to use Bijoy Sarani after the new road opened. The project would cover repairing the road past the Bangladesh China Friendship Conference Centre. The authorities had a plan to construct a tunnel next to the link road if it caused traffic snarl-up in front of the CAO. Authorities plan to widen Airport Road in front of the CAO too, he said. Headquarters of Bangladesh Parjatan Corporation had already been shifted as part of project implementation. Professor Md Shamsul Hoque of Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, consultant of the project, said the road would be the longest link road in Dhaka to connect the south of the city with the north. Residents of east Dhaka including Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Kalyanpur and Shyamoli areas had to go to the Chittagong highway through Motijheel or Rampura. But they would be able to be on the highway through Tejgaon Industrial Area-Hatirjheel-Rampura road if a new road were constructed demolishing the Rangs Bhaban, the adviser said. Local Government Division secretary Shaikh Khurshid Alam was also present at the press conference. bdnew
