<TITLE> Skilled workers could remit $12bn from abroad: adviser </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury says Bangladesh could earn around $12 billion in remittances every year if unskilled overseas workers could become a skilled labour force. "At present, 49 percent of Bangladeshi workers serving abroad are unskilled," the adviser said Sunday. "If they were turned into a skilled workforce, the remittance earnings could total $12 billion a year," he told the principals of technical colleges at the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training auditorium in the city. Bangladesh earned $6 billion in foreign remittances in 2007 from a total of 832,000 workers who received clearance to be employed overseas, Iftekhar said. The adviser stressed that the earning potential of the workers could be enhanced by upgrading the curricula of the technical centres to produce a skilled workforce. Presided over by BMET director general MA Malek, Sunday's meeting was also addressed by Abdul Matin, expatriates welfare and overseas employment secretary. The principals of 38 technical centres around the country attended the meeting. bdne
