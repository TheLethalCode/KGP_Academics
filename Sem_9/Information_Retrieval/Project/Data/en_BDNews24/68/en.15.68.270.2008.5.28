 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court shifted the trial proceedings of the GATCO graft case Wednesday to a special court set up in the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban complex. Metropolitan senior special judge Md Azizul Haque ordered the transfer on security grounds. Assistant record keeper Noor Alam of the Metropolitan Senior Special Judge's Court told bdnews24.com that the case documents would be shifted to the special court by Wednesday. Earlier on May 22, the judge ordered the seven fugitives in the case including former finance minister M Saifur Rahman to surrender to court by May 28 and asked authorities to publish a gazette notification in this regard. But none of the accused appeared within the deadline. GATCO directors Syed Tanvir Ahmed and Syed Ghalib Ahmed were taken to court Wednesday from Dhaka Central Jail. Some 24 people have been made accused in the graft case so far, 17 of whom have been detained while seven remain fugitive. The fugitives are former finance minister and acting BNP chairperson M Saifur Rahman, former commerce minister Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury, former shipping secretary Julfiker Haider Chowdhury, Jahanara Ansar, wife of former shipping minister Akbar Hossain, and three GATCO directors AKM Musa Kajal, Shahjahan M Hasib and Ehsan Yusuf. bdnews24.com
