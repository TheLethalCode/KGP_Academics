<TITLE> Nihat primed to fire </TITLE>

 ISTANBUL, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nihat Kahveci has proved to be one of Turkey's most successful footballing exports. The diminutive 28-year-old striker from Giresun on the Black Sea coast - more famous for exporting hazelnuts than footballers - has made a big impact since arriving in Spain in 2001. While players such as Hakan Sukur failed to make a major breakthrough during stints with clubs in Italy and England, Nihat has played a key role at both Real Sociedad and Villarreal. His 18 league goals with the eastern Spanish side this season have helped lift them to second in the Primera Liga and booked them a place in next season's Champions League. Turkey coach Fatih Terim will be banking on him making a similar contribution at Euro 2008. He is prized for his speed, strong right foot and long-range shooting ability, to which a recent Turkish television advert pays tribute - showing him writing a denial of transfer rumours on a football and then kicking it from Spain to Turkey. Nihat was a product of the youth system at Besiktas, where he was brought into the first-team squad by coach John Toshack and established himself as a valuable goalscorer. At the start of 2001, Toshack brought Nihat to Real Sociedad when he took over as coach there. He only slowly broke into the team, but in partnership with Serb Darko Kovacevic he helped push the club close to winning the Primera Liga in 2003 - a memory which still riles him. "I would be lying if I said the pain of missing out on the championship was not still inside me It would have been unbelievable for me," he said. The added disappointment of missing out on the title again this year with Villarreal will be a further motivation for Euro 2008, to which he fired Turkey with a goal against Bosnia in November. Back in 2002, he played a role in Turkey reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup and with the additional frustration of failing to qualify for the 2006 World Cup, Nihat will be determined to go one better this time round
