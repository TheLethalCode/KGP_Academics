<TITLE> Quiet man Barnetta ready to fire up Swiss campaign </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERNE, Switzerland, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - While living up to his 'quiet' forename off the pitch, Tranquillo Barnetta is surprisingly explosive when providing the midfield impetus on it for his native Switzerland. Fast, skilful, imaginative and versatile, Barnetta, 22, established himself as his country's hottest prospect during the 2006 World Cup and has managed to enhance that reputation in the intervening two years, despite some indifferent performances from the team as a whole. Already a European champion at junior level, having won the under-17 title with Switzerland in 2002 - as a right back - the Bayer Leverkusen player is strong on both feet and can play in any midfield position. Significantly for a Swiss team deprived of injured top scorer Alex Frei for a year, he has also worked hard on his goal scoring, providing both in the 2-1 win over the Netherlands last August. A more typical performance came against fellow co-hosts Austria in October when Barnetta set up all three goals in Switzerland's 3-1 victory including a dazzling run from his own half and past a couple of Austrian defenders to set up Hakan Yakin for a simple tap-in. Although invariably modest, Barnetta is well aware of his exceptional ability and the fact that Switzerland will be expecting great things from him. "Earlier I was always seen as a big talent, but today I see myself as an established footballer because I have been able to bring a certain consistency to my performances," he told Switzerland's Eurosoccer magazine in May. NATURALLY RESERVED "Switzerland never won a match because one or two players played well though, but only when we have played well as a team." As his name suggests, Barnetta has Italian roots though they are well buried. His family have lived in Switzerland since his great-great grandfather brought them to the country prior to the First World War. Barnetta himself describes himself as "fully Swiss" and enjoyed a remarkably traditional Swiss upbringing including an education at the monastic school in his small home city of St Gallen. Given his naturally reserved nature and his phenomenal talent it is unsurprising that he describes former French international Zinedine Zidane as his idol. The one major setback in Barnetta's career so far has been the cruciate ligament injury in October 2004 that sidelined him for six months though he now says it proved beneficial to his career as a whole. "That injury taught me that it can all be over very quickly," he said after his recovery. "Now I know the opposite is also the case: you can get back very quickly to the top again.
