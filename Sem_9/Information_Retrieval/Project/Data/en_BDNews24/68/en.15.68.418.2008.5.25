 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)Adviser Ghulam Quader said Sunday he was optimistic that Awami League and BNP will realise the need to join in the political dialogue process with others. "I'm hopeful that BNP and AL will participate in the dialogue when the time is ripe. I trust that both parties are already convinced of the necessity of joining hands with others," the communications adviser told reporters at the ministry. "All efforts are on to bring in the two parties to the government dialogue on electoral reforms, and we know that they too want the dialogue process to be successful." Asked if detained former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina will be allowed to be present at the talks, the adviser said: "I don't have anything to say about this, as it involves a legal process." Quader, however, stressed the need for AL and BNP to participate in political dialogue with the government, as the nation is at a critical crossroads in its history. Mentioning that the dialogue process had got off to a positive start, he said: "I'm sure the dialogue efforts will be successful with the particiaption of all the parties concerned. There's is no reason why the process should fail." Refuting complaints aired by AL presidium members that the chief adviser was not present through all the dialogue sessions Saturday, the adviser said Fakhruddin attended for more than an hour and he would be present as required in all future sessions. bdnews
