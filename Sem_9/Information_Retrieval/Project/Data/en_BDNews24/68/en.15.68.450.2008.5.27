 KATHMANDU Tue May 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb exploded in Nepal's capital on Tuesday, injuring at least one person, in the latest attack that has raised tensions ahead of a historic vote for a new assembly to abolish the 239-year monarchy. "It was a small bomb in a public park near the venue where a pro-republican cultural program was set to be held," Kathmandu police chief Sarbendra Khanal said. "One person was slightly injured in the leg," he said. "We have defused a second bomb near the same place before it exploded." The blast came hours after members of a special assembly expected to formally declare Nepal a republic were sworn in at a ceremony attended by the country's top political leaders. The government warned on Tuesday that it could use force to throw unpopular King Gyanendra out of the royal palace if he refuses to leave voluntarily after the monarchy is abolished. "The king must leave the palace immediately and move to the Nirmal Niwas," Peace and Reconstruction Minister Ram Chandra Poudel said, referring to Gyanendra's private home. "If he does not leave the palace then the government might have to use force to vacate the palace," he said. "This will not be good for him." There was no immediate comment from the palace. Tuesday was the second day running of bomb attacks. A pro-Hindu militant group set off on Monday two small bombs outside the International Convention Centre, the venue of Wednesday's assembly meeting, police said. No one was injured in the attacks. The assembly elected in April is scheduled to hold its first meeting on Wednesday and formally declare an end to the monarchy, a key part of a 2006 peace deal with Maoist former rebels that ended a decade-long civil war. "It is not clear who set off the explosion but we have found a pamphlet of a pro-Hindu outfit, Ranabir Sena, near the site," another police official said Many Nepalis think that the king will go quietly after the assembly vote. Gyanendra has been living in the Narayanhity royal palace in the heart of Kathmandu since ascending the throne in 2001, but he has made no public statement over his plans. All state allowances and benefits given to the king will be stopped from Wednesday. The government has banned demonstrations around major royal sites and the assembly. But Maoists and other main political parties say tens of thousands of people will take to the streets on Wednesday to celebrate the monarchy's end. The government took over control of the royal palace after Gyanendra was forced to end his absolute rule following weeks of street protests in 2006. Nepalis say much of the mystique of the royal family was broken after the 2001 palace massacre in which popular King Birendra and eight other royals were killed by then Crown Prince Dipendra, who later turned the gun on himself. In April this year, anti-monarchy Maoists emerged as the largest party in elections to the 601-member assembly
