<TITLE> Guitarist Bilic strikes the right chord for Croatia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia's rock guitar-playing coach and former defender Slaven Bilic is seen as one of the most charismatic managers in top-level football. At 39, the former West Ham United and Everton centre-half has made an impressive start to his coaching career, having ended his playing days in 2001 at his first club, Hajduk Split, in his home city on the Adriatic coast. A key figure in Croatia's celebrated run to third place at the 1998 World Cup finals, Bilic's spell with the national set-up began in 2004 in charge of Croatia's Under-21 squad. He moved up to the seniors, replacing Zlatko Kranjcar, following a disappointing showing at the 2006 World Cup finals. Croatia were beaten to a place in the second round by unfancied Australia, who held them to a 2-2 draw. Bilic applied the same no-nonsense approach from his playing career in his first game as manager, suspending three players for being spotted in a nightclub ahead of their opening Euro 2008 qualifier in Russia. All threeIvica Olic, Darijo Srna and Bosko Balaban  later retuned to the squad and are now in contention for a place at Euro 2008. Bilic quickly won the players' hearts and minds, along with those of the national media, with his commitment to making Croatia a force to be reckoned with at the tournament. Last November's 3-2 win over England at Wembley drew interest from several Premier League clubs, but Bilic chose instead to extend his contract with the Croatian Football Association (HNS) after protracted negotiations. His favourite strategy is a standard 4-4-2, which he transforms into a 4-3-3 when he needs to chase the game and a more conservative 4-5-1 with wide players playing behind the lone striker in a counter-attacking formation. He was not afraid to give young talent a chance on the road to Euro 2008 and was rewarded handsomely as Eduardo da Silva emerged as the team's top scorer with 10 goals. Defender Vedran Corluka and playmaker Luka Modric also impressed. Fluent in German, Italian and English, Bilic also has a law degree. However, his love of rock music is his most distinguished interest outside the world of football. He plays the guitar in a band called the Rawbau, with clips of him in action on www.youtube.com. The band have recorded Croatia's Euro 2008 anthem called Fiery Madness, reflecting the team's nickname "The Fiery Outfit.
