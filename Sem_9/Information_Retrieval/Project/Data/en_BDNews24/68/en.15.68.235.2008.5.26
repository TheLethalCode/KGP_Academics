 JOHANNESBURG, May 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Thabo Mbeki called South Africa's wave of deadly attacks on immigrants a "disgrace" on Sunday and said his government would act firmly to curb the bloodshed amid growing criticism from African nations. At least 50 people have died and more than 25,000 have fled to refugee centers from the attacks, which have heightened fears for the stability of Africa's largest economy. In recent months the country has seen a wave of electricity outages, a surge in inflation and discontent over pro-business policies, to a background of uncertainty over political transition as Mbeki nears the end of his final term in 2009. Mobs, armed with knives, stones and in some cases guns, began attacking African migrants in a Johannesburg shanty town on May 11. The xenophobic violence has spread to other areas. "We must acknowledge the events of the past two weeks as an absolute disgrace," Mbeki said in a televised address, his first of the crisis. "Everything possible will be done to bring the perpetrators to justice." South Africa's government and the ruling ANC have been criticized for their slow reaction to the unrest, the worst since apartheid ended 14 years ago, and for not adequately addressing the poverty widely blamed for sparking the bloodshed. Mbeki reiterated his government's position that a minority were responsible for the attacks and that they did not reflect the values of the majority of South Africa's 50 million people. Some poor South Africans accuse foreigners, many of whom are Zimbabweans who have fled an economic meltdown back home, of stealing jobs and fuelling violent crime. Rising food and fuel prices have pushed tensions to breaking point. There are growing calls for Mbeki's government to take steps to quell the waves of refugees and asylum seekers lured by the chance to work in South African mines, factories and farms. But Mbeki, speaking on the U.N.'s Africa Day, urged his citizens to be charitable to foreigners and said his nation's prosperity was linked to that of the rest of Africa. "We must remain firm in our commitment to work hard to achieve the goal of the renewal of our continent, understanding that in this circumstance an injury to one is an injury to all," Mbeki said, vowing to resist calls to force migrants into camps. ANC MOBILISES Mbeki had issued several statements condemning the violence but had come under pressure to address the public, as his predecessor Nelson Mandela did during national crises. South Africa's neighbors have expressed concerns about the violence directed against their citizens, thousands of whom have returned home. The unrest has dented South Africa's reputation as one of the most welcoming to immigrants and refugees. Mozambique said more than 26,000 of its citizens had left. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa expressed shock that Zambians had been among those targeted by the mobs and pointedly reminded South Africans that his country and others on the continent played a key role in helping end white minority rule. Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe said his government would offer land to Zimbabweans in South Africa who came home. Appalled by the criticism, senior ANC officials fanned out across the Johannesburg region on Sunday to appeal for calm. But party leader Jacob Zuma, frontunner to succeed Mbeki, received a rocky reception when he spoke at a meeting east of Johannesburg, where residents expressed frustration over the impact of immigration on housing, employment and crime. "Tell them (other African leaders) to tell their people they must not harass us in our country," a resident shouted at Zuma. "If you are a stumbling block, we are going to kick you away." But police said trouble spots were becoming calmer. "We had a quiet evening last night with no reports of serious violence. The violence is cooling down now," Andre Traut, a spokesman for police in the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, said on Sunday. Traut said many migrants were in makeshift refugee camps, where they were receiving blankets, food and clothing. Police, backed by the military, were watching for fresh unrest. Earlier this week Mbeki authorized the army to help. Officials in the tourism industry, one of the cornerstones of the economy, are worried that overseas visitors will delay or cancel trips to the country, which is scheduled to host the 2010 soccer World Cup. An estimated half a million extra tourists are expected to visit South Africa for the championship
