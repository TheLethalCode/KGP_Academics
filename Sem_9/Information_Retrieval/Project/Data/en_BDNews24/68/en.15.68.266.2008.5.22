 PRAGUE, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - When Karel Brueckner retires from coaching after Euro 2008, the 68-year-old will have the distinction of being the first Czech manager to take his country to three successive tournaments. However, his overall legacy will also depend on the team's progress at the finals in Austria and Switzerland as critics believe his best moments actually came four years ago. A distinctive figure with his shock of white hair and a voice often rendered hoarse by shouting from the bench, Brueckner is nevertheless admired by his players, who often say they cannot imagine a future without him. A former chain-smoker with a fondness for chess and cards, Brueckner has worked his way up to international football from modest beginnings and without managerial experience in any of the major European leagues. He started out in domestic club football with provincial side Olomouc, the town where he was born and where he also began his playing career back in 1957. Appointed coach of the under-21s in 1997, he made the step up to the senior squad in December 2001 and was instrumental in guiding the Czechs to Euro 2004 in Portugal. He was due considerable credit for reinvigorating a squad that had suffered a shock defeat by Belgium in their playoff to reach the 2002 World Cup. At the finals in Portugal, Brueckner's magic worked until a 1-0 defeat by eventual tournament winners Greece in a semi-final decided by a 'silver goal' seconds before the end of the first half of extra time. Unbowed, Brueckner led the Czechs to the 2006 World Cup, their first in 16 years. However, a group stage exit after 2-0 defeats by Ghana and Italy in which the Czechs finished with only 10 men fuelled criticism that Brueckner had stuck by the old guard instead of trying out in-form players. The disappointment did not prevent the Czech Soccer Union extending his contract and he steered a reshuffled side to Euro 2008 in the absence of former European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved, who retired in August 2006. Trouble did brew though in March 2007, when the Czechs lost 2-1 at home to Germany in a qualifier and players were caught by the tabloid press celebrating defender Tomas Ujfalusi's 29th birthday at the team hotel just hours later. Brueckner even considered resigning over the incident but was backed by players and football officials alike. He will depart for sure after Euro 2008, leaving an impressive record. With the Czechs having won 47 of their 71 games under Brueckner, his successor will have to work hard to do any better
