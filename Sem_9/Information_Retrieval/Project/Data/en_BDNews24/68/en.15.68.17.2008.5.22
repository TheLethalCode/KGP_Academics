<TITLE> Wembley euphoria now a memory for Croatia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ZAGREB, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia are preparing for Euro 2008 with the euphoria of their victory over England at Wembley tempered by the blow of losing top scorer Eduardo da Silva to a horrifying leg-break. Croatia maintained a proud record by reaching the finals, having qualified for six out of seven major tournaments since declaring independence in 1991, missing out only on Euro 2000. Though the high point came with a third-place finish at the 1998 World Cup, courtesy of a talented side led by Davor Suker, Zvonimir Boban and Robert Prosinecki, many began to rate Croatia's trophy chances after that Wembley win last November. Already qualified for the finals, Slaven Bilic's Croatia out-classed England on a treacherous pitch, their 3-2 victory denying the hosts a place of their own at the tournament. Former coach Miroslav Blazevic, who steered the 1998 side to their remarkable result in France, expressed hopes of Croatia emulating or even surpassing that success at Euro 2008. However, those hopes suffered a body blow in February when Brazilian-born Eduardo, who had scored in Croatia's home win over England, suffered a broken fibula and open dislocation of his ankle after a tackle by Birmingham City's Martin Taylor. LOSING STEAM Newspaper pictures of the injuries, as Eduardo lay on the pitch, were not for the faint hearted. The qualifying competition's second highest scorer with 10 goals would clearly not be at the finals. A 3-0 home defeat by the Netherlands in a friendly before the injury, followed by an unimpressive 1-1 draw in Scotland also took the steam out of what seemed an unrealistic assessment of Croatia's chances. For Bilic, the key to their hopes next month will be to make the right start. After the draw, he called their opening Group B fixture against Austria in Vienna on June 8 a "landmine" that Croatia must negotiate successfully to have any chance of reaching the last eight. Should they drop points against the unfancied co-hosts, the Croatians will face an uphill struggle against favourites Germany and a Poland side determined to make an impact in their first European championship. With Eduardo out, Mladen Petric, Ivica Olic and Ivan Klasnic will be handed the goalscoring duties, while a well-drilled midfield led by Luka Modric and Niko Kranjcar should provide the supply routes. Croatia's success will also depend on whether the back four, largely dependent on older players, can deal with the pressure. While Vedran Corluka and Dario Simic are sure to start, Danijel Pranjic may be preferred to Josip Simunic on the left and Robert Kovac's pace and agility will face a real test. Reaching the knockout stage is not beyond Croatia, if they can repeat their qualifying form without Eduardo and avoid further injuries
