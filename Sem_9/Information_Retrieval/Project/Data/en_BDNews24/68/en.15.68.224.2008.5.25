<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori put his team in command of the second test on the third morning at Old Trafford on Sunday after his five wickets destroyed England's batting. The New Zealanders led by 180, having scored one run for no wicket after three overs of their second innings at lunch. In reply to New Zealand's first innings 381, England were bowled out for 202, 25 minutes before lunch as left-arm spinner Vettori claimed five for 66 from 31 overs, while the accurate seamer Iain O'Brien took three for 49. England, resuming on 152 for four, capitulated meekly and at 180 for nine they were still two runs short of avoiding the follow-on after losing five wickets for 20 runs. Tail-ender Stuart Broad had the 'honour' of ensuring England avoided the follow-on with two runs off Vettori when the feat seemed increasingly unlikely with every falling wicket. It was also Broad who registered England's first boundary of the morning, after 56 difficult minutes, when he flicked O'Brien to fine leg. He cover drove another four in the same over. Broad was the last man out for 30. Despite Ross Taylor's explosive 154 not out on Saturday, the accurate and threatening New Zealand bowling and spitting turn and bounce for Vettori from the Manchester pitch was proving a challenge to England. PIETERSEN STRUGGLES Kevin Pietersen, when on 25, received an early lifeline after he deflected an inside edge on to his pad that carried to wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum. Bizarrely, only O'Brien appealed and he looked surprised when none of his team mates joined him. Vettori extracted considerable turn and bounce from the pitch and one delivery spun past Pietersen's bat and was taken by McCullum at head height. Pietersen seemed unwilling to smother the spin by using his feet and his struggle was complete when he edged another turner from Vettori to Taylor at slip and was out for 26. Ian Bell (8) then edged O'Brien to second slip, where Taylor took the catch after a juggle. Paul Collingwood, under pressure for his position after going a year without a test hundred, was trapped lbw by Vettori after the ball struck him on his back leg. His score was two and England had then lost three wickets for just four runs. Tim Ambrose (3) gave Taylor his third catch with an edge to slip off Vettori. With three runs needed to avoid the follow-on, crowd favourite Monty Panesar (1) edged Kyle Mills to McCullum, who took a spectacular, diving, one-handed catch. Jacob Oram did not field in the session after falling on his right shoulder in practice but is expected to be all right
