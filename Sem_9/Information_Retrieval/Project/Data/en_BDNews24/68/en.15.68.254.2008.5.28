<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  The government is continuing its efforts to bring all political parties to dialogue, the commerce adviser said Wednesday. "We have to understand the sentiments of all political parties. We can't say for sure yet whether dialogue will be successful without the participation of the two major parties," adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters, emerging from a meeting with business leaders at the commerce ministry. "All I know is, we have to go forward. We have no other way." The government will hold talks with the business community on June 5. FBCCI president Annisul Huq, who led the business delegation to the meeting with the adviser, said: "The situation is becoming complex by the day." "The government is trying to proceed towards the election through dialogue while political parties are going opposite," Huq said. "The future seems foggy to me." But Hossain Zillur Rahman termed the dialogue an effort to take the nation on the path to fulfilling desires and expectations of people. "We are trying to continue dialogue as there is potential for success. We will sit with all parties, no matter what others say," Rahman said. "Everybody should assess the whole matter with patience. It won't be wise to take anything negatively." On the decision by the two major parties of boycotting dialogue without their leaders, the FBCCI chief said: "The parties say there is no end in politics. Their statements reflect the same." "If the situation becomes more complicated, the nation, and the business community in particular, will be in trouble. Everybody should realise that we are going through a tough time." "To get over the crisis we have to communicate with all," he said. The FBCCI chief urged the government and the politicians to be "visionary". "The parties will want their leaders freed, which is natural. They should also realise that they will have to resolve the problem through discussion," Huq said. bdnews24.c
