 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League on Tuesday decided not to join government dialogue without party chief Sheikh Hasina, a move likely to put a question mark on ongoing political talks. The decision on boycott came from a meeting of the Awami League Central Working Committee at the party's Dhanmondi office. The ALCWC meeting has been adjourned until Wednesday, acting AL president Zillur Rahman told reporters. A major announcement about a movement for the release of the former prime minister, now behind bars on charges of corruption, is expected to come from Wednesday's meeting. The ALCWC meeting also endorsed most recommendations made by district AL leaders at the party's crucial extended meeting on Monday. "The meeting has approved the speeches of the district leaders, showing honour to them. The district leaders said there would be no dialogue and no election without Sheikh Hasina," Zillur said. "We have also decided that we will not go to dialogue without Sheikh Hasina. If we go to dialogue we will do so under her leadership. And it is Sheikh Hasina who will name those who will participate in it," he said. The ALCWC meeting will resume at 11am Wednesday. bdnews
