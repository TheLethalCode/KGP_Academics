 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)The government is set to hold talks with the business community Wednesday to set the schedule of a parallel dialogue with civil society, the commerce adviser said Tuesday. "The government will hold a parallel dialogue with civil society. We will set the schedule in consultation with the business community," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters after a meeting at the law ministry between the four advisers assigned to the dialogue process. Law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader and LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal were present in the meeting. The government will sit with Islami Shashontantra Andolan on May 29; after a short break it will resume the dialogue process on June 2, Hossain Zillur said. Earlier, the adviser had denied there was any pressure from any quarter to involve the two major political parties in dialogue with the government. Hossain Zillur, who is also adviser to the education ministry, was questioned by reporters at an education ministry press briefing on the upcoming HSC exams. "It's you who's raised the issue. We are not aware of any such pressures being being brought to bear," he said. Asked if the government is contemplating any measures to involve the two detained leaders of the major parties, the advsier said: "Well, all the issues discussed and raised are under consideration. All-out efforts are in place to make the dialogue fruitful." "The dialogue is not being looked at as a government initiative only; it reflects the hopes and aspirations of the nation." "To make it successful, the media too has to play a positive role along with the government and the political parties." Asked how things would go in case the dialogue fails, Hossain Zillur replied: "We need not waste our time worrying about 'ifs' and 'buts'; we are working heart and soul to render it fruitful." "We have arranged the dialogue as the government respects the people of the country; it also cares about public opinion." "The nation is striving to move ahead through identifying problems during the dialogue and resolving them," the adviser said. bdnews24.com/m
