 JOHANNESBURG, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiery paceman Andre Nel returns to the squad as South Africa announced a battery of fast bowlers for their tour of England on Friday. The 30-year-old, who has played 34 tests, is the only addition to the squad that toured India in March and April, from which he was controversially omitted. Nel joins a six-man pace attack that includes the in-form Dale Steyn, the experienced Makhaya Ntini, the up-and-coming Morne Morkel, as well as Monde Zondeki. "It is a long tour with two lots of back-to-back test matches and we all know what the rate of attrition of fast bowlers can be, which is why we selected an extra one," selection convenor Joubert Strydom said in a statement released by Cricket South Africa on Friday. "In addition, we feel that we will need to give Dale Steyn a bit of a rest as he has been bowling regularly in the Indian Premier League. "He is one of our key weapons and we want him to be at his best when the test series gets underway. The same applies to Makhaya Ntini, while Morne Morkel is coming back from injury," Strydom said. The rest of the squad is the same that drew the series 1-1 in India, including two spinners in Paul Harris and Robin Peterson. South Africa's tour of England will include four tests, five ODIs and a Twenty20 match, as well as six non-international matches. They will leave for England on June 24. Squad : Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Paul Harris, Jacques Kallis, Neil McKenzie, Morne Morkel, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson, Dale Steyn, Monde Zondek
