<TITLE> Bravo warns against underestimating Aussie newcomers </TITLE>

 KINGSTON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia have lost several of their experienced campaigners in the past two years but West Indies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo says it would be foolish to underestimate their new faces. West Indies begin a three-test series against Australia at Sabina Park on Thursday. "We're not going to take them lightly because they have lost five or six key players over the last year or so," Bravo told reporters. "We know how good a team they are, they still have world-class players in their setup. "Our aim is to continue to play the game we have been playing for the last year or so, just try to enjoy our cricket and try to be a better team and move forward," he added. The most recent retirement from the Australia squad was that of wicket-keeper batsman Adam Gilchrist, which followed the departures of Justin Langer, Damien Martyn, Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. At Sabina Park, world number one ranked Australia will also be without vice-captain Michael Clarke, who was granted leave to attend the funeral of his fiancee's father and opening bat Matthew Hayden, who has an Achilles tendon injury. NEW FACES But the hosts themselves have been forced to bring in some less experienced faces, with captain and opening bat Chris Gayle injured and middle-order batsman Marlon Samuels suspended. Bravo believes, however, that after a promising drawn two test series against Sri Lanka, the arrival of the Australians offers the perfect stage for fringe players to shine. "We have a lot of good players on our team as well, they're young but they are maturing," he said. "It's difficult at the beginning of an important series such as this one to have our captain out due to injury and also losing Marlon. "There is an opportunity for other players like Devon Smith, Brenton Parchment, Ryan Hinds and Runako Morton -- the guys who have been in and out of the team. "Once you do well against a team like Australia everyone will stand up and your name will be counted because there is no other team in the world you would want to make your name against." West Indies have lost 11 of their last 12 tests against Australia and are ranked eighth in the world
