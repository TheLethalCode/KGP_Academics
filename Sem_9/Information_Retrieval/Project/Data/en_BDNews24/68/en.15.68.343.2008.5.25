<TITLE> Global market investors may face break-even dilemma </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Many investors will this week be tempted to cash in global equity holdings that have now recouped most of the earlier heavy losses of the year as surging oil prices stoke fears about a toxic mix of rising inflation and slowing growth. A series of price data from the United States and some euro zone countries may further aggravate an inflation picture which has already forced major central banks to review the wisdom of fresh interest rate cuts to stimulate struggling economies. And sentiment indicators from the United States, the euro zone and Britain could show further deterioration in consumer and business morale which may further dampen the spring rally. US crude oil rose as high as $135.09 a barrel last week, gaining more than 30 percent since early April. Headline-grabbing forecasts abound, with Goldman Sachs -- the most active investment bank in energy markets -- predicting oil could shoot up to $200 per barrel within the next two years and average $141 in the second half of 2008. Nevertheless, the main MSCI world equity index managed to hit a four-month high last week, coming close to the end-2007 level -- a break-even point for many investors. MSCI's emerging stock index set a 2008 high last week, recouping all losses made since the end of last year. "We've had a sizeable rally. But where I see the biggest problem is that fundamentals have not improved. There is this gap opening between hopes for a rebound in fundamentals and the real economy, which is worsening," said Philipp Bartschi, equity strategist at Swiss wealth manager Sarasin. "As commodity prices rise, everything which has a commodity-label is going up. Consumer-oriented markets are suffering. From a global market perspective, commodity-driven inflation is dampening growth prospects. It would be hard to go higher from here." Karen Olney, head of European equity strategy at Merrill Lynch, reckons equities still discount plenty of bad news even after the rally. Currently, they offer a six percent Equity Risk Premium -- an excess return over risk-free bonds -- and are still discounting a 25 percent fall in earnings. "It will be a bumpy ride from here, at least until we get through another six months of downgrades," she said. Next week's data offers an important update on price pressures surrounding the developed economies. U.S. core Personal Consumption Expenditure data -- the Federal Reserve's favourite measure of inflation -- is due on Thursday and the April PCE figures are out on Friday. Data due also include Germany's May consumer inflation, Japan's April consumer prices, Italy's producer and consumer prices and Canada's producer prices. Confidence data will be released from the United States, Italy, France, Britain and the euro zone throughout the week. "There is more risk appetite coming back into markets, partly backed up by the signal from the Fed ... that they are done for now," said Andrew Bosomworth, executive vice president for PIMCO Europe in Munich. "(Inflation) is everywhere you look. That's definitely the problem in developed markets as well as developing markets." BREAKEVENITIS: SWEATY PALMS AND TEMPTATIONS TO SELL Analysts at U.S.-based fund Fisher Investments are more determined that this is not the time for cashing out. "Whenever markets rebound from a sell-off, beware the looming contagion: Breakevenitis is a common affliction known to infect millions of investors each year," Fisher said in a note. "Symptoms include sweaty palms, indigestion and a tantalising temptation to sell securities as they reach their 'breakeven' point. Unfortunately, giving in to this temptation results in a truer sickness: portfolio underperformance." Barclays Capital's equity risk indicator shows the probability of an equity market sell-off has dipped to 65 percent, below the crisis levels that prevailed in late 2007. Analyst expectations of earnings have also improved in tandem with investor confidence. In May, upward revisions outnumbered downward revisions by 1.2 percent. "Looking at confidence indicators, perhaps it is not the time to pull out," said Sreekala Kochugovindan, asset allocation strategist at Barclays Capital. GROWING STAMPEDE This week -- a shorter one for Britain and the United States where markets are closed on Monday for a holiday -- also features a series of speeches from key central bank officials from the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. Norway's central bank is expected to keep interest rates steady at its policy meeting on Wednesday. Monetary policymakers especially in the euro zone could ratchet up their anti-inflation rhetoric in a market where investors are pricing in a more than a 50 percent chance of an interest rate hike by September. Indeed, commodities have proven the best portfolio harvest this year, returning 27.97 percent through May 20 -- a whopping 72.44 percent annualised return -- according to Lehman Brothers. And it's not just a short-term phenomenon. Since 2000, commodities turned a cumulative total return of 172.86 percent, compared with 60.27 percent for bonds and minus 5.38 percent for stocks. Commodities gave the average annual return of 13.65 percent, against 5.65 percent for bonds and 0.23 percent for stocks. "Equity and especially bond returns will be suppressed by the headwinds of this roaring commodity updraft," the bank said in a note to clients. "This macro Supercycle exhibits strong evidence of persistent stamina... The asset allocation move, more like growing stampede, into commodities by institutional and individual investors has hardly concluded.
