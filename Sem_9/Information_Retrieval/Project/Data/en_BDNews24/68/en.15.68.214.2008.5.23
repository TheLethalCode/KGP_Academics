 PARIS, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French fishermen battling for cheaper fuel ignored calls by the government to lift their blockades of ports on Friday and found new ways to disrupt traffic on land and at sea. The fishermen say they will go bust unless they obtain discounted diesel at 40 euro cents ($0.6) per liter as opposed to 80 euro cents on the market. The price of marine diesel has surged by 30 percent in the past four months. Fishermen have been blockading ports and fuel depots for more than a week and their protest has gradually escalated despite a government promise to provide 110 million euros ($173 million) in aid this year. The fishermen have dismissed the measure as insignificant. "What the grassroots want is to pay 40 cents a liter for diesel at the pump, nothing else will do," said David Bourrel, a fisherman from Paimpol in Brittany, just after a meeting with Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Michel Barnier in the region. Over 30 fishing boats left the northern port of Boulogne on Friday morning, sailing side by side and very slowly to impede traffic on one of the busiest shipping lines in the Channel. On the outskirts of Caen in Normandy, fishermen raided two fish wholesalers, throwing out all the supplies and damaging equipment. Late on Thursday, about 40 fishermen in Arcachon in the southwest had looted three supermarkets, distributing fish for free as part of the protest movement. Oil firm Total reported sporadic supply problems in some filling stations in the south of the country, where two fuel depots have been under siege for days. Authorities said the problems were mainly due to panic buying by motorists. EU CONSTRAINTS Barnier renewed his call for the protests to stop, promising that the government would not abandon the fishermen. "We will maintain our support, one way or another," Barnier said in an interview on television channel France 2 before traveling to Brittany to meet angry fishermen. The government does not have a free hand in the matter as direct state aid to a sector that competes with other European fishermen could fall foul of European Union regulations. Barnier has submitted a series of proposals to Brussels but the European Commission has yet to give its green light. "The Commission will not veto our aid because it is social in nature and aimed at individuals, it does not amount to supporting companies," Barnier said. "I need fishermen to resume work," he said, promising 40 million euros would be handed out by June 15. The fishing industry employs an estimated 24,000 people in France and provides an extra 70,000 jobs in related sectors. It is very difficult for fishermen to pass on the rising cost of diesel to consumers because they face stiff competition from importers, who provide 85 percent of French domestic fish consumption. Also, fresh fish is sold by auction so fishermen cannot control the price. Depleted fish stocks close to the coast and fishing quotas have compounded the fuel problem, forcing fishing boats to sail further and further out to sea.
