<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam called upon banks Thursday to adopt appropriate measures to protect depositors' interests. "Banks thrive on the depositors' funds, but none of them ever invited any of their clients to act as a member of its governing body," said the adviser, while inaugurating an online banking service of Al Arafah Islami Bank at the city's Sheraton Hotel. "The banks should supply their depositors with all the information they deserve to know." Mirza Aziz said both government and private banks fall short in providing adequate services to their clients, which must be addressed positively by ensuring better care. "Even clients of the most responsible and sensible banks complain about lack of proper service," he said. "One must keep it in mind that the image of an institution is created by what its chairman, directors and senior officials do and how they carry themselves while performing their duties and other activities," the finance adviser said. "Bangladesh Bank has undertaken a number of initiatives in the recent past to ensure good governance within banks and other financial institutions, and the banks must adhere to the central bank guidelines," he added. Among others present, chairman of Al Arafah Islami Bank, Md Anower Hossain, and managing director MA Samad also spoke on the occasion. bdnews2
