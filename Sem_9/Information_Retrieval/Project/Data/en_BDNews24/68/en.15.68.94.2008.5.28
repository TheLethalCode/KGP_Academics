 Dhaka, May 28 (bdews24.com) -- The Bangladesh National Football team were deprived of their preparatory match in Thailand ahead of the next month's SAFF Championship when their first warm-up match against Bangkok Glass Club Wednesday was abandoned following heavy rains in Bangkok. The match was washed out following heavy downpour 15 minutes after the game started, a message received from Bangladesh Football Federation said. Bangladesh will take on Bec Tero Sassana, the champions of the Thailand League, on Friday in their second and final warm-up match before heading for Sri Lanka on the same night. The 5th SAFF Championship is scheduled for June 3 to 14 in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Bangladesh will begin their SAFF campaign taking on lowly Bhutan on June 4 before facing surprising package Afghanistan on June 6. Bangladesh will square off hosts Sri Lanka on June 8. Before leaving here for Bangkok on Tuesday, the national footballers played only two warm-up matches at home -- one against the foreign footballers staying in Dhaka, and the other was against the former national players. The first match ended in a 1-1 draw, but the national booters defeated the local footballers 1-0 in the second one.
