 ISTANBUL, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey have set their sights on restoring national pride at Euro 2008 after the shocking descent which followed their impressive progress to the World Cup semi-finals six years ago. Despite boasting a talented squad, dreams of establishing themselves as a global footballing power were shattered by their failure to reach Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup in what proved to be painful circumstances. An unsightly post-match brawl in a playoff against Switzerland marred Turkey's ill-fated bid to qualify for Germany and resulted in severe FIFA sanctions. Two years earlier they had suffered a major upset in their Euro 2004 playoff defeat by unfancied Latvia. This time around, fears of another embarrassment galvanised the squad and they qualified from Group C in second place behind Greeceone point ahead of Norwayto huge national relief. Coach Fatih Terim, who led Galatasaray to UEFA Cup triumph as well as managing top Italian sides, now faces the challenge of carrying that renewed momentum into its games against the Czech Republic, Portugal and Switzerland in Group A. "Turkey were third in the world in 2002 and everybody expects a lot of the national team. But the European championships are harder than the World Cup," he said in a recent interview. "There is no such thing as a weak opponent". Turkey's hopes in the competition will be boosted by memories of their last appearance in 2000, when they reached the quarter-finals. The latest campaign will be spearheaded in attack by Villarreal's Nihat Kahveci, alongside Halil Altintop and the experienced Hakan Sukur. Fenerbahce's Semih Senturk, top league goalscorer this season, will add to the attacking threat. Germany-based Hamit Altintop and Yildiray Basturk will strengthen the midfield, which will also benefit from the pace of Tumer Metin and Arda Turan. Terim will also be hoping for a return to form for midfielder Emre Belozoglu and striker Tuncay Sanli, who have so far failed to reproduce in England the form which they have displayed at previous clubs
