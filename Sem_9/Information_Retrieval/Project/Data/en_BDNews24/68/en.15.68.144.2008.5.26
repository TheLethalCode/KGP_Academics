 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)The government has taken up two big rehabilitation programmes worth Tk 7,595 crore to make up for cyclone Sidr losses. The two projects are: a Tk 7,493 crore second primary education development project (PEDP-2) and a Tk 102 crore project for house construction for the landless Sidr-affected families. Under the PEDP-2 project, 398 primary schools will be constructed in 13 Sidr affected areas so that they could be used as cyclone centres. Under the house construction project, 1,000 houses would be built for 10,000 families. A meeting of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC), chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, approved 13 projects worth Tk 9,768 crore. After the meeting, planning secretary Jafar Ahmed Chowdhury told reporters: "The chief adviser urged completion of the work of the projects in time." "He has directed the secretaries to complete work by the deadline," Chowdhury said. Asked whether the chief adviser was happy at the pace of implementation of the annual development programme, Chowdhury said: "In the first 10 months (July-April) of the current fiscal year, 54 percent of ADP had been implemented. The chief adviser was not much happy about it." The CA stressed expediting ADP implementation in the remaining two months of the fiscal year. A Tk 25,500 crore ADP has been finalised for fiscal 2008-09. The ECNEC meeting on June 6 will approve the ADP. Chowdhury said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam would announce the new budget on June 9. bdnews
