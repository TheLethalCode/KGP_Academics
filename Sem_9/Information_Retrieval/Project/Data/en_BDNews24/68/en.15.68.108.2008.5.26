<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  The Communist Party of Bangladesh Monday placed a 26-point proposal on the table in its dialogue with the government Monday, including withdrawal of all bans on political activity under the current state of emergency. CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan said the government should withdraw all conditions imposed on politics and lift the state of emergency. The party also stressed the lifting of bans on trade union activities. "The dialogue was held in an open environment," Manzurul said, but added that the dialogue process should also include professionals, labourers, the business community and minorities so that a true democracy can be established. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said a separate dialogue with citizens at all levels of society would be held in parallel. CPB supported the government's anticorruption drive, adding: "We have asked the government to ensure justice so that no partiality takes place." The party recommended a balance of power. Zillur Rahman agreed with CPB. "Our main motto is to create check and balance," the adviser said. The government sat in dialogue with CPB in a two-hour session from 10am to noon Monday. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the government side at the dialogue, while CPB president Manzurul Ahsan Khan headed his party's delegation. The dialogue process began Thursday with the Workers Party of Bangladesh and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. The government sat with Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (Inu) on Sunday, and is scheduled to meet with the Liberal Democratic Party Monday afternoon. bdnews24.com/e
