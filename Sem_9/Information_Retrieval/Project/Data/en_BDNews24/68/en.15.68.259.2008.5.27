 Dhaka, May 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Tuesday announced a 14-member squad for the ensuing tri-nation one-day international series with a new face, pacer Dollar Mahmud. The tri-nation series involving India, Pakistan and hosts Bangladesh is scheduled for June 6 to 15 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. "We have given Dollar (Mahmud) a chance following his brilliant performance in the Under-19 World Cup squad and the academy team," chief selector Rafiqul Alam told reporters at a press conference Tuesday. The chief selector, however, said that Dollar was not considered first, but he got room following groin injury of pace duo Nazmul Hossain and Syed Rasel. The three-member selection committee also recalled wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, dropped for the series' against South Africa, Ireland and Pakistan, and middle order batsman Mehrab Hossain Junior. "We have excluded keeper Dhiman (Ghosh) for team combination as Mushfiq is a top-order batsman and Dhiman bats in the lower order," Rafique explained. Mushfiq is in superb form with scoring the highest 632 in 14 matches in the recently concluded premier cricket league. Asked why the committee considered Mehrab Hossain instead of experienced Alok Kapali, the chief selector said, "No doubt, Alok played very well this season, but he has been out of international cricket since the Twenty20 World Cup and Mehrab passed a fine time against South Africa and played superbly for the national academy team." Meanwhile, Alok scored 482 runs in 15 matches of the premier cricket league. The committee axed pacer Syed Rasel, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh, opener Junaed Siddique and Shakib Al Hasan, who pulled out of himself due to Higher Secondary Certificate exam, from the 15-member squad that toured Pakistan in April. About the exclusion of Junaed, Rafiqul said that Junaed was going in a bad patch in ODIs and they had given him a break at the moment. The selection committee also announced a 15-member squad for the Asia Cup with adding one more player, Mosharraf Hossain to the tri-nation squad. Squad for tri-nation series: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mahmudullah Riad, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Farhad Reza, Shahriar Nafees, Nazimuddin, Roqibul Hasan, Shahadat Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehrab Hossain Junior and Dollar Mahmud. Reserve players: Junaed Siddique, Dhiman Ghosh, Rubel Hossain, Alok Kapali and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. Squad for Asia Cup: Mohammad Ashraful, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Mahmudullah Riad, Tamim Iqbal, Aftab Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Farhad Reza, Shahriar Nafees, Nazimuddin, Roqibul Hasan, Shahadat Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Dollar Mahmud and Mosharraf Hossain Rubel. bdn
