<TITLE> Olmert coalition ally demands he step aside </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM Wed May 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called on Wednesday for Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to step aside or face the collapse of his coalition and an early election after damaging allegations of corruption. A day after an American businessman told an Israeli court how he handed Olmert envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars in cash, Barak held a news conference to lay out the position of his Labour party, the junior partner in Olmert's coalition. The political turmoil in Israel threatens to derail US efforts to secure an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal before President George W Bush steps down in January. "I do not think the prime minister can run, in parallel, the government and deal with his own personal affair," Barak said. "Therefore, out of a sense of what is good for the country and in accordance with the proper norms, I think the prime minister must disconnect himself from the daily running of the government. "He can do this in any of the ways open to him -- suspension, vacation or resignation or declaring himself incapacitated. We will not be the ones to determine this." Barak put the onus on Olmert's centrist Kadima party to seek a new leader to replace the prime minister: "If Kadima does not act and a new government is not formed during this current of session that is to our liking, we will act towards setting an agreed and early date for elections." A parliamentary election is not due until 2010. A defection by Labour would almost certainly force an early ballot. Polls indicate that the right-wing opposition Likud led by Benjamin Netanyahu could be the strongest party after any snap election
