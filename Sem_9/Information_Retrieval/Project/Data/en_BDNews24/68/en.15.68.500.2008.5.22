<TITLE> Switzerland coach Kuhn in search of happy ending </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERNE, Switzerland, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn knows he will face huge expectations when the Euro 2008 co-hosts kick off the tournament on June 7, having himself played a considerable part in building up the country's hopes. Kuhn, 64, is due to retire following the tournament and has already established himself - statistically at least - as Switzerland's most successful coach after becoming the first to lead the national team to three successive major tournaments. As part of his application for the job back in 2001, Kuhn handed the football association an outline for the development of the national game headlined "European Champions 2008". After that ambitious title was leaked to the media, Kuhn has repeatedly insisted that he wanted to build a team capable of winning the title, but never said they would actually do so. Still, anything less than a place in the quarter-finals would be seen by many Swiss fans as a disappointing end to the steady progress made under Kuhn's stewardship. Already well known to Swiss soccer fans as one of the most gifted midfielders to represent the country, Kuhn won 64 international caps, including two appearances at the 1966 World Cup. At club level he won six Swiss league titles, five Swiss Cup wins and made two appearances in the European Cup semi-finals  without ever leaving his local side FC Zurich. SURPRISE CHOICE His progression into coaching came much later, after a failed attempt to make a career in insurance, and he was in his early 50s before passing his trainer exams. Even after a successful spell as coach of the national under-21 side, Kuhn was a surprise choice for the top job in 2001 and was selected only after the association's main candidate Ottmar Hitzfeld turned down the offer. After a somewhat difficult start, though, Kuhn built up a successful team, relying heavily on the youngsters he had worked with at under-21 level. Leaving much of the team's tactical analysis work to assistant Michel Pont, Kuhn has concentrated on fostering a sense of "family" within his squad and at their tight-knit best the Swiss have certainly proven hard to break down. Highlights such as the qualifications for Euro 2004 and the 2006 World Cup - reached via an ugly play-off encounter with Turkey - have been offset however by accusations of occasional amateurism. The mishandling of Alex Frei's spitting incident, leading to the team's top scorer being sent home early from Euro 2004, and the apparent lack of any penalty practice before the World Cup exit in a shootout against Ukraine each saw Kuhn accused of naivety. There have also been much-publicised spats within his supposed 'family', most recently with last year's controversial axing of World Cup captain Johann Vogel. Kuhn's inability to come up with any positive ideas following a 4-0 friendly mauling by Germany in March has also caused some head-shaking in the country that voted him "Swiss of the Year" at the end of 2006. Known for his laid-back, almost cool, handling of media questions, Kuhn will now have to provide those answers on the pitch if he is to end his career with anything more than a whimper. After finally being talked round by the Swiss FA, Hitzfeld is waiting to take over in July, and only the results of Euro 2008 will really show if Kuhn is a hard act to follow
