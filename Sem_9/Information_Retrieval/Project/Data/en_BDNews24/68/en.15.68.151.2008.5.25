 HARARE, Sun May 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Robert Mugabe has changed his campaign strategy ahead of the June 27 presidential run-off, opting for voter canvassing and small village meetings, a senior official said. Mugabe has tended to make mass rallies the focus of his election bids since assuming power in 1980. The strategy backfired in the March 29 presidential poll when opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai outpolled the Zimbabwean leader. The two will face off in a second ballot next month because Tsvangirai failed to win an absolute majority. Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) draws much of its backing from the capital Harare and other cities. Offsetting that urban support is one of the keys to victory for Mugabe, who has seen his popularity plunge amid an economic meltdown that critics blame on his mismanagement. His government says Western sabotage is responsible for the problems. But the 84-year-old ruler is still admired by millions in Zimbabwe and elsewhere in Africa for spearheading the battle to end British colonial rule in Zimbabwe. A grassroots campaign could re-ignite support for the liberation era hero. Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa said the new campaign style, which Mugabe would kick off later on Sunday would pave the way for his re-election. "The machinery has been well oiled and (is) ready to win the June 27 presidential run-off," Chinamasa was quoted as saying by the state-controlled Sunday Mail newspaper. Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party lost control of parliament in the March 29 poll for the first time since it came to power. COMPLACENT Chinamasa and other ZANU-PF officials concede that they were complacent ahead of the elections, which allowed Tsvangirai's MDC an opening, including in rural areas where Mugabe has been traditionally strong. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai has kicked off his run-off campaign after returning to Zimbabwe on Saturday for the first time since early April. The MDC leader has been traveling to galvanize support in Africa and overseas for his bid to unseat Mugabe. Tsvangirai cancelled his homecoming a week ago after his party said it had learnt he was the target of an assassination plot by Zimbabwe's military intelligence. The government dismissed the plot as a propaganda stunt. He, too, has expressed confidence ahead of the run-off despite raising concerns that post-election violence threatened to taint the vote and that the final result could be rigged by election officials. "What we want is a complete demilitarization of the situation," Tsvangirai said at a press conference on Saturday. The MDC says dozens of its supporters have been beaten and killed in an intimidation campaign orchestrated by the ZANU-PF, which in turn accuses the MDC of being responsible for the violence. The government also says the MDC are Western puppets. The Southern African Development Community, which is due to monitor the run-off, said this month that conditions were neither safe nor fair yet for a fresh vote. SADC is due to hold a meeting on Tuesday to discuss preparations for the election. Zimbabweans hope the run-off will bring recovery from the current crisis. Zimbabwe is struggling with inflation of 165,000 percent, 80 percent unemployment and chronic food and fuel shortages. Millions have fled to nearby countries
