 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)  Higher Secondary Certificate and equivalent examinations under nine education boards are set to begin Thursday. More than 6.20 lakh students signed up for the exams under seven education boards, a madrasa education board and technical board, up from 5.41 lakh of the 2007 exams. Among the examinees, 5.02 lakh were registered for exams under the seven education boards, 62,505 for Alim exams under the madrasa board and 54,719 under the technical board. Prof Manirul Islam, chairman of the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education for Dhaka, told a press conference in his office Wednesday that the examinations would be held in 1,800 centres. "Regular and irregular" candidates under Dhaka board total 1,51,247 this year. Under the board, 1,46,912 students had enrolled for HSC in the 2006-07 session but 1,18,498 of them or 80.66 percent signed up for exams. On why 19.34 percent of students failed to register for exams, Prof Manirul Islam blamed students' failure in "tests". Wedding, fund crunch, involvement in politics and addiction to narcotics were also among the reasons for dropouts. bdnews
