 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com) Hasina Akter from Araihazar in Narayanganj is a victim of a gruesome acid attack. She was attacked with acid in 2004 for her refusal to enter an affair she did not want to. "Society blamed me." Hasina, 25, was speaking at a ceremony titled "Fund Rising for Acid Victims and Award for SME Entrepreneurs" at Gulshan Club. "Acid Survivors Foundation helped me retain my courage following the dastardly attack that burnt my entire face," she says. Hasina survived with the left eye and forehead unaffected. Hasina, in a trembling voice, says: "Please stay beside us. This is all I want from you. If you come up, our sisters or mothers won't fall victim to acid crimes." The Women Entrepreneurs Association of Bangladesh (WEAB) organised the programme in partnership with bdnews24.com to raise funds for acid victims of the Sidr-hit areas by selling artworks of various artists as well as products manufactured by small entrepreneurs. WEAB president Nasreen Awal Mintoo awarded seven women entrepreneurs: Manoprova Odhikari of Barisal, Keme Rakhain of Cox's Bazar, Khaleda Ahmad of Dhaka, Saleha Begum Sheli of Feni, Mamtaz Begum of Kurigram, Bibi Rahima of Noakhali and Anita Dasgupta of Sylhet. Nasreen said the awards were meant to encourage women into entrepreneurship. Home secretary Abdul Karim who attended the event as chief guest stressed the need for strengthening the role of police in preventing acid attacks. The government has made a set of rules prescribing stern punishment to the people involved in acid crimes, he said. "Many cases related to acid were scrapped due to a lack of witnesses," Karim said. bdnew
