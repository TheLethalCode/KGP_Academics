 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)  Police have arrested former army chief Mustafizur Rahman, now under care of Apollo Hospital, on charges of his involvement in the MiG-29 scam, a police officer said Sunday. "The former army chief has been shown arrested in the case," Badda police chief Syed Mominul Ahsan told bdnews24.com. On May 20, Dhaka divisional judge Golam Mortuza Mojumder issued an arrest warrant against Mustafiz in the case after revoking his bail. The case involves the purchase of eight MiG-29 war planes during Sheikh Hasina's term as prime minister. Mustafiz could not attend the court that day as he was ill. The now defunct Bureau of Anticorruption filed the case against Hasina and six others on Dec 11, 2001, with Tejgaon Police Station alleging misconduct in the purchase of the war planes. The case details said the government had incurred losses to the tune of Tk 700 crore due to the contentious purchase in 1999. Hasina made an appeal to the High Court in 2003 to cancel the case, which was rejected. bdnew
