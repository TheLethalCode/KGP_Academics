 Dhaka, May 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Workers Party of Bangladesh demanded the immediate withdrawal of the state of emergency, for the sake of a fair and transparent election, in formal talks with the government Thursday. A two-hour meeting between the government and WPB marked the start of the formal dialogue with political parties. WPB has also asked the government to make necessary arrangements for detained Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and AL general secretary Abdul Jalil to take part in the dialogue process. "The government has said it will take all required steps to ensure the participation of all political parties in the dialogue," party president Rashed Khan Menon told reporters Thursday after the dialogue. "The dialogue will be meaningful and effective only with the participation of all parties, the government has said," Menon added. "We have asked the government to reinforce democratic rights by lifting the emergency immediately for a congenial atmosphere for the polls and for the democratic process." "We have proposed withdrawing ban on trade union and all direct and indirect control and interference on all kinds of professions including the print and electronic media," Menon added. Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, one of the advisers in Thursday's meeting said: "We have had a fine dialogue." Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led four of the advisers who held pre-dialogue talks with the political parties, in the meeting with Workers Party of Bangladesh from 10 am to midday. Rashed Khan Menon led the seven-member WPB delegation. Bikalpadhara Bangladesh will be the next party to sit with the government at 4 pm. Political leaders and advisers will brief reporters after each meeting. With political parties demanding direct meetings with the chief adviser, five advisers held informal talks in April leading up to the formal dialogue -- law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, communications adviser Ghulam Quader, LGRD adviser Anwarul Iqbal, foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman. Fakhruddin in an address to the nation on May 12 hoped that national unity would be achieved on every important issue through the dialogue. bdnews24.com/a
