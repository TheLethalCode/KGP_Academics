 MOSCOW, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes broke his nose in Wednesday's Champions League final against Chelsea but played through the pain barrier to win the medal he missed out on nine years ago. Scholes was injured in a first-half collision with Chelsea's Claude Makelele that saw both players yellow carded by Slovak referee Lubos Michel with Scholes bloodied, bruised and needing treatment from the physios before he rejoined the action. "When he came off at halftime he was very groggy and needed some tablets before going back on for the second half," said manager Alex Ferguson. "Tonight he got what he should have got in 1999a winner's medal." Back then Scholes had to celebrate United's victory from the sidelines after being suspended for the final against Bayern Munich in Barcelona. This time Ferguson said Scholes's name would be the first on the team sheet for the final after his scorching shot at Old Trafford gave United a 1-0 win over Barcelona in the second leg of the semi-final and secured their place in Moscow. United's victory completes a belated full set of major honours for Scholes, the quiet man from Oldham who joined United as a 13-year-old around the same time as Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt. "Paul Scholes has been a fantastic player for Manchester United for all these years and I am delighted for him," Ferguson added
