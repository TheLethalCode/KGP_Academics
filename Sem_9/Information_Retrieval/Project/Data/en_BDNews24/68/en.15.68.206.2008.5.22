<TITLE> Hickersberger aims to leave Austria's lows behind </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VIENNA, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former Austria midfielder now in his second spell as coach, Josef Hickersberger has already experienced more highs and lows than most of his predecessors. He scored five goals in 39 internationals and is still remembered for his involvement in Austria's shock 3-2 win over world champions Germany at the 1978 World Cup. Taking over as coach for the first time in 1988 after a year in charge of the Under-21s, Hickersberger enjoyed initial success, notably in steering Austria to the 1990 World Cup finals. The euphoria fizzled out quickly, though, as Hickersberger's men suffered three straight group stage defeats. Much worse followed three months later when Austria began their Euro 92 qualifying campaign with a 1-0 defeat by the tiny Faroe Islands, who were playing their first competitive match. Frequently cited as the worst result in the country's sporting history, the shock defeat saw Hickersberger instantly tagged "Faroe Pepi" (Pepi being a diminutive name for Josef). He stepped down shortly afterwards. His route back to the job was circuitous, involving stops at Duesseldorf and Austria Vienna followed by a two-year time-out and a move to the Middle East to coach clubs in Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. Returning to his homeland to take over at Rapid Vienna in 2002, he started to put the Faroe Island nickname behind him when he led the club to the 2005 league title and a surprise qualification for the Champions League. With Austria in the doldrums after four successive failures to qualify for either the World Cup or European championship, Hickersberger's decision to return to the post at the start of 2006 was certainly a gamble. He has also not lacked courage in his determination to rejuvenate the team, bringing in several promising youngsters at the expense of the country's most experienced players. Unfortunately for Hickersberger, his young team have not yet been able to repay his faith in terms of actual results. Austria have won just four times in 22 matches since his return and only once in the last 14 matches. A nine-game winless streak in 2007 saw Austria equal their longest sequence without a victory and unsurprisingly saw fans calling for Hickersberger to step down for a second time. He has refused to go, describing the chance to coach Austria at a Euro 2008 on home soil as "the highlight of my career". A closer look at some of the team's more recent performances also suggest signs of improvement. Despite a 3-0 home defeat by Germany in a February friendly, Austria were far the better side in the first half and in March they took a 3-0 lead against Netherlands before losing 4-3. They will have to be at their best for more than just 45 minutes to get anything from Euro 2008 and Hickersberger knows his fate rests on a creditable performance in June. If he gets his wish to stay on after the tournament, Hickersberger will face an interesting reunion in October when Austria play a World Cup qualifier against the Faroe Islands
