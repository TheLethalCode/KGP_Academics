<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Ricky Pointing struck an outstanding 158 as Australia dominated West Indies to finish at 301 for four on the opening day of the first test. A day that began full of hope for the hosts, with Fidel Edwards dismissing both openers cheaply, ended with Australia firmly in control and looking capable of making a large first innings total on a decent track. At stumps Brad Hodge was unbeaten on 53 alongside nightwatchman Mitchell Johnson (1). The West Indian bowlers stuck at their task but they began to toil in the Sabina Park sun against Ponting as he made his 35th test century displaying all his experience, skill and concentration. The Tasmanian, who scored 140 in his last test appearance, against India back in January, may have been playing one-day and Twenty20 cricket for the past three months but he looked instantly at ease in the Kingston test. That was hardly surprising given the 33-year-old's record in the Caribbean -- this was the fourth successive test match in the region in which he has made a century. Ponting was ably assisted by Michael Hussey and Hodge as he took Australia away from a stuttering start at 37 for two. It took a brilliant one-handed catch by Brenton Parchment at square leg as Ponting pulled Dwayne Bravo to end the Australian captain's presence at the crease 11 minutes from the close. He had taken his guard with some consternation after Barbadian Edwards, getting movement and bounce out of the track, caused plenty of problems early on with his slingy action. KATICH RETURNS After Ponting chose to bat, Simon Katich, returning to test cricket after an almost three-year absence, flashed Edwards to Darren Sammy at wide gulley in the fourth over to depart for 12. Then Phil Jaques was trapped lbw for nine, caught at the crease by a rising delivery from the Barbados quickie with Australia on 37 for two. However, Ponting and his vice-captain in this test Hussey settled in and put on 50 before lunch without looking troubled and then ground down the West Indies attack in the afternoon session by batting prudently but punishing the loose ball. By the time Hussey went they had put on a 137-run partnership which changed the momentum of the day's play. Hussey had been cautious -- his 56 runs came off 146 balls -- but his presence was invaluable as support to Ponting who gave a lesson in how to wait for the loose ball and punish it. Although West Indies, without injured pace bowler Jerome Taylor, lacked penetration, stand-in skipper Ramnaresh Sarwan will take some comfort from the fact that his bowlers and fielders kept their discipline. Hussey was brilliantly caught by Dwayne Bravo at slip from off-spinner Amit Jaggernauth. Bravo, moving away from the ball, switched direction to take a super one-handed reflex catch for debutant Jaggernauth's first wicket in test cricket. In came Hodge, called up to replace Michael Clarke who is on compassionate leave, and he continued to provide Ponting with a reliable partner as they made a 119 stand. Australia were also without the injured Matthew Hayden while West Indies captain and opening batsman Chris Gayle was ruled out with a groin injur
