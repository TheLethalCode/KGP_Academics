 Dhaka, May 26 (bdnews24.com)  An optical fibre submarine communications cable system, SEA-ME-WE 4, snapped off Singapore Monday, slightly disrupting internet services in Bangladesh, an official said. The cable got cut off sometime between 9.00am and 9.30am near Singapore, about 46 kilometres from Singapore Landing Station, Rizwan Ali, general manager of Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board, told bdnews24.com. "Repair work started and the line will be back on soon," Ali said. The cable carries telecommunications between Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt, Italy, Tunisia, Algeria and France. A January 30 breakdown in an international undersea cable network near Alexandria in Egypt disrupted Internet links in a large swathe of Asia. bdnews
