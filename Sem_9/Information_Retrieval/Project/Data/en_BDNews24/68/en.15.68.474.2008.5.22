 KINGSTON, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia opening batsman Matthew Hayden has been ruled out of Thursday's first test against West Indies at Sabina Park with an Achilles tendon injury, a team spokesman said. Australia were already without vice-captain Michael Clarke, who was granted leave to attend the funeral of his fiancee's father. Simon Katich, returning to tests after nearly a three-year absence, will now open along with Phil Jaques. Brad Hodge, recalled as cover for Clarke, will come into the side at number five, the spokesman said. Hayden, who has played 94 tests, missed the weekend's tour match against a Jamaica XI due to the injury. Australia will play three tests, five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 game against West Indies
