<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul, given the all-clear after a brain scan, revealed the drama of being struck on the head by a bouncer from bowler Brett Lee during a brave century against Australia. Chanderpaul was struck down during the third day of the first test on Saturday but pressed on and was taken to hospital for the scan following the close of play. A West Indies spokesman said no damage had been shown by the scan and that while Chanderpaul would likely skip fielding duties on Sunday he would definitely be able to bat in West Indies' second innings. The left-hander collapsed to the floor and lay motionless for several minutes, with his wife watching anxiously from the stands, before he received medical treatment and stood up to continue his innings. The Guyanese batsman was on 86 at the time and went on to make 118, earning a standing ovation from the Sabina Park crowd and helping revive West Indies' chances in the test. "When I went down I did not know where I was," said Chanderpaul. "My entire body went numb, I could not move my hands and I could not move my feet. "I was down but when I found myself I decided to get up and continue the fight. I was in pain, it was hurting. I was down but not out," said the batsman. "I told myself that if I left the field we would have been in a bad state in this match and I did not want to leave at that stage. I knew I had a job to do and I told myself I had to stay around and take control for the team. "It was one of my best innings. I was happy to pull through and get a major score and keep the team's hopes alive. I like the way the team has been fighting and the positive attitude we have in the camp," he added. West Indies made 312 all out, 119 runs short of Australia's first innings total of 431 but then made a dramatic fightback with the ball in the last hour skittling Australia's top four batsmen, including captain Ricky Ponting, for 17 runs
