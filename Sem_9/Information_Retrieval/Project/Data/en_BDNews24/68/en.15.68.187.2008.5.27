 KINGSTON, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There are two major questions requiring an answer from Australia's tour of the Caribbean - are Ricky Ponting's team finally fading? And are West Indies at last returning to the standards expected of them? After Australia won the first test at Sabina Park by 95 runs on Monday the early answer to both questions is - not quite yet. Certainly there were indications that Australia, having lost so many key players in the past two years, is losing the air of omnipotence that has surrounded them. They were reduced to 18 for five in their second innings - their worst start, for the loss of five wickets, since 1936 and a sign their upper order is by no means guaranteed to score runs. It should, however, not be forgotten the tourists were without Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden - both of whom are likely to start in the second test in Antigua. They will bring reassuring experience to the top order while the middle order looks to be benefiting from the emergence of Andrew Symonds as a more mature and controlled batsman. Symonds, always a handy one-day hitter, looked rock solid in both his innings (70 not out and 79) and ensured there was a resilience to the Australian batting. On the bowling front, Stuart Clark shone with eight wickets in the match, five of them in a match-winning second innings display, and has emerged as the ideal replacement for Glenn McGrath. Brett Lee was his usual aggressive self and worked well in tandem with Clark, but leg-spinner Stuart MacGill, returning after a hand operation, looked rusty in bowling far too many loose balls and giving ammunition to those who worry about Australia's slow bowling in the post-Shane Warne era. For the hosts, there were some real signs of improvement but also some familiar failings. On the plus side, the fielding was outstanding and Fidel Edwards and Daren Powell produced a superb spell of fast bowling on Saturday to have Australia rocking. The return of Jerome Taylor in Antigua will give West Indies a genuinely world class pace trio. With Dwayne Bravo's medium-quick to mix it up and Darren Sammy as the stock bowler the seam bowling department is well taken care of. Spinner Amit Jaggernauth did not do enough on his test debut to keep his place for the second test and it remains to be seen if the selectors opt to give slow left-armer Sulieman Benn an opportunity or stick with a seam attack. Runako Morton impressed with a sensible first innings 67 and Shivnarine Chanderpaul's battling century was a reminder of his quality but the first innings middle-order slump and the front line batsmen's struggles in the second highlighted their continuing lack of consistency. Devon Smith and Brenton Parchment will have to perform better in Antigua if their roles are to be confirmed and the questions over the depth of West Indian batting answered
