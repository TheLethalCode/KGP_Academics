"The Chinese government has submitted a new request regarding provision of relief materials as well as transportation means, including that possibly to be extended by the SDF," said Hiroshi Suzuki, the ministry's deputy spokesman. Japan refers to its military as "Self-Defence Forces" (SDF). Kyodo news agency said China had sounded out Tokyo about sending military planes to the quake-stricken area. Sino-Japanese ties chilled during Junichiro Koizumi's 2001-2006 term as Japan's prime minister over his visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni war shrine, seen by critics as an offensive symbol of wartime misdeeds.
