 ROME, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti has targeted Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o or Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor as potential close-season signings. Palermo striker Amauri is also an option, although the Brazilian appears close to signing for Serie A rivals Juventus. "One of the four. They are all perfect," Ancelotti told Thursday's La Gazzetta dello Sport when asked about his plans to strengthen his attack before next season. "They are centre forwards with the characteristics needed to solve our problems. We need flexible forwards who can help the squad in defence too." Milan will be desperate to improve next season after finishing fifth in Serie A this term and failing to qualify for the Champions League. Ancelotti indicated he would bring six or seven new signings to the San Siro. "That's how things will be because some players will quit and there is a need for replacements," he said. "But it won't be a revolution. The foundation is solid and we'll build the Milan of the future on it." Ancelotti refused to comment on whether Brazilian Ronaldinho remained a target following stop-start negotiations with the Barcelona forward. "He's a great champion and Milan always looks at champions," he said. "But whether he's coming is not a question to ask me.
