<TITLE> No dialogue without Hasina, AL to notify govt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 28 (bdnews24.com)The Awami League will notify the chief adviser officially in a day or two of its decision to boycott the ongoing political dialogue in the absence of detained party president Sheikh Hasina, said a senior AL leader Wednesday. Corrected "Only if Sheikh Hasina is freed unconditionally will the AL executive council meet under her leadership and decide the issue of joining the dialogue," the party's acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said, as a two-day meeting of the Awami League Central Working Committee wrapped up Wednesday. Trashing the idea of releasing Hasina on parole to attend the dialogue, Ashraf said: "We want a free Hasina to lead us to the dialogue." The ALCWC meeting also announced a countrywide mass signature campaign to be conducted from June 7 through June 30 demanding Hasina's unconditional release. The ALCWC decided Tuesday not to join government dialogue without their party chief, a move likely to put a question mark on ongoing political talks. The meeting also endorsed most other recommendations made by district AL leaders at the party's crucial extended meeting on Monday. bdnews24.c
