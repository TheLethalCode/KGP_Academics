<TITLE> Ponting praises five-wicket Clark after victory </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KINGSTON, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia captain Ricky Ponting praised Stuart Clark for his part in an 'unrelenting' display after he took five wickets in the dismissal of West Indies for 191 on the final day of the first test for a 95-run victory. Clark returned his best test figures of five for 32 and, with Brett Lee also in impressive form, West Indies were unable seriously to assault their target of 287. Ponting said that the often under-regarded Clark had proved once again that he was a vital part of the Australia team. "How could you not admire what he's done? He's averaged around 20 in 125 or so test matches, that's a really great achievement, especially when he hasn't bowled with the new ball on a lot of those occasions," Ponting told reporters after the game. "And we're playing on a lot of wickets, like we are here, where you just have to probably go against what you do in Australia and find different ways of working batsmen over and getting them out." "He's been the guy a bit like Glenn (McGrath) was when he was in the side, whatever the situation required, you know that he'll come in and get the job done for you. He'll give you what is expected and what the team requires," he said. Ponting said he was pleased with the way his side went about the final day. "I think today we were just unrelenting. We didn't give them any opportunity to get themselves back in the game. "That is great re-enforcement for our group going in to the next game because the Antiguan wicket could be pretty slow and low going on the World Cup games that we've played there. So we've now shown ourselves the way to go about playing test cricket again," he said. Clark said that the Australian approach with the ball on Monday was to frustrate West Indies. "It was not the wicket we were going to blast them out on. We had to be really patient and really boring. "Stopping them from scoring was always going to be our biggest weapon, as soon as they felt where are they going to get their next run from, we were well and truly in the game then. "It's always nice to get a few wickets. It re-enforces to me and all the bowlers that we can be successful on these types of wickets, we don't just need the pace and bounce of Australia.
