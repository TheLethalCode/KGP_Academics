<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, May 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's James Anderson said he would continue his short-pitched bowling tactic against New Zealand in the second test despite leaving Daniel Flynn requiring immediate dental attention on Friday. "When you hit someone on the head it encourages bowlers to do it again," Anderson told reporters after Flynn retired hurt. The batsman missed a hook shot and was spitting blood when his helmet grille bent into his mouth and dislodged a front tooth. Jacob Oram was struck on the head shortly after. "Certainly with Oram we thought it was a weakness," added Anderson, "he did not look that comfortable so we will keep doing it. We do look at the bouncer as an attacking option, especially against the Kiwis." A New Zealand team spokesman said Flynn, who will bat on day two, was having cosmetic dental work from two specialists, adding the tooth was not totally removed but broken at the root. New Zealand closed on 202 for four after bad light allowed just 54 overs in the day, but at 136 for four and with Flynn having retired, England looked as if they might take control. BEST WAY Anderson had toiled without success in the morning but bowled with menace after lunch. "The ball did not swing that much as it was quite cold and conditions were not conducive so when I got the end with the wind I decided to test out the middle of the pitch and I enjoyed it," said the paceman. "We were trying to get their wickets so that seemed to be the best way as the pitch was not doing a great deal. It worked well for a while and we could have got a couple more in that spell." Anderson, enjoying a run in the team ahead of experienced bowlers Matthew Hoggard and Steve Harmison, remembers there being "blood everywhere" after Flynn was hit but said it was "just a part of the game". "I went up to him as soon as it hit him and asked if he was alright but I didn't get a reply. I have hit people on the head before but not with teeth to show for it," he added. "It's one of those things, I am trying to get him out and make it as uncomfortable for him as possible. People do get hit." Anderson also struck Indian batting champion Sachin Tendulkar on the helmet at Trent Bridge last yea
