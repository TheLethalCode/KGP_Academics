 Dhaka, May 25 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal sat in dialogue with the government Sunday, despite some misgivings over the dialogue process recently aired by the party's president. Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to the chief adviser, told bdnews24.com that the session started at 3pm as scheduled. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed led the government side, with JSD president Hasanul Huq Inu heading his party's delegation. Earlier in the week, Inu had said: "We are sceptical about the outcome of the dialogue, and we don't quite trust everybody there, but we're going to attend the talks." He also urged the Awami League to participate in the forthcoming dialogue with the government to "help in electing a democratic government in December and save the nation from its present uncertainties". The awaited dialogue process began Thursday as the government sat separately with the Workers Party of Bangladesh and Bikalpadhara Bangladesh. The government is scheduled to sit Monday with the Communist Party of Bangladesh and the Liberal Democratic Party. bdnews24.co
