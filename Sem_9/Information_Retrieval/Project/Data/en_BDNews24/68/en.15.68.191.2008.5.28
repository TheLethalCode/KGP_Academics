 TIGNES, France, May 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bafetimbi Gomis earned a place in France's final 23-man squad for Euro 2008 on Wednesday, a day after celebrating his first cap with two goals in a 2-0 warm-up win over Ecuador. Coach Raymond Domenech, who had to cross out seven names from a provisional list of 30 players announced earlier this month, decided to keep the 22-year-old St Etienne forward. Gomis had been expected to be dropped until he became the first player to score twice on his France debut since Zinedine Zidane in a 2-2 draw with the Czech Republic in 1994. Domenech went for Gomis instead of Olympique Marseille's Djibril Cisse. The two men both scored 16 Ligue 1 goals this season and Gomis came on for Cisse for the second half of Tuesday's game in Grenoble. Defenders Philippe Mexes and Julien Escude, midfielders Alou Diarra and Mathieu Flamini, forward Hatem Ben Arfa and reserve goalkeeper Mickael Landreau are the other casualties. "I don't want to make comments about a player or another but I want to say my feelings," Domenech told a news conference in this French Alps resort where France traditionally hold their training camp before major events. "This was the toughest moment of my career as France coach," he added, holding back tears. UNLUCKY SEVEN "We went to each player's room and had to knock on the door with the verdict," Domenech told. "When the seven left the hotel, all the other players were in the lobby to express their support. It was a difficult moment and a strong one as well." Two helicopters then landed and were boarded by the unlucky seven. The most prominent absentee from the 30-man list was Juventus marksman David Trezeguet, with whom Domenech has a difficult relationship. Domenech's final choice was particularly harsh on Cisse, who missed the 2006 World Cup after sustaining a leg fracture in a warm-up game. The France squad is a blend between seasoned warriors and exciting youngsters, among them Olympique Lyon striker Karim Benzema and Marseille forward Samir Nasri, both 20. The 2006 World Cup runners-up are in Group C with world champions Italy, Netherlands and Romania at the June 7-29 Euro 2008 finals in Austria and Switzerland. Squad: Goalkeepers: Gregory Coupet (Olympique Lyon), Sebastien Frey (Fiorentina), Steve Mandanda (Olympique Marseille). Defenders: Eric Abidal (Barcelona), Jean-Alain Boumsong (Lyon), Francois Clerc (Olympique Lyon), Sebastien Squillaci (Olympique Lyon), William Gallas (Arsenal), Patrice Evra (Manchester United), Willy Sagnol (Bayern Munich), Lilian Thuram (Barcelona). Midfielders: Lassana Diarra (Portsmouth), Claude Makelele (Chelsea), Jeremy Toulalan (Olympique Lyon), Patrick Vieira (Inter Milan). Forwards: Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea), Karim Benzema (Olympique Lyon), Sidney Govou (Olympique Lyon), Samir Nasri (Olympique Marseille), Bafetimbi Gomis (St Etienne), Thierry Henry (Barcelona), Florent Malouda (Chelsea), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich)
