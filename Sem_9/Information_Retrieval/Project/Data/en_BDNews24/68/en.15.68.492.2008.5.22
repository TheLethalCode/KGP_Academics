<TEXT>
 ROME, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fourth consecutive Italian Cup final between Inter Milan and AS Roma on Saturday (1900 GMT) gives Serie A champions Inter the chance to win the double having been denied that honour by Roma last season. The final at Rome's Stadio Olimpico, no longer the two-legged tie it was until last year, is being played amid speculation that it will be Roberto Mancini's last game in charge of Inter. The coach has fuelled the rumours by making no public comment since Inter clinched their third consecutive Serie A title under Mancini on Sunday. Mancini's agent said on Tuesday the coach is staying at Inter next season. But the speculation that Mancini is heading to Chelsea with the London club's former boss Jose Mourinho taking his place in the Inter dugout is set to continue until the silence is broken. The 43-year-old's future has been in doubt since he said he would quit at the end of the season after Inter's Champions League defeat by Liverpool in March only to make a quick U-turn. Roma will be motivated to retain the Cup after Inter beat them to the championship for the second consecutive year. They also want to have something to show for the attractive football they have served up all year. Captain Francesco Totti is out until next season after having surgery on a knee injury, so in-form Montenegro international Mirko Vucinic is set to take his place in attack again. Inter cannot field suspended defender Marco Materazzi and Argentine striker Julio Cruz. Midfielder Esteban Cambiasso and defender Cristian Chivu are injury doubts but Sweden forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic is available after returning from a knee injury to score the double that wrapped up the title in a 2-0 win at Parma on Sunday. The two-leg formula for the final was dropped in favour of a single match and the Stadio Olimpico was chosen earlier in the seasonlong before Roma reached this stage. Roma beat Inter 7-4 on aggregate last season, with Inter triumphing the previous two years. The Roman outfit are trying to match Juventus's record of nine Cup victories, while Mancini is seeking to add to his impressive personal record in the competition. He won the Italian Cup six times as a player, four times with Sampdoria and twice with Lazio, and has lifted it four times as a coach with Fiorentina, Lazio and twice with Inter
