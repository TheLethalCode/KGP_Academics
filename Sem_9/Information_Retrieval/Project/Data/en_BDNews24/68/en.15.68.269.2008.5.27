 NAPLES, Tue May 27, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A judge in Naples has ordered 25 people, including employees at units of construction company Impregilo, to be put under house arrest for alleged irregularities in waste management activities in southern Italy.

Court sources said the arrest orders were for about 10 executives and employees of companies controlled by Impregilo which managed waste disposal in the Campania region. Lawyers for the Impregilo units said they had not yet been notified of the arrest orders. The company itself was not immediately available for comment. Impregilo stock, which has gained since Berlusconi's April election victory on his promises of higher infrastructure spending, was down by 5.14 percent to 4.04 euros by 9:59 a.m. EDT.
