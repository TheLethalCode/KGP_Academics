 MANCHESTER, England, May 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand reached 180 for four when light rain stopped play and brought tea forward by 25 minutes on the first day of the second test at Old Trafford on Friday. The tourists recovered well from the loss of two wickets after lunch and the retirement of Daniel Flynn, who was struck in the mouth by a James Anderson bouncer. Ross Taylor was 57 not out at tea and Jacob Oram had 10. Opener Jamie How was first to depart in the afternoon session when he edged a perfect leg-cutter from Anderson to wicketkeeper Tim Ambrose for 64. Three overs later the hard-hitting Brendon McCullum was caught at slip by Paul Collingwood off spinner Monty Panesar for 11, after a deflection off the wicketkeeper's glove. McCullum had begun the over with a four and a six over midwicket. At 136-4, Flynn missed his hook shot to a quick bouncer from Anderson and the ball cannoned into his mouth via the grille of his helmet. He immediately fell to the floor, spitting blood and was forced to retire on four visibly missing a tooth. His replacement Oram was equally uncomfortable against Anderson and was struck on the top of his helmet in the same over after edging his first ball for four. He received another painful blow on his left hand in Anderson's next over. Taylor decided that attack was the best way to combat the increasing bounce and pace and he reached his half-century with the second of two square cut boundaries in one Anderson over. EARLY ADVANTAGE Ryan Sidebottom had claimed two wickets in a 15-minute period before lunch to give England the early advantage. First Aaron Redmond left a ball swinging in to him only to lose a bail over his off stump for 28. Sidebottom, bowling around the wicket, did not seem to initially realise he had taken the wicket and held his head in despair. James Marshall departed for no score in Sidebottom's next over when he was adjudged lbw by umpire Simon Taufel. Replays showed the ball pitched in line of the off stump. Darrell Hair, umpiring his first test since being dropped from the elite panel almost two years ago, had to make his first decision at 12-0 in the fifth over after Sidebottom struck How on the pads in front of middle stump. Replays suggested the ball might have bounced over the stumps, vindicating Hair's adjudication. England were unchanged from the drawn first test at Lord's, while New Zealand made one change, bringing in Iain O'Brien for Tim Southe
