 Dhaka, May 23 (bdnews24.com)  A mob beat three alleged robbers to death on the bank of the Nandipara river in Khilgaon in a predawn lynching Friday, police said. A fourth, Salauddin, was wounded in the attack. Salauddin, who was undergoing treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, claimed that the killings were the outcome of a previous enmity. Khilgaon police chief Sheikh Mohammad Abu Zahid told bdnews24.com that local people woke up to an announcement from a local mosque that the robbers were taking away a trawler. Locals soon assembled, hemmed in the robbers and beat them at about 4.30am, leaving Russell, 28, and Liakat, 32, dead on the scene. Md Rafiq, 32, died in hospital. There are three cases against Russell and six against Md Rafiq, said Zahid. The gang was long involved in robbing trawlers, Zahid alleged. "Passengers of many trawlers have lost their belongings and valuables in the middle of the river to this gang." "Police have long been hunting for them," he said. Salauddin said Russell was a friend of his. "He had a dispute with some local people," Salauddin said. bdnew
