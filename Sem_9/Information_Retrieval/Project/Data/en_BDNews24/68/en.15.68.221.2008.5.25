<TITLE> Donors and Myanmar to work on differences over aid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Yangon, May 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International donors and Myanmar's military government hoped to reconcile major differences over relief and rebuilding needs for millions of cyclone survivors at a pledging conference in Yangon on Sunday. Three weeks after Cyclone Nargis left nearly 134,000 people dead or missing and up to 2.5 million destitute, large areas of the stricken Irrawaddy Delta have not been reached, humanitarian workers said. But the government has said the combination of its own relief efforts and international help has already moved the operation into the rebuilding phase, asking for $11 billion in pledges for resettlement, reconstruction and rehabilitation. "I'm encouraged that many countries are represented at high levels," U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told Reuters TV as he left Bangkok for the conference in the former Burma, which has been under military rule for 46 years. Forty-four delegations, some at ministerial level, were attending the one-day meeting jointly organized by the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is one of 10 members. Ban's mission to ramp up international aid to cyclone survivors made a breakthrough on Friday when junta supremo Than Shwe promised him that all disaster experts, regardless of nationality, would be allowed in after weeks of restrictions. A U.N. official said the conference was more about getting the secretive generals to open doors than the world to open its wallet. "The content of it is clearly much broader than a 'pledging conference' in the sense that the sole aim is not to raise money. The aim is to remove the various obstacles to getting assistance to the people," the official said. Much of the fund-raising is likely to centre on the U.N.'s $201 million emergency appeal, which has racked up $57 million. MERCY MISSION The head of ASEAN has said donors would not pledge money unless there was a detailed plan of action, including monitoring of aid and transparency. ASEAN Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan told reporters in recent days that the group's "Coalition of Mercy" was calling for "some form of agreement to garner international assistance, based on figures that are scrutinized and validated by competent neutral agencies". Only a quarter of those in need have been reached in Myanmar and experts fear more will die if they do not receive a steady supply of food, medical care and equipment such as tents in the coming months. A European humanitarian official in Yangon said foreign NGOs were cautiously optimistic that Than Shwe's agreement with Ban would get more aid moving into the Irrawaddy Delta, which used to be one of Asia's largest rice-growing areas. She said it was unclear whether Sunday's meeting to secure more funding from international donors would provide any clarity. "So far it's been bits and pieces. We don't even know what aid the government has delivered, so we can't draw any conclusions," she said. There were some signs of a loosening of restrictions on the outskirts of Yangon, the former capital, on Saturday. Roads to the southwestern Delta were no longer guarded by the military, but instead by upturned tree roots and tree trunks, now slowly being cut by villagers using double-ended handsaws. In Kyauktan 20 km (12 miles) outside of Yangon, homeless survivors were taking refuge in a Buddhist monastery. "We are homeless. Every time something goes wrong we get help only from the monks," one woman said.
