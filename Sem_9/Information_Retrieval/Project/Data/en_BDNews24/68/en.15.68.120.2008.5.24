<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 24 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leader Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Saturday a certain quarter was plotting against his party to keep it from contesting the national polls. Speaking at a meeting with ex-student leaders at his NAM flat, the Khaleda-nominated secretary general of the troubled party asked BNP leaders and supporters to remain alert against any such conspiracy. He demanded release of party chairperson Khaleda Zia, saying the ongoing dialogue between the government and political parties would not be successful without her. Delwar asked the government to ensure Khaleda's participation to add meaning to the dialogue. He also said he doubted a free and fair election could occur under the present Election Commission. "Khaleda Zia must be there at the dialogue to make it meaningful in the interests of a free and fair election. She has to be freed. The government has to prove its willingness by freeing her." Delwar also demanded release of Khaleda's long-standing rival, Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. "Without the two, there will be no fair election in the country. People will not accept it by any means," he said. He said the BNP would not take contest any election in name only. The BNP leader said the Election Commission has made itself controversial with proposals such as increasing parliamentary seats and cancellation of an article of the constitution. On a recent High Court verdict regarding the EC's delay in holding polls, the former chief whip said: "The High Court said the failure to hold elections within 90 days of dissolution of parliament was illegal. This is how the government has revoked the rights of the people." bdnew
