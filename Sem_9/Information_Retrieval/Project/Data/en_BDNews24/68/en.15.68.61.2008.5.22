 PRAGUE, May 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jan Koller, the Czech Republic's all-time leading scorer, will try to make the most of Euro 2008 before retiring from the national team. The 35-year-old giant Nuremberg striker, who stands 2.02 metres tall and has scored 52 goals in 85 internationals, said last month he would hang up his boots after the finals. When he made his debut against Belgium in 1999 nobody could have imagined Koller would become a mainstay in the team but he was a permanent fixture by the tine coach Karel Brueckner took him to Euro 2004 in Portugal, where he netted twice. Koller also opened the scoring in a 3-0 victory over the United States at the 2006 World Cup in Germany but was injured in that match and without him the Czechs were eliminated. "I hope the Euros will be a successful full stop," Koller said as he contemplated the end of his international journey. His career took off with a surprise debut for Sparta Prague at 21 after he making the leap from a fourth division team. He worked hard on his technique, taking ballet lessons to improve his balance, and quickly became a dangerous target man with an ability to score goals despite his 103 kg frame. But Koller has often failed to control his temper. He kicked a national team shirt after being substituted early in a qualifier for the 2002 World Cup and a red card against Iceland kept him out of the playoff with Belgium. He also served a two-match ban with Nuremberg this season for allegedly spitting at an opponent in the Bundesliga and had to suffer relegation on the last day of the campaign. Koller scored in a 1-1 friendly draw with Denmark in March, a promising sign for Czech fans as he warmed up for a Group A campaign against Portugal, Turkey and co-hosts Switzerland
