 ANKARA, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey has closed its airspace to flights to and from northern Iraq, NTV television said on Thursday, as part of economic sanctions targeting groups supporting Kurdish militants operating in northern Iraq. Private broadcaster NTV gave no source for its report and it was not clear whether any ban would affect U.S. military planes operating between NATO member Turkey and Iraq.

On Tuesday, airline officials told Reuters Turkey's civil aviation authority had denied Istanbul-based charter airline Tarhan Tower permission to fly two of its three weekly flights to Arbil, Barzani's capital, this week. The United States uses Turkey's Incirlik airbase to provide logistical support to its forces in Iraq, though it has very few troops in the mainly Kurdish and relatively peaceful north of that country. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will discuss the PKK issue with Turkish leaders in Ankara on Friday. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will then hold talks next Monday in Washington with US President George W Bu
