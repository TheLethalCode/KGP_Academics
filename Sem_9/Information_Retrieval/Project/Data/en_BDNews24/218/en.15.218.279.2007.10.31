<TITLE> Siddons sees a better team ahead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Jamie Siddons Wednesday said he would want Bangladesh play a better brand of cricket in one-day, Test and Twenty20 matches in his two years as the national coach. "It is not all about taking them (Bangladesh) to number two or three in ranking. We are going to make certain progress... my vision is that we play very good cricket in all form of games in one-day international, Test and Twenty20," Siddons told reporters at his first press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Wednesday. Siddons, however, said he would set his goal after the discussion with his coaching staff and players. The former Australia assistant coach said until they had had the discussion what he could tell was they would do everything to make the team get better. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) sealed a deal Tuesday after Siddons, widely regarded as one of the best Australian batsmen never to have played Test cricket, came in the city on Monday. "I think we have 10-12 Tests in the next year and we have to start to show some improvement. We last played Test in Sri Lanka and I must say that was disappointing," said the 43-year-old. Siddons has already fetched video footages and statistics of the players and would study them for the next three weeks before officially taking charge in the last week of November. "Looking at the score sheets, I think we have got some very good players but they are bit inconsistent very inconsistent and that's one of the things we have to address "I think our tailenders need to concentrate a bit more and make some runs as well to help the top order. We have a lot of areas where we need to improve. I think the basic of cricket is very simple to bat, bowl and field better." Asked whether two years were enough to achieve his goal, Siddons said it was probably not but it was probably a good start. "I will look forward to do well in those days, somewhere we have to start. If the team shows progress, If I can do something well, the contract can be extended up to the next World Cup," said specialist batting coach. "I have been a first-class cricketer for 23 years, assistance coach for five years. I thought it is time to step in for a job myself. I have got a lot of idea and taking charge of a team was one of my ultimate goals. "Now the opportunity has come to put my philosophy and coaching techniques into practice and to give them to Bangladesh. "Hopefully they will be a better outfit and play some good cricket and win some matches," he said. Asked what would be his role in selection, he said he was very keen to play a part in the selection process or "at least have a very good discussion with the selectors". Siddons said he had a good rapport with the players though he might have language problems with some of the players. "I think one of my skills is communication with players. Obviously there will be a little bit of language barrier with some of them and I have to get a lot better at that. "My rapport with players has always been very good. Creating friendship, trust and respect for the players is one of my stronger points. "So I can't see that being any different here. I should be able to get the players on board and get them enjoy what I teach," said Siddons.
