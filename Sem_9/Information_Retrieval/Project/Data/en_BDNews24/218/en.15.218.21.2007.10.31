 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Deposed BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain Wednesday renewed his claim that he led the mainstream party and denounced other factions as 'not legitimate'. The ailing leader called on the Election Commission (EC) to deal exclusively with him in matters regarding the electoral reforms dialogue. Acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed and former MP Akhtaruzzaman separately said Delwar, who is ill, urged the EC to accept his faction as the BNP's sole representative. Akhtaruzzaman, who visited Delwar in BIRDEM, told reporters at the National Press Club that Delwar hoped the EC would recognise his claim. "Delwar is urging the EC through this press appeal not to add to the confusion." "The decision taken by some members of the standing committee is not legitimate." "There is only one BNP and there is no division within the party," Rizvi said to bdnews24.com Wednesday evening. "Those who are misusing the party's name and confusing the public have no connection to Khaleda Zia." "Party workers and leaders have rubbished their claims and hope the EC invites the BNP under the leadership of Khaleda Zia." "We are waiting for the invitation." Akhtaruzzaman said Delwar brushed aside election commissioner Md Sohul Hossain's statement that "the invitation will be sent to the one who is general secretary on Nov 7" as ill motivated. Earlier in the afternoon, a four-member BNP delegation headed by party standing committee member Lt General (retd) Mahbubur Rahman met chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. The delegation conveyed a letter to the CEC from a BNP committee headed by acting chairperson M Saifur Rahman and acting general secretary Hafiz Uddin Ahmed. bdnews24.
