 NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's cricket team landed in India on Thursday for the fourth bilateral series between the rival countries in the last four years. Captain Shoaib Malik and his team mates were escorted out of Delhi international airport amid tight security after landing for the 42-day trip. Malik and coach Geoff Lawson are due to address a news conference at the team hotel at 1900 (1330 GMT). Pakistan, who last won a test series in India in 1986, are due to play five one-day internationals from Monday followed by three tests. The visitors will be in action straightaway with a warm-up one-day match against the Delhi Ranji team on Friday. India opening batsman Virender Sehwag, recalled to the one-day team after being sidelined due to poor form, will miss the warm-up following his father's death two days ago. The teams have toured each other's country annually since 2004 when India went on a full tour of Pakistan after a 14-year break due to political tensions between the two neighbours
