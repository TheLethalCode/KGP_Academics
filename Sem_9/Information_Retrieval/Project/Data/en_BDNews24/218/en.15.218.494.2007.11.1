 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) - The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry Thursday called directly on non-resident Bangladeshis to contribute to the economic growth of the country. "If you see non-resident Indians and Chinese citizens, you will find them investing in big volume. I would request you to take part in Bangladesh's growing economy," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told an NRB delegation from the UK in his office. Nasir offered the Bangladesh British Chamber of Commerce delegation technical and marketing collaboration in several sectors such as fish, food and vegetable processing, hatcheries, education and health care. BBCC chairman Wali Tasar Uddin proposed collaboration with FBCCI in quite a different sectorestablishing a fashion design institute in the country. "Fashion design is important to reach customers in the UK and Europe," he said. "If you don't know the trend, how can you increase the volume of exports? The FBCCI can form a partnership with us to establish a fashion design centre here," Wali said. The BBCC chairman also said Brits of Bangladeshi origin now owned and operated over 12,000 restaurants employing over 100,000 Bangladeshi workers. "Bangladeshis in the UK also run grocery stores, departmental stores, real estate businesses, cloth or other small and moderate businesses," he added. "The new generation of the Bangladeshi community now looks for other major business ventures both in the UK and Bangladesh," Wali said. Nasir referred to potential sectors for direct investment such as light engineering, dairy farming and dairy products, saying: "Bangladesh is endowed with vast natural resources. We hope British companies will expand partnerships between Bangladesh and Britain." Nasir added: "We are coming out of our image crisis. Bangladesh is no more a number one corrupt county. Our image is going to improve." In fiscal 2006-07, the volume of bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Britain stood at $1.45 billion, with Bangladesh enjoying a trade surplus of $899.39 million.
