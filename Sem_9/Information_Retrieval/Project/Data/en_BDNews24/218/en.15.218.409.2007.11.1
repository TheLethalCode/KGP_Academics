<TITLE> Judiciary is meant to end sufferings: CJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin has said the judicial power is not a power in itself but a means to end sufferings of the people who seek justice. "The judicial functionaries wield judicial power which is actually not a power but a pledge to wipe off tears caused by injustice," Amin said Thursday in his speech at the inauguration of judiciary separation at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. The chief justice asked judicial magistrates to remain "fully committed" to discharging their duties and stressed utmost sincerity and dedication so that they could meet people's expectations. "So far I understand every member of the judiciary is under a public duty to administer justice in its truest sense at minimum time and cost." "I have the firm conviction (that) the members of the judiciary shouldering the new responsibilities will be able to magnify the image of judiciary and restore public confidence through their hard work and dedicated services." Amin was happy that at last the separation, which he called a long-felt national demand and desire, got through. He said the nation waited for this since the making of the constitution on November 4, 1972 that envisages clear provisions of a free judiciary in its Article 22. "It is better late than never," he said. Amin said all organs of the state have a set of duties but everything was meant to ensure justice for people. He expected cooperation from the executive to help function the judiciary. "In order to make the law effective and to make the justice delivery system functional the other organ of the state (the executive) will hopefully play a supportive role in making the promise of justice a real one," Amin said. bd
