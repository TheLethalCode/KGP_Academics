 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Cape Town International Airport is closed indefinitely after an aircraft veered off the main runway on Friday, a South African airport official said. No injuries were reported. Bongani Maseko, director of airport operations at the Airports Company South Africa, told public broadcaster SABC officials were talking to South African Airways [SAA.UL] to establish what happened during the plane's landing. "The entire airport is closed to all inbound or outbound traffic ... We do anticipate indefinite delays at this point," he said on SABC radio.
