 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The coal policy being drafted does not recommend export but suggests open-pit mining for experimental extraction in the Barapukuria coalfield, an official said Thursday. A high-level review committee tasked to flesh out a national coal policy meets Friday to discuss the details of the draft policy. "The draft is being prepared now. Once it is complete, the committee will sit and finalise the draft. We are taking suggestions from all concerned. We are taking great care so that the policy protects the national interest," chief of the committee Prof Abdul Matin Patwari told bdnews24.com. Patwari, also vice chancellor of Asia Pacific University, said the draft policy would not recommend export of coal. The draft proposes to extract coal on an experimental basis through open-pit mining system at Barapukuria where coal is nearest to the surface. The experimental extraction aims to see its impact on the environment and explore ways to make up for the ecological loss. Prof Patwari said open-pit mining can ensure extraction of maximum amount of coal. However, the damages especially to environment and local people is being taken into consideration. The eight-strong review committee was formed on June 21 to formulate the coal policy. The committee has had 10 meetings so far, the first being on July 21. The draft once finalised would be sent to the energy ministry for vetting. The policy would deal with the issues of leasing out coal fields, extraction, partnership, marketing and use of coal. According to the latest government count, the coal deposit in the five coal fields of the country stands at 2.5 billion tonnes, equalling 53 TCF gas. bdnew
