 Philipp Gollner SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Dell founder and chief executive Michael Dell received a pay package valued at $4.5 million for most of the year before he retook the CEO job in January, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Dell, 42, was paid a salary of $950,000 and received stock option awards valued at $2.49 million in Dell's fiscal 2007, which ended on Feb. 2 of this year, the company said in its proxy statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The 2007 proxy covers all but two days during which Michael Dell was executive chairman of the Round Rock, Texas-based personal computer maker. He returned as CEO on January 31, 2007. The company said it also paid about $1.05 million for the "personal and residential security" of Michael Dell. "The board believes that Mr. Dell's personal safety and security are of vital importance to the company's business and prospects and, therefore, that these costs are appropriate corporate business expenses," the company said in the proxy statement. Michael Dell is among the best-known executives in the United States, having started the company from his University of Texas dorm room in 1984 and driving it to become the world's largest personal computer maker by 2003. The company last year lost that ranking to Hewlett-Packard Co, which aggressively sold consumer laptop computers and printers in retail stores and expanded in markets outside the United States. The company's stumbles under former CEO Kevin Rollins helped pave the way for Michael Dell's return as CEO two days before the end of its fiscal year. The company said in August it agreed to pay Rollins $48.5 million in cash for stock options that expired and could not be exercised because Dell was late in filing its fiscal 2007 financial report as it investigated accounting irregularities. Rollins has since been named a senior advisor at private equity firm TPG Capital. Dell filed the 2007 annual report and other overdue statements on Tuesday after it concluded an audit of its accounting for the fiscal years 2003 through 2006 and the fiscal first quarter of 2007. Dell is scheduled to hold its annual shareholders meeting on December 4 in Round Rock.
