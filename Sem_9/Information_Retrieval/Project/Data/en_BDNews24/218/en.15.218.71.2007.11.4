 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  In a bid to honour the mother language, the second Indo-Bangla Bangladesh Games will start on February 22, a day after the international mother language day. The decision was taken at a joint meeting between Bangladesh Olympic Association (BOA) and West-Bengal Olympic Association (WOA) at the BOA office Saturday. "The Games were scheduled to be held in December, but we together decided to hold the second Indo-Bangla Bangladesh Games from February 22 to pay respects to language martyrs," said BOA acting secretary general Kutubuddin Ahmed after the meeting. "The visitors will pay respects to the language martyrs on February 21 and the screen of the games will open next day at Bangabandhu National Stadium," said Ahmed. The first Indo-Bangla Games with the athletes from both Bangladesh and West Bengal was held in January this year in Kolkata. The games consisted of eight disciplines  athletics, swimming, football, kabaddi, basketball, volleyball, shooting and kho kho. But, the second edition meet will see one more event of cricket to be included along with the previous eight events. "The cricket is certainly most favourite game in the subcontinent, and the meet will see the newest version of Twenty20 cricket, which has made a new dimension in cricket," said Komolesh Chatterjee, general secretary of the WOA. The WOA general secretary said they might send the Bangla cricket team, which participated in the Ranji Trophy in India, to the meet. Some 220 athletes and officials from both sides will take part in the Indo-Bangla Bangladesh Games.
