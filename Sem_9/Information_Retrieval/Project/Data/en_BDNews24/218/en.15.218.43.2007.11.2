<TEXT>
 MILAN, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of Serie A fixtures this weekend: Juventus striker Alessandro Del Piero looks set to come back into the starting line-up for Sunday's big match with leaders Inter Milan having come off the bench in Wednesday's 3-0 win over Empoli. Del Piero may link up with David Trezeguet, who bagged a hat-trick against Empoli, while Claudio Ranieri must decide whether to include Vincenzo Iaquinta in a three-pronged attack. The coach may instead continue with in-form Raffaele Palladino on the right wing with fit-again Mauro Camoranesi only likely to make the bench. Third-placed Juventus also have Pavel Nedved, Giorgio Chiellini, Nicola Legrottaglie and Antonio Nocerino back from suspension and all four could start. Former Juve striker Zlatan Imbrahimovic will return to Inter's starting XI after being left out of Wednesday's 4-1 win over Genoa because a booking would have ruled him out of the trip to Turin. Ibrahimovic is expected to receive a nasty reception from a Juve crowd who have not forgiven him for leaving, but Patrick Vieira will be spared the catcalls as he is injured alongside fellow midfielder Dejan Stankovic. Inter goalkeeper Julio Cesar is battling to recover from a sore back with Francesco Toldo out with a broken metatarsal and third-choice Paolo Orlandoni is poised to step in again. AC Milan welcome back Massimo Ambrosini from suspension for Saturday's visit of Torino but Ronaldo is not in contention despite resuming full training after three months out with a leg problem, vice president Adriano Galliani told reporters. Paolo Maldini is pushing for a start after recovering full fitness after knee surgery but fellow defenders Marek Jankulovski and Massimo Oddo are out injured. Torino midfielder Tommaso Vailatti is suspended following his red card in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by Udinese. On-loan Inter forward Alvaro Recoba is also out because he needs dental surgery, media reported. Daniele De Rossi is suspended for second-placed AS Roma's trip to Empoli on Sunday with Francesco Totti again highly doubtful with an ankle knock having missed the last two games. Unbeaten Fiorentina in fourth have no new injury problems for Saturday's game at struggling Lazio, who continue to be dogged by players being on the treatment table rather than on the pitch
