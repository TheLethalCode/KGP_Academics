<TITLE> Essentials prices still piercing pockets </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Essentials prices continued to rise last week, hitting consumers hard. Government employee Motaleb Hossain, who came to do his groceries at New Market kitchen market, started with rising rickshaw fares when asked how the price spiral had affected him. He said, "Rickshaw fares go up with increases in rice and lentil prices. Other public transport fares have increased as well." "But our salary does not keep pace; as a consumer I have to bear the brunt of the price hike." "Tell me what the rate of increase is when rickshaw pullers demand Tk 12 instead of Tk 8? Atta prices doubled in a single jump! Every time I come to shop, I find that prices have gone up." He said his salary increased by only Tk 375 over a year. Soybean oil, powdered milk, sugar and lentil prices went up over the last week. Atta or coarse flour remained steady at Tk 38 per kg. Although onions, going at Tk 58 per kg, cost Tk 2 less than last week's price, they were still 178 percent more expensive than this time last year. Soybean oil sold at Tk 90 per kg, a Tk 5 increase over last week. Sugar rose to Tk 32 from Tk 29 last week. Powdered milk saw increases of Tk 10 to 25 per kg, sold at Tk 445 to Tk 460. Chittagong consumers heaved a sigh of relief as onion prices came down a little. But that gain was offset by increased soybean oil and powdered milk prices. Hilsha price did not decline even though fishermen have started netting the fish again after a ban on Hilsha catches expired. Vegetable prices, however, did decrease as supply to the kitchen markets increased. Rice and atta prices, which increased last week, were comparatively static on wholesale and retail markets this week. Government measures to arrest the price hike have proved unsuccessful, buyers alleged. Shoppers in the capital said they felt more at ease when the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) had opened 100 fair price shops during Ramadan, and when grocers were forced to display a price list in their shops. The BDR closed 60 outlets and operate just 40 now. Consumers alleged that monitoring of prices at kitchen markets has become lax. BDR Col Abdul Halim, who is in charge of market controls, told bdnews24.com, "If government wants the shops that operated during Ramadan open again they can issue the necessary directive." Meanwhile, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has said there were no specific measures to control rising essentials prices. He said prices were fluctuating because of changes in international commodity prices. bdnews24.co
