 ISLAMABAD, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A missile attack launched by a U.S. drone aircraft on Friday killed at least five people and wounded several more near a madrasa run by pro-Al Qaeda mujahideen in Pakistan's Waziristan region, witnesses said. The sprawling religious school or madrasa was founded by a veteran mujahideen commander, Jalaluddin Haqqani -- an old friend of Osama bin Laden. There were unconfirmed reports earlier this year that the aging and infirm Haqqani had died, but his son Sirajuddin has emerged as a major militant leader in his place. "A drone was flying very low and fired the missile. It destroyed three houses," a resident of Dandi Darpakheil village told Reuters. "I have seen human flesh scattered all over the area near the houses," the villager said. The villager requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the information, as drone attacks are typically launched by U.S. forces across the border in Afghanistan. The Pakistan military does not possess drones, and it has not acknowledged past strikes by US drones as it go against the government's stated policy that no foreign forces are allowed to operate in Pakistani territory. The US does not usually acknowledge making any strikes either in order not to embarrass its ally. Pakistani security forces are bearing brunt of a suicide bomb campaign because of President Pervez Musharraf's support for the war on terrorism. The latest explosion rocked Miranshah, the main town of North Waziristan, two km (one mile) away. "It shook Miranshah. Many people came out of their shops in panic," one of man said. Six wounded men were admitted to Miranshah's main hospital. Pakistan's military spokesman confirmed there had been no Pakistani action and offered no explanation for the cause of the explosion. "I have heard there was an explosion in a house, but we didn't carry out any action," Major-General Waheed Arshad said. The strike coincided with a visit to Islamabad by the head of the U.S. Central Command Admiral Willam Fallon, who held talks with Musharraf on Friday. Military cooperation with Pakistan became a hot topic among U.S. presidential hopefuls earlier this year after Senator Barack Obama said in August he would be willing to attack inside Pakistan with or without approval from the Pakistani government if he ever became president.
