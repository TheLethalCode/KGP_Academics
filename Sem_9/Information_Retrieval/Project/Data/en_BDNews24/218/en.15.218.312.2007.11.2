 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Arab men faced deportation from Britain after a special court dealing with foreign terrorism suspects rejected their appeals on Friday, in cases that test the balance between security and human rights. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission, accepting assurances received by Britain from Algeria, dismissed arguments that three Algerian men would risk torture on returning home. It said the fourth, a Jordanian, was protected by a 2005 agreement between Britain and Amman on the human rights of deportees, without which "he would face the real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment and even torture at the hands of agents of the Jordanian state". Britain regards the men, whom media can identify only by letters, as threats to its national security and say one of them had direct ties to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Human rights groups say that if Britain has evidence against them, it should put them on trial. They say assurances of fair treatment from countries with records of torture are worthless. Gareth Peirce, a lawyer for two of the men, said they would appeal again and condemned the secrecy surrounding the court. "We have been trapped in the vice of secret hearings, secret courts, secret decisions on appeal," Peirce told reporters, adding that the men were only prolonging their legal battle because they feared for their lives in Algeria. "It is inconceivable that any human being would continue to run this marathon in custody if he did not absolutely fear he would face torture or death as the alternative." She said she had no idea of the content of confidential 'closed evidence' that formed part of the court's deliberations. 'BIN LADEN LINK' The British government said the court decision recognised the value of its deportation agreements with other countries. "These agreements strike the right balance between allowing us to deport individuals who threaten the security of this country and safeguarding the rights of these individuals on their return," Home Office Minister Tony McNulty said. Britain says one of the Algerians, U, had ties to bin Laden and backed militants behind bomb plots in 1999-2000 against Los Angeles airport and a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France. Another, Y, was tried and acquitted of a plot in Britain involving ricin poison, but later re-arrested. "Mentally he's completely crushed," said Lawrence Archer, a juror in Y's case who is now campaigning for him and has visited him in jail. Jordan told Britain in September that its GID intelligence agency wanted to investigate the Jordanian man, VV, in connection with terrorism, including alleged links to al Qaeda commander Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who was killed in Iraq in 2006. The court said a United Nations report in January painted an "utterly deplorable" picture of torture and abuse of detainees in Jordan, and Human Rights Watch uncovered further "horrific" evidence when visiting a Jordanian prison in August. But it said it was in Jordan's interests to keep its promise to Britain to treat deportees humanely and allow them regular visits from an independent monitor if they were detained. It was confident Amman would keep this commitment in VV's ca
