 WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Pentagon said the US military did not carry out a missile strike on Friday that witnesses said killed at least five people near a religious school run by pro-al Qaeda mujahideen in Pakistan's Waziristan region. "There was no indication that that was any US military asset," said Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman after speaking with US military officials in Afghanistan. "Every indication was that there was no US military involvement in this activity that you've seen," he told reporters. Asked if the strike could have been launched by aircraft owned by another U.S. agency, such as an intelligence agency, Whitman said he did not speak for other agencies. "I only talk for the United States military," he said Witnesses said a US drone aircraft launched a missile on the religious school founded by an old friend of Osama bin Laden. The Pakistan military does not possess drones.
