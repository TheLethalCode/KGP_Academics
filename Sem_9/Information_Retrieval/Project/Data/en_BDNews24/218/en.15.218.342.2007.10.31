<TITLE> Russia urges Turkish restraint on Kurdish rebels </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey should show restraint over Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq but its security concerns are understandable, a Kremlin spokesman said on Wednesday. "We share Turkish concerns over terrorist activities in its southwest, some of which are trans-border," Kremlin deputy spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing. "We stick to the position that exercising its legitimate rights, Turkey should realise its responsibility as a regional state so as not to make things worse. Any sharp movements can deteriorate the situation (and) take it out of control." Peskov added: "We hope Turkey will refrain from ill-considered steps." Ankara has threatened a military incursion into northern Iraq, from where Kurdish rebels have launched attacks on targets inside Turkey. Washington, which views Turkey as a vital ally in the Middle East, has urged Ankara to show restraint. It argues an incursion would further destabilize an already volatile region.
