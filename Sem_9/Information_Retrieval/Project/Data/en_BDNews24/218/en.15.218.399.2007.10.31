<TITLE> UN court affirms 15-year jail for Bosnian Serb </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 AMSTERDAM, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The UN war crimes tribunal rejected on Wednesday an appeal by former Bosnian Serb policeman Dragan Zelenovic to reduce his 15-year jail sentence for the rape and torture of Bosnian Muslims in the 1992-1995 war. The 46-year-old former paramilitary leader had argued that his cooperation and admission of guilt which had relieved his victims of the obligation to testify should be seen as mitigating factors. "The scale of the crimes was large. Zelenovic's participation in the crimes was substantial," the appeals chamber said as it rejected cutting his sentence. Zelenovic had pleaded guilty to seven charges under the terms of a plea bargain between his defence team and prosecutors. In April, the court found him guilty of personally committing nine rapes of women in Serb detention, eight of which qualified as both torture and rape and four of which were gang rapes.
