 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  This Saturday, November 3, is Jail Killing Day, a sad event in the life of the nation. On this day in 1975 four national leaders who led the liberation warfirst acting president of Bangladesh Syed Nazrul Islam, prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed, and cabinet members retired captain M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzamanwere killed while in detention in Dhaka Central Jail. The Awami League (AL) has planned a two-day memorial to pay tribute to them. The tribute will include the garlanding of the portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, hoisting of the party flag at half mast at the AL office, wearing black badges, laying wreaths at the graves of the four leaders at Banani graveyard and a discussion session at the Engineers Institution Sunday. AL's acting president Zillur Rahman said, "The killing was part of a deep conspiracy to rob Bangladesh of leadership. The killing was a continuation of the murder of Bangabandhu on August 15. The national leaders sacrificed their lives with courage and firmness for the interest of the country and the nation." "They did not bow down to the killers and conspirators." He said the lives of the four national leaders would ever inspire the people in their struggle against injustice. After the assassination of Sheikh Mujib and the murder of much of his family on August 15, 1975, four leaders in the Mujibnagar government were detained at Dhaka central jail. They were killed while in custody on November 3. The murder of the four jailed leaders has since been remembered as Jail Killing Day.

A verdict was announced on Oct 20, 2004 during the tenure of the BNP-Jamaat alliance government, sentencing 15 of the 20 accused. Three former army officials were handed down death sentences by hanging and 12 others were awarded life imprisonment.
