 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) -- The Rapid Action Battalion freed Pushpita Noor hours after she was arrested at her Gulshan home with suspected ties to Yaba trade. Pushpita, sister of suspected Yaba trader Jannatul Ferdous Niki, was arrested in an overnight raid on the house of her husband MHN Bulu, director of a private TV station. RAB's commanding officer Sultan Mohammad Nurani confirmed the news on Pushpita's release to bdnews24.com Thursday night. Nurani had earlier said no illegal substance was seized in the raid. Investigators interrogated Pushpita to know the whereabouts of Niki, who is at the centre of a hunt by the elite force in connection with drug-dealing. RAB said they had information that Hotel Purbani director Mahbubur Rahman Joynal and girlfriend Niki had ties to Yaba trade. In hours of an earlier raid on Joynal's Dhanmondi home, RAB seized local and foreign currency worth about Tk 28.5 crore, a large amount of gold and diamond jewellery, alcohol and Yaba and Viagra tablets. Neither Joynal nor Niki was in the house during the raid. According to RAB, Niki has been living in that house for several years as a friend of Joynal. bdnews24.com/
