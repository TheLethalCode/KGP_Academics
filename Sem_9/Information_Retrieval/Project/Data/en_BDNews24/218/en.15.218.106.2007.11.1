 ANKARA Thu Nov 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that economic sanctions agreed against groups backing Kurdish rebels were not yet in force, denying a report that Turkey had closed its airspace to flights to northern Iraq. Turkey has massed up to 100,000 troops along its border with Iraq, backed up by tanks, artillery and aircraft, in preparation for a possible large-scale military incursion into northern Iraq, a move Washington says could destabilize the wider region. On Wednesday, Turkey's cabinet approved unspecified economic sanctions against groups deemed to support the separatist Kurdish PKK in a move widely seen as targeting Masoud Barzani's autonomous Kurdish administration in northern Iraq.

As well as a possible flight ban, Turkish newspapers have mentioned restrictions on traffic through the busy Habur border gate with Iraq, curbs on exports of electricity and cement to northern Iraq and a clampdown on the operations of firms belonging to Barzani in Turkey among the sanctions considered. On Tuesday, airline officials told Reuters Turkey's civil aviation authority had denied Istanbul-based charter airline Tarhan Tower permission to fly two of its three weekly flights to Arbil, Barzani's capital, this week. Turkey blames the PKK for the deaths of nearly 40,000 people since the group launched its armed campaign for an ethnic homeland in southeast Turkey in 1984. The United States and European Union, like Turkey, brand the group as terrori
