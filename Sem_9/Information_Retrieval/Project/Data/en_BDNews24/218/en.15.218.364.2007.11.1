<TEXT>
 DHAKA, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) -- The Awami League Thursday asked the Election Commission to disqualify the Jamaat-e-Islami and what it termed war criminals from taking part in polls. "We ask the Election Commission not to register Jamaat-e-Islami because it bases its politics on religion, and we ask that steps be taken to bar war criminals from participating in the polls," acting AL chief Zillur Rahman said in a press briefing in his Dhanmondi office following a central working committee meeting. Zillur said recent remarks about the Liberation War by a Jamaat-e-Islami leader were arrogant. The meeting also discussed party preparations for the dialogue with the EC on November 4. The AL's EC dialogue preparatory committee's proposal, highlighting 31 points on electoral reform, was amended and passed at the meeting. But the number of Awami League participants at the EC talks was not finalised. One AL leader, who asked not to be named, said it had been decided that 21 participants would attend the dialogue. But disagreements remained over the size of the delegation. Some leaders wanted only senior leaders and experts at the discussions, so it is possible that the delegation might be smaller, he said. The leader, who asked not to be named, said the meeting supported in principle a 33 percent reservation of seats for women. He said the meeting called for party functionaries at every level of responsibility to be elected. Zillur Rahman told reporters: "We will agree with the Election Commission's positive proposals, but will suggest alternatives to those points that are not acceptable." On judicial independence, he said: "We hope the people will get justice from a free judiciary and the judiciary will be able to meet the expectations of the people too." Zillur claimed that the case against Sheikh Hasina was false and vowed to free the AL chief through a legal and constitutional fight. He demanded the release of detained AL leaders and activists, including party general secretary Abdul Jalil. Zillur demanded a case and arrest warrant against Sheikh Rehana be withdrawn. The acting AL chief asked the government to take steps to halt inflation, and to supply seeds and fertilizers to farmers at reasonable prices. Forty-three out of the 71 AL central working committee members attended the meeting. bdnews
