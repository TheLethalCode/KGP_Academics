 VANCOUVER/BANGKOK, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Canadian court ordered accused pedophile Orville Frank Mader to remain in custody on Friday, and Thai police said they want him returned to Thailand to face charges of sexually abusing young boys. The 54-year-old Canadian was detained when he arrived at Vancouver International Airport on Thursday on a flight from Southeast Asia after Thai police issued a warrant for his arrest. Mader appeared briefly in provincial court near Vancouver and was ordered to remain in custody until another court hearing on Nov. 8. Mader was detained under a Canadian law that allows the courts to restrict the movements of people believed to be a threat to children under the age of 14 even if no criminal charges have been filed. He was arrested by a Royal Canadian Mounted Police unit that investigates international child exploitation but police have not said if charges are pending in Canada. It is illegal for Canadians to travel to other countries for the purpose of having sex with children. The "sex tourism" law has rarely been used and its constitutionality has never been tested in the courts. Thai police said they would ask the country's Foreign Ministry to start the extradition process. Canada and Thailand have an extradition treaty. "Our concern is Canadian police may only be able to hold him for a short period because he apparently has not done anything wrong in Canada," Police Colonel Apichart Suribunya told Reuters. A Canadian Justice Ministry spokesman declined to comment on whether Canada had received an extradition request. Thailand issued an arrest warrant for Mader after a 7-year-old boy said the Canadian asked him to perform oral sex on Mader at a hotel last week in the beach town of Pattaya, about 150 km (90 miles) from Bangkok. Thai police say Mader had sexually abused three boys in Pattaya. The boys were aged 7 to 9 and Mader could face up to 20 years in jail if convicted in Thailand, a Pattaya police officer said. "A 7-year-old boy identified him from among a number of tourist pictures. He is wanted on charges of sexual molestation against minors aged under 13," Police Major Sompol Nakhapan said on Thursday. Mader is also wanted in neighboring Cambodia, where he was found guilty in 2004 of molesting two boys under the age of 13. He was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in jail. Mader, a native of Kitchener, Ontario, owns a house in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey, British Columbia, but worked in Southeast Asia as a teacher for several years, according to Canadian media reports. This incident comes in the wake of Thailand's arrest of Canadian Christopher Neil, who became the focus of an international manhunt when German police determined his identity in manipulated photos of child abuse posted on the Internet. Neil's arrest prompted Thailand to begin a wider search for suspected Western pedophiles. Neil, who denies the charges of sexually abusing boys, is in Thai custody awaiting trial.
