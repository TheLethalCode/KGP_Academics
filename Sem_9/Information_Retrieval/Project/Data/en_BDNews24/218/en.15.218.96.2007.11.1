 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Rapid Action Battalion Thursday arrested suspected Yaba peddler Puspita Noor at her Gulshan home after an overnight raid on the house of her husband MHN Bulu, director of a private TV station. "The house was raided from Wednesday night. Bulu's wife Puspita was arrested in the morning and taken to the RAB-3 office at Tikatuli," RAB's commanding officer Sultan Mohammad Nurani said to bdnews24.com. Nurani said no illegal substance was seized in the raid but investigators were intensively interrogating Puspita to know the whereabouts of her sister Jannatul Ferdous Niki, a model. "Model Niki and her younger sister Puspita are heavily involved with the Yaba drug trade," he said. RAB said they had information that Hotel Purbani director Mahbubur Rahman Joynal and friend Niki had ties to Yaba trade. In a raid from Monday night through to Tuesday noon on Joynal's Dhanmondi home, RAB seized local and foreign currency worth about Tk 28.5 crore, a large amount of gold and diamond jewellery, alcohol and Yaba and Viagra tablets. Neither Joynal nor Niki was in the house during the raid. According to RAB, Niki has been living in that house for several years as a friend of Joynal. bdnews24.c
