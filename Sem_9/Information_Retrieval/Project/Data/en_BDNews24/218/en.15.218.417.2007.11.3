 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) - An Awami League delegation will supply the Election Commission with specific draft reform proposals and timescales for their implementation during their talks Sunday. The party's policymaking body has completed several rounds of meetings to prepare written recommendations in accordance with the commission's election roadmap. The party will submit specific rationalisations for the commission proposals it will object to, as well as why it agrees with others. The AL will present alternative proposals for the issues it disagrees with. AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed told bdnews24.com that the party would raise a strong objection to the registration of war criminals and political parties based on religion. "The AL will demand a ban on the war criminals and religion-based parties in accordance with the constitution and international agreements on war crimes," Tofail said. Several parties allied with the AL have already made similar demands to the EC. Specifically, the party will ask the EC to bar imams, priests and other representatives of religious institutions from electioneering. The proposals demand a law be enacted that carries a six months jail term for violators. Further demands include banning government officials from using religious rhetoric while on election duty. Tofail, head of a committee formed to prepare reform proposals for the EC, said: "The 14-party's guidelines for electoral reforms will form the basis of our talks with the commission." "We will try to compromise between the commission's expectations and our guidelines," added the AL leader. The draft proposals include a suggestion that cross-party discussions take place prior to the appointment of the chief election commissioner and other election officials. Another proposal calls for an amendment to the 1972 Representation of the People's Order, rather than scrapping it. The party will also propose the establishment of a separate secretariat for the EC, which will give it financial independence and the power to punish certain crimes. The party will oppose the registration of stranded Pakistanis and Rohingyas as voters. The AL will support the Election Commission's proposal to bar NGO officials from contesting in the polls and will in fact call for even stricter control over their participation, according to a proposal. The EC proposes a bar on nominating party members who joined less than three years prior to an election. The AL's draft proposal, however, argues that occasions can arise that should allow such a nomination. According to a further proposal, the people will be disqualified from contesting the polls if they have a three-month outstanding telephone bill, electricity bill or debt to any other state service agency. The AL draft proposals suggest removing the EC's power to cancel political party's registration as well as formulating a political code of conduct. AL demands photographs of the party's founder, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, as well as the party chief and candidates remain on election posters with the party symbol. The AL opposes the presence of local observers at polling centres. The party also suggests keeping the candidate's election expenditure as a publicly available document. Loan defaulters will also be ineligible to contest polls. AL proposes that the EC bear most of candidates' election expenses, which will, in their opinion, increase the EC's expenditure, but reduce national cost. bdnews24.
