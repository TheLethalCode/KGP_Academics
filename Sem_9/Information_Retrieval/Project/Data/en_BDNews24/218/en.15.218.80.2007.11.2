 Al Amin Dewan bdnews24.com Chittagong University correspondent Chittagong, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Many former students of Chittagong University have alleged that the certificates or marksheets they have got are strewn with errors. They say even the name of the university in their certificates is misspelled. The students have alleged that they face hassle and embarrassment when they apply for jobs, fellowship or higher education with the certificates and mark sheets full of glitches. "My certificate signed by the vice chancellor spells the name of the university as unibersity," said Subarna Majumdar, an ex- journalism student. "Not only that, my marksheet also bears errors with misspelled course names and other details," she said. Subarna said she became was shocked to see gross errors in four marksheets of her honours and masters translated into English. She needed them to apply for a scholarship abroad. "I have got my university's name as Chittagong Unibersity," she said. In her masters marksheet signed by the controller of examinations, the minimum qualifying marks for a third class is wrongly given 280, which is actually 180. When bdnews24.com brought took up the issue with the controller of examinations and officials of the transcript section they were surprised too. An official told bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity that correction was not easy since the documents are printed in the government-run Security Printing Press in Gazipur. He said a former student may need to wait long to get the papers corrected since the press would not reprint them unless there is a big printing order. Mohammad Mozaffar Hossain, the controller of examinations of the university, said it was a matter of shame and regret. The error-riddled certificates have already been reprinted with correction and the victims will surely get the right ones, he said.
