<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British banks suffered a landmark defeat on Wednesday in their legal bid to scrap protection for consumers shopping abroad on their credit cards. Credit card providers lost an appeal in the House of Lords against a ruling that gives consumers using cards abroad or ordering goods from overseas the same protection as they have in the UK. The two companies at the centre of the challenge, Lloyds TSB and Tesco Personal Finance, part of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, failed in their argument that the protection afforded in the Consumer Credit Act could only be applied to domestic transactions. Lord Hoffmann said there was nothing in the wording of the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to exclude foreign transactions. British consumers spent 10 billion pounds on overseas credit card transactions in 2006, according to figures from the payments association Apacs. Wednesday's ruling comes amid a consumer revolt over current account and credit card charges that is costing the industry billions of pounds. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is currently investigating banks' pricing structures in a major study due to be published by the end of the year. It has already forced providers to cut credit card default charges to 12 pounds or less, and industry commentators have said a wider crackdown on charges could herald an end to "free banking" as companies try to recoup lost revenue. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, card issuers are jointly liable with suppliers if there is a problem with goods or services, provided the price of the item is between 100 and 30,000 pounds and is paid for with the card. The High Court ruled in November 2004 this only applied to domestic transactions, but the Court of Appeal confirmed the OFT's view and extended the protection to overseas transactions in March last year. Martyn Hocking, editor of consumer magazine Which? Money, said Wednesday's judgement was "excellent news for consumers". "This positive ruling will remove the uncertainty surrounding purchases overseas and over the Internet, and consumers will be able to shop with greater confidence," he said. "With most credit card companies, consumers already pay a charge each time they use a credit card abroad -- the least they can expect is the same level of protection as they enjoy at home." Sandra Quinn, director of corporate communications at Apacs, welcomed the clarification the ruling had brought. "This is something we've been seeking for a number of years," she said. "From a customer's point of view, this decision means no change as card companies had been meeting valid overseas claims anyway. "Clearly, the card industry will need to consider the implications of today's ruling for their individual businesses."
