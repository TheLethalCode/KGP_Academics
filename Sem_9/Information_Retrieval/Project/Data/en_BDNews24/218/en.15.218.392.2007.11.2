<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Dutch international Ronald Koeman signed a 2-1/2-year deal to coach Valencia on Friday after quitting as PSV Eindhoven manager earlier this week. The 44-year-old ex-Barcelona player replaces Quique Sanchez Flores who was sacked following Sunday's 3-0 defeat at Sevilla. Sanchez Flores was the third manager to have been fired by Valencia in three years with predecessors Antonio Lopez and Claudio Ranieri also failing to live up to expectations after the success achieved under previous boss Rafa Benitez. "We wanted to sign an internationally recognised coach," said Valencia president Juan Soler. "We are convinced we will be in very good hands. He knows what Valencia's objectives are, he knows the squad and he will bring us the success we want." Koeman will be joined by his assistant Tonny Bruins Slot, who also previously worked under Johan Cruyff at Barcelona. Although demolished 5-1 by league leaders Real Madrid at the Mestalla on Wednesday, Valencia remain relatively well placed in in sixth spot just two points off the Champions League places. Caretaker coach Oscar Fernandez will be on the bench again for Saturday's match at Real Mallorca but Koeman will replace him for Tuesday's visit of Rosenborg in the Champions League
