 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) Police late Friday night arrested Khulna city mayor Sheikh Tayebur Rahman in Dhaka in a case filed in the southwestern city Thursday charging him with extortion. The case was filed at Khulna Sadar Police Station and was forwarded to Gulshan Police Station whose officers arrested Tayebur from his Gulshan-2, House No. 95 home at about 10:30pm. Tayebur, a former BNP MP, was later sent to the Cantonment Police Station for security reasons, officials said. Gulshan police deputy commissioner Mir Rezaul Alam told bdnews24.com at 11pm: "Tayebur Rahman was arrested after the case was filed in Khulna. He is now in custody." A senior official at RAB HQ, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: "Tayebur Rahman was taken to Dhaka Cantonment Police Station for security reasons. He was arrested [in Gulshan]." Officer in charge of Khulna Sadar Police Station Mesbahuddin told bdnews24.com at 11:30pm, "Gulshan police have messaged us to take the accused to Khulna. On receiving the news, investigation officer of the case sub-inspector Enamul Haq has started for Dhaka." Suspended assistant director of Khulna City Corporation's Municipal Service Project, SM Hafizur Rahman, filed the case late Thursday night, charging the mayor with extorting Tk 2.9 lakh. The case accuses Tayebur and three others, including Khulna City Corporation's public relations officer Abu Taher and the mayor's nephew Kazi Shawkat Hossain Thandu, of extortion and taking bribes. On Oct 29, Hafizur filed a complaint (GD) with the same police where he accused the mayor, the nephew, Taher and KCC official Khan Enayet Ali of corruption and bribery. On Oct 31, revenue officer SK Asaduzzaman filed a counter complaint against suspended KCC chief engineer Liakat Al Sharif and Hafizur, charging them with embezzling Tk 44.55 lakh in the corporation's fund. bdnews2
