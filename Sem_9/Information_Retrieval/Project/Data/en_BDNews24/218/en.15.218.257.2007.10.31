 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - A three-member BNP delegation, assigned by new acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed, has requested the CEC to invite them to the BNP's dialogue, scheduled for Nov 22. Meeting with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Wednesday, the delegates also handed a letter to the CEC and claimed that they represented the BNP mainstream. BNP standing committee member Mahbubur Rahman led the team. The other two other members were ZA Khan and Mofazzal Karim. Mahbubur Rahman later told reporters: "There have been some changes in the party lately. We informed the CEC about the appointment of the new acting chairperson and secretary general and asked him to invite us to the dialogue on November 22. We are the mainstream of the BNP." The commission said it would examine the party constitution and let us know its decision later, according to Rahman. "We made a new committee of the BNP. We hope we will be invited to the dialogue with the Election Commission scheduled for November 22." Rahman ruled out the allegation by Khandaker Delwar Hossain that the Saifur-led committee was 'unconstitutional'. Delwar Tuesday staked his own claim to the post of secretary general and said the meeting of the standing committee was illegal. Delwar was appointed to the post by party chief Khaleda Zia on the day she was arrested and detained. Rahman said he believed that Delwar would join hands with them. "BNP was, is and will continue to be united. It is a major party and a popular party. Delwar is unwell, and he must join hands with us accepting realities." The CEC told reporters that he had received two letters from BNP and would invite one faction by Nov 7 in line with the party constitution. The Election Commission on Aug 28 announced a schedule for dialogues on electoral reforms with 15 political parties. According to the schedule, the commission is supposed to sit with BNP on Nov 22. The two BNP factions led by expelled secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and Delwar Hossain sent two letters to the EC on Sept 5 and 24. bdnews
