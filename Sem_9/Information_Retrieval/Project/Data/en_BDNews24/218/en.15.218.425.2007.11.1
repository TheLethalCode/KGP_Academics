 GUATEMALA CITY, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A right-wing retired general and a leftist businessman face each other in Guatemala's presidential runoff vote on Sunday after a campaign centered on soaring crime and sullied by dozens of murders. Opinion polls differ as to who leads at the end of a chaotic campaign in which over 50 candidates and political party activists were gunned down. Houses were riddled with machine-gun fire and car bombs set off to intimidate others. If he wins, former army intelligence chief Gen. Otto Perez Molina will be the first military man to lead Guatemala since it emerged from decades of often brutal army rule in 1986. Silver-haired Perez Molina has used his tough-on-crime image to close a gap in polls with Alvaro Colom, a factory owner in his third bid for the top job. Perez Molina led some recent polls in the coffee-growing country, but Colom is ahead in others. Since the end of a 36-year civil war in 1996, crime blamed on drug barons and tattooed street gang members has engulfed the Central American country known for its Mayan culture and majestic ruins. While many Guatemalans are wary of military officers in politics, others remember lower rates of street crime under the tough wartime rule of men like former dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who is wanted on charges of genocide in a Spanish court for his role in Guatemala's civil war. Perez Molina has gained support for his Patriotic Party, whose emblem is a clenched fist, by promising to use the army and temporarily suspend basic rights to regain control of areas overrun by youth street gangs and drug mafias. "We have had civilian governments and they are afraid of applying the law," said Lorenzo Taquez, 42, an interior decorator who has been robbed three times, once at knifepoint while walking down the street with his two young daughters. "Perhaps he will be stricter because he is a military man," Taquez said of Perez Molina. Murders have soared to almost 6,000 a year in a country of 13 million people, one of the world's highest rates and almost double the level when peace agreements ended the war between the government and leftist guerrillas. Guatemala is a major trafficking route for cocaine moving from Colombia and through Mexico to consumers in the United States. A corrupt and inept justice system leaves 98 percent of murders unsolved. DARK PAST A U.N.-backed report on Guatemala's civil war said the army massacred thousands of Mayan villagers in a scorched-earth campaign. More than 200,000 people were killed in the war. Critics of Perez Molina, who led troops in an area that suffered some of the worst repression in the war, say a vote for him would be a return to the country's dark past. "If he wins, we will go back to the times of war, and the guerrillas could even come back if he brings in repression," said Jorge Lopez Riva 51, an electrical technician who backs Colom. Soft-spoken, chain-smoking Colom has promised to spend more on health and education. He says Guatemala will only cut crime by attacking poverty and removing corrupt police and judges. Colom beat Perez Molina by 4.7 percentage points in the first round of voting in September but his campaign has faltered since a top advisor quit the race amid death threats. The campaign was the most violent since the end of the civil war, with dozens of party members, candidates and political activists slain. Colom's party has been hardest hit. He blames the violence on drug gangs trying to penetrate his campaign, but Perez Molina's team has also been targeted. His private secretary was gunned down just blocks from his downtown office this month.
