 WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The US economy grew at a surprisingly brisk clip in the third quarter, the government said on Wednesday in one of a series of reports that implied a resilient expansion despite a battered housing sector. A pickup in consumer spending and strong exports powered economic growth ahead at its fastest rate during the third quarter since the beginning of 2006. Growth in gross domestic product, which measures total production within U.S. borders, unexpectedly edged higher to a 3.9 percent annual rate, up from 3.8 percent in the second quarter for the strongest quarterly growth since 4.8 percent in the first quarter of 2006, the Commerce Department reported. The robust GDP figure raised questions among some analysts whether Federal Reserve policy-makers will need to lower interest rates at the conclusion of a two-day policy session later on Wednesday. "The Fed has a strong economy, high productivity, low wage pressures and low inflation," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "These data do not argue in favor of a rate cut." Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast that third-quarter growth would slow to 3 percent partly in expectation that dispirited consumers hurt by falling house prices would trim their spending. Surveys have shown that consumer confidence has suffered as a subprime mortgage crisis lingers on. Instead, consumer spending picked up to a 3 percent annual rate during the third quarter from 1.4 percent in the second quarter, a powerful stimulant since consumers fuel about two-thirds of national economic activity through their purchases of goods and services. MARKETS SURPRISED The GDP report was one of several stronger-than-expected readings on the economy on Wednesday that sent the dollar up against other major currencies and ignited a rally in stock futures prices. Bond prices fell as investors bet the chances for interest-rate cuts were reduced. The Labor Department said employment costs -- a key determinant of the costs of production -- rose a smaller-than-expected 0.8 percent in the third quarter, down from 0.9 percent in the second quarter. Cheaper benefit costs accounted for the decline. And separately, a closely watched report from ADP Employer Services estimated that private employers added 106,000 jobs in October. The private employment service's estimate was well ahead of forecasts among economists surveyed by Reuters for 60,000 jobs and implied the economy had more underlying strength than many had previously thought. "Certainly the GDP number was much stronger than anticipated and that may lead to some second guessing about what the Fed may do this afternoon, coming on top of that ADP number which was also much stronger than expected," said economist Scott Brown of Raymond James and Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. The GDP report showed exports jumped in the third quarter at a 16.2 percent rate. That was more than double the second quarter's 7.5 percent and the strongest increase since the fourth quarter of 2003. FED SCRATCHES HEAD The GDP data is one of the final gauges of economic performance that FOMC members will weigh before announcing later on Wednesday whether they will reduce interest rates. The Fed is expected to trim its key federal funds rate a quarter percentage point but rate futures markets scaled back the odds on the reduction after the GDP and other data was published. Prices rose more rapidly in the third quarter, with the so-called core index of personal consumption expenditures, which excludes food and energy items, climbing at a 1.8 percent rate. That compared with 1.4 percent in the second quarter and begins to push the boundary of the 1-to-2-percent rate for core price rises that is widely considered to be acceptable to Fed policy-makers. While consumers spent relatively freely in the third quarter, businesses became more cautious. Business investment increased at a 7.9 percent annual rate, down from 11 percent in the second quarter. The deterioration in housing gathered steam. Spending on residential construction plummeted at a 20.1 percent rate in the third quarter, far ahead of the 11.8 percent rate of decline in the second quarter and a seventh straight quarter in which residential spending has fallen. A weakening US dollar has made American-made products cheaper for foreigners to buy and appears to be benefiting exporters. Imports also rose in the third quarter, up 5.2 percent after contracting 2.7 percent in the second quarter. Inventories of unsold goods also accelerated in the third quarter, to an annual rate of $15.7 billion compared with $5.8 billion in the second quarter. Some of the build-up may represent stocking-up for the coming holiday season between Thanksgiving and Christmas although inventories may also accumulate if sales of some goods begin to lag. In either case, however, rising inventories add to growth in the period in which they occur
