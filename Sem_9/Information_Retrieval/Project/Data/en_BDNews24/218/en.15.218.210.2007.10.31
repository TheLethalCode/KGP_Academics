<TITLE> Ukraine PM says wants Russia gas talks ended soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovich asked Ukraine's energy minister on Wednesday to complete talks with Russia over the price of next year's gas imports within 10 days. Ukraine and Russia have had disputes before on gas prices and in January 2006 a brief cut in supplies affected some European Union countries. So far Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom has said it will just "fine-tune" 2008 prices. "It is necessary to complete negotiations with Gazprom about gas deliveries and prices," Yanukovich told a cabinet meeting. "I turn to (Energy) Minister (Yuri) Boiko and ask you to complete talks about this issue as soon as possible -- a week, 10 days, no more." Ukraine pays $130 per 1,000 cubic metres of gas, far below the $250 paid by EU countries. Both the government and President Viktor Yushchenko have indicated a rise to $150-160 would be acceptable, a position reiterated by Yanukovich on Wednesday. Boiko told a briefing after the meeting that remaining debts to Gazprom accumulated by Ukraine since the beginning of the year would be paid by Thursday. Gazprom threatened earlier this month to cut supplies over arrears. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he wants a gradual transition to market gas prices for Ukraine from current levels - a legacy of the Communist era. The EU receives about a quarter of its gas from Russia, the majority of which is transported through Ukraine. Some also goes through Belarus, which is also facing higher prices and has had its own disputes with Russia.
