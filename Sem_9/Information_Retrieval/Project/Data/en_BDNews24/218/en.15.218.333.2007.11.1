<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Thursday said he hoped political parties would give more priority to national interests. "Proper development will not take place in the absence of right politics," Huda said in the dialogue with Ershad's Jatiya Party at the EC. Referring to demands by political parties to bar anti-liberation forces and war criminals from the elections, however, he said: "These are political issues. We have nothing to do with them." He renewed his pledge to install "a democratic government through a free and fair poll". JP acting chairman Anisul Islam Mahmud, who led the 15-member team, placed a set of proposals. Some of them demanded efforts to stop the use of violence and illegal money to influence the elections. He also proposed to keep the ceiling of election expenditure for each candidate within Tk 5 lakh and implement the electoral rules properly. Secretary general Amin Hawlader also raised some proposals for reforms to the electoral laws. Election commissioners Sohul Hossain and M Sakhawat Hossain also attended the meeting. The EC started dialogue with the political parties on Sept 12. bdnews24
