<TITLE> Nigerian House of Reps elects new speaker after row </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ABUJA, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's House of Representatives elected a new speaker on Thursday in defiance of the ruling party leadership, after weeks of chaos caused by a corruption scandal centred on the previous speaker. Oladimeji Bankole will replace Patricia Etteh, who resigned on Tuesday under threat of impeachment over the award of contracts worth $5 million in public funds to renovate her official residence and that of her deputy and to buy 10 cars. "We have been elected to leadership at the most trying time to restore public confidence, set the agenda and machinery for legislative business, evolve best practices for public procurement, ensure judicious use of public funds," Bankole said shortly after he and his deputy were elected. Bankole's election was a minor show of resistance by the House against the leadership of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), which had imposed Etteh in June and named a different man as the preferred successor. Bankole, a PDP member, garnered 304 votes against 20 to the candidate backed by the party leadership. The PDP won a crushing majority in the National Assembly after elections in April condemned as "not credible" by European observers and "a farce" by Human Rights Watch because of widespread vote-rigging and political violence. Etteh was imposed by former President Olusegun Obasanjo, who stepped down as head of state on May 29 but remains chairman of the PDP board. The choice of Bankole signals that legislators want to assert their independence from the party hierarchy. The House has yet to debate any legislation since it was inaugurated in June because proceedings have been dominated by the row over the renovation contracts. An in-house investigation found that Etteh had broken House rules in awarding the contracts but for weeks she refused to step aside to allow another member to chair a debate on the findings of the investigation. This caused her allies and opponents to scuffle repeatedly on the floor of the House. During one session an Etteh supporter collapsed and died after over-exerting himself. The president's presentation of the federal budget for 2008 to the National Assembly has been delayed by a month because of the mayhem in the House. It has been tentatively re-scheduled for Nov. 8 and the new House leadership will be under pressure to ensure that the presentation can take place on that date.
