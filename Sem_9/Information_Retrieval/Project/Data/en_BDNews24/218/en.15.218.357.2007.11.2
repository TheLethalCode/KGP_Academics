<TITLE> Khaleda sees Delwar as secretary general: BNP leader </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Detained BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has not approved the decision of the party standing committee meeting, a BNP leader said. "We have learnt through the members of [Khaleda's] family members that she still considers Khandaker Delwar Hossain as the legal secretary general," acting office secretary Rizvi Ahmed said. "The person who is claiming to be the acting secretary general after a midnight coup is illegal," he said at his Shyamoli home. The policymaking wing of the party at a Oct 29 midnight meeting appointed M Saifur Rahman as acting party chief and Hafizuddin Ahmed as acting secretary general in place of Delwar. Khaleda had appointed Delwar secretary general expelling his predecessor Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan just before her arrest on Sep 3. "A conspiracy is going on to destroy the BNP. The ill-attempt to remove the secretary general selected by Khaleda Zia in midnight coup was part of the conspiracy. But the BNP chairperson did not accept it." Rizvi alleged that he was being harassed by the government but refused to give details. bdne
