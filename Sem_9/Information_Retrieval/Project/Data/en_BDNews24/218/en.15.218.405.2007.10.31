<TITLE> Paraguay ex-general eyes presidency after acquittal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ASUNCION, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former army general convicted of leading a failed coup said he would run for Paraguay's presidency, after the Supreme Court cleared the way by overturning his 10-year prison sentence. Lino Oviedo will compete in the April 2008 vote in Paraguay, one of South America's poorest countries, which has been governed by the ruling Colorado Party for more than 60 years. The Supreme Court annulled a 1998 military court verdict against Oviedo late on Tuesday, accepting the argument of former high-ranking military officers who denied that an uprising had occurred. The Supreme Court decision followed a September ruling that allowed Oviedo out of jail. "It has been demonstrated now that there was absolutely nothing aimed at destabilizing democracy in Paraguay," local newspapers quoted Oviedo as saying. "(My party) will start working to reach the government palace in 2008." Paraguay's constitution bars people who have been sentenced to prison from running for president, and some political opponents accuse President Nicanor Duarte Frutos of pressuring his allies on the Supreme Court to overturn Oviedo's sentence. The opposition says Duarte's aim is to dilute support for former Roman Catholic Bishop Fernando Lugo, who leads in polls. Duarte is backing his former education minister Blanca Ovelar, who faces a Colorado Party primary election in December. "It's clear there was a pact (between Oviedo and Duarte) because this ruling is a judicial aberration," opposition senator Carlos Filizzola, a Lugo supporter, told local radio on Wednesday. Oviedo, 64, is a charismatic figure popular with Paraguay's poor. In September, a military court released him after he had served 5-1/2 years in jail in two separate stints for trying to topple the government of former President Juan Carlos Wasmosy in 1996. After his first stint in prison, Oviedo spent five years in exile in Brazil before returning to Paraguay, where he was jailed again in June 2004. He turned himself over to authorities to try to clear his name. Paraguay was ruled for 35 years by dictator Alfredo Stroessner, a former army general and Colorado Party leader who was deposed in 1989.
