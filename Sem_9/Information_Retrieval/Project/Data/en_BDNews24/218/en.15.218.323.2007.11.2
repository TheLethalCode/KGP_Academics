<TEXT>
 MADRID, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches: Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard has criticised his team for a lack of commitment in their 1-1 draw at Valladolid on Thursday. "We played alright in the first half, but in the second we were disorganised and there was no sense of us being a team," said the Dutchman. "We have to sacrifice ourselves more when we don't have the ball, run harder, do the dirty work and play for the team." The Catalans host struggling Real Betis on Sunday in their next league match. Sevilla hope striker Frederic Kanoute will be able to return to action for Saturday's match at home to leaders Real Madrid after sitting out the 4-3 defeat at Atletico because of a recurrence of a groin injury. Kanoute scored a hat-trick against Real when the two sides met in the the Spanish Super Cup final at the start of the season. Ronald Koeman will arrive in Valencia on Friday to sign a two and a half year contract with the club following the sacking of Quique Sanchez Flores earlier this week. Valencia have conceded eight goals in their last two defeats against Sevilla and Real Madrid and travel to an in-form Real Mallorca on Saturday. Atletico Madrid's Diego Forlan will miss Sunday's match at home to his former side Villarreal because of a thigh muscle injury, while fellow striker Sergio Aguero is a doubt because of a minor strain in his right leg. Argentine international Maxi Rodriguez and former Liverpool forward Luis Garcia are expected to step in to replace the duo. Betis have reiterated their confidence in coach Hector Cuper after the side's 3-0 defeat at home to Osasuna on Wednesday. "We are going carry on with Cuper as coach. He has the full support of the board and we have faith in his project," club president Pepe Leon told reporters ahead of Sunday's match against Barcelona. The Andalucians have only ever managed to beat Barca four times on their visits to the Nou Camp. Getafe midfielder Franciso Javier Casquero believes his side have turned the corner after notching up a second win of the season with their 2-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Wednesday. "It looks like we are going to have to suffer this year, but I'm confident that we will now start heading up the table," he told sports daily AS on Friday
