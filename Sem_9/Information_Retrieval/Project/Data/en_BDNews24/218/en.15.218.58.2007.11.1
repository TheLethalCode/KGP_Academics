 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Newly appointed judicial magistrates attended a formal ceremony Thursday at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Centre that heralded the official separation of judicial and executive branches. Newly appointed court staff including bench clerks, assistants and stenographers took up their posts from the morning in advance of the magistrates' arrival. Osman Ali Khan, a former bench clerk in the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court, told bdnews24.com that no hearings were held Thursday morning. "I don't think any magistrate will return to the courts from the ceremony before 2pm," Khan said. "Once the magistrates have returned it will be decided what hearings will be accepted," added the former court officer. The rescheduled postings and appointments orders, signed by Judge Abul Khayer Md Enamul Haque, showed that Md Abdul Khaleque, the former chief metropolitan magistrate's personal assistant and stenographer, will perform the same duties for the newly appointed first additional chief metropolitan magistrate Shawkat Ali Chowdhury. Khaleque will also perform the same duties for Judge Sultan Mahmud.
