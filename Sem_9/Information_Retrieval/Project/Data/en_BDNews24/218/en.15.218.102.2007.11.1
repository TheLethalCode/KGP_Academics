 COPENHAGEN, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Support for Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen has slipped ahead of a Nov. 13 general election, but opinion polls on Thursday still showed his Liberals and their allies ahead by a slim margin. The Social Democrat-led leftist opposition has gained some ground since Rasmussen called the early election last week, hoping to win a third term on the back of tax cuts, a healthy economy and record low unemployment. Surveys have put Rasmussen ahead through most of this year and commentators note that most of the current voter movement is within the two political blocs rather than between them. "Unless we see a major shake-up in the next week, we are looking at a situation where the present prime minister will have the best foundation to form a government", said Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard, politics professor at Copenhagen University. The polls suggest any governing coalition would have to include New Alliance, a newly formed party which is carving a niche in the centre of the political spectrum. The election was called 15 months ahead of a February 2009 deadline. A poll conducted over five days to Oct. 30 by Synovate Vilstrup showed Rasmussen's Liberals on top with 26.0 percent of the votes followed by the leading opposition Social Democrats with 25.3 percent. The poll published in daily Politiken was based on 1,050 responses. The prime minister's Liberal-Conservative coalition and its anti-immigrant ally, the Danish People's Party, were seen taking 45.2 percent of the votes in all, versus 44.0 percent for the opposition. Rasmussen swept to power in 2001 and won re-election in 2005 on the back of a crack down on asylum-seekers and tax cuts. The New Alliance got 8.1 percent in the poll, which could make it the kingmaker after the elections. New Alliance leader Naser Khader, a Danish citizen of Muslim descent and former leader of a moderate Muslim group, has said he will back Rasmussen to form a government after the election. That would entail Khader siding with the anti-immigrant DPP, a seemingly tall task for Rasmussen to manage, but one that some believe is possible. "In their rhetoric, the DPP and New Alliance have really painted each other as the arch enemy, but after the election the DPP may have a hard time explaining to their voters why they gave away power to the left rather than come to terms with New Alliance," he said. Rasmussen was scheduled to meet Social Democrat leader Helle Thorning-Schmidt in a televised head-to-head debate on Thursday, the first of only two scheduled one-on-one bouts between the two before the election.
