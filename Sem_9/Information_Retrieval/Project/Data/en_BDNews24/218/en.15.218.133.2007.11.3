 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Saturday commemorated Jail Killing Day and hoisted flags at half-mast at AL offices across the country. Party members wore black badges on visits to Bangabandhu Bhaban to garland a portrait of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Banani graveyard to lay flowers at the graves of three of the four slain national leaders. Syed Ashraful Islam, son of slain leader Syed Nazrul Islam and acting general secretary of the party, presidium members Tofail Ahmed, Abdur Razzak, Sajeda Chowdhury, Motia Chowdhury, Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, Abdul Mannan, Akhteruzzaman, Sultan Mohammad Monsur and many AL members took part in the memorial services. Quran khwani and milad mahfil in memory of the victims of the August 15 and November 3 killings were held throughout the day at Banani graveyard. The AL will hold a discussion programme at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh at 4:00pm Sunday. On this day in 1975, four leaders of the wartime national governmentacting president of Bangladesh Syed Nazrul Islam, prime minister Tajuddin Ahmed and cabinet ministers M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamruzzamanwere killed inside Dhaka Central Jail. Power usurpers gunned down the four leaders after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and most of his family on August 15, 1975. The Jail Killing Case was revived in 1996, but a verdict handed down by the court on October 20, 2004 was never carried out. Three former army officials were given the death penalty for their role in the custodial killings, 12 suspects were awarded life sentences, and five suspects were acquitted. bdnews24
