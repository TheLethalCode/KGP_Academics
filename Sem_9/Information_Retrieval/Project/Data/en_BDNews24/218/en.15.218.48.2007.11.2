 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Six world powers agreed on Friday to push ahead with a third round of sanctions against Iran unless reports later this month show Tehran has shown greater transparency about its nuclear programme. Political directors from Britain, France, Germany, the United States, Russia and China will meet again on November 19 to assess reports from the United Nations atomic watchdog and from European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said. "Political directors agreed to finalise a text for a third UN Security Council sanctions resolution with the intention of bringing it to a vote in the U.N. Security Council unless the November reports of Dr Solana and Dr El-Baradei show a positive outcome of the efforts," the spokesman said. Iran has refused to halt uranium enrichment after two previous U.N. sanctions resolutions and denies that it wants to produce atomic bombs, saying its programme is intended solely for power generation. Britain's Foreign Office said on Friday the top officials had asked Solana to seek a further meeting with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and to report back. The United States imposed economic sanctions last week and has not ruled out military action against Iran. Britain has also said it will push for a third round of UN sanctions. But diplomats from other countries have said they want to hear first on how Iran's talks with the UN watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), are progressing after Tehran agreed to answer questions about its past secret nuclear work. Ahead of the meeting, United States undersecretary of state for political affairs Nicholas Burns, said Russia and China, major trading partners with Iran, had effectively blocked moves towards a third sanctions resolution for six months. Russia believes dialogue rather than more punishment is the way forward while China reacted to the US sanctions by saying it was opposed to acting "too rashly". TEHRAN "COOPERATING" Former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said on Friday that Tehran was cooperating with the IAEA, referring to an agreement in August under which Tehran pledged to clear up suspicions about past secret atomic activities. Rafsanjani, who is an influential cleric and speaker of the powerful Assembly of Experts, said: "America is making a mistake. Iran has entered into negotiations and is talking to the Agency (IAEA). Iran has told (the IAEA) to ask its questions and get the answers. One should be patient and negotiate." Referring to any possible US military action, he said: "I am sure that if America seeks adventure again, soon all the nations of the world will realise that America has made an obvious mistake." He said "such threats, if they come true, will create another quagmire for the global arrogance of (the United States)". US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking to reporters on Friday on her way to Turkey, said Washington had had some "tactical" differences with China and Russia about the timing and the "depth or breadth" of a new U.N. resolution.
