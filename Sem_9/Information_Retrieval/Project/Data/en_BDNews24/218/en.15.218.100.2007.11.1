 ZURICH, Nov 1 (BBC/bdnews24.com) -- Martina Hingis has admitted she is under investigation for a positive test for cocaine at this year's Wimbledon. The 27-year-old Swiss star was speaking at a news conference in Zurich where she announced her retirement for the second time on Thursday. "I have tested positive but I have never taken drugs and I feel 100% innocent," Hingis said. "The reason I have come out with this is because I do not want to have a fight with anti-doping authorities." She added: "Because of my age and my health problems I have also decided to retire from professional tennis." Hingis first retired in 2003 because of persistent injuries before returning to top-flight tennis at the start of 2006 and winning three more titles. She brought her season to a premature end last month because of hip problems but had vowed to return to action. Hingis ended 2006 ranked seventh in the world and is currently number 19.
