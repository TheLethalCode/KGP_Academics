<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  Mir Shawkat Ali, who distanced himself from the BNP, Saturday slammed the party's standing committee for appointing M Saifur Rahman as acting BNP chief and Hafizuddin Ahmed as acting secretary general without Khaleda Zia's consent. "It was a stupid decision," Shawkat told reporters at his Gulshan home. He repeated that he was no longer with the BNP. "In line with the party constitution, the chairperson possesses the ultimate power. The standing committee meeting cannot be held without her permission," he claimed. Denouncing the so-called veteran leaders, the former army officer said: "Where were the senior leaders before? Their activities are unconstitutional." Shawkat also commented on BNP leaders Hafizuddin Ahmed and ASM Hannan Shah who traded criticism over the Nov 3, 1975 botched coup and the 1981 assassination of former president Ziaur Rahman. Hannan Shah said Hafizuddin, a former major who is now acting secretary general, was involved with Nov 3 coupan allegation Hafizuddin refuted. Asked whether Hafizuddin had connections with the coup, Shawkat said: "I was not in Dhaka on Nov 3. I don't know whether Hafiz was connected. Begum Zia and Mohiuddin Ahmed (convicted prisoner of Bangabandhu Murder Case) can say about it." Shawkat said, "I am not with the BNP now. I will return to the party as soon as I am convinced that the party is not joining hands with war criminals." Deploring the selection of Hafizuddin as secretary general he said, "This is a big political party. He has been with the party only for six years. It was not right to make him secretary general." Criticising the senior leaders of the BNP, Shawkat said: "It looks bad when the people who don't have enough strength and whose sons are connected with graft become active." He predicted the party would not stay united even with 130 lawmakers. "We were the companions of Zia, so was Col (retired) Oli. We are now away from the party." bdnew
