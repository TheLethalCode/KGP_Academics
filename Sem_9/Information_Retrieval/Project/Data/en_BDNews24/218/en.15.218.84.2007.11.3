 TBILISI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ten thousand Georgians demanded the resignation of President Mikhail Saakashvili in a second day of protests in front of their parliament building on Saturday. The turnout was much lower than the 70,000 opposition supporters who protested on Friday in the biggest show of unrest since the peaceful revolution that swept Saakashvili to power four years ago. But the crowd's demands were more extreme. "Our nation's main aim now is Saakashvili's resignation," Labour Party Chairman Shalva Natelashvili said at the rally. Protesters, some waving banners and wearing white bandanas bearing the slogan "I'm not scared", vowed to stay on the streets until the Western-allied government meets their demands for an early parliamentary election and changes to voting rules. "We aren't going to step back. We will stay here to the finish," said George Tsagareishvili, one of the leaders of the opposition United Georgia party in the ex-Soviet country. The street protests have drawn comparisons with the Rose Revolution, the wave of mainly peaceful protests that led to Saakashvili replacing Eduard Shevardnadze as president. Saakashvili's opponents accuse him of authoritarian rule and human rights abuses, although not on the same scale as in some other ex-Soviet states. They also say living standards are not rising as quickly as many had hoped after the revolution. "They have deprived us of everything. They are mocking us," said 41-year-old protester Lia Kavtaradze, as the crowd chanted "Go! Go!" EARLY ELECTIONS Opposition supporters want a parliamentary election brought forward to early 2008 from late next year so they can win the vote and use their majority to abolish the presidency. Billionaire businessman Badri Patarkatsishvili has backed the movement. Interfax news agency reported he left for Israel on Saturday after addressing the crowd the previous day. "We have to tell the president our slogan: Georgia without a president," said Republican Party leader David Berdzenishvili. "If Saakashvili doesn't make the right decision, he will go the same way as his predecessor Shevardnadze". Levan Gachechiladze, a member of parliament, said the "people's movement" had added the demand that Saakashvili resign to its call for an early election. Tina Khidasheli, another of the Republican Party's leaders, added: "We had been offering Saakashvili new elections but he is afraid. Now, he should go". Saakashvili, who is in Tbilisi, has not commented on the protests. The president, a key U.S. ally who wants to take Georgia into NATO and the European Union, frequently flaunts his democratic credentials. Opposition supporters are not opposed to Saakashvili's pro-Western stance, a position which has earned support from the United States and the European Union in Georgia's quarrels with neighbouring Russia.
