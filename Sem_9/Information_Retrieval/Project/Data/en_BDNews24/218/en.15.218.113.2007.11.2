<TITLE> Pakistan faces militancy from across NW Frontier </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PESHAWAR, Pakistan, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Waziristan, Islamabad's Red Mosque, now Swat, a beauty spot known as Pakistan's Switzerland -- Islamist militant uprisings are challenging President Pervez Musharraf across the volatile northwest. Provoked by a suicide bombing and public beheadings, security forces responded with helicopter gunships and artillery against fighters led by a 32-year-old cleric who's been spouting jihad on the radio and has a reputation for riding around on a white horse gathering donations for his cause. The result -- around 180 people have been killed in the conflict over the past week and thousands of families have fled a valley that in years past had been a tourist destination. The fighting in Swat adds to pressures on General Musharraf, and fuelled rumours that the politically embattled U.S. ally might declare emergency powers and call off elections meant to turn Pakistan into a civilian-led democracy. In the four months since his troops stormed the Red Mosque to crush a Taliban-style movement and a ceasefire with Waziristan's militants broke down, close to 800 people have been killed in militant-related violence. "Uprisings are always crushed. There should be zero tolerance for them," said Mahmood Shah, a former security chief of Pakistani tribal areas. "The government should isolate the hardcore militants and box them in. It's the only solution. There is no need to appease them." There have been at least 23 suicide attacks, including one last month that killed 139 people at a rally to mark former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's return from eight years of self-imposed exile. Another killed seven people less than half a kilometre from Musharraf's own army residence in Rawalpindi on Tuesday. Musharraf sent the army into Swat, but it is the paramilitary Frontier Corps which has led the fight against Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e- Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM), Maulana Fazlullah's armed movement, which wants to impose strict Islamic law in the region. "Fazlullah is becoming a new icon for the militants after Abdul Rashid Ghazi," a senior intelligence official said, referring to the militant cleric who was killed in an army assault on the Red Mosque in July. Known as "Mullah Radio", Fazlullah has used an FM station to call men to arms to avenge the slaying of Ghazi and his followers. He now has hundreds, possibly several thousand fighters under his command. TOURISTS LONG GONE Not many sightseers go to Swat these days for its crystal blue lakes, verdant alpine meadows and snow-capped mountains. It sometimes gets a mention by security analysts playing the perennial guessing game; Where is Osama bin Laden? The al Qaeda leader and his deputy Ayman al Zawahri are believed to be hiding somewhere in the Pashtun tribal belt straddling the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. They released audio and video tapes in September calling on mujahideen to avenge the slaughter of comrades in the Red Mosque by intensifying attacks on Musharraf and his security forces. Security officials believe that some Arab and Uzbek militants who fled tribal areas had also taken sanctuary with Fazlullah's fighters and were involved in the Swat uprising. They say the foreigners were responsible for the beheading of six paramilitaries last week. Swat is at the other end of the tribal region from Waziristan, at the southwest of the Pashtun tribal belt. While it is not one of Pakistan's seven semi-autonomous tribal agencies, the Swatis, as locals are known, are tribal. Militancy took roots in Swat in the 1980s when militant madrasas sprouted across North West Frontier Province, covertly funded by the United States and Saudi Arabia, to drive the Soviet Union out Afghanistan. By the 1990s the same madrasas were producing Taliban fighters and radical Islamists. Fazlullah's father-in-law, Sufi Mohammad, founded TNSM and led an uprising in Swat in 1994 to make sharia the law of the land. The authorities later set up Islamic courts to appease the Islamists, a move critics say emboldened the radicals. When U.S.-led forces entered Afghanistan in 2001, Sufi Mohammad sent thousands of fighters over the border in a futile attempt to save the Taliban militia from defeat. "I don't miss being the ruler of Swat for one minute," Miangul Aurangzeb, the scion of the last ruler of the former Pakistani princely state says dejectedly, ruing how the state mismanaged his old fiefdom and let militancy thri
