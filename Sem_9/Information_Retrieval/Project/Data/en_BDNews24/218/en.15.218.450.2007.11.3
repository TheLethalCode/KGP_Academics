 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (BBC/bdnews24.com) -- Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf Saturday declared emergency rule, state-run TV has reported, as independent channels went off air. Paramilitary troops have been deployed inside state-run television and radio stations in Islamabad, witnesses said. Gen Musharraf is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on whether he is eligible to run for re-election last month while remaining army chief. Munazza Siddiqui, senior producer for CNBC, Pakistan's private TV channel, told bdnews24.com that TV channels went off air because of the emergency. "We don't have access to information as all channels have been blocked out," she said. "I have no electricity where I live. It may be because of power shortage and has little to do with the state of emergency," Siddiqui told bdnews24.com by phone. The BBC's Barbara Plett reports from Islamabad that fears have been growing in the government that the Supreme Court ruling could go against Gen Musharraf. Pakistan has been engulfed in political upheaval in recent months, at the same time as the security forces have suffered a series of blows from pro-Taleban militants opposed to Gen Musharraf's support for the US-led "war on terror". Private channels Geo News and Dawn News earlier quoted unnamed sources as saying the government had made up its mind to declare emergency rule. Shortly afterwards they came off air. A special cabinet meeting is expected shortly. One TV channel reported that emergency rule may involve the suspension of the constitution. Parliamentary elections are due in January. Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who recently returned to the country after years of self-exile to lead her party in the elections, is currently in Dubai on a personal visit. Private channels Geo News and Dawn News both quoted unnamed sources as saying the government had made up its mind.
