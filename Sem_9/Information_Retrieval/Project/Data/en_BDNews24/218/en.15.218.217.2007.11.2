<TEXT>
 Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Plagued by a wave of suicide bombings and attacks, Pakistan is going through a period of intense uncertainty in the run up to a January vote that is supposed to transform the country into a civilian-led democracy. With uncertainty hanging over President Pervez Musharraf's position, the weakness of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League, and an active militant threat, there is speculation that the embattled leader could delay the election by imposing emergency rule, or even declare martial law.
