 KARACHI, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's top pacer Mohammad Asif will not travel with the national squad to India on Thursday due to a chronic elbow problem. "Asif .... is not leaving with the team today. He is ruled out of the first three one-dayers but could miss the entire tour if his injury does not heal in time," Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told a news conference. Naghmi said Asif had informed the board he had not made a complete recovery from the injury. "It was his decision and for the time being we are announcing no replacement for him," he added. Asif also missed four of the five one-day matches at home against South Africa last month because of the elbow problem, which has affected him since last year. Pakistan begin a five-match one-day series in India on Nov 5
