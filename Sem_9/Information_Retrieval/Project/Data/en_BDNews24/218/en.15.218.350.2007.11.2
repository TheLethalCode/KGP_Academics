<TITLE> Opener Butt sets up Pakistan win </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Delhi, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)- Salman Butt hit 83 off 84 balls as Pakistan warmed up for the one-day series in India with a seven-wicket victory over a Delhi XI. Left-hander Butt hit a six and 13 fours before retiring to give team-mates a chance of some batting practice. And Pakistan reached 215-3 in the 43rd over after earlier restricting the home side to 213-9. India and Pakistan will play five one-day matches, the first at Guwahati on Monday, before three Test matches. And the tourists are in upbeat mood despite a recent home series defeat by South Africa. Pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar took 1-46 in his 10 overs after skipper Shoaib Malik won the toss and opted to field first, while Rajat Bhatia top scored for Delhi with 75. Bhatia rescued their innings in a fifth wicket stand of 91 with Shikhar Dhiwan (52) after they had been reduced to 46-4, but both were run out as Pakistan enjoyed a good day in the field. Seven bowlers were used by the tourists, and part-time leg-spinner Younus Khan proved the most successful with figures of 2-25. Pakistan's reply began badly when Kamran Akmal was leg-before to left-armer Kunal Lal for five, but Imran Nazir and Butt responded with a flurry of boundaries to put them well ahead of the required rate. The total had reached 66 in only the seventh over when Nazir (34 off 22 balls) gave a catch to mid-on, but Misbah-ul-Haq joined Butt in adding 91 to effectively end the game as a contest. Butt returned to the dressing room with the total on 157 and Misbah eventually fell for 39, before Yasir Hameed (33 not out) and Fawad Alam (10 not out) knocked off the remaining runs. Courtsey : BB
