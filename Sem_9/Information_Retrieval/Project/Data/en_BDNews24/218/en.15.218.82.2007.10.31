<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The judiciaryseen as the last bulwark of fairness and one of the indices of vibrant democracycarves out an independent niche for itself on November 1. Bangladeshis, just as any other nation would, have long craved for a fair and neutral judicial system free from the debilitating influence of political or social pressures. But government after government fended off the move on the plea that the process has its very many handicaps and it had better be sidelined. That a lack of political will put brakes on things moving ahead was there for all to see, but the political leadership preferred to keep its eyes wide shut All that happened despite the fact that the judicial independence was an important issue in the constitution that wanted judges and their rulings to be protected. But government after government fended off the move on the plea that the process had its very many handicaps and it had better be sidelined despite the fact that judicial independence was an important issue in the constitution that wanted judges and their rulings to be protected. The lingering issue assumed a new dimension on Dec 2, 1999 in the wake of the Supreme Court's 12-point directive in the "Mazder Hossain case". The case was named after the then general secretary of Bangladesh Judicial Service Association who along with 441 other judicial officers filed a writ petition with the High Court in 1995. The apex court gave the government six months to implement the 12 points. On June 18, 2001, it trashed a petition to review the verdict, making it mandatory for the government to separate the judiciary. The court kept on reminding the government of its responsibility to implement the judgment since. But excessive dependence on the bureaucracy led political governments to dither on the issue. The administrative magistrates, widely accused of corruption, delay and tyranny, were used by the political party in power to crush opponents and the governments pampered the executives all the time. The latest apolitical interim government finally set out to make the judicial system independent after two and a half centuries, just about the time when French political philosopher Charles Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu said in his 'The Spirit of Laws' in 1748 said a citizen cannot call himself free unless his government has separate judicial and administrative state organs to ensure his well being. During East Pakistan days, the provincial legislative council passed a bill in 1957 to separate the judiciary, but the bill was not gazetted by bureaucrats. In 1958, the Law Commission recommended the judicial magistrates be brought under the High Court, which too was shelved. After independence, article 22 of the Bangladesh constitution provided for the separation of judiciary from administration, but the fourth amendment to the constitution made the judiciary submissive to the administration. In 1976, the Law Commission recommended freeing judiciary in three phases in consultation with the 1957 bill. Pakistan and India separated the judiciary in 1973 and 1974 effectively by amending the 1898 Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), doing which is necessary. In Bangladesh, a 1987 bill proposed to amend the CrPC but the bill was not passed. Law minister Mirza Golam Hafiz made another aborted attempt to bring changes to the law in 1990. In 1996, his successor Abdul Matin Khasru, now a Supreme Court advocate, promised moving another bill for separation of the judiciary, but it failed. bdnews24
