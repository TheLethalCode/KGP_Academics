<TITLE> Warner Music withholds content from Nokia: WSJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 New York, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Warner Music Group is withholding its content from Nokia's new music Web site over concerns about illegal downloads, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday in its online edition. Warner has chosen not to sell its music through the Nokia Music Store Web site in part because another Nokia service -- a file-sharing Web site called Mosh -- is being used to distribute copyrighted material, the Journal said, citing sources familiar with the matter. Representatives from Warner Music and Nokia could not immediately be reached for comment on the report. Nokia spokesman Kari Tuutti confirmed to the newspaper that Warner was withholding its music content from Nokia's new downloading service, adding, "We are continuing discussions ... and we are hopeful that Warner will be a part of Nokia Music Store in the future." Nokia is the first handset maker to move strongly into the content space with services like Mosh, which is designed primarily for mobile usage, even though it can be accessed from a PC.
