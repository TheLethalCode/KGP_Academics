 Dhaka, October 31 (bdnews24.com)A Dhaka court Wednesday sent retired commodore Zulfiquar Ali, former chairman of the Chittagong Port Authority, to jail after his surrender in the GATCO graft case. Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Mizanur Rahman ordered Ali to jail. As the accused appealed at the time for first division status and medical treatment in prison, the judge ordered the jail authorities to take appropriate measures in line with the jail code. In the case filed by the Anticorruption Commission, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, her son Arafat Rahman Coco and the late shipping minister Akbar Hossain's son Ismail Hossain are also in jail. Abdur Rashid, the ACC prosecution officer, told bdnews24.com that the three of the 13 accused were absconding. On October 28, the court turned down a request for remanding accused Coco in custody for the second time, on health grounds. ACC deputy director Golam Shahriar Chowdhury said that in the graft case filed with Tejgaon Police Station on September 2, it was stated that the accused Khaleda Zia and Coco with others influenced the contract awarding authorities and as a result GATCO won a container handling deal breaching the conditions laid down in the tender, which caused the government to lose about Tk 1,000 crore. Khaleda and Coco were arrested in the case on September 3 and sent to jail. bdnew
