 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Friday said it would not want anyone to act in a way that could put the roadmap to elections at stake. The party's policymaking presidium member Tofail Ahmed said the government and the Election Commission work together to make sure that the roadmap got through. "We'd never like any quarters do anything which might threaten the election roadmap," he said to reporters at the party's Dhanmondi office. Tofail briefed reporters after a meeting of a sub-committee that is working out details on the Nov 4 dialogue for electoral reforms with the EC. The EC has already sat with various political parties to talk about a draft on electoral reforms prepared by the top polls office. It has said it will finalise the changes after taking views from the political parties. Acting president Zillur Rahman will lead the presidium members to the commission for the dialogue, Tofail said. What would be their agenda then in the dialogue? Tofail said they simply ask the EC to implement the roadmap. He said the party was blending the 31-point demand it had placed before the EC in 2005 under Khaleda Zia's administration with the new commission's draft proposals on electoral reforms. Party chief Sheikh Hasina at a rally in the city's Paltan ground had spelled out the proposals in that year but the then administration and the commission did not implement them. "We'll try to put an integrated framework taking into account both the Election Commission's draft proposal and the 31-point," said Tofail, a former minister in 1996-2001. He said they had detailed discussions on agenda in the meeting where party leaders such as presidium members Abdur Razzak and Matia Chowdhury and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam were also present. He asked the commission to allow them to take more than 10 members to the dialogue. Presidium members Zohra Tajuddin and Amir Hossain Amu may not join the dialogue. Zohra is sick while Amu's wife died of cancer in Singapore two days ago . Tofail expressed his sympathy to Amu for the loss of his wife. bdnews24
