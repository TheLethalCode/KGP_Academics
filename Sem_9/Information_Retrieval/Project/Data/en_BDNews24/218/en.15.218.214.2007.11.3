<TITLE> Clinton: Rivals complaining because she's winning </TITLE>

 CONCORD, NH, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Friday her male rivals attacked her at a debate this week not because she is a woman but because she is winning the race to be the party's presidential candidate. As bickering among the rival camps intensified, Clinton denied hiding behind her gender even as she was accused of doing just that by rival Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. Campaigning in New Hampshire, Clinton was asked if she thought other Democrats were taking aim at her at Tuesday night's debate because she is a woman. "No, I don't think they are piling on because I am a woman," she said. "They are piling on because I am winning." Clinton was in Concord registering to run in the state's political primary, traditionally one of the first nominating contests. Obama, the only black candidate in the US presidential race, told NBC's "Today" show that Clinton is widely viewed as a tough figure in national politics. "So it doesn't make sense for her, after having run that way for eight months, the first time that people start challenging her point of view, that suddenly she backs off and says, 'Don't pick on me,'" he said. "That is not, obviously, how we would expect her to operate if she were president." Obama said he hoped Clinton would wanted to be "treated like everybody else." Clinton, in a speech on Thursday, raised the gender issue by referring to the "all-boys club of presidential politics." Her rivals believed they had found a crack in Clinton's armor as they seek to gain on the front-runner with two months to go before the voting starts in Iowa. The presidential election is a year away. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who was active in outlining his differences with her at the debate, released a Web video called "The Politics of Parsing," accusing Clinton of "double-talk" on issues such as Iraq, Social Security and illegal immigration. At the same time, the Obama campaign demanded Clinton release records from her time as first lady in the 1990s. Rival campaigns and reporters would like access to the records in order to see what positions she took when her husband, Bill, was president. "It's time to turn the page on this kind of secrecy and restore trust in our government," said a memo from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. Former President Clinton came to the aid of his wife on Friday, saying in Redmond, Washington, that charges that he and his wife are delaying release of the records are "breathtakingly misleading." Not to be left out, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's campaign launched a campaign ad to run in New Hampshire questioning Clinton's experience and highlighting his own experience as former governor of Massachusetts and head of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. "She has never run anything. And the idea that she could learn to be president as an internship just doesn't make any sense," Romney said in the ad.
