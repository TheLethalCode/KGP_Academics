 By Fayen Wong SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oil leaped nearly 2 percent to top $96 for the first time on Thursday, extending the previous day's 5 percent surge after an unexpected sharp fall in US crude stocks and data showing strong economic growth. The rise toward oil's inflation-adjusted peak of $101.70 from April 1980 was also supported by a drop in the US dollar, which fell to record lows against the euro after the US Federal Reserve cut rates by a quarter percentage point. US oil for December delivery rose as high as $96.24 a barrel in electronic trade. By 0302 GMT it was up $1.57 at $96.13. December Brent crude also hit its record high of $91.63, up $1 on the day. Oil soared $4.15 or nearly 5 percent on Wednesday, its biggest one-day gain in 10 months, after US data showed an unexpected 3.9 million-barrel drop in crude stocks last week, most of it at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point. "The US inventory report has reaffirmed the belief that market conditions are tightening and oil prices are ratcheting up higher on that basis," said David Moore, a resource analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). Two rate cuts by the Fed to stave off fears of recession also have added liquidity to financial markets by making it cheaper to borrow, and some analysts say the extra cash has been drawn to energy markets. Oil prices have surged more than 50 percent since the start of the year, and have risen about 18 percent in the past month alone on winter supply worries, speculative buying and a succession of record lows in the US dollar. Prices are now nearing their highest even when adjusted for inflation, but the economy of the world's biggest energy consumer has shown surprising resilience to high oil prices, growing at a brisk clip in the third quarter. US GDP expanded at a 3.9 percent annual rate last quarter, the quickest pace since the first quarter of 2006, while private employers added 106,000 jobs in October, beating economists' forecast of 60,000 new jobs, data showed With OPEC resisting calls for more oil as it blames speculation and politics for oil's rise, analysts saw little standing in the way of a run at $100 a barrel. "It's just a matter of time... Everything you see now are bullish factors, so there is no reason for you to sell at the moment," said Ken Hasegawa, commodity derivatives sales manager of Fimat Japan Inc. Iran warned the United States on Wednesday it would find itself in a "quagmire deeper than Iraq" if it attacked the Islamic state, and Russia intensified efforts for a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear row with the West (Additional reporting by Jiwon Chung in
