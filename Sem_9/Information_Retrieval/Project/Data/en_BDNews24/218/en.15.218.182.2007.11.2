<TITLE> Myanmar to kick out top UN official </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Myanmar's military junta is kicking out the UN's top resident diplomat for highlighting the country's deepening economic crisis, casting a shadow over a planned visit this weekend by special envoy Ibrahim Gambari. UN officials said on Friday that country chief Charles Petrie had been summoned to the former Burma's new capital, Naypyitaw, for an official dressing down for a statement he released on the Oct. 24 United Nations Day. After the meeting, Petrie and his colleagues were given a letter saying the military government would not be renewing his credentials, which expire "pretty much now", a Yangon-based diplomat said. "They were basically not very happy with the statement," one U.N. official told Reuters in Bangkok. "The government has emphasised that they do not want him to continue to work in Myanmar." It is not known when Petrie would actually leave the country, but it is hard to see him working alongside Gambari, due to arrive on Saturday for a second visit since September's bloody crackdown on monk-led pro-democracy protests. Gambari's mission is supposed to persuade the junta to enter serious talks about political reform with detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who won a 1990 election landslide but was denied power by the army. In the statement, Petrie said the protests that started in mid-August against shock increases in fuel prices and snowballed into a major anti-junta uprising were indicators of the dire state of the economy after 45 years of military rule. "The events clearly demonstrated the everyday struggle to meet basic needs and the urgent necessity to address the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the country," it said. One of Asia's brightest economic prospects when it won independence from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has become one of its most desperate cases after a series of disastrous experiments with home-grown socialism. It has also been riven by decades of ethnic civil war and, in the last 10 years, some US and European sanctions. According to the UN's World Food Programme, five million people out of a population of 56 million do not have enough food. One third of children under five are underweight, and 10 percent are classified as "wasted", or acutely malnourish
