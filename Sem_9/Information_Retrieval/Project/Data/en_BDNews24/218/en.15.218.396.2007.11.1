 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com)  Law and justice adviser Mainul Hosein Thursday stressed the importance of judicial activism and integrity in improving judicial services, at a ceremony marking the separation of the judiciary from the executive branch. The law adviser to the caretaker government said, "We fought for the country's freedom so that we can live with our rights and liberty protected under a democratic dispensation." He said judicial separation was not "a favour to the judges," and said it was now "for the judges to... win [the] people's full and clear confidence." "It is only through personal integrity and good conscience that judges can ensure people's confidence in the judiciary." Mainul explained the objectives of the caretaker government in the process of judicial separation: "Corruption and abuse of power prevailed over the rule of law and justice. The present caretaker government assumed responsibility with [an] expressed commitment to salvage democracy and the rule of law." "In the past the judiciary was not allowed independence for the simple reason of not allowing democracy to function." The law adviser said judges would have to uphold high standards of integrity to achieve the goals of an independent judiciary. "It is not right to think that Judges have no accountability. Judges have their accountability to society and their accountability must be judged by their conscience and oath of their office.' "It has been well recognised by famous judges that if the judges decay, the power of contempt of court will not save them." "The other side of the coin is that they must be above suspicion." He downplayed an earlier row between some administrative officers and some legal professionals, saying, "What is unique about this achievement is that both the judiciary and the executive ultimately put in their best efforts to attain the common goal." The law adviser again stressed the role of the judicial branch and the legal profession in improving judicial services, saying, "Judicial activism for justice and good governance is well-recognised in all democracies. So let us move ahead together to establish true democracy for building a 'just society'." In his concluding remarks of the function at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, Mainul said: "The rights and liberty guaranteed by our constitution are useless if the judiciary is not free and independent." Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed inaugurated the activities of the Dhaka District Judicial Magistracy and Dhaka Metropolitan Magistracy at the ceremony. bd
