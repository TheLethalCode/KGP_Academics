 JOHANNESBURG, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's leading wicket-taker Shaun Pollock has been recalled for the first Test against New Zealand starting in Johannesburg next Thursday. Pollock, who has taken 416 wickets in 107 Tests, has been added to the 11 players who clinched a series win in Pakistan last month. "The team deserves a full vote of confidence after their magnificent series win in Pakistan," South African chief selector Joubert Strydom said in a press release on Friday. Pollock was not selected for either of the two Tests in Pakistan and there will be fierce competition for places in an strong South African attack. Squad - Herschelle Gibbs, Graeme Smith, Hashim Amla, Jacques Kallis, Ashwell Prince, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Andre Nel, Paul Harris, Dale Steyn, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock
