 Dhaka, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)  Transparency International chairperson Huguette Labelle Friday asked the government to strengthen the anticorruption drive ahead of national polls. The TI chief, who is on a visit here, said judicial separation was a major step against corruption and said Bangladesh was on the right track. She was speaking on global corruption at BRAC Centre in Mohakhali at an event organised by Transparency International, Bangladeshlocal chapter of the Berlin-based international corruption watchdog. Labelle said the next national election would be very important for Bangladesh. Many former members of parliament and political leaders were somehow involved with corruption, she said, adding that the Election Commission must be vigilant so that voters are able to cast their own vote. Labelle said the government must be transparent to the people, especially when making big purchases. She also suggested overhauling the Anticorruption Commission (ACC) and related organisations to make the anticorruption drive a success. She said the ACC was on the right track. The TI boss said transparency should be ensured at all offices involved in preparing the national budget including the auditor general's office. Labelle said the private sector was mainly responsible for corruption, describing it as a global problem. Many big oil and gas companies were facing graft allegations, the TI boss said. Multinational companies were spreading corruption to small countries, Labelle added. A TI survey of over 60,000 people across the world about their impression of who was most corrupt found that lawmakers were seen as the most corrupt people in society. Political parties followed in second place followed by the police administration in third place, she added. Earlier in the day, Labelle spoke at a seminar on the role of the mass media in resisting corruption. bdnews24
