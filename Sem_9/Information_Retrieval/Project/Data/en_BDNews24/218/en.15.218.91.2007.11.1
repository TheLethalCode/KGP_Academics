 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)Stocks ended lower for a fifth-day Thursday amid profit-taking in most sectors, though banking stocks led the losses. "I don't think a slump has gripped the market. Investors are rather chasing in profits. Some are watching the trend," said Zaiul Haque Khondker, managing director of state-run investment bank ICB (Investment Corporation of Bangladesh). The market dipped from morning to midday trade due to profit taking. It retrieved some points on a buying pull before the closing, but remained negative. Banks, except for Z category or low quality banks, moved down. Losses in the issues of most other sectors such as power, mutual funds and pharmaceuticals added additional pace to the market decline. "It's okay. Nothing to worry about," said Yawer Sayeed, who helps manage over Tk 1.0 billion in funds. "Everybody is repositioning themselves," he added. The DGEN or general index was down 14.49 points or 0.50 percent to 2836.31. The DSI or all-share price index declined 3.37 points or 0.13 percent to 2411.98. The DSE-20 shed 12.53 points or 0.56 percent to 2194.65. Turnover also declined to Tk 1.77 billion as merchant banks continued their margin loan adjustment. A total of 12,648,979 shares traded with 73 scrips advancing, 128 losing and 23 remaining unchanged. Trust Bank, topmost on the turnover table, slipped 1.12 percent to Tk 1081.5. Market major BRAC Bank dipped 0.15 percent to Tk 1477.25 due to profit taking. Atlas Bangladesh, third most active issue, posted gains after it offered 125 percent cash dividend and one bonus shares against four existing shares. Atlas ended at Tk 504.6, up .09 percent from the previous day. Social Investment Bank, a low quality issue, continued rising, and added 1.59 percent to Tk 461.75. UCBL gained 0.14 percent to Tk 4740.5 due to post-midday buying. Pharmaceuticals, mutual funds and power stocks traded down. Beximco Pharma led the losses in its sector, while Grameen 1 MF led mutual funds down. All the major indices on the Chittagong Stock Exchange declined, led by banking and energy stocks. Of the issues traded, 41 advanced, 72 dropped and six held steady. Turnover dropped to Tk 245.68 million from trading of 2,906,336 shares. bdne
