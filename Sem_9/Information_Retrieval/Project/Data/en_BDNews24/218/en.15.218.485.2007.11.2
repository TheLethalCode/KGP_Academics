 ANKARA Fri Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States promised to redouble efforts on Friday against Kurdish guerrillas in an attempt to stave off Turkish military intervention in northern Iraq that could destabilise the region. US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, visiting Ankara amid growing anti-US sentiment among Turks, called the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) a "common enemy." But she did not spell out what steps Washington was contemplating. "We all need to redouble our efforts and the United States is committed to redoubling our efforts," Rice told a news conference with Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan. Babacan clearly expressed Turkish frustration at the lack of action so far. "This is where the words end and action needs to start," he said. Ankara says numerous pledges by U.S. and Iraqi authorities have failed to materialise and it has warned that unless immediate action is taken Turkey will launch a major cross-border operation to crack down on PKK guerrillas using northern Iraq as a base to carry out deadly attacks in Turkey. Turkey, a NATO member with the alliance's second-biggest army, has sent up to 100,000 troops to the Iraqi border, backed by tanks, artillery and aircraft. But Iraq and the United States have urged Ankara to refrain from a major operation in an area that has so far been spared the worst of the violence in Iraq. "No one should doubt the commitment of the United States to this issue ... We have a common enemy and we need a common approach," Rice said. Rice also held talks with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who is going to Washington next week for discussions with President George W. Bush on how to tackle an estimated 3,000 PKK guerrillas operating freely in northern Iraq. Rice said measures on how to deal with the PKK would be discussed at a meeting between herself and ministers from Turkey and Iraq on the sidelines of an Iraq neighbours' conference in Istanbul on Saturday. STRAINED TIES Turkish-U.S. ties are at a low following a resolution passed by a U.S. congressional committee last month that called the 1915 massacre of Armenians by Ottoman Turks a genocide. Rice hopes to heal any rifts from that. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center in Washington put the U.S. favourability rating in Turkey at 9 percent and found Turks see the United States as the single biggest threat to their nation's security. Babacan said Rice's visit to Turkey, which is one of the main supply routes to U.S. troops in neighouring Iraq, marked the start of closer cooperation between the NATO allies in combating the threat from the PKK. Erdogan is under pressure to act as the military and much of public opinion doubt Washington or Baghdad will crack down on the PKK; nor do they expect firm action from Masoud Barzani, the head of the Kurdish semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq. "The subject on our agenda is an operation, not a war. We hope that this operation will not be necessary," Erdogan said in a speech to officials from his ruling centre-right AK Party. Turkish diplomats say the meeting with Bush will now be key to determining whether an incursion takes place or not in an area that has a complex mix of potentially antagonistic ethnic groups including Arabs and Turkmens as well as Kurds. Analysts question Ankara's willingness to authorise a major incursion, saying Turkish leaders hope their rhetoric will push US and Iraqi authorities into acting against the PKK. Rice said short-term measures included better information sharing with the Turks and making it harder for the PKK to move around in northern Iraq. Turkey wants more and has threatened to go in alone to shut down PKK camps and arrest rebel leaders in northern Iraq. "Any such operation will result in the biggest defeat and losses for the Turkish army in the 23 years of the war," PKK commander Bahoz Erdal said, according to the Europe-based Firat news agency, which often carries PKK statements. Turkey plans economic sanctions that would target the PKK and groups providing them with support in northern Iraq, a move Rice said the United States could foll
