 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed Thursday inaugurated the activities of Dhaka District Judicial Magistracy and Dhaka Metropolitan Magistracy. "It is a great day for the nation and there is no doubt about it," he said in his speech to the huge audience at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre in Dhaka. "From today the judiciary is separated," he said. He said the separation of the judiciary from the executive came after two hundred years of colonial rule and 36 years of independence. "This glorious day will forever be remembered as a milestone in our forward march towards establishing good governance and the rule of law in our country," Fakhruddin said. Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, who attended the programme as special guest, said the separation was the outcome of the "long-felt national desire". He said he hoped the judiciary would work "to establish justification of separating the judiciary from the executive. The chief justice looked to the executive for cooperation and said: "The executive will hopefully play (a) supportive role." Law and justice adviser Mainul Hosein, who presided over the "historic" event, emphasised judicial activism which he said is "well recognised in all democracies". "Let's move ahead together to build a just society," he said, minutes before the chief adviser formally inaugurated the Dhaka District Judicial Magistracy and Dhaka Metropolitan Magistracy. The programme came to an end at 11:15am. bdnews24
