<TITLE> Georgia's Saakashvili elicits protests and praise </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 40,000 people demanding early elections protested on Friday against President Mikhail Saakashvili in the biggest show of unrest since the 2003 Rose Revolution that swept him to power. Saakashvili says he has chalked up considerable successes in his nearly four years in office. His opponents say his rule is a failure. Here are the main arguments for and against: ECONOMY FOR: Last year the World Bank named Georgia the top reformer in the world. Gross Domestic Product grew by 9.6 percent in 2006, and officials forecast 2007 growth of 14.5 percent. The government has boosted revenues by tightening up administration of the tax system, private investment is up and there has been a crackdown on corruption. Per capita income is up from $700 a year in 2003 to $1,500 now. AGAINST: Many people complain their living standards are not improving fast enough. A crackdown on the black market in cigarettes and alcohol left thousands of street vendors without jobs. Growing incomes are offset by rising inflation and the fact that many Georgians are, since the reforms, having to pay tax and utilities bills in full. There is also unhappiness that the government is dramatically increasing the defence budget instead of raising pensions. The opposition allege corruption in Saakashvili's own team. DEMOCRACY FOR: U.S. President George W. Bush called Georgia under Saakashvili a "beacon of democracy." The Georgian president says he wants to take his country into the European Union. Unlike many of its neighbours, Georgia has a feisty opposition and vocal media. AGAINST: Saakashvili's opponents say he uses a selective application of the law to sideline his political opponents. They point to criminal charges brought against ex-defence minister Irakly Okruashvili, days after he said he was setting up an opposition party. Critics say Saakashvili's style is authoritarian and he bulldozes individuals' rights. There was anger in Tbilisi when, as part of a plan to spruce up the scruffy capital, many people were evicted from their homes. RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA FOR: Georgians feel their big neighbour Russia has for years been hummiliating them by propping up separatists in Georgia's Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions who reject Tbilisi's rule. Saakashvili has promised to restore central control in the regions and uses uncompromising rhetoric when talking about Russia. Many Georgians say they back his stance. AGAINST: An embargo imposed by Moscow after Tbilisi briefly arrested four Russian soldiers on spying charges has hit many peoples' wallets. Direct flights to Moscow have been stopped, it is nearly impossible for Georgians to receive Russian visas and Russia has banned imports of Georgian wine, a key earn
