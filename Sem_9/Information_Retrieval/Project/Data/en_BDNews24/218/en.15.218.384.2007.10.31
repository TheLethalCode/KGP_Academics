 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - Stocks closed mixed Wednesday as turnover declined as merchant banks were curtailing loans to clients, and because investors were cashing in on recent gains on the market. "Merchant banks appear to be adjusting their loans and profit-taking is continuing," said Dhaka Stock Exchange chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed Khan. Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance, said investors' purchasing capacity eroded because merchant banks were adjusting their loans. The main DGEN or general index fell 4.54 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2850.81 as investors cashed in on banking sector stocks. The DSI or all-share price index, buoyed by Rupali Bank, however added 10.47 points or 0.43 percent to close at 2415.35. The Dhaka bourse halted the trade of Rupali Bank shares to make inquiries following a sudden surge in share prices. Rupali Bank grew 11.93 percent to Tk 2796 per share. The DSE-20 blue chip index dipped 4.0 points or 0.18 percent to 2207.19. Losers beat gainers 106 to 87. Some 21 issues held steady. Turnover slumped to Tk 1.69 billion from Tk 2.02 billion the previous day. A total of 1,27,25,443 shares changed hands. Trust Bank, the most active share, recovered from losses and added 0.20 percent to Tk 1093.75. "Some investors have stopped to catch their breath and are content to watch the action from the sidelines, others are busy cashing in," he said. BRAC Bank closed at Tk 1479.5, down 0.77 percent from the previous day. Social Investment Bank continued its rally and finished at Tk 454.5, adding 0.05 percent. Banking majors National Bank, Islami Bank, and UCBL share prices dropped as profit-taking continued. Market heavyweight Power Grid Company of Bangladesh, the day's second most active issue, slipped 0.55 percent to Tk 623.50. Other power sector issues advanced, however. Padma Oil gained 2.19 percent to Tk 1145.70. All the major Chittagong Stock Exchange indices, except for the CSE-30, ended lower. Some 57 shares gained, 61 lost and five held steady.
