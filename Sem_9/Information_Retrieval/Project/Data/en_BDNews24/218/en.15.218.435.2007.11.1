<TITLE> Abuse of power, not bribery is main problem: ACC boss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com) - Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury Thursday said abuse of power was the main problem in Bangladesh, not bribery. "Many people abuse power without taking any financial advantage," Chowdhury said at a press conference in the ACC office. He declined to give any details about the proposal to make the ACC a fully autonomous body, but said: "I can only say that the government is very much sympathetic to us. It has helped us on various matters." "It would be easier for our work if the ACC was made an autonomous body. We would be able to implement our plans more swiftly," he added. Asked about recent allegations of corruption related to land deals, Chowdhury said the ACC was not authorised to deal with 85 percent of such land-related allegations it received. "Some other government bodies have been working on these issues. We will send the allegations to the relevant departments," he said. The ACC chief expressed regret over his recent comment on the Official Secrets Act at a function organised by the Reporters Against Corruption. "It was not right of me to make the comment." The former army chief had said at the function: "Reporters do not need to care about the Official Secrets Act." bdnews
