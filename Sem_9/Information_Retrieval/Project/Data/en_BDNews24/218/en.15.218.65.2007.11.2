 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Upbeat US jobs data briefly boosted the dollar and helped European stocks to cut losses on Friday, easing concerns about credit troubles and the health of banks which had weighed on sentiment earlier. US employers added 166,000 new non-farm payrolls in October, twice as many as economists had forecast. US stock futures jumped, indicating a stronger open on Wall Street. Treasury prices fell while rate futures slipped, with markets still implying a 60 percent chance of a US interest rate cut in December. Strong data helped to calm jitters about the health of banks which resurfaced after brokerages downgraded Citigroup and Bank of America on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve cut US interest rates to limit economic damage from the housing market's downturn. "Overall (it was) a pretty good report ... It would suggest the US economy is producing jobs so I think that would remove speculation that we get a further Fed rate cut in the near term," said Shaun Osborne, senior currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto. US stock futures were up 0.4 percent while the MSCI main world equity index was down 0.4 percent, off earlier lows. The index hit all-time highs hit on Thursday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index also limited losses to stand down 0.4 percent on the day. Shares in UK bank Barclays fell more than 6 percent at one point on market talk of funding worries and speculation it was telling analysts to trim profit forecasts. The dollar briefly jumped against the euro, before reversing to hit all-time lows around $1.4525. MONEY MARKETS Concerns about the fallout from U.S. subprime mortgages sparked a sell-off in risky assets and pushed up the cost of interbank lending in August and September, prompting the world's major central banks to inject liquidity to prevent the financial system from seizing up. Dollar interbank lending rates hit new 1-1/2 year lows on Friday, extending their fall following this week's Federal Reserve interest rate cut. London interbank offered rates for three-month dollar deposits fell to 4.86500 percent at their daily fixing, their lowest since March 2006. However, the spreads between interbank lending rates and Fed funds rates -- a key gauge of money market stress -- stood at 36.5 basis points for three-month dollar deposits, above the historical average of around 15 bps. The iTraxx Crossover index, the most widely watched indicator of European credit market sentiment, widened by 6 basis points to 344 bps. It was a blowout in this index which triggered credit concerns in August. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened by 2 bps, while emerging market stocks were down 1.2 percent. The December Bund future was up 5 ticks. US light crude was up 0.8 percent at $94.28 a barrel. Concerns over the US economy had pulled prices off this week's record high above $96, although they are up more than 86 percent since January. Gold stood at $795.90. Analysts say the recent surge in these commodity prices has increased concerns about inflation, which could weigh on risky assets in the near term. "There are worries over housing, over banks and oil prices pushing higher, and so you have concerns about valuations," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Manageme
