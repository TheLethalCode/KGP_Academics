<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, England, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The battle for the Premier League title is not just a two-horse race between champions Manchester United and unbeaten leaders Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson said on Friday. The two sides, who meet in Saturday's early kickoff (1245 GMT), are level on 26 points, with Arsenal top on goals scored. "People are saying the title will rest between ourselves and Arsenal, but then you look at Chelsea's form of last week," Ferguson told a news conference, referring to Chelsea's 6-0 win over Manchester City. "They returned to sparkling football and were really impressive and with the strength of Liverpool's squad you can't discount them. "At this moment in time, both us and Arsenal are enjoying a good spell. But I know in my experience there are rough days ahead. You might lose a game or two. It's a tough league, but I would like to be top of the league tomorrow night." United have won their last eight league games and go to Arsenal boosted by the return of striker Louis Saha and midfielder Michael Carrick after injury. Captain Gary Neville, who has just returned to fitness after seven months out, will not travel to the Emirates Stadium but aside from that, Ferguson is only missing long-term injury victims Paul Scholes, Mikael Silvestre, Park Ji-sung and Ben Foster. "It's the strongest position we've been in so far this season and it could not have come at a better time, because for big games like tomorrow you hope you're going to have your strongest team available. Apart from Paul Scholes, I think we've got that," he said. "I could not be happier with the form. We have scored four goals four times in a row, which we have never done since 1907." Arsene Wenger's Arsenal, inspired by Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas, have been lauded for their high-quality football this season and with United also now in full flow, Ferguson was relishing the confrontation. "Both teams will be hell-bent on making sure they win tomorrow," he said. "That's the kind of mouth-watering aspect about it and anyone who's got a ticket will be rubbing their hands because without question, the form of both teams, the football they are playing and the goals they are scoring points to a big occasion.
