 Madrid, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Spanish court Wednesday found 21 of the 28 people guilty of involvement in the deadliest attack linked to al Qaeda in Europe, the Madrid train bombings which killed 191 people on March 11, 2004. Following are details of some court cases concerning attacks or planned attacks in Europe involving more than one defendant: BRITAIN - November 2006 - Dhiren Barot, a senior al Qaeda operative, who admitted a plot to blow up the New York Stock Exchange and carry out attacks in Britain with gas-filled limousines and a "dirty bomb", is jailed for a minimum of 30 years. Seven other Britons linked to the same plot were jailed for a total of 136 years in June 2007. April 2007 - Five Britons -- Omar Khyam, Anthony Garcia, Jawad Akbar, Waheed Mahmood and Salahuddin Amin -- are jailed for life for plotting al Qaeda-inspired bomb attacks across Britain on targets ranging from nightclubs to trains and a shopping centre. Prosecutors said they planned to use 600 kg (1,300 lb) of ammonium nitrate fertiliser to make bombs in revenge for Britain's support for the United States after the 9/11 attacks. July 2007 - Moroccan-born Younes Tsouli, Briton Waseem Mughal and Jordanian-born Tariq al-Daour are sentenced to jail terms of between six-and-a-half and 10 years for inciting terrorism over the Internet. July 2007 - Muktah Said Ibrahim, Yassin Hassan Omar, Ramzi Mohammed and Hussein Osman are jailed for 40 years each for conspiracy to murder in connection with failed suicide bombings on London's transport system on July 21, 2005. FRANCE - June 2006 - A French court convicts 25 Islamist militants of planning terrorist attacks in Paris and of recruiting fighters to send to Chechnya and Afghanistan. Four ringleaders, who were either Algerian nationals or of Algerian descent, receive jail terms of between nine and 10 years. -- July 2007 - Eight men of Turkish, Moroccan and French nationality are found guilty of associating with criminals engaged in a terrorist undertaking and handed sentences ranging from a year's suspended jail to 10 years in prison. The men were suspected of belonging to a France-based cell of the Moroccan Islamic Combatant Group, which carried out the May 16, 2003, attacks in Casablanca which killed 45 people. The court found no direct link between the men on trial and the Casablanca attacks. GERMANY - October 2005. Four Arab men accused of planning to bomb Jewish targets on the orders of militant leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi receive sentences of between five and eight years. SPAIN - September 2005. A court convicts 18 of 24 accused, mostly of belonging to or cooperating with al Qaeda. -- October 2007 - A Spanish court finds 21 people guilty out of 28 charged over the 2004 Madrid train bombings that killed 191 people. Seven were acquitted of involvement. Moroccan Jamal Zougam and Spaniard Emilio Suarez Trashorras were both given sentences of thousands of years, although under Spanish law can only serve a maximum of 40 years. All the suspects pleaded innocent and those found guilty are expected to appeal against their sentences.
