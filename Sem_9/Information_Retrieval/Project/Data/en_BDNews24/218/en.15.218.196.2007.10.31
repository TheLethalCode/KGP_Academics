 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - The government is planning four new roads in the capital to ease traffic congestion, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Wednesday. The CA doubted that his government would be able to launch a mass transit system before handing power over to an elected government in 2008. Speaking to editors at the Chief Adviser's office, Fakhruddin said a road would be constructed straight from Bijoy Sarani to Tejgaon once Rangs Bhaban was demolished. A flyover is planned for the stretch from Banani 11 to Gulshan to ease traffic jams in the area. A road from Zia Colony to Mirpur and another from Begunbari Hatirjheel to Bishwa Road will also be constructed. Officials said roads make up nearly 8 percent of the capital's total area. The figure should have been at least 25 percent, they said. No new roads have been built in Dhaka in the last decade, but there are a million new cars on the road. bdnews
