<TITLE> UK rates to hold in Nov, but cut expected early '08 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British interest rates look set to stay on hold in November thanks to resilient economic growth, with only a handful of analysts looking for a cut compared with one in four a few weeks ago, a Reuters poll showed. Fifty-five of 60 economists in a survey taken Oct 30-Nov 1 said the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 5.75 percent on Nov. 8. Only five forecast a quarter percentage point reduction, compared with 14 of 52 in a poll on Oct. 17. Economists put a median 25 percent probability rates will fall on Thursday, small chances but still significant. The majority of economists -- 47 of 59 -- said rates would fall at least 25 basis points by the end of the first quarter 2008. News that the British economy expanded at its fastest annual pace in three years in the third quarter mostly put to rest speculation that the Monetary Policy Committee is about to cut rates, although the U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed policy on Wednesday for the second time in the past few months. One MPC member, David Blanchflower, voted to cut rates at the October meeting but analysts consider it unlikely that a majority will come around to his point of view soon. "We would expect them to continue to bide their time and allow more data to come in on the extent of any economic slowdown before changing rates," said John Hawksworth, head of macroeconomics at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "With the UK economy as a whole apparently still growing slightly above trend in Q3, there is certainly no immediate need for such a cut." Evidence of any serious damage so far to the British economy from the credit crunch that began in August has been scant and the British property market, while slowing, is not unravelling rapidly like its American counterpart. An industry report on Thursday showed retail sales growth in October eased more than expected to its weakest pace in nearly a year but stores remained optimistic about future sales. MARKETS IN BETTER SHAPE Banks are now more willing to lend to each other in money markets after a period where they were no longer functioning properly and the FTSE-100 index of leading shares is not far off an all-time high. At the same time, the pound has reached a 26-year high above $2.08 , which in itself has a dampening effect on the economy. A report on Thursday showed British manufacturing activity growth slowed to its weakest pace this year in October. BoE Chief Economist Charles Bean said in a speech late on Wednesday that the turmoil in financial markets would probably soften the growth outlook but that policymakers can't afford to lower their guard against inflation risks. The BoE's forecasts in the November Inflation Report will be crucial to determining the future path for rates. Inflation, which the BoE targets at 2.0 percent, has been below target over the past few months -- and weaker than analysts expected. But analysts have also seized on recent remarks by MPC member Kate Barker, who has in the past been viewed as more inclined than other committee members to cut rates, as evidence the BoE is not in a hurry to move. "We are still fearful that recent events in financial markets could result in a sharp slowdown in the economy, and indeed, forward looking indicators are weakening," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec, who changed his forecast for a November cut to February. "We would not be surprised if the MPC did cut the Bank rate next week, but we concede that recent news has tilted the balance of probabilities towards rates remaining on hold for now."
