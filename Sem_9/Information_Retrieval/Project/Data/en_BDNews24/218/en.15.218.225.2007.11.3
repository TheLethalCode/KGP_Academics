 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's constitution was suspended on Saturday as President Pervez Musharraf invoked emergency powers, state run Pakistan Television reported. Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and eight other judges refused to endorse the provisional constitutional order issued by the president, and Chaudhry has been told his "services are no longer required", private news channels said. Chaudhry and his fellow judges, according to a Reuters journalist, were still inside the court building on Constitution Avenue, the broad thoroughfare where the presidency and the National Assembly are also located. The road has been sealed off by troops.
