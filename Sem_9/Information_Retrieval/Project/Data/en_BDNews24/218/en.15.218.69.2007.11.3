 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- President General Pervez Musharraf Saturday said Pakistan's sovereignty would have been jeopardised if timely action had not been taken. He said this in his address to the nation on state-run television after imposing emergency rule in Pakistan. Musharraf imposed the state of emergency, deploying troops and sacking a top judge in a bid to reassert his flagging authority against political rivals and Islamist militants. Nuclear-armed Pakistan's internal security has deteriorated sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks by al Qaeda-inspired militants, including one that killed 139 people. State-run Pakistan Television said Musharraf had suspended the constitution and declared an emergency, ending weeks of speculation that the general who seized power in a 1999 coup might impose emergency rule or martial law. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, on a visit to Turkey, criticised the measures as "highly regrettable" and said she hoped Pakistan would have a free and fair election in January as promised. Witnesses said troops were deployed at Pakistan Television and radio stations, and most phone lines were down. Other troops sealed off the thoroughfare where the presidency building, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court are located. Shots were heard in several neighbourhoods of Karachi, where there is strong support for former opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, a former prime minister. Television channels said that Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, whose earlier dismissal in March marked the beginning of a slide in Musharraf's popularity, had been told that his services were "no longer required". Chaudhry had been reinstated in July.
