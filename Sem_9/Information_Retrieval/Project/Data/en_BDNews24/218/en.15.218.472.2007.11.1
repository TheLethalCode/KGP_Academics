 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) -- Law and information adviser Mainul Hosein Thursday clarified that the separation of the judicial from the executive branch did not mean that it would become detached from the government. "The judiciary will have to work in cooperation with the executive branch through discussions," the adviser said. Mainul said judges should not be answerable to the government's ministers and lawmakers. "There has to be transparency in the appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and trial courts," Mainul told reporters in a briefing at the law ministry. The adviser said the establishment of a separate Judicial Service Commission and Judicial Secretariat was necessary to pave the way for a fully independent judiciary. "The government is currently unable to establish the secretariat due to a lack of funds. If any government in future wants to establish one, they can do so." "We are an interim government. We are here to establish good governance in the country." "The judiciary has to be made independent for good governance to thrive. We have started that task," Mainul said. The advisor said no one from the executive branch would now be able to interfere in the crucial work of the judiciary, but judges would have to work hard to build a neutral system. "The next administration will have to be alert. The courts are the people's last resort," said Mainul. Unlike the judiciary, the adviser said, there is no scope to appeal against any decision of the executive. "Trial courts have to be accountable to the High Court. They will also face punishment if they do not work properly," he said. The adviser stressed the need for vigilance to ensure the whole legal system remained honest. Mainul added that he felt salaries in the judicial system should be enhanced to make sure corruption does not get a foothold and justice prevails. bdnew
