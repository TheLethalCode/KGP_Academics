 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - The government has issued an ordinance, raising the amount of tax-exempt income from savings certificates from Tk 25,000 to Tk 150,000 per year. The government amended the Income Tax Ordinance following a decision taken by the interim cabinet on October 6. "...No tax shall be deducted if the total amount of interest does not exceed one lakh and fifty thousand taka during the income year," the amended ordinance, signed by President Iajuddin Ahmed, said. It however added, "Any tax so deducted shall not be treated as final discharge of tax liability under this ordinance." "I hope the ordinance will help solve the problems resulting from the imposition of income tax on income from savings certificates," said Ali Ahmed, member of Income Tax Policy Division of the National Board of Revenue (NBR). The NBR earlier levied a 10 percent tax on interest earnings from savings certificates, deducting the tax at source if interest earnings exceeded Tk 25,000 a year. This resulted in many investors, especially among lower income groups, pulling out of fixed income instruments and opting instead to invest on the stock market. The sales of savings certificates in July-August of 2007 dropped 10.74 percent to Tk 2,547.62 crore from Tk 2854.10 crore in the same period a year ago. But the repayment amount increased to 13.82 percent from 8.84 percent a year earlier. "This measure will rapidly reverse the declining trend in savings certificates investments. It will also restore small investors' confidence in fixed income instruments," said National Savings Directorate director Saifuddin Ahmed Mojumder. bdnews24.
