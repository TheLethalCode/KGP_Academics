<TITLE> Rebels a new headache for deepwater oil in Nigeria </TITLE>

 ABOARD BONGA, Nigeria, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Young Edohore has grown used to most of the risks associated with living and working on an oil production vessel 80 miles (120 km) off the coast of Nigeria -- even the sharks in the ocean below. The hazards of handling high pressure oil and gas on a confined offshore platform have been carefully assessed by Royal Dutch Shell over decades operating in Britain's North Sea. But the threat of militant attack is a big new headache for an industry already testing the limits of its ability in the search for new reserves. "We have not seen militants here, but we have had threats," said Edohore, a 30-year-old engineer who lives half his life on the 300,000-tonne Bonga facility. "We have controls for operational hazards, but no control for human hazards and if they come it would be very disastrous," he said. Militant attacks on oilfields closer to the shore have cut Nigerian output by a fifth over the past two years, and the groups demanding greater autonomy for Nigeria's southern oil heartland are reaching further and further out to sea. Last Friday, rebels seized six foreign oil workers from an Italian oil facility, the Mystras, located 53 miles (85 km) offshore. They were released on Tuesday. DEEP WATER Bonga is the first of a string of new oilfields in the world's eighth-largest exporter located in ocean depths of at least 1,000 metres, mostly about 100 miles offshore. The world oil industry is pushing the limits of technology by producing oil at these depths, developing remote-controlled equipment capable of withstanding huge atmospheric pressure. Alone, Bonga pumps 225,000 barrels a day from wells on the seabed into the storage tanks located in the hull of the giant converted oil tanker. The crude is exported via a buoy floating a few hundred metres away. Four similar developments -- known in the industry as floating production, storage and offtake vessels -- in Nigeria will account for 800,000 barrels a day by the end of next year. Similar projects are also under way in nearby Equatorial Guinea and Angola, making the Gulf of Guinea one of the world's deep water oil hot spots. Offshore installation manager Cliff Pain says any incursion onto Bonga would be handled like any other emergency: a helicopter crash, fire or gas release, for example. "We have a performance standard that we have to recover all 164 personnel behind the blast wall within 8 minutes," he said, referring to a protective wall between the processing units and the living quarters designed to withstand a "worst-case scenario" explosion. Most of the safety measures have been drawn up with obvious hazards in mind such as dealing with highly flammable gas and liquids under high pressure in a confined space. But Shell has added a few extra features on Bonga, including anti-climb paint on the vessel walls and a ship with naval personnel on board to patrol the perimeter 24 hours a day. "They won't engage people who carry out an incursion, but they are there to discourage," Pain said. The best insurance policy against attack is the 80 miles of ocean between the steel leviathan and the coast of the Niger Delta, he said. As for the sharks circling the ship, the British oil veteran doesn't see them as a threat. "When the guys drop the mascerated food it's an amazing sight. Fish that you would dream about catching almost within touching distance," said Pain, a keen angler. "One of my biggest regrets is not being able to stick something in the water to lure one."
