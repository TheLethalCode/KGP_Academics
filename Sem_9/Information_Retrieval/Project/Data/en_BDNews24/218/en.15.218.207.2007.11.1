<TITLE> UK govt to step in to end horse racing levy deadlock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British government said on Thursday it would step in to end a deadlock between the horse racing industry and bookmakers over how much gambling firms pay the industry. Ruffled by the racing industry's move to break their near monopoly on racing coverage and data, bookmakers originally demanded a halving in the amount of money they pay to horse racing. Firms such as Ladbrokes, William Hill and Coral currently pay 10 percent of the profits they make on horse racing bets to the industry, but have argued they should now pay less if they have to shell out for the new TurfTV service. James Purnell, the government minister that oversees the gambling industry, will now step in to settle the deadlock by April. It is only the second time in 15 years that the government has had to intervene in this way. "We regret that negotiations between the parties have failed and that Department for Culture, Media and Sport will again be responsible for determining the levy," DCMS said in a statement. "We will now begin work to decide the levy for the 2008/09 financial year," it added.
