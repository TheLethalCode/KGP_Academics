<TITLE> Kenyan politicians "behaving badly" before polls </TITLE>

 By Wangui Kanina NAIROBI, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Kenyan politicians are using state vehicles illegally for campaigning, inciting violent youths and using "uncouth" language against opponents, a rights group said on Friday of the nation's frenetic election campaign. In a report, "Still Behaving Badly", the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) also denounced "gross" text messages and emails demonising candidates and tribes ahead of parliamentary and presidential elections on Dec. 27. Opposition frontrunner Raila Odinga is currently leading in opinion polls ahead of President Mwai Kibaki, who wants a second five-year term in the east African nation. "Political leaders continue to demonstrate a dearth of civility and decency through the use of vulgar, uncouth and at times inflammatory language," the group said. One pro-Kibaki minister is quoted in the report referring to Odinga as "our own Hitler", and saying he had the potential to "destroy" the country. Another minister derisively described the opposition leader as "a boy" and "uncircumcised". Circumcision of boys is a key rite of passage to manhood practiced by most of Kenya's 42 tribes. Communities such as Odinga's western Luo community -- who do not perform the rite -- are not considered real men by some of the others. "KNCHR strongly urges Kenyans to desist from being agents of hate speech by refusing to forward offensive texts or emails," the report said. At a news conference, the group produced photos as evidence of the misuse of government vehicles in campaigns, as well as a list of number plates of the offending cars. Justice Minister Martha Karua and her energy and environment counterparts, Kiraitu Murungi and David Mwiraria, were snapped using their official vehicles to attend political rallies. Former Health Minister Charity Ngilu was cited for using her official car to attend a rally where she defected to Odinga's Orange Democratic Movement (ODM). The report also called for the arrest of Roads Minister Simeon Nyachae, accusing him of inciting armed youths to beat up three ODM leaders in September. "This shall send a message to potential inciters and safeguard public confidence in the rule of law," KNCHR said. According to the report, women and journalists have also been the targets of pre-election violence. "The police and Electoral Commission of Kenya need to be more proactive, vigilant and firm in dealing with perpetrators of violence during elections," it said.
