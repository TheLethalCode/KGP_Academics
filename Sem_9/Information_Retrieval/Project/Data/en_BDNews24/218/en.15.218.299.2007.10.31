<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Tim May, chief executive officer of the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations (FICA), arrived in the city Wednesday and weighed the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) plea to get FICA membership. Soon after his arrival, the former Australian Test cricketer visited the CWAB office and observed its activities. May hoped that the FICA would accept the CWAB plea. "I have gone through the structure and activities of the CWAB in this short time. We will have our meeting in London this November 17-18 where we will review all this information," May told reporters at a press conference Wednesday. "Everything seems very positive to me," said the former off-spinner. Excluding three Test nations of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, the FICA currently has seven members. "The FICA is an umbrella body of world cricketers associations. At the moment, we are compiling a database of issues to have an understanding with the ICC and the local boards," said Tim, "Our objective is to build an industrial relation with the ICC." The CWAB had applied for FICA membership in August and its former general secretary and Bangladesh first Test captain Naimur Rahman Durjoy was to join the FICA annual general meeting in South Africa in September. But, Durjoy could not attend the meeting following a visa crisis and Tim May upheld the CWAB's petition at the meeting. "The last meeting of the FICA discussed the Bangladesh plea as they did not turn up due to the visa crisis," said the 45-year old Australian adding that he was sent to scrutinise details. bdn
