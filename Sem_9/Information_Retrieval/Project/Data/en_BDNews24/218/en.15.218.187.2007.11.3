 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto boarded a flight back to Pakistan from Dubai on Saturday, her husband said, after President Pervez Musharraf invoked emergency powers and suspended the country's constitution. "(She's flying back) tonight, yes of course," Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari told Reuters by telephone from Dubai, saying she was already on the plane. "It's definitely not pleasant news, it's not welcome news," he added. "We're hoping to build institutions, not destroy them."
