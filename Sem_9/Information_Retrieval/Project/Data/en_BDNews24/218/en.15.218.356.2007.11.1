 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com) -- Former BNP law minister Moudud Ahmed Thursday filed a contempt of court lawsuit against former NBR chairman Badiur Rahman and three colleagues for refusing to receive tax on his undeclared money. The case was filed with the High Court bench of Justice Abdur Rashid and Justice Miftahuddin. Three other accused are the former director general of the intelligence cell of the National Board of Revenue, Mostak Hossain, and other officials Shamima Akter and Touhidul Munir. The High Court on Aug 15 asked the NBR to take tax on Tk 3.84 crore in undeclared income from Moudud. In line with the court order, Moudud sent a letter to the revenue board on Aug 28 to take the money, but the NBR refused in a letter sent on Sept 26. A lawyer for Moudud, now in jail, filed the case as the former minister said the NBR violated the High Court order by not receiving tax from him. bdnew
