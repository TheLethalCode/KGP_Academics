 Dhaka, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com)  Transparency International chairperson Huguette Labelle Saturday said the anticorruption crackdown and the trial of suspects in Bangladesh should be carried out in a transparent manner. Labelle said corrupt people should be prosecuted "no matter who the person is". At the same time, she said, it should be done in a proper justice system. Labelle added that it must be ensured that "the justice system does its work". The TI chief who is on a visit here made the comments after she visited Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury in his office. The TI chief had earlier said judicial separation was a major step against corruption, in a sign that Bangladesh was on the right track. She spoke on global corruption at BRAC Centre in Mohakhali at an event, organised Friday by Transparency International, Bangladeshthe local chapter of the Berlin-based international corruption watchdog. A TI survey of over 60,000 people across the world about their impression of who was most corrupt found that lawmakers were seen as the most corrupt people in society. Political parties followed in second place followed by the police administration in third place. bdn
