 COLOMBO, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamil Tiger political wing leader S P Thamilselvan was killed in a Sri Lankan air force raid early on Friday, the rebels said, in what analysts warned was a body-blow to any hope of ending the conflict soon. Thamilselvan was the rebels' main interlocutor at the last round of peace talks with the Sri Lankan government in Oct 2006, and was the international face of the separatist group. Friday's air raid came amid near daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes that have killed an estimated 5,000 people since early last year alone. "With deep sorrow we announce to the people of Tamil Eelam, the Tamil people living all over the world and the international community, that at 6 a.m. today ... head of our organisation's political wing Brig. S P Thamilselvan was killed by the Sri Lankan air force aerial bombing," the rebels said on their Web site www.ltteps.org. Rebel aide Bawan, who works at Thamilselvan's peace secretariat in the northern rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi, confirmed the news by telephone. Sri Lanka's stock market rose on the news. Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, President Mahinda Rajapaksa's brother, welcomed the news, and said the military would pick off the rest of the Tigers' leaders one by one. "This is just a message, that we know where their leaders are. I know the locations of all the leaders, that if we want we can take them one by one, so they must change their hideouts," he told Reuters. "When the time comes only, we take them one by one." OUTLOOK BLEAK Analysts said Thamilselvan's death had further darkened an already bleak situation in Sri Lanka, where human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings have mushroomed as the fighting intensifies. Sri Lanka is considered one of the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers and journalists given the numbers of each killed. "The loss of Thamilselvan in this way would be a very big setback to any hope of peace talks in the near future -- which in any case were not apparent either," said Jehan Perera of non-partisan advocacy group the National Peace Council. "It just makes it an even bleaker scenario. It is a very bad situation," he added. "What we can look forward to now is for the LTTE to seek to even the score." The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who say they are seeking to carve out a separate state in north and east Sri Lanka for minority Tamils, have repeatedly said they must establish "balance of power" after military setbacks, code for retaliation. Sri Lanka's stock market rose on news of the death of Thamilselvan, the most high profile rebel to be killed in years, closing a provisional 0.99 percent firmer in late trade. "Any sort of victory in the war will boost the market. So there was high activity after the news," said Harsha Fernando, CEO at SC securities. Nearly 70,000 people have been killed since the war began in 1983, and while the military has had the upper hand in recent months and have evicted the rebels from their eastern stronghold, the Tigers and their suicide fighter wing are still able to mount daring attacks. bdnews24.com/lq/1802hrs Analysts see no clear winner on the horizon and say the conflict
