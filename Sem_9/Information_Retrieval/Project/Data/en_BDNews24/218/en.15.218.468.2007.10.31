<TEXT>
 BRUSSELS, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The European Union condemned on Wednesday the murder of Kyrgyz journalist and human rights campaigner Alisher Saipov and called for a thorough investigation. "The EU deplores Mr Saipov's death and praises his work, which provided an important contribution to the promotion of human rights," the Portuguese EU presidency said in a statement. Police in Kyrgyzstan are investigating a possible Uzbek link to the murder last week of Saipov, who had criticised Uzbek President Islam Karimov. They said they had established who killed Saipov and were searching for them, but did not identify the killers. The EU urged Kyrgyz authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice, as pledged by President Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Any Uzbek connection to the killing could be an embarrassment to the European Union, which on Oct. 15 announced a suspension of visa bans on Uzbek leaders with the aim of encouraging positive steps on human rights. It said the situation would be reviewed after six months and the restrictions could be re-imposed earlier if necessary. Saipov, an ethnic Uzbek with Kyrgyz citizenship, exposed rights violations in Uzbekistan. He was shot dead by an unknown assailant in the Kyrgyz town of Osh on Oct. 24. He reported for the US-funded Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and ran an Uzbek-language newspaper called Siyosat, or Politics. Amnesty International said the killing would have a "chilling effect" on freedom of speech in ex-Soviet Central Asia. Kyrgyzstan sees itself as an island of liberalism in the otherwise authoritarian region, allowing journalists and the opposition to operate freely. But several public figures have been murdered in the past few years. Its relations with Uzbekistan are strained and boiled over in the 1990s into ethnic conflict in which hundreds died.
