 PARIS, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks sank for a second day in a row on Friday, knocked lower by sharp declines in banking shares on fears that financial institutions have not yet revealed the full impact of the crisis in the credit market on their results. UK bank Barclays plunged 6.4 percent on market talk of funding worries and speculation that Britain's third-biggest bank was telling analysts to trim profit forecasts. Both the Bank of England and Barclays declined to comment. Other banks also took a beating, with UBS down 4.2 percent and HSBC down 2 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares unofficially closed 0.6 percent lower at 1,560.52 points, after losing 1.6 percent on Thursday. "Financial stocks remained under great pressure. The banks still have major balance sheet problems and I think we will continue to have big negative news on that front," said Jean-Francois Virolle, chief strategist at Global Equities, in Paris.
