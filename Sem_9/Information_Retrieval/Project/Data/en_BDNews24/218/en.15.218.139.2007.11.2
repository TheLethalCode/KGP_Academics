 MOSCOW, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia's nuclear chief on Friday said only full nuclear powers should create centres for enriching uranium, in a swipe at a Saudi proposal for Arab states to help supply Iran with enriched uranium.

Prince Saud said Iran was considering the offer. He said the enrichment plant should be in a neutral country, such as Switzerland. In late 2005 Russia offered to create a joint centre with Iran to enrich uranium on Russian territory, but Iran sent conflicting signals about its intentions. Later, Tehran said it would produce nuclear fuel inside Iran. The Kremlin says that Iran should not be pushed into a corner and opposes tougher sanctions but senior officials say Russia has no interest in seeing Iran get nuclear weapons.
