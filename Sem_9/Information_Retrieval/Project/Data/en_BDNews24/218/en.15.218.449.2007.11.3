 ISTANBUL, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Major powers sought on Saturday to reduce tensions on the Turkish-Iraqi border and prevent any large-scale incursion by Turkey's military that could escalate into a bigger regional crisis. The so-called "neighbours' conference", hosted by Turkey in Istanbul, was meant to focus on improving security inside Iraq but instead it is overshadowed by border tensions over PKK guerrilla attacks launched from the north of the country. "Our objective is to have an Iraq that has stability and safety and that does not create threats for its neighbours," Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan told the opening session of the one-day Iraqi security conference. Ankara is growing increasingly impatient at what it sees as US foot-dragging over the PKK and has massed up to 100,000 troops on the border for a possible offensive against about 3,000 rebels using Iraq as a base to stage attacks into Turkey. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has promised more action from the United States but provided scant details on how far Washington was prepared to go except to offer improved intelligence-sharing on the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). European Union External Affairs Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner urged restraint on all sides so the conflict did not escalate into a bigger regional crisis but said Iraq must act to stop the PKK from operating from its territory. "We call very strongly on the central government of Iraq and the regional Kurdish government that they prevent their territory to be used for terrorist attacks," Ferrero-Waldner told Reuters. No major announcements are expected during Rice's visit, or at the one-day conference at an Ottoman palace on the banks of the Bosphorus in Istanbul, partly because she does not want to upstage a meeting on Monday in Washington between Erdogan and President George W Bush. Turkish diplomats said a declaration after Saturday's meeting of ministers from major western powers and the region was likely to include condemnation of all terrorism and applaud bilateral arrangements between Iraq and its neighbours. BORDER CRISIS Turkey had wanted the conference to focus on Iraqi security and to reassert the political and territorial unity of Iraq. Rice, Turkish Foreign Minister Ali Babacan and Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari are set to hold talks on the sidelines of the conference to hammer out a strategy to fight what Rice says is a "common enemy". Babacan expressed Turkish frustration at the lack of action so far. "This is where the words end and action needs to start," he said after talks with Rice on Friday. The United States supports very limited, targeted strikes by Turkey on PKK training sites but opposes any large-scale invasion into northern Iraq that could destabilize the region, US officials say. Moreover, the US military, which is struggling to bring Iraq under control, has made clear it is reluctant to have any joint activities with the Turks in an area that is the most stable in the country. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki had a "very positive plan" he would introduce on Saturday regarding the PKK. Iran, at loggerheads with Washington over its nuclear ambitions and Iraq, has offered to help ease tensions in northern Iraq. But US officials said Rice was unlikely to hold any substantive discussions with Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of Saturday's meeting. She sat diagonally opposite Mottaki at a dinner on Friday. Participants said the two appeared to avoid each other.
