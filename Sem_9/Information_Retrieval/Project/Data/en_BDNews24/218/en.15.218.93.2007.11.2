 MINGORA, Pakistan, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A firebrand pro-Taliban cleric on Friday called for the withdrawal of troops from Pakistan's volatile northwest region to open the way for negotiations to end days of fighting. Scores of people have been killed in the scenic Swat valley in North West Frontier Province since last week, after the government sent around 2,000 troops to quell a violent campaign by cleric Maulana Fazlullah to impose strict Islamic code in the conservative region. A delegation of clerics and local politicians met with Fazlullah on Friday to try to end the standoff. "Fazlullah has said he is ready to hold talks with the government," Mohammad Amin, a local tribal politician, told Reuters. He said Fazlullah set three conditions for the talks, including withdrawal of security forces from Swat, enforcement of Islamic Sharia law and that all legal cases against his followers be dropped. Government spokesmen were not available for comment. Swat, which lies close to Pakistan's lawless tribal belt bordering Afghanistan, has seen a surge in militant activity since Fazlullah launched an illegal FM radio station and urged a holy war after an army assault on a militant mosque in the capital Islamabad in July. The latest fighting erupted last week after a suicide bombing targeting an army convoy killed 21 people. The militants executed 13 people, including six members of the security forces whom they beheaded. More than 180 people have been killed overall. Thousands of people have already fled the valley amid fears of more fighting. The militants said on Friday that around 48 paramilitary soldiers had surrendered to them in the village of Charbagh. They paraded the men wearing plain clothes before journalists, describing them as soldiers. "We surrendered because we have no ammunition to fight, no food to eat," one man, who identified himself as Ali Gul, told Reuters. The government has rejected the militants' claim, saying none of its soldiers had surrendered. Violence has escalated across Pakistan since July, when militants scrapped a peace deal in the North Waziristan tribal region and the army assault on Islamabad's Red Mosque. On Friday, a missile was fired at a militant hideout in North Waziristan, near the Afghan border, killing at least five people, residents said. The surge in violence comes as Pakistan is going through a period of intense uncertainty in the run up to a general election due in January that is supposed to transform the country into a civilian-led democracy. Speculation is rife in Pakistan that U.S. ally President Pervez Musharraf, who is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on whether he was eligible to run for re-election last month while still army chief, might impose a state of emergency or martial law amid escalating violence. Eight air force personnel were killed in a suicide attack in the central city of Sargodha on Thursday, while seven people were killed in a similar attack on Tuesday less than one kilometer Musharraf's army residence in Rawalpindi, a garrison city adjoining Islamabad. At least 139 people were killed in a suicide bombing last month at a rally to mark the return of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after eight years of self-imposed exile to avoid graft charg
