 LONDON, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspect wanted over the murder of a woman police officer during an armed robbery has been extradited from Somalia after an international search, police said on Thursday. Mustaf Jama, 27, was flown back to England with British detectives after being arrested in the northeast African country. He went missing in November 2005 after the murder of PC Sharon Beshenivsky, 38, in Bradford. In a statement, police said Jama was being transferred to a police station in West Yorkshire for questioning. "This arrest is the latest step in the continuing investigation to bring all those suspected of involvement to court," it said. Four others have already been convicted over Beshenivsky's killing. The mother of three children and two stepchildren was shot dead as she answered an alarm at a travel agent on Nov. 18, her youngest daughter's birthday.
