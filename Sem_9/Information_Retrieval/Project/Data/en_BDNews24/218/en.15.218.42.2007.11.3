<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany and Italy have set up a joint unit to tackle Italian organised crime groups such as Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta, the president of Germany's federal crime office was quoted as saying on Saturday. Security officials in Germany and Italy have been working to set up the unit since six Italians were shot dead in a suspected Calabrian mob feud in the western German city of Duisburg in August, the Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported. The unit is now ready to begin operations and will be officially presented in December in Berlin, federal crime office President Joerg Ziercke told the paper. "We want to increase our knowledge about the activities of the Italian mafia in Germany," Ziercke said. "Investigations in recent years suggest Germany plays a big role for the Italian mafia," he added. Welt am Sonntag said that since 1997, more than 65 Italians have been arrested in Germany, including some of the most wanted members of Italian organised crime groups.
