 PARIS, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - French rail and energy unions prepared to step up their campaign against government plans to cut back special pension benefits with rolling strikes next month, officials said on Wednesday. Six rail unions called for strikes from Nov. 13, while the main energy unions threatened to begin strikes the following day, as they intensify opposition to one of President Nicolas Sarkozy's key economic reforms. A trade union official said the energy unions would go ahead with the strike if the government made no new proposals on its planned pension reforms by Nov. 5. The unions said they would meet the following day to assess the situation. The stoppages would follow a preliminary strike on Oct. 18 that halted nationwide rail services for a day and caused serious transport disruption for several days afterwards. It also comes after a separate dispute between national airline Air France and cabin crew that caused chaos for air travellers last weekend. The strikes have provided the first real challenge to Sarkozy's aim of overhauling the French economy and have opened the prospect of a repeat of the weeks of protest that sunk a previous effort to reform pensions in 1995. The so-called "special pension regimes" offer workers in a range of sectors a privileged status that allows some to retire as early as 50. The government has vowed to reform the system, which it says is unaffordable, saying that all workers will have to pay pension contributions for 40 years to enjoy full pension rights, up from 37.5 years at present. Unions say the proposed changes chip away at rights that protect workers like train drivers who have physically demanding jobs that cannot be exercised past a certain age. The government counters that technical advances have meant that such jobs are no longer so arduous as they were when the system was put in place after World War Two and that the pension privileges are unfair to other workers. Opera workers, who also benefit from the special regimes, forced the Paris Opera to cancel a performance of the opera "La Traviata" last week when they went on strike to protest the changes.
