 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has decided to impose emergency rule and he will seek approval from cabinet on Saturday, a senior security official said, in a move that will put off elections due in January. Speculation has been rife that US ally Musharraf, who is awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on whether he was eligible to run for re-election last month while still army chief, might impose emergency rule or martial law. Militant-related violence has surged in the country.
