 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) - Newly installed BNP acting secretary general Hafizuddin Ahmed Saturday said he would oppose any party council proposal that sought to remove Khaleda Zia from the head of the party. "We are all pro-Khaleda. The question of dropping her is irrelevant. If such a proposal comes up in the council I will vote against it. She is our leader and she will remain so," said Hafizuddin at a press briefing at his Banani home. In answer to a query regarding Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan's proposal that allowed for Khaleda Zia to remain as chairperson of the party, Hafizuddin said: "Anybody can make a proposal in a democratic manner." "No proposals are final yet. There is no reason to spread confusion over this," said the acting secretary general. The BNP leader demanded an end to the state of emergency and a 'restoration of people's fundamental rights'. "We want to extend our all-out cooperation to the government and the Election Commission in holding a fair electionfree from the influence of black money and muscle power. A united BNP will contest the next election," he said. A public spat recently arose between Hafizuddin and Hannan Shah over their respective activities at the time of former president Ziaur Rahman's killing. The acting secretary general said: "Hannan Shah is a leader of my party. He was senior to me in the army and I respect him." "Confusion has arisen over media report of our statements. There is no sense in dragging out an incident that happened 32 years ago. I will not say anything further on this matter." The former lawmaker said the public is waiting to see what the politicians can do to contain the spiralling cost of essentials in the market, check corruption and solve the unemployment problem. Hafizuddin added that 106 MPs had so far given their support to the present leadership: "Wait and see the influx of people that come to our side." Former lawmakers, including the BNP chairperson's adviser AHM Mofazzal Karim and ZA Khan attended the press conference. Earlier, more than 200 leaders and workers of Dhaka University Chhatra Dal and party activists from Kushtia BNP branch greeted the new acting secretary general. bdnew
