<TITLE> Oil near $94 but off highs on US economic concerns </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SINGAPORE, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose to near $94 on Friday, recovering from overnight falls due to funds selling on weakness in global equity markets, and traders were looking to strong Asian demand to counter concerns over the US economy. US crude for December gained 38 cents to $93.87 a barrel by 0452 GMT, having fallen by $1.04 a barrel after striking an all-time high of $96.24 a barrel. Brent crude was up 79 cents to $90.51 a barrel but down from a record of $91.71. Traders said worries over tight supplies continued to support prices, citing comments by the administrator of the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) about fears of a shortage next year, as well as continued strong demand in Asia. Guy Caruso, administrator of the EIA, has said that if OPEC does not produce more oil, markets would be short of barrels in the first quarter 2008. Derivatives traders said Asian demand was expected to continue unabated. China's oil giants Sinopec Corp and PetroChina are looking to more than double diesel imports this month to the highest in three years, helped by a surprising increase in pump prices from Thursday. "Though they may feel the pain from high oil prices, a big chunk of demand growth is expected from China, India and the Middle East in 2008," said Tony Nunan, risk manager for Mitsubishi Corp in Tokyo. Traders said the overnight decline in oil prices came as the financial sector dragged down the stock market after brokerages downgraded the two largest US banks, renewing fears of more fallout from the credit crisis. "There was some profit-taking and concerns over the impact to the US economy," said Gerard Rigby from Fuel First Consulting in Sydney. Weakness in the US economy could further erode demand growth from the world's top energy consumer. US crude's 40 percent rally since mid-August, has brought it close to the inflation-adjusted high of $101.70 hit in 1980. US refiners drained 3.9 million barrels of crude from storage, mostly from tanks in Cushing, Oklahoma -- delivery point for the NYMEX oil futures contract -- as the world's thirst for oil is climbing toward its fourth-quarter peak ahead of the northern hemisphere winter. Weakness in the US currency has also recently boosted many dollar-denominated commodities and helped the oil rally. Adding to the support was the Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to lower US interest rates by a quarter percentage point to reduce the risk of a slowdown in the world's biggest economy.
