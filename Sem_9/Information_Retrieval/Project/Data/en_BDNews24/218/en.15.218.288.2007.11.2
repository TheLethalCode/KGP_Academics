<TEXT>
 Nov. 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP)Tens of thousands of people on Friday occupied the centre of the Georgian capital Tbilisi to protest against President Mikheil Saakashvili, who four years was the hero of the pro-democracy Rose Revolution. The huge crowd filled the main Rustaveli Avenue, spilling right up onto the steps of parliament. The atmosphere was good-natured and although police maintained a tight guard around parliament they were unarmed and there was no sign of riot police. The rally was the biggest challenge yet to Saakashvili, who launched radical democratic and free-market reforms in the wake of the 2003 Rose Revolution and a landslide presidential win in 2004. "Young people do not want to live in that kind of Georgia. We want to live in a truly democratic country," said one protestor, Irina Ezhabauri, 29. "Saakashvili is a liar. He betrayed the people's expectations. We do not have freedom." Opponents mostly support Saakashvili's pro-Western policies, which have angered former ruler Russia: but they accuse his government of arrogance, political persecution, abuse of the judicial process, and promoting a widening gap between rich and poor. "Saakashvili's time is up," Kakha Kukava, a lawmaker with the opposition Conservative Party, told the rally. "This is only the beginning. Thousands and thousands of people will be here later." The Rose Revolution was the first of three to shake the ex-Soviet Union, followed by the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and another uprising in Central Asian Kyrgyzstan. All three were sparked by a desire for freer elections but have led to varying levels of political turbulence. Opposition activists said they expected at least 20,000 people -- some said up to 100,000 -- to attend Friday's protest and call for new elections and Saakashvili's resignation. Tensions rose on the eve of the demonstration amid claims that Irakli Okruashvili, a former defence minister arrested on corruption charges after turning against Saakashvili, had been forced into exile. The interior ministry quickly denied the accusation. Georgian authorities have dismissed the opposition's demands as unconstitutional. They say presidential and parliamentary elections will be held as planned late next year. Saakashvili has built close ties with the United States and the European Union and is bidding to take his country into the NATO military alliance. But opposition leaders met ahead of the demonstration on Thursday with US Assistant Secretary of State Daniel Fried and the OSCE Secretary General Marc Perrin de Brichambaut. Both are visiting Tbilisi to attend an international conference. "They better understand the current critical situation in Georgia than the authorities," said Davit Zurabishvili of the Republican Party after the meetings. "The fact that the international community shows such a huge interest in the opposition means that the opposition is an important force." Fried said at a press conference late Thursday that the meeting had been productive. "Demonstrations are a thing that a democracy has," he said, adding that he hoped Friday's protest would proceed peaceful
