 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil climbed $1 on Friday, heading towards $95 as concerns over tight fuel supplies in the run up to winter returned to the fore. The market awaited a key US jobs report for clues about the economic health of the world's top oil consumer. U.S. crude rose $1.10 to $94.59 a barrel by 1109 GMT, having fallen by $1.04 on Thursday after striking a record high of $96.24.

Traders said supply worries continued to support prices, and cited comments by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) about fears of a shortage next year, as well as continued strong demand in Asia. EIA administrator Guy Caruso said that if OPEC does not crank up production, markets would be short of oil early next year. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies more than a third of the world's oil, rejects any talk of supply tightness and blames speculators, political tensions and a weak dollar for driving up the cost of fuel. OPEC, which in September agreed to boost supplies by 500,000 barrels a day from Nov. 1, has resisted consumer calls for more oil. OPEC heads of state are due to meet in Riyadh this mon
