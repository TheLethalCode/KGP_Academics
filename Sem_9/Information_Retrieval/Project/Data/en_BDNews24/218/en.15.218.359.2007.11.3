<TITLE> Merkel opposes SPD proposal for rail privatisation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quoted as saying on Saturday that she opposes a model favoured by her Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners for selling off part of state rail operator Deutsche Bahn by 2009. Merkel told the weekly Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the SPD's proposal to sell shares in the company [DBN.UL] to small investors via so-called "people's shares" would not achieve some fundamental aims of the part-privatisation. Her conservatives (CDU/CSU) and the SPD would try to find a compromise in coming days, she said. The conservatives back Deutsche Bahn management, which wants to place a 25 percent stake in the firm with institutional investors. Many politicians have said the privatisation, which aims to raise 3 billion euros, is doomed. The coalition partners are due to discuss the Deutsche Bahn privatisation and a range of other issues on which they disagree at a meeting in Berlin on Sunday.
