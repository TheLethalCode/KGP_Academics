<TITLE> Bush defends attorney general pick in torture dispute </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nov. 2(bdnews24.com/AFP ) President George W Bush said Thursday that his attorney general nominee will not tell lawmakers weighing his confirmation if he judges "waterboarding" of terrorism suspects is torture, thus illegal. Bush's defiant defense of Michael Mukasey came in a speech that portrayed his Democratic critics as weak on terrorism -- a replay of his successful 2004 reelection message as the 2008 White House race heats up. Prominent Democrats, whose party retook the US Congress in November 2006 largely thanks to anger at the unpopular war in Iraq, quickly shot back that they would oppose Mukasey if he did not answer the question. The nomination, once thought to virtually be a sure thing, appeared to have run aground as some Republicans and Democrats demanded to know whether Mukasey considers waterboarding -- which experts liken to controlled drowning -- to violate US legal prohibitions on torture. Without ever naming waterboarding or other alleged techniques, Bush insisted in a speech to a conservative think tank in Washington that: "The procedures used in this program are safe, they are lawful and they are necessary." "It's wrong for congressional leaders to make Judge Mukasey's confirmation dependent on his willingness to go on the record about the details of a classified program he has not been briefed on," the president said. He said Mukasey, who has called the practice personally "repugnant," also cannot answer because his reply might place US interrogators "in legal jeopardy" and might help terrorists train to resist US questioning. As he spoke, Bush's 2004 White House rival, Democratic Senator John Kerry, said he would vote against Mukasey over his "refusal to classify the barbaric practice of waterboarding as torture." "I am not comfortable confirming anyone who cannot see that this method of interrogation is antithetical to American values and traditions -- especially not to a position that is charged with representing our entire justice system," Kerry said in a statement. Bush's comments came after a growing number of Democratic Senators, including top presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Chris Dodd and Joseph Biden, come out against the nomination. Veteran Senator Edward Kennedy was the latest to reject Mukasey, in a Senate speech on Thursday. "This is a nomination I had hoped to support," said Kennedy, but added he could not do so because of the interrogations issue. "Waterboarding is torture, yet Judge Mukasey refuses to say so," he said. "The attorney general of the United States must also be a person with an unbending commitment to justice, fairness, and equality, who will stand up for America's laws and values, even when the White House tries to steer the department in the other direction." Another senior Democrat, Senator Chuck Schumer, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee refused to say whether he would back the nomination. "I am weighing this issue very carefully," he told reporters, adding "I don't think Democrats are mistreating him." Mukasey's fate appears to hinge on gaining the support of a single Democratic senator, to match the votes of all the Republicans on the Judiciary committee, to send the nomination to the full Senate floor. A vote is expected in the committee on November 6. Bush, heartened by reports of a sharp drop in deaths in Iraq and fresh from an attack on Democratic front-runner Clinton, charged that Democrats have forgotten the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. His rhetorical broadside came as a Malcolm Nance, a former master instructor in the US Navy's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape School (SERE), which trains US forces to resist brutal interrogation practices like waterboarding, wrote in the New York Daily news that it is undoubtedly torture. "Having been subjected to this technique, I can say: It is risky but not entirely dangerous when applied in training for a very short period. However, when performed on an unsuspecting prisoner, waterboarding is a torture technique -- without a doubt. There is no way to sugarcoat it," he sa
