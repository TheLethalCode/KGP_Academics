<TITLE> Heart transplants suspended at Papworth hospital </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Papworth hospital said on Friday it had suspended routine heart transplants after an increase in the number of early deaths among patients. This year, seven of the 20 patients who have undergone transplants at the Cambridge hospital have died within 30 days, a rate of 35 percent. Papworth's average rate is seven percent, with the average across all transplant centres 10 percent. The hospital notified the Department of Health once it discovered the increase, and it was advised to suspend heart operations for a review be carried out. Lung transplants and other operations will carry on as normal. The review, which is to take two weeks, is likely to consider the age of donors and the length of time it takes to retrieve organs from other centres and hospitals. One line the review may look into is the age of donors, with improved road safety resulting in fewer organs from younger donors being made available. Stephen Bridge, the hospital's chief executive, said: "We are talking comparatively small numbers but it was agreed it would be sensible for us to invite the Healthcare Commission to undertake an external review. "If there are any improvements, we will implement them." The Healthcare Commission said in a statement: "The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) asked the Healthcare Commission to undertake a review of heart transplant services at Papworth Hospital. "A team, including clinical and technical experts, began the review on Monday (Oct. 29). We will report our findings to the CMO within two weeks." Papworth achieved the top score of "excellent" in the Healthcare Commission's 2006/2007 annual NHS performance ratings last month. In July, it staged the first ever interactive public broadcast of a UK hospital operation, during which the audience were able to ask the surgeon questions as he performed open-heart surge
