 ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf imposed emergency rule on Saturday and deployed troops across the capital in a bid to reassert his flagging authority against political rivals and Islamist militants. Nuclear-armed Pakistan's internal security has deteriorated sharply in recent months with a wave of suicide attacks by al Qaeda-inspired militants, including one that killed 139 people. State-run Pakistan Television said General Musharraf, who is also chief of army staff, had suspended the constitution and declared an emergency. The move is expected to put off parliamentary elections due in January. Witnesses said paramilitary troops were deployed at Pakistan Television and radio stations ahead of the announcement, which follows weeks of speculation that U.S. ally Musharraf might impose emergency rule or martial law. Troops sealed off Constitution Avenue, the thoroughfare where the presidency building, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court are located. Television channels also said that Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, whose earlier dismissal in March marked the beginning of a slide in Musharraf's popularity, had been told that his services were "no longer required". Chaudhry had been reinstated in July. Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, was awaiting a Supreme Court ruling on whether he was eligible to run for re-election last month while still army chief. The court said on Friday it would reconvene on Monday and try to finish the case quickly, having earlier said it would take a break until Nov. 12 -- just three days before Musharraf's current term is due to expire. A senior security official told Reuters that Musharraf would seek approval for the move from the cabinet later, after which there were expectations he would address the nation. The cabinet was due to start meeting at 7 pm (1400 GMT). "NOT PLEASANT NEWS" About 139 people were killed on Oct 19 by an attempted suicide bomb assassination of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto during a procession through Karachi when she returned from eight years of self-imposed exile. Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari said she was already on a flight back to Pakistan from Dubai. He described Musharraf's move was "definitely not pleasant news". "We're hoping to build institutions, not destroy them." Before the announcement on emergency rule, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had told journalists travelling with her to Turkey that Washington opposed any authoritarian measures and wanted elections to go ahead. "I think it would be quite obvious that the United States would not be supportive of extra-constitutional means," Rice said. "Pakistan needs to prepare for and hold free and fair elections." Musharraf had said he would quit as army chief if he was given a second term, and he had allowed Bhutto back into Pakistan to lead her party into the national elections. In London, a spokesman for former Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said; "We feel it's a desperate attempt of a defeated dictator who has been exposed for what he is in the eyes of the world." "He (Musharraf) feels the Supreme Court will not allow him to remain the president. That's why he has taken the decision," spokesman Nadir Chaudhri said, Musharraf's troubles began in March when he suspended Supreme Court Justice Chaudhry on allegations of misconduct. Critics accused him of trying to put pressure on the court not to block his re-election and Musharraf's popularity plummetted as lawyers rallied to support the top judge. In July, after a week-long siege, Musharraf ordered troops to storm the Red Mosque in Islamabad to crush a Taliban-style movement based there. At least 105 people were killed in the raid and a wave of deadly militant attacks and suicide bombings followed.
