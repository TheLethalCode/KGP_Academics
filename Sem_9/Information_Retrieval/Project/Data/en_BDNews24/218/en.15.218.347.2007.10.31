<TITLE> Media drove me "close to suicide" - Heather Mills </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Heather Mills, estranged wife of former Beatle Paul McCartney, has launched an emotional attack on Britain's tabloid media, saying they had wrongly cast her as a gold digger and driven her close to suicide. Mills appeared on British television on Wednesday to promote a campaign to change laws governing the media in order to offer individuals greater protection from paparazzi and some newspapers, particularly the Sun. "I've had 18 months of absolute abuse," Mills told GMTV in a lengthy interview during which she choked several times. GMTV said Mills had appeared on the show at her own request. "They've called me a whore, a gold-digger, a fantasist, a liar, the most unbelievably hurtful things. "I've stayed quiet for my daughter. We've had death threats, I've been close to suicide ... I've had worse threats than a paedophile or a murderer and I've done nothing but charity for 20 years," the 39-year-old added. Mills, who has a daughter Beatrice with McCartney, denied she had been offered a large financial settlement in what has become a bitter divorce battle. "I have been offered nothing, OK?" she said, when asked about the case. "These figures are made up. 100 million (pounds), 50 million, 20 million ... How do you know if I even want any money? I'm one and a half million in debt in lawyers' fees." Former model and charity worker Mills also rebutted reports she was holding out for the right to sell the story of her marriage to McCartney. "It's rubbish! I could sell my story right now! I'm trying to protect Paul and our daughter." DIANA COMPARISON She compared her situation to that of Kate McCann, the mother of missing girl Madeleine who has been the subject of press conjecture since her daughter's disappearance, and Princess Diana, who died after being chased by paparazzi. "That is what we're doing as a nation, buying these newspapers," she told GMTV. "Every time you buy one of those you contribute to it. So force a change for responsible journalism." She added that the "hate campaign" whipped by some tabloid media put her and her daughter's life at risk. "That's why I considered killing myself, because I thought if I'm dead, she's safe and she can be with her father." She asked viewers to visit Web site www.youcare.com, which calls for a boycott of "The Scum" or "The so-called Sun". "This barrage of abuse constituted a human rights violation and has highlighted the need for greater protection of the individual in regards to their privacy in the British Justice System," the Web site reads.
