 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com) - Barisal and Chittagong were in the driving seats against Dhaka and Rajshahi, respectively, at the close of day one of the third round four-dayer in the Isphani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Friday. Dhaka batsmen struggled against Barisal bowlers, to be bundled out for 157 after skipper Mohammad Ashraful decided to bat first in damp weather at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Barisal, in reply, were 27 for no losses, with openers Shahriar Nafees (19) and Hannan Sarkar (6) remaining unbeaten. Playing away at the Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, Rajshahi were 191 for nine at stumps against the home team with Delwar Hossain (8) and Saqlain Sajib (7) batting. The first day between Khulna and Sylhet was abandoned due to a wet outfield at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Dhaka vs Barisal Ashraful's decision to bat first proved a wrong move when opener Anwar Hossain (2) and one-down Al Shahriar Rokon (4) returned to the dressing room at 19 for two. Opener Javed Omar (33) and Ashraful tried to repair the damage, but it was short-lived, before Ashraful (17) was trapped lbw by Arafat Salahuddin, who returned with two for 25. However, the fifth wicket between Mehrab Hossain and Shamsur Rahman Shuvo raised the hope of posting a modest total, but left-arm spinner Tariqul shattered their hopes having Shuvo (16) caught behind the wicket by Shaheen Hossain. They put on 49 runs for the fifth wicket. Mehrab top-scored with 49 off 139 balls. Left-arm pacer Sajedul Islam, who made the first breakthrough in the day, damaged Dhaka's middle order and wrapped up the visitors' first innings at four for 40. Barisal opener Nafees, dropped on 19 at the first slip by Rokon off Mosharraf Hossain, was batting along with Hannan (6) when the bails were drawn for the day. "I thought that the weather might be changed after first hour play, but it didn't work," Ashraful explained his decision to bat first winning the toss. "Besides, the wicket seemed good to bat, but our top order could not click. "It could have been better had we crossed the 200-mark, but a 157-run was not a bad total in such a wicket," said Ashraful hoping that they would be able to restrict the opponents to below 170-run. Rajshahi vs Chittaong Pacer Tareq Aziz captured four wickets for 38 as table topper Rajshahi struggled against the hosts in the port city. Rajshahi got off to a fine start with opening pair Junaed Siddique and Jahirul Islam making 68 runs before Jahirul (32) was caught by Nafis Iqbal off Ehsanul Haq. After breaking the opening stand, Rajshahi saw their batsmen return to the dressing room at regular intervals with the last five batsmen walking off the pitch in the space of just 12 runs. Junaed Siddique scored a patient 78 off 210 balls with the help of six fours and one six. Skipper Khaled Mashud (18) and Mushfiqur Rahman (18) were other notable scorers for the last year's runners-up.
