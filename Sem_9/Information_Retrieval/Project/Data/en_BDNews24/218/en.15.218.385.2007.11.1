<TITLE> Lampard hat-trick sees Chelsea through in League Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Frank Lampard hat-trick, including a scrambled effort in injury time, helped holders Chelsea overturn a 3-2 deficit and beat Leicester City 4-3 in the fourth round of the League Cup on Wednesday. Seven of the top nine in the Premier League were in action and, as usual in the country's third competition, most of them fielded largely reserve sides. They generally proved strong enough though as Arsenal, Manchester City, Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers and Everton, as well as struggling Tottenham Hotspur, joined Chelsea in the quarter-finals. West Ham United earned a place on Tuesday. Chelsea's 45-game home unbeaten record seemed set to disappear when they trailed 3-2 with three minutes left at Stamford Bridge but Andriy Shevchenko, with virtually his first contribution of the night, lashed home a brilliant equaliser. In a furious injury-time finale Lampard got the ball over the line and, although Shevchenko then banged it back into the net after it had been hacked clear, Chelsea gave the goal to the England midfielder. He had earlier scored in the 20th and 29th minutes after Championship (second division) side Leicester had gone ahead through Gareth McAuley after six minutes. Leicester, however, refused to lie down. They equalised through DJ Campbell and then went 3-2 up with a rare Carl Cort goal in the 74th minute before Chelsea's late heroics. Brazilians got all the goals for last-season's runners-up Arsenal as Eduardo da Silva scored in each half and Denilson added the third in their 3-0 romp at Sheffield United. Robbie Fowler's return to Anfield was a disappointing one as his Cardiff City side lost 2-1 to Liverpool, Nabil El Zhar and Steven Gerrard on target for the hosts. There were two all-Premier League ties in which an Elano penalty four minutes from time was enough for Manchester City to win 1-0 at Bolton Wanderers while Benni McCarthy and Morten Gamst Pedersen earned Blackburn a 2-1 win at Portsmouth. Tottenham Hotspur beat Blackpool 2-0, with goals from Robbie Keane and Pascal Chimbonda, in their first game under new Spanish manager Juande Ramos and Everton needed an extra-time goal by Tim Cahill for a 1-0 win at Luton. The draw for the quarter-finals takes place on Saturday
