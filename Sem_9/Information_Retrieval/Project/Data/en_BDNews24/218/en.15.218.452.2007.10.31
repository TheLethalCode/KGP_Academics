 MADRID, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - PSV Eindhoven coach Ronald Koeman has agreed to take over at Valencia if the two clubs can reach a compensation deal, Spanish media reported on Wednesday. Koeman, who signed a two-year contract with PSV in 2006, is expected to commit to the Primera Liga side until 2010. Valencia sacked Quique Sanchez Flores after last weekend's 3-0 defeat at Sevilla. Koeman, 44, clashed with PSV chairman Frits Schuitema last season when the team appeared to have squandered their title chances but they ended up sn!tching the Dutch championship on goal difference in a dramatic finale. PSV, top of the league again this season, are due to hold a news conference later on Wednesday. Former Dutch international defender Koeman, a member of the Barcelona team that won the 1992 European Cup and four consecutive Primera Liga titles, has also coached Ajax Amsterdam and Benfica. Valencia, who are fourth in the Primera Liga, face leaders Real Madrid at the Mestalla later on Wednesday. They are third in Champions League Group B, four points behind leaders Chelsea
