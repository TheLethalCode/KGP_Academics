<TITLE> Newcastle named UK's top fireworks town </TITLE>

 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's fireworks capital has been named -- and it is not the birthplace of Guy Fawkes, a survey found on Friday. As the 402nd annual bonfire night celebrations draw near, Newcastle has topped the survey for the most sales of fireworks. While other towns such as Swindon in the west and Bidston in the northwest also did well in the Tesco survey, Fawkes' own town of York failed to make the top 10. Smethwick, in the west Midlands and Woodseats in Yorkshire had the least sales. The survey comes after the main bonfire celebrations in York were banned last month by the local council on health and safety grounds, a decision that left the local tourist board stunned. Guy Fawkes was born in April 1570 in Stonegate, York and was in charge of executing the Roman Catholic plot to blow up parliament and the protestant King James 1 during the state opening of parliament on Nov. 5, 1605. The plot was uncovered at the last minute and Fawkes was caught and executed early in 1606.
