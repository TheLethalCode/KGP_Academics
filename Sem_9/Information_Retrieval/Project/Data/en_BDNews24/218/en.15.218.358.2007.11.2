 MADRID, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain on Friday defended a planned visit by King Juan Carlos to Spain's two north African enclaves, which Morocco claims as its own, saying the trip was in response to persistent demands from locals.

A low point was reached in 2002 under his predecessor Jose Maria Aznar, when Morocco sent troops to the tiny disputed island of Perejil and Spain sent special forces to oust them.
