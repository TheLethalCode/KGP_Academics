 BEIJING, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A wave of high-level visits by the Dalai Lama to Western countries will have no effect on the status of Chinese-ruled Tibet, and will only serve to harm relations with Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday.

Last year, a young nun was killed when Chinese guards fired on a group of Tibetans attempting to cross in the same area -- the glaciated pass of Nangpa La.
