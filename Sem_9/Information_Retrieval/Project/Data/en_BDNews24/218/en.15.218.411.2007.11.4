 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  Outgoing coach Syed Nayeemuddin emphasised the need for camp for the national booters in a bid to maintain players' fitness level they acquired under his guidance. "It is needed to continue the football camp for the national team whether I am here or not," Nayeemuddin said at a meet with the sports reporters at Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) Sunday. "The boys are much disciplined, dedicated and sincere, and committed to playing well for the national side. "They have gained a lot of fitness and they need to continue the camp to keep their fitness well though the national football team has no international commitment in the next four months," said Nayeemuddin. "If the footballers remain out of play, they certainly lose their fitness," Nayeemuddin said, "Whether anybody or I take charge in future, one has to start from scratch." The BFF parted with Nayeemuddin following the deferment of the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) championship to be held in next July instead of December, 2007, in Sri Lanka and Maldives. BFF acting general secretary Manzoor Hossain Malu rejecting Nayeemuddin's advice, said, "I don't think the fitness level of the players will deteriorate for not having the camp as they are professional footballers." Malu said that they parted with Nayeemuddin for some reasons that not only mean SAFF championship deferment. The acting secretary said that the three factors -- no international engagement up to next April, BFF financial crisis and players' need for rest -- prompted them to release Nayeemuddin. Nayeemuddin, however, said he would always be ready to take the charge of Bangladesh if the BFF calls him in future. b
