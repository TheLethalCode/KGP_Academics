 CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - NASA on Thursday delayed a risky spacewalk to fix a torn solar wing panel on the International Space Station until Saturday, giving engineers more time to plan the unprecedented task. Dangling from an extension boom, astronaut Scott Parazynski will attempt to install home-made braces to the broken hinges on one of the station's power-collecting wings. The boom will be mounted on the station's robotic crane to hoist Parazynski nearly to the end of the outstretched span. The spacewalk had originally been targeted for Friday to allow time for a second repair attempt before space shuttle Discovery departs in case the first one failed. But with so many new procedures, robotic arm operations and safety concerns about having an astronaut work close to an electrically charged device, managers decided allow one more day to plan the outing. Aboard the station, commander Peggy Whitson and Discovery pilot George Zamka set up an impromptu workshop to fashion aluminum strips into harnesses to take the load off the broken hinges on the station's ripped wing panel. Wearing protective goggles, the two cut strips of aluminum, taped pieces together for strength and punched holes so wire ties can bind the brace to the damaged solar panel. The flap tore on Tuesday as astronauts were extending the panel. Engineers are not sure exactly what happened, but fixing the damage has become the top priority of Discovery's extended, 15-day mission. The shuttle blasted off on Oct. 23 to deliver a new module to the station that has docking ports for Europe's Columbus and Japan's Kibo laboratories, which are scheduled for launches next month and in 2008. "Without having fixed the problem it will be very difficult to get Columbus further along in processing," said Gregor Woop, a European Space Agency manager overseeing Columbus' launch preparations at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The 27,000-pound (12,150-kg) lab is slated for liftoff between Dec. 6 and 13 aboard the shuttle Atlantis. NASA, however, will not clear the shuttle for launch until it is assured the station's broken wing is stable. If the 110-foot (33-metre) wing is not drawn out taut, additional damage could occur, said NASA's space station program manager Mike Suffredini. Discovery was due to leave the outpost on Monday and return to its Florida home port on Wednesday. NASA needs to fly 11 more construction missions to the station before 2010 when the shuttles are scheduled to be retired.
