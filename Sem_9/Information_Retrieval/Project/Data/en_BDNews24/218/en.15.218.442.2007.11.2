<TITLE> Kibaki fights to regain election lead </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NAIROBI, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Donning a Mandela-style flowery shirt and quipping jokes with the masses, President Mwai Kibaki is fast shedding his aloof image as he hits the road in a frantic race to win Kenya's December election. Stung by his main rival Raila Odinga's surge in opinion polls, the normally staid and besuited Kibaki has abandoned his State House office in the capital Nairobi and barely left the campaign trail in the last month. Despite his age, 75, a re-energised Kibaki has been criss-crossing the nation, addressing rallies, dancing with children, entering homesteads, and even putting on traditional Islamic dress for the end of the holy month Ramadhan. Having led polls comfortably for several years, Kibaki was overtaken by Odinga in September and is now about 10 percentage points behind in most surveys ahead of the Dec. 27 vote. Odinga, 62, got ahead of his former boss by starting a well-oiled campaign a year ago and pushing his charismatic -- if controversial -- personality to the fore of public life in Kenya via ads, grassroots tours, and constant media prominence. His opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), formed in 2005, has also had longer to organise itself than Kibaki's just-inuagurated Party of National Unity (PNU). But Kibaki's team believes they can recover in time. "Give me five more years to finish the work I have begun," he urged a whooping crowd of tens of thousands this week at a dusty sports ground near Nairobi's biggest rubbish dump. Enthusiastic crowds of supporters chanting "Kibaki tena" (Kibaki again) and waving banners plastered with his face jumped over open sewers and stood on heaps of uncollected garbage to catch a glimpse of their man. "The old man must rule for another five years man, he has promised to clear this filth," one jobless resident, James Mburu, said, pointing to the stinking rubbish piles. "DON'T FIGHT WITH YOUR NEIGHBOUR" While traversing the nation of 36 million, Kibaki has touted gains made since he took over in 2002, such as free education, an improved economy, and wider democratic space. He accuses Odinga -- a wealthy former cabinet minister and political prisoner who projects himself as a champion of the poor -- of deceiving Kenyans with impossible promises. "Some of these people have been in government, yet when you hear the promises they are making it sounds like they have a magical solution to the problem. What did they do when they were in government?" he asked the crowd. Analysts generally say the two men, while poles apart in style, would in fact differ little on basic policy, particularly for the economy which has been motoring along smoothly at around five percent average annual growth since Kibaki took over. Both are promising increased growth in a business-friendly environment, and to extend free primary education to the secondary sector. Their main difference is over political devolution, with Odinga championing more power to provinces but Kibaki arguing that would foster tribalism. Odinga was instrumental in Kibaki's victory in 2002 then became his roads minister. But he was sacked after campaigning against his boss in a 2005 referendum. Many Kenyans see the coming election, however, as having little to do with issues and all to do with the tussle between Kibaki's Kikuyu tribe, and Odinga's western Luo community, which says it has been marginalised by the government. Odinga's ODM is perceived by many as an alliance against the Kikuyu, Kenya's largest and most economically powerful tribe. Spurred by tribalism, riots and fighting have marred political rallies across Kenya in recent days, with one person trampled to death as he fled trouble during a PNU rally. Many fear the campaign will yet again be tarnished by the bloodshed seen in past Kenyan elections. "We want a peaceful election. There is no need for violence," Kibaki said at the Dandora waste dump in what has become a mantra of his campaign. "The election is only one day. If you fight with your neighbour, what will you do on the day after?" he added in Swahili, drawing the sort of chuckles from the crowd that aides hope will warm the electorate to him come voting d
