<TITLE> UK's Friends under pressure to shape up or sell out </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's Friends Provident, jilted by partner Resolution last week, is under pressure to convince investors it can generate cash and boost profits, as few bet on its ability to remain independent. Friends struck the 8.7 billion pound ($18.1 billion) merger deal with Resolution in July, but that broke down after the larger partner became the target of a bid battle. The move has left Britain's smallest bluechip life insurer -- which expects to burn cash for the next three to four years and has dropped a key profit target -- to confront market speculation that it will now face a takeover or a break-up bid. "It's got weak management, a weak balance sheet, economic profitability is not what it should be. They got into the protection market too late and too much of their business is pensions," analyst Tim Young at Collins Stewart said. "Frankly, it is very vulnerable." Friends, a takeover target since it listed in 2001, is now again facing nagging questions over its focus on group pensions -- a growing business but currently less cash-generating -- and protection, hit by the UK housing slowdown. Friends will also have to convince the market it can, with its planned 500 million pound debt issue, fund its growth -- along with the cost of fickle customers leaving early and, crucially, the development of new products. Sources familiar with the insurer say the failure to complete the deal with cash-generating Resolution has not prompted Friends to put up a "for sale" sign -- but all sides agree that it must move quickly to win back investor confidence. Friends shares, down almost 13 percent from a peak in July when the merger was announced, are trading at around 177p -- well below the group's 2001 listing price of 225p. "Friends is not soliciting offers, but the board does have a duty to consider all offers that create shareholder value," one of the sources said, adding that applied to both the group and its individual assets, such as its majority stake in fund manager F&C or its higher-margin international arm. The list of rivals named on the market as potential suitors for Friends -- or for its assets -- include Zurich Financial Services, France's AXA, UK-listed Old Mutual and even Resolution's suitor, Standard Life. Speculation on specific buyers has cooled in recent weeks and one source familiar with the matter said Friends had not received any serious approaches since the merger failed. The market, however, is still betting on a bid. "It looks attractive and it is in play. I would be surprised if nothing were to happen," fund manager Edward Collins at New Star Asset Management said. NO MAJOR OVERHAUL Sources familiar with the group said efforts to boost investor confidence do not currently include plans for a major strategy overhaul, though there could be some adjustments -- a move that may not be enough to satisfy some investors. "Having struck a merger deal, which looks like it was about raising cash, going back to the original business plan looks tricky to me," Pali International analyst Marcus Barnard said. "I don't think there is anything wrong with their strategy per se, but people have lost confidence in Philip Moore, they have lost confidence in their plans." Analysts and some investors have questioned the ability of Friends' top executives to survive the failed deal, with many speculating on the future of Chief Executive Philip Moore, a former finance director who took the top job in January. One source familiar with the group, however, denied pressure from major shareholders on top executives -- the same team that has been leading the group virtually since its listing. "There have been no conversations (with investors) asking the group to do anything with management," the source said.
