<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com) - Local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal Saturday said that city corporations would soon be run by three-member mayoral panels. "The members of the panel will carry out municipal responsibilities by rotation. That way, city corporations' activities will not be hampered by the absence of a mayor," the LGRD adviser told reporters after a meeting on preparations for the Biswa Ijtema, believed to be the second largest gathering of Muslims in the world after the hajj. The adviser said that relevant laws were being amended. He said that at least one panel member would be a woman. The adviser spoke about preparations for the Biswa Ijtema: "Our main target this year is to save the Turag river from contamination." The Public Health Engineering Department is constructing safety tanks to ensure that untreated sewage does not contaminate the river." Iqbal said the government planned to locate the control centre in a building it plans to construct in the Ijtema field. Previously the control centre was located on private land, causing some disturbance. Some 624 two-storey toilets, wash basins, and 4km of roads will be laid down. Work has already started on installing tube wells, water pumps and sub-stations. bdnews2
