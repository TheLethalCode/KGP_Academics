<TITLE> Foreign force mooted as way to Palestinian deal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Western and Israeli officials are exploring whether sending an international force to the Palestinian territories could overcome Israeli security concerns to remove one of the main obstacles to peacemaking. Some advisers close to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert see a big international force as possibly the only way to satisfy Israel's security needs during the time it would take to create a Palestinian force able to combat and disarm militants. Peacekeepers have long been envisaged as part of any final peace deal and the Palestinians have voiced support for their deployment as a way of loosening Israel's military grip. The idea under discussion could mean inserting foreign troops, starting in the occupied West Bank, before a peace deal. Israel has in the past argued that peacekeepers would interfere with its security measures and do little to rein in militants. The fact that the Gaza Strip is under the control of Hamas Islamists could make it hard to deploy such a force there. Diplomats said that if Israel agreed, it would likely insist on combat-ready forces under US command, with troops from Europe and regional powers like NATO member Turkey, a secular Muslim country that has strategic ties with the Jewish state.
