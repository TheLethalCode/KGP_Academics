 Marc Frank HAVANA, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tropical storm Noel left thousands of hectares of sugar cane under water in eastern and central Cuba and seriously damaged infrastructure, official media said on Friday, as rain continued in the area. The Communist party newspaper Granma reported "significant damage" in eastern Guantanamo province, "extensive areas of cane flooded" in neighboring Holguin province, and "ravaged" plantations in Las Tunas province. Extensive areas of cane were also flooded in eastern Santiago de Cuba and Granma provinces, as well as the central provinces of Camaguey and Ciego de Avila. Thousands of miles of secondary roads and rails used by the industry were washed out, while damage to major roads and rails left much of the area without adequate supplies of fuel and food, state-run media reported, without further detail. Unlike in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, no deaths were reported. Noel meandered for three days across eastern into central Cuba before exiting to the north, though associated rainfall continued into Friday. The area was already saturated by twice the normal rainfall in September and October. Cuban plantations lack adequate drainage systems. "From 120 meters up on a hill the cane plantations look like rice paddies, completely flooded," Las Tunas radio reporter Juan Manuel Olivares quipped from the cane-producing northern part of the province Friday morning. Camaguey cane farmer Diogenes Hernandez said in a telephone interview he was discouraged. "If you realise that from Camaguey east to Guantanamo there is more than half the country's sugar cane, with this deluge there will be neither mature cane nor roads to get it out," Hernandez said of the coming harvest. "It looks like what happened last year -- lots of cane and little sugar," he added. Unseasonable rainfall and heat combined with industrial and organisational problems to make the 2007 harvest one of the worst on record. Output was estimated at around 1.1 million metric tons of raw sugar, based on provincial reports, compared with the 1.5 million to 1.6 million tons that had been planned. Through September, sugar officials had waxed optimistic the harvest would begin early in November and run through April and that there was far more cane than the previous few years. But the excessive precipitation has apparently dampened their enthusiasm, with all but a few mills in the western part of the country now not expected to open until late December into January. Poor harvests in recent years have forced Cuba to import between 200,000 and 300,000 tons of low grade whites annually from Colombia and Brazil. Postponement of the harvest may force additional imports to meet domestic demand. Cuba consumes a minimum 700,000 tons of sugar per year and 400,000 tons are destined for a toll agreement with C
