 BRISBANE, Australia, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka continued to struggle in their tour match against Queensland on Saturday after going into stumps at 62-4 in their second innings, 23 runs behind the home side's first innings total. After the Sri Lankans declared at 201-9 in the first innings, fast bowler Andy Bichel scored 125 to lead Queensland to 295. Farveez Maharoof was the pick of the Sri Lankan bowlers on the second day of the three-day tour match with 3-72 off 20 overs and Lasith Malinga, Malinga Chandana and Sanath Jayasuriya grabbed two wickets each. Bichel's four-hour knock was his ninth first-class hundred and featured 11 fours and seven sixes. The 37-year-old's seven sixes was a record for a Queensland batsman in a first-class game. Fast bowler Ashley Noffke, the main destroyer in the first innings, was quickly into the action when Sri Lanka began their second innings. Noffke, who has taken 2-8 from six overs in the second innings, dismissed likely Test openers Jayasuriya, caught at third slip for two, and Marvan Atapattu, who was trapped leg before for seven. Sri Lanka will be hoping for a big score from captain Mahela Jayawardene, who was not out 22 at stumps, alongside Chamara Silva (2) when play resumes Sunday. The first Test in the two-Test series begins at the Gabba here on Thursday
