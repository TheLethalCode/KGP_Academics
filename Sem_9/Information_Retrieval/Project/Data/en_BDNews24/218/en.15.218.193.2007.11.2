<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Premier League ahead of this weekend's matches: Arsenal, unbeaten in 17 games this season, and Manchester United, who have won their last eight league games, meet in a top of the table clash at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday that is likely to have a big bearing on the outcome of the title race. Arsenal, whose young reserves thumped Sheffield United 3-0 in the League Cup on Wednesday, will be near full-strength, apart from missing Swiss defender Philippe Senderos (back) and Dutch forward Robin van Persie (knee), who are both still injured. Manchester United will be without Paul Scholes (knee), French striker Louis Saha (knee) and Michael Carrick (arm) while defender Gary Neville, who has just returned to fitness after a seven-month injury layoff, is unlikely to be included despite playing nearly an hour in his comeback match for the reserves on Thursday. With third-placed Manchester City not playing Sunderland until Monday, Chelsea have a good chance of going above City if they pick up three points as expected at struggling Wigan Athletic. Avram Grant's side crushed City 6-0 last week before a dramatic comeback 4-3 win over Leicester City in the League Cup on Wednesday, and should be too strong for Wigan, who have taken just one point from a possible 21 since the start of September. Chelsea will still be without injured England duo John Terry (knee) and Ashley Cole (ankle), while Wigan's England striker Emile Heskey is still out with a foot injury. An outstanding match is in prospect at Ewood Park where fifth-placed Blackburn Rovers take on sixth-placed Liverpool. Blackburn have won their last four league matches, while Liverpool are unbeaten in domestic matches this season. Robbie Savage, who has a knee injury, is Blackburn's only major absentee, while Liverpool hope to have Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano back after an ankle injury. Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, are hoping to kick-start their season in their first league match under new Spanish coach Juande Ramos as they travel to fellow strugglers Middlesbrough. Spurs, who are 18th, will be hoping to inflict a fifth straight league defeat on Middlesbrough, who have slipped to 17th. Former Spurs Egypt striker Mido is likely to be absent from the Boro side with a hamstring injury, while Gareth Bale (ankle) will be missing for Spurs. England goalkeeper Paul Robinson, who missed the last two league matches with a calf injury, will return to league action after playing in the 2-0 League Cup win over Blackpool on Wednesday
