<TITLE> Shadow of the gun looms over Lebanon crisis </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Fri Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For arms dealer Abu Walid, political crisis in Lebanon means profit. He says he can't keep up with customer demand. "The market is very prosperous. If there were weapons factories in Lebanon today, they would not be able to meet the demand," he said, adding that the price of a good Kalashnikov -- his best selling gun -- had trebled to more than $1,000. Weapons buying by rival political factions is ringing alarm bells for Lebanese who fear a bitter power struggle in their country will turn violent unless it is settled soon. Demand had been "unusually strong" over the last five months, said Abu Walid, declining to give his full name. "I don't care who's buying. What is important is who pays more." He said he buys his supplies from Palestinian factions while others smuggle weapons into the country. In a country already awash with guns, the distribution of more weapons has raised the stakes in efforts to resolve the standoff between the governing coalition backed by the United States and its opponents, who are supported by Syria and Iran. The rival parties are now trying to agree on a president to replace Emile Lahoud, whose term expires on November 23. But they have yet to make progress towards a deal seen as vital to defusing Lebanon's worst internal crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon last week expressed concern that militias were arming to prepare for a "constitutional void" if there was no agreement. Politicians from both sides have accused each other of arming and training supporters, casting a shadow over talks to end the crisis. Hezbollah, which has its own guerrilla army, is accused of conducting military training for its allies in the opposition -- a claim the group denies. Backed by Syria and Iran, Hezbollah says its weapons are only for use against Israel. Security officials have acknowledged training by factions on both sides. Security sources say the problem is still limited in scale and could be dealt with by the army, which has managed to maintain its neutrality during the year-long crisis. GUNS APLENTY, TENSION HIGH But with guns aplenty and animosity running deep among followers of rival leaders, a deterioration in the political situation could bring guns into the streets and spark violence. Sectarian mistrust is high between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim supporters of the rival sides and between Christians whose leaders stand on opposite sides of the political chasm. "We have asked the young men to use their money to buy weapons," said a Sunni political activist from Beirut. "There are meetings -- cells of 20 in each -- we tell them that anyone who has money should buy because the gun can only be fought with the gun," he said, declining to give his name. Residents of his Sunni area with military experience had also been contacted and primed for action if needed, he said. "Gifts" of weapons have been received from local donors. Deeply suspicious of Shi'ite group Hezbollah, he described how residents of his district had formed what amounted to a paramilitary neighborhood watch. "Our area will be turned into a complete fortress," he said. Such preparations are in part a result of clashes which killed 10 people earlier this year in some of Lebanon's worst civil strife since the 1975-1990 war. But although weapons sales are soaring and tensions high, analysts do not see the potential for a conflict on the scale of that war, which began with fighting between Christian and Muslim Lebanese, backed by Palestinian factions. In the civil war, the combatants had well-organized militias and extensive arsenals, including heavy weapons. Now, only Hezbollah has such resources at its disposal. Some argue that the group's dominant position precludes any conflict. "I still haven't figured out who is going to fight who," said Timur Goksel, an expert on security affairs in Lebanon. "If there is training going on, I don't think it's happening on a massive scale that we can call a militarization." "What we are mostly hearing about is small groups getting together for a weekend of firing their weapons," he said. But the emergence of "neighborhood watch" groups was one s
