<TITLE> French fishermen strike over rising fuel costs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RENNES, France, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fishermen at one of France's main ports went on strike on Friday to protest against the rising cost of fuel and demand state aid. Almost all the 300 boats based around the northwestern port of Guilvinec in Brittany took part in the strike and organisers said they hoped fishing fleets along France's Atlantic coast would join their protest. Some 500 fishing industry workers protested outside maritime offices in Guilvinec to press their case, blocking access to the building with crates and nets. Fishing firms say they had budgeted for diesel to cost some 30 euro cents a litre this year, but the price has jumped to 51 euro cents in recent days, meaning boats risk making a loss every time they go to sea. The fishermen want a cut in duty on fuel and have dismissed a 25.5 million euro ($37 million) aid package announced by the government three days ago as insufficient. Oil prices have risen 40 percent since mid-August, driven in part by expectations of tighter supplies this winter, and the cost of a barrel of oil rose more than $1 on Friday to some $94.
