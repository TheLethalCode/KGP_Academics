 RAMALLAH, West Bank, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Hamas officials on Friday for the first time since the Islamist group seized Gaza in June, but ruled out formal reconciliation talks until Hamas cedes the territory. Abbas said he met Hamas lawmaker Hussein Abu Kwaik and a Hamas-backed former government minister, Naser el-Deen al-Shaer, informally at his presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Hamas officials said Abbas initiated the meeting by inviting the officials for Friday prayers. "I met with Hamas officials and told them there would be no dialogue with Hamas until they reverse their coup," Abbas told Reuters in Ramallah shortly after the meeting. Abbas has refused to hold talks with Hamas since the group routed his forces in Gaza during violent clashes in June. The Palestinian leader has sacked a Hamas-led government and appointed a Fatah-backed administration in the West Bank, leading to an easing of U.S. and Israeli sanctions and plans for a peace conference. Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said two other Hamas members were also present at the meeting, which was not official. All four are based in the West Bank, where Abbas loyalists hold sway. Abu Kwaik this week criticised comments by Gaza-based Hamas leader Nizar Rayyan, who had called for using force to seize control of the West Bank. One political analyst said Hamas could be using Friday's meeting with Abbas to distance itself from Rayyan's comments. "This meeting indicates Hamas doesn't want to sever ties with Abbas," said Ali Jarbawi, professor of political science at Bir Zeit university in the West Bank. "It also shows a sort of split between Hamas moderates and radicals which seems to go along geographical lines between the West Bank and Gaza." NO DIALOGUE Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters in Gaza Abbas had invited the group to his compound for the prayers. "The prayers in the Muqata came after an invitation by Abbas to some Islamist figures, including some Hamas officials. It was not linked to any kind of dialogue between Hamas and Fatah." Last month Hamas said it was ready to hold reconciliation talks with Fatah and hinted it might be ready to give up control of the Gaza Strip. But Fatah ruled out talks unless Hamas first cedes control of the coastal territory. Jarbawi said a politically weak Abbas may be using Friday's meeting to send a message to Israel and the United States, warning them not to press him too hard to make concessions at a peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland due before year end. "I don't think he's interested in talks with Hamas right now but maybe he's sendng a signal saying: 'look, don't press me too much at Annapolis I also have other options," he said. Israel and the West have shunned Hamas, demanding it recognise the Jewish state. Israel has warned that dialogue between Fatah and Hamas could torpedo a peace deal. Israeli government spokesman David Baker said on Friday Hamas was "bent on Israel's destruction and should be kept out of the gam
