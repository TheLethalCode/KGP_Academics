 Rangpur, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chief HM Ershad Friday demanded that war criminals be tried and a ban on Jamaat-e-Islami for its anti-independence role. "Jamaat is an anti-liberation force. During the 1971 war of independence it was involved in killings, rapes, arson and looting," the former president said at a meeting with journalists at his home in Rangpur town. Ershad urged the Election Commission not to register the party for elections. He said separate laws were not required to try war criminals; they could be tried under laws already in force. He demanded that the caretaker government complete the trial of corruption suspects before the elections and disqualify those found guilty from contesting polls. District JP general secretary Mostafizar Rahman Mostafa, city president and chairman of Rangpur Municipality Abdur Rauf Manik and former lawmaker Mohammad Ali Sarker were present at the meeting. bdnews24.
