 HONG KONG, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks fell nearly 2 percent on Friday, led by financial shares after broker downgrades of US banking giant Citigroup sparked worries about further fallouts from credit market problems. Those concerns dampened appetite for riskier assets, boosting safe-haven Japanese government bonds and the helping the low-yielding yen hold most of Thursday's sharp gains, while snuffing out the rally in US crude Oil was at $93.76 a barrel, down from an all-time high of $96.24 set a day ago, and gold fell in tandem to about $790 an ounce from a 28-year peak near $800. At 0220 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had fallen 1.7 percent, while MSCI's measure of other Asia Pacific stocks shed 1.8 percent. Just a day earlier, the MSCI index reached an all-time high before ending a shade lower after the boost from a widely expected US interest rate cut faded. "The market was getting a bit complacent, thinking that the Fed will fix everything. It's not going to be that easy," said Eric Betts, equities strategist at Nomura Australia. Bad news for stock investors came in the form of a ratings downgrade, where CIBC World Markets cited concerns Citi might have to cut its dividend or sell assets to boost capital, amid fears the bank could face further losses from subprime mortgage-related securities. The news, which drove Citi's shares down nearly 7 percent, coupled with disappointing earnings from Exxon Mobil, sent Wall Street's three main indexes down more than 2 percent. "Investors will take the US market plunge as a chance to take profit from a recent bull run," said Lee Kyung-soo, a market analyst at Daewoo Securities. Asia ex-Japan stocks are up nearly 45 percent so far this year. Data showing a slowdown in factory growth in October that suggested the US economy was cooling from its surprisingly robust third-quarter pace also weighed on sentiment. Stock markets fell across the board with South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong all down more than 1 percent. All three markets had hit record highs this week. FINANCIALS HIT Bank stocks bore the brunt of the selloff with Japan's top lender Mitsubishi UFJ, Australia's Macquarie Bank, South Korean lender Kookmin Bank and HSBC, all down more than 2 percent. Woori Financial Group slid 3.7 percent a day after it wrote off $166 million of bonds linked to US subprime mortgages as losses, denting third quarter earnings. Japanese automakers were not spared despite posting positive sales in a slumping US market that saw Chrysler LLC and Ford Motor report double-digit sales drop last month. Nissan Motor fell 3.6 percent, while Toyota, which snapped a three-month streak of lower US sales, shed 2.8 percent. YEN HOLDS GAINS, EYES ON PAYROLLS While off early lows, the dollar held below 115 yen after falling from near 116 yen overnight, while the euro briefly dipped below 165 yen from above 167 yen in the previous session. Against the dollar, the single currency bought $1.4430 off the record high just above $1.45. But further gains in the yen will depend on the influential US non-farm payrolls report due later on Friday, which is expected to show an increase of 80,000 jobs and a steady jobless rate of 4.7 percent. "If the US jobs data is weaker-than-expected, expectations for a December rate cut will be reheated," said a trader at a Japanese bank. Weakness in equities helped bolster government bonds, causing yields to fall. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was yielding 1.605 percent, down six basis points from Thursday's close.
