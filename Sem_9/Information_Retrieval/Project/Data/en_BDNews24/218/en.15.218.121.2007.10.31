 COLOMBO, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka has imposed a ban on reporting of troop deployments and proposed military operations and arms procurement as stepped-up fighting continues in the latest chapter of a long-running civil war. The censorship move came a week after Tamil Tiger rebels had mounted their biggest suicide operation by land, backed by air strikes. The assault on an air force base in the northern district of Anuradhapura killed 14 service personnel and damaged several aircraft, while 21 rebel suicide fighters also died. The government notification on the new rules, issued earlier this week and seen by Reuters on Wednesday, said they "may be cited as the Emergency (Prohibition on Publication and Transmission of Sensitive Military Information) Regulations". The rules say the media should not "print, publish, distribute or transmit" material pertaining to proposed military actions or arms procurements, "or the deployment of troops or personnel", among other items. President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is also the defence minister, imposed the censorship rules. "The President may, for the purpose of these regulations, appoint by name or office, any person or body of persons to be the Competent Authority," it added. The gazette notification said the punishment for any violation of the new regulations will be a "rigorous imprisonment" for a maximum 5-year term. The censorship move came after the government suspended five radio stations belonging to privately owned 'ABC network' on Friday, accusing them of airing a false broadcast about a Tamil Tiger rebel attack on a village in the far south. The government and the rebels are locked in a propaganda war over renewed fighting in the north and east. An estimated 5,000 people have been killed since early last year amid near-daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes. The death toll since the conflict erupted in 1983 stands at about 70,000.
