 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmad staunchly defended his administration's track-record at a meeting with leading editors in his office Wednesday. Fakhruddin listed the measures undertaken by his interim administration to "protect this government's objectives", including electoral, administrative and local government reforms. He stressed his administration's efforts to improve public services, citing the one-stop passport service and power supply as examples. Of the latter, he said the load-shedding situation had improved. Mentioning that 1400 MW would be added to the national grid by Dec 2008, he said more power deals were on the table. "By 2008, I'd like to leave a situation so that the new government doesn't face a major crisis." The chief adviser mentioned his administration's "reform" measures, including amendments to the Election Commission, Anticorruption Commission, Public Service Commission and University Grants Commission. Fakhruddin also referred to the amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure to separate the judiciary from the executive. Speaking of the new Regulatory Reforms Commission, Fakhruddin named "two more institutional reforms in future"the National Human Rights Commission and the proposed Right to Information Act, a law relating to freedom of information. "I know we will be able to accomplish and implement much [before we leave at the end of 2008]," the CA said. In answer to an editor's question, the chief adviser said: "I would not deny that some fundamental rights have been curbed because of the state of emergency." But Fakhruddin disagreed with the editor's comment that "people are entrapped". "There is no doubt that we have to lift the state of emergency." But he said the prime objective was to hold "fair and acceptable elections". bdnews2
