 NEW DELHI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will continue their cricket tour of neighbouring India even though emergency rule has been imposed back home, a team official said on Saturday. "We are just focusing on cricket," the team's media manager Ehsan Malik said. "We've had no intimation (from the Pakistan board). Everything is status quo." Pakistan will leave New Delhi on Sunday for Guwahati for the first one-dayer to be played the next day. The five-match ODI series will be followed by three tests which conclude on Dec. 12.
