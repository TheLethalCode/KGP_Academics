 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  National discard Hannan Sarkar smashed 85 as Barisal dominated over holders Dhaka at the close of the second day of the third round four-dayer in the Ispahani Mirzapore Tea Ninth National Cricket League Saturday. Barisal were 215 for four at stumps in reply to Dhaka's paltry total of 157 all out in the first innings at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Imrul Kayes smashed league's second century as Khulna posted a modest 274 all out against Sylhet despite Enamul Haq Junior's five-wicket haul on the second day after the first day was abandoned following the wet outfield at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Away at Bir Shrestha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong, the second day's play between Chittagong and visitors Rajshahi was called off due to wet outfield after Rajshahi ended up the first day Friday with 191 for nine. Dhaka vs Barisal Barisal, having resumed the day on 27 for no loss, finished the day at 215 for four, taking a slim 58-run lead in the first innings. Hannan topscored with 85 off 273 balls, and put on 63 runs for the opening stand with Shahriar Nafees (33) and added another 69 for the second wicket with Imran Ahmed (35). Hannan, who hammered four fours, was the fourth batsman out to leave the side at 174. Nasiruddin Faruque (27) and Raisul Islam (14) remained unbeaten to put on 41 runs for the unbroken fifth wicket when the bails were drawn for Day 2. Khulna vs Sylhet Left-handed opener Imrul and national all-rounder Saqib Al Hasan guided Khulna to post a fine total with 127 and 59 respectively. Imrul, who clubbed 16 fours and two sixes in his 208-ball knock, was the fourth batsman out, leaving the side at 222 for four, but Khulna saw their remaining six wickets fall for just 52 runs to be folded to 274. Saqib, the first centurion in the ongoing league, chipped in with a timely 59 off 66 balls that studded with seven boundaries before being bowled by Enamul, who returned with five for 65. Except those two batsmen, Habibul Bashar (33), Nahidul (16) and Tushar Imran (10) managed to cross the double digit as pacers Rashedur Rahman and Tapash Baishya each took two wickets for 33 and 61. Sylhet, in reply, were six for no loss with Golam Rahman and Golam Mabud batting on identical 3.
