 Dhaka, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com) - Islami Oikya Jote leader Misbahur Rahman Chowdhury Saturday said he would testify against Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mujahid and assistant secretary general Abdul Quader Molla for war crimes they allegedly committed in 1971. At a press conference in the IOJ's office, Chowdhury, chairman of an IOJ faction, said that up to 50 Jamaat leaders had been involved in war crimes during the liberation war. "Jamaat should be banned if war criminals are not expelled from the party," he said. Chowdhury trashed demands by left-wing political parties that politics based on religion be banned. "That is unconstitutional and illegal," he said. Chowdhury told reporters that he worked with Nizami, Mujahid, Quader Mollah and top Jamaat leaders in 1971. "I was with Chhatra Shangha at that time. They (Nizami, Mujahid and Quader Molla) joined Badar Bahini and I went to England." "I knew they acted against the liberation of the country and I am ready to testify in court against them," Chowdhury said. Misbahur demanded the trial of those who acted against the liberation war in 1971 and of those now involved with militancy. He said the Jamaat leaders had called the liberation war a 'civil war' and made "indecent remarks" about freedom fighters. bdnews24.
