 GENEVA, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chairman of agriculture negotiations in the Doha round at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will delay his revision of a draft compromise text to the end of November, trade diplomats said on Friday. New Zealand's WTO ambassador, Crawford Falconer, had planned to issue his revision to a draft text on agriculture -- widely seen as the key to a comprehensive trade deal -- in the middle of this month, but needs more time to bridge differences between rich and poor countries, they said. The farm talks have run into difficulties on the question of market access -- in particular how countries can protect the producers of politically sensitive products. The delay will allow a group of developed countries another week to provide Falconer with data on consumption patterns, which could be used to decide which products should be designated as sensitive and how to treat them. Falconer would then meet with negotiators again in the week of Nov. 12, and aim to produce his revised draft, incorporating the data and the negotiators' views, by the end of the month. "It's a delay for positive reasons," said a U.S. trade official. Since the long-running negotiations resumed in earnest in September, trade diplomats had said that agriculture offered the best hope of an early advance, and Falconer had hoped to issue a revision in early or mid November of the negotiating text he first produced in July. Agreement on the outlines of a deal in farming could then allow negotiators to put liberalisation deals on industry and on services such as banking and telecoms into place in the talks, launched six years ago to free up world trade. The delay will also allow Falconer to take into account the outcome of a meeting of the G-20 group of developing countries that Brazil has called for Nov. 15 in Gene
