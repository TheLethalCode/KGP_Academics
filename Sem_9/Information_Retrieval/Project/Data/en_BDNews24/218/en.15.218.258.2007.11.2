<TITLE> Stocks cool down on profit-taking run </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnes24.com)  The Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) was cooling down thanks to a weeklong profit-taking run by investors, with banking and power sectors closing lower following steady gains in previous rallies. "This has helped stabilise the market to some extent, but many issues remain overpriced," said Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Faruq Ahmad Siddiqi. The main DGEN or general index ended at 2836.32 Thursday, down 65.67 points or 2.26 percent from an all-time high of 2901.99 the previous Thursday. Other indices also finished lower. Daily average turnover for a week on the bourse dropped 24.60 percent to Tk 1.98 billion from its highest-ever average of Tk 2.63 billion, due mainly to a SEC lending restriction on merchant banks that barred greater-than 100 percent loans to clients. Transaction volume on the Dhaka bourse also declined. The week started with a fall in DESCO shares after it posted 25 percent cash dividend for the year 2006-07. A steady decline in market majors Trust Bank, BRAC Bank, Summit Power, AB Bank, Power Grid Company of Bangladesh and Square Pharmaceuticals helped the market hit the skids. Dhaka University economics teacher Abu Ahmed said, "This was expected. Profit-taking may cool down the market, but let's see how it behaves over the next few days." Analysts said except for the volatile movement of Islami Bank and Rupali Bank shares, market behaviour was moderately okay over the week and had withstood the risk of a major correction. "The market had a soft landing, demonstrating a level of maturity. It does not appear as though there will be a major correction," said Yawer Sayeed who helps manage Tk 1 billion in funds at AIMS of Bangladesh. Analysts said investors were waiting, watching and stopping to breathe following a dizzying rally that drove the benchmark DGEN to hit an all-time high of 2901.99 on Oct 25. The regulator termed the earlier rally 'abnormal' as too many funds chased too few shares. A slowdown in bank lending to the real estate sector contributed to the diversion of funds towards the stock market, according to analysts. "Investors appear to have taken a watchful stance," said Ziaul Haque Khondker, managing director of state-run investment bank Investment Corporation of Bangladesh. bdne
