 DUBAI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Al Qaeda second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahri said a Libyan group had joined the militant organisation and he urged mujahideen in North Africa to topple the leaders of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. "Today, with grace from God, the Muslim nation witnesses a blessed step ... honourable members of the fighting Islamic group in Libya announce that they are joining the al Qaeda group to continue the march of their brothers," said Zawahri in a recording produced by As-Sahab, the group's media arm, and posted on Saturday. "O nation of jihad, support your sons so that we defeat our enemies and rid our homeland of their slaves," said Zawahri, naming the leaders of the four North African Arab nations. Zawahri presented another speaker whom he identified by an alias, Abu al-Laith, suggesting he was the leader of al Qaeda's Libyan wing. Libya is an OPEC oil exporting nation. "We announce we are joining al Qaeda as loyal soldiers," Abu al-Laith said. The recording was posted on Saturday on an Islamist Web site.
