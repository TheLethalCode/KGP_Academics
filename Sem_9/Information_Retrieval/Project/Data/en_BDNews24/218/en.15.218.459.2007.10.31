<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh have been drawn in a relatively easy group in the 2009 Twenty20 World Cup to be held in England. The Tigers were drawn with champions India and lowly Zimbabwe in Group A. The grouping of the tournament was completed Wednesday in Dubai during a general meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC). As there have not been enough Twenty20 matches played yet, it was not possible for the ICC to establish an official ranking for this format. It relied on the results of the inaugural meet held in South Africa last month to complete the draw. Bangladesh defeated the West Indies in group match to finish eighth, a result that eventually helped the Tigers to get an easy group. Group A: India (1), Bangladesh (8) and Zimbabwe (9) Group B: Pakistan (2), England (7) and Associate 1 (10) Group C: Australia (3), Sri Lanka (6) and West Indies (11) Group D: New Zealand (4), South Africa (5) and Associate 2 (12)
