 BEIJING, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The planned construction of hydroelectric power stations in the middle of China's oldest irrigation system and a World Heritage site has sparked concern, state media said on Friday. The plans include a dam in the middle of the centuries-old irrigation network at Dujiangyan, in the southwestern province of Sichuan, and erecting up to 10 hydropower stations and other tourist and real estate developments along the Botiao River. "It is irrational to build such stations as they will destroy the natural ecology along the river," Chen Qingheng, a researcher with the Chengdu ecological research centre under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was quoted by the China Daily as saying. "Moreover, (it) will affect the local drinking water." Botiao River is one of the four tributaries of the Min River, the main source of drinking water for Chengdu. The Dujiangyan government has said the hydroelectric plants will cost 1 billion yuan ($134 million) to build and will have the capacity to generate more than 100,000 kw. "The hydroelectric project will require a number of dams to be built and they will raise the water level of the river," said Zhao Wenqian, deputy director of the Sichuan provincial academy of water resources. "If the dams are breached, every farm and village in the area will be at risk." Other factors, such as the environmental impact and the significance that Dujiangyan represents in Chinese history, should be taken into consideration too, an editorial in the China Daily said. The dam plan was introduced three years ago but delayed after severe media backlash and criticism from experts. "The assessment should be conducted not only by the water resource authority but also environmental protection, forestry and land resource departments, and other scientific research institutions to ensure comprehensive analysis," said Nie Xiuxiang, deputy director of the Sichuan science and technology Association.
