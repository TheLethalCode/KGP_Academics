 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com) - Power Cell, under the Power Division, has invited private concerns to submit their pre-qualifications for operating two independent power plants at Bibiana and Sirajganj. The two power stations will have a capacity of between 330 and 450 megawatts. The final date for submitting applications for the Bibiana power plant has been fixed for Nov 8 and for Sirajganj power plant on Dec 11. Power Cell's director general Abdul Jalil told bdnews24.com that those who pass the prequalification phase would be asked to submit their tenders with detailed proposals. Power Cell officials added that the government expects to sign an agreement with the successful bidder by April or May next year. The two gas fired power plants should come into operation by 2011, said the official. Power Cell is also evaluating proposals from five private companies this week in a move to bring a further eight rental power plants into operation. "The proposals are currently being scrutinised, this process may be completed by the end of the week," said Jalil. Five companies submitted 13 proposals for seven 260 megawatt power plants following Power Cell's tenders. The response left only a proposal for a project in Fenchuganj without any takers, Power Cell has now re-tendered the project. Power Cell officials said the companies who had submitted proposals were Aggreko from Singapore, Alstom Power Rentals from the US, Kaltimex Energy from Indonesia, Energy Prima from Bangladesh and a Bangladeshi consortium called Green Power. The government selected the eight locations for the availability of gas and ease with which they could hook up to the national power grid. The sites are Sylhet (50 megawatt), Fenchuganj (50), Shahjibazar (50), Ashuganj (50), Bhola (30), Khulna (40), Bheramara (20) and Bogra (20). Bheramara and Khulna power plant are slated to be diesel-run, while the rest are to be gas run. bdnews
