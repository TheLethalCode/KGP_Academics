 London, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  UK's Immigration Minister Liam Byrne was fined 100 pounds Friday for talking on a mobile phone while driving, his department confirmed. The 37 year-old MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill was also ordered to pay 45 pounds in costs and had three points docked from his licence. Byrne admitted the charge at Sutton Coldfield Magistrates' Court. "Liam Byrne has pleaded guilty to the charge of driving whilst using a mobile phone, the court has dealt with this matter and the minister has apologised," a Home Office spokeswoman said, declining to elaborate. Media reports said the incident happened in July while Byrne was driving his Ford Escort north of Birmingham and that he had been talking about an important matter to do with deportation. His conviction, which was criticised by road safety campaigners, comes after tough new penalties were introduced earlier this year for anyone caught driving while talking on a hand-held mobile phone.
