 Dhaka, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)  The children of Syed Nazrul Islam, acting president of the provisional government of Bangladesh at Mujibnagar and a close aide to independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Friday demanded that the verdict in their father's murder case be carried out. Syed Ashraful Islam, son of Nazrul Islam and acting general secretary of the Awami League, made the demand from a press conference at his home in Sher-e-Bangla Nagar, a day ahead of Jail Killing Day. Syed Nazrul Islam and three other national leaders Tajuddin Ahmed, M Mansur Ali and AHM Qamaruzzaman were killed while in custody at Dhaka central jail on Nov 3, 1975. The day is remembered as Jail Killing Day. Ashraful asked the interim government to carry out the verdict in the jail killing case to protect the image of the nation. Nazrul Islam's other son Syed Safayetul Alam, his wife Syeda Mahbuba Akter and their two sons Syed Nafis Nazrul and Syed Ismam Faruqi were present at the news conference. "The death of my father is more a matter of pride than pain. The four national leaders by sacrificing their lives proved that they did not betray Bangabandhu," he said. "Anti-liberation forces, in a well-planned way, killed the four liberation war leaders after killing Bangabandhu and his family members." Syed Safayet said: "We hope to get justice from a judiciary that is now free." "We hope the independent judiciary will start its journey by attending to the killing of Bangabandhu and the killing of the four national leaders." bdnews24
