 COLOMBO, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lankan troops killed 31 Tamil Tigers fighters in a series of clashes in the north of the island, as warplanes bombed rebel training camps on Thursday, the military said. Two soldiers were also killed and 17 wounded in the clashes with the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northwestern district of Mannar and neighbouring Vavuniya, the focus of renewed civil war.

An estimated 5,000 people have been killed since early last year amid near-daily land and sea clashes, ambushes and air strikes.
