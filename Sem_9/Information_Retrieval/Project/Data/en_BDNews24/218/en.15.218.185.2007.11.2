 NEW YORK, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US voters will decide on about $29 billion of bond issues on Tuesday's ballots, including funding for cancer and stem cell research, highways and schools. The biggest chunk of the proposed debt issuance is in Texas, where voters will be asked to approve five state bond measures totaling $9.75 billion and a flurry of local ones mostly for schools. But the total amount of proposed new borrowing by states, counties and towns will be considerably smaller this year than a record $78.6 billion in proposed bond issuance on 2006 general election ballots, as tallied by Ipreo LLC and The Bond Buyer. "That's typical for an odd-year election," said Jennie Drage Bowser, policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver, Colorado. Most states only hold a statewide election in even years and most citizen initiatives also can only appear on even-year general election ballots, Bowser said. This year voters will decide on 34 statewide ballot questions in six states. There are only 10 statewide bond measures in Texas, New Jersey and Maine, which is good news for the $2.5 trillion municipal bond market. "The debt is relatively light," said David Hitchcock, senior director and analyst at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services in San Francisco. "I don't see any pressure to bond ratings from things on the ballots." ROADS, RESEARCH AND BONDS The largest proposal is for $5 billion of general obligation bonds in Texas to pay for highway improvements followed by $3 billion of bonds to establish the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute and fund research into all forms of human cancer. Cal Jillson, professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said the statewide Texas bond referenda "are highly likely to pass." Jillson said the cancer research bond proposal backed by Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry is popular in the generally conservative state because it is seen as an alternative to controversial embryonic stem cell research. New Jersey, meanwhile, is asking voters to approve $450 million of bonds for stem cell research, which Gov. Jon Corzine also is pushing. The measure is needed to ensure New Jersey stays the "medicine chest" for the world, the Democrat says. MORE STUDENTS, MORE BONDS Other proposed bond measures on Tuesday's ballot are for school construction, land preservation and infrastructure projects. Most of them are again in Texas, which is one of the fastest growing states in the country. The state wants to raise $1 billion for maintenance and improvement of state facilities and $500 million to fund education loans to college and university students. Texas school districts are asking voters to approve millions of dollars of borrowing to build new facilities and buy more buses to accommodate expected increases in students. For example, the Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District in Houston is asking to borrow $807 million, another Houston school district is asking to issue $805 million of bonds and the Prosper Independent School District outside of Dallas wants to tap the market for $710 million. In Virginia, Fairfax County voters will decide on $365 million in bonds for schools. A school voucher program is on the ballot in Utah, while Washington voters will decide whether to okay a bill that prohibits insurers from unreasonably denying a claim for coverage or benefits. Washington voters will also consider whether to expand an existing requirement that any tax increases must be approved by two-thirds of the Legislature and whether to create a budget emergency reserve. Texas and New Jersey have ballot questions to provide property and other tax relief, while Oregon voters will decide whether to increase the tobacco tax by 84.5 cents to provide dedicated funding for children's health care. Oregon voters will also consider whether to scale back a 2004 measure that proved too costly to local governments and undermined land use regulations. That measure required local governments to compensate landowners for lost revenue if zoning restrictions prevented them from developing their land or to waive these restrictions. Texas will decide on a proposition to allow governments to sell property acquired through eminent domain but not used for public purposes back to the previous owner at the original price. In Maine, voters will decide whether to allow slot machines at a tribal commercial track in Washington County and whether to expand legislative term limi
