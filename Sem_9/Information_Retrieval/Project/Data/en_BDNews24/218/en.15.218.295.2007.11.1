<TITLE> Judiciary emerges free amid high hope </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The country's government head, top judge and interim law minister Thursday revelled in the emergence of a judiciaryfinally set free from the corrosive executive influence but spoke of the challenges ahead in delivering justice to the people. Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin said the judicial power was actually not a power in itself but a means to end people's woes. "The judicial functionaries wield judicial power which is actually not a power but a pledge to wipe off tear caused by injustice," Amin said in his speech at the inauguration of judiciary separation at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. The separation, called by many as a landmark event in Bangladesh's history after a decade of legal wrangling, was formally declared by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at the state function. "From today the judiciary is separated," he declared. The judiciary, suffering from erosion in public confidence because of political pressure, was made independent of the executive wing through the launch of the activities of Dhaka District Judicial Magistracy and Dhaka Metropolitan Magistracy. "It is a great day for the nation and there is no doubt about it," Fakhruddin said. "This glorious day will forever be remembered as a milestone in our forward march towards establishing good governance and the rule of law in our country," the interim government leader said. The chief justice also sounded happy as the separation, which he called a long-felt national demand, finally got through. He said the nation waited for the event since the constitution was drafted on Nov 4, 1972, envisaging clear provisions of a free judiciary in Article 22. Amin referred to the adage taught in high school, "It is better late than never." The chief justice asked judicial magistrates to remain "fully committed" to discharging their duties and stressed utmost sincerity and dedication so that they could meet people's expectations. "So far as I understand every member of the judiciary is under a public duty to administer justice in its truest sense at minimum time and cost." "I have the firm conviction (that) the members of the judiciary shouldering the new responsibilities will be able to magnify the image of judiciary and restore public confidence through their hard work and dedicated services." Law and justice adviser Mainul Hosein also joined the interim leader and the top justice to say: "Only through personal integrity and good conscience can judges ensure people's confidence in the judiciary." "The judges have to ensure that people's high expectation about getting speedy justice the easy way does not remain illusive," Mainul said. He, however, warned against any political bias in the current "critical situation". "There is no room for partisan bias for fully appreciating the hurdles we have to cross so that we do not fail the nation in securing peace, security and justice," the adviser said. He said the judges had their accountability to the society and their accountability must follow their conscience and oath of their office. Separation to follow constitution, ensure justice Fakhruddin said the judiciary had been made independent because the constitution said so. Pointing to the brouhaha by some administrative officials, the chief adviser said the decision to free the judicial system had been taken not because the government had no confidence in the executive. "We have full confidence in the executive," he said. He called upon all officials of the state's different organs to perform their duties. He, however, "ordered" all officials of the republic to "cooperate with" the judiciary under the new arrangement. He said such a venture cannot go trouble-free. "Some initial troubles are normal. But the government is pledge-bound to remove those hurdles," he said. The chief justice also sought cooperation from the executive to help make the new order work. Amin said all organs of the state have a set of duties but everything was meant to ensure justice for people. "In order to make the law effective and to make the justice delivery system functional the other organ of the state (the executive) will hopefully play a supportive role in making the promise of justice a real one," the chief justice said. People's faith is real power Mainul, the law adviser, said people's faith in the judiciary is the real power. "The faith of the people in the judiciary gives the judiciary the real power band, overriding moral authority. Some of our eminent judges have proved their judicial activism and calm courage whenever the nation faced a crisis in the field of rule of law or constitutional process." He said moral compulsion to deliver justice honestly, not arrogance of power, was important to make the judiciary effective. bdne
