<TEXT>
 BRISBANE, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Queensland all-rounder Ashley Noffke stole the limelight as he ripped through Sri Lanka's top order in their three-day tour match on Friday. Noffke took 5-36 to leave Sri Lanka in trouble at 139-8 before wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene (58 not out) and Malinga Bandara (43) rallied the tourists with a 71-run partnership. The Sri Lankans declared at 210-9 just after tea and then claimed four Queensland wickets in the final session, having the home side 60-4 at the close of the first day. Queensland fast bowler Mitchell Johnson was named in Australia's squad for the first Test starting at the Gabba on Friday but he was upstaged by Noffke. Noffke took three wickets for just two runs from his first four overs, removing Sanath Jayasuriya for one, Michael Vandort for four and captain Mahela Jayawardene for a duck. Michael Kasprowicz (2-28) also got in the act, striking in his second over when he had Thilan Samaraweera caught behind for seven. Johnson (1-39) broke through with the last ball before lunch as he had veteran opener Marvan Atapattu caught in the gully for 48. Lasith Malinga and Farveez Maharoof bowled fiery spells and claimed two wickets each late in the day for Sri Lanka. Openers Jimmy Maher (4) and Ryan Broad (12) went inside the first 10 overs before Andrew Symonds smashed Malinga for three consecutive boundaries in a quick-fire 22 off 20 balls
