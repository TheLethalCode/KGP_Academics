 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP leaders Hafizuddin Ahmed and ASM Hannan Shah Friday traded verbal bursts over the Nov 3, 1975 coup and the 1981 assassination of former president Ziaur Rahman. Both leaders, who had served in the army, briefed the media in their homes in a war of words that has plagued the beleaguered party in recent days. Hannan said Hafizuddin, a former major who is now acting secretary general, was involved with Nov 3 coupan allegation Hafizuddin refuted. Hafizuudin said Hannan had been trying to smear him and accused him of meeting Ershad after Zia was killed. "In 1981, he had a conciliatory meeting with Ershad as representative of Manjur after Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in Chittagong." Hannan said to reporters later in his Mohakhali DOHS home, "Hafizuddin had taken part in an abortive army rebellion under the leadership of Colonel Shafayat Jamil, head of the 46 brigade. He (Hafiz) was involved with November 3 incident. "I resisted those military coups of the people like Hafiz. Hafiz was also involved with the Bogra army rebellion." Hannan said he did not have any connection with Zia's assassination. "It was I who had taken the initiative and recovered the body of Zia from Rangunia and handed it over to Justice Sattar," he said. Earlier in the morning, Hafizuddin told reporters, "It was broadcast on the state-run television's news that Hannan Shah had a meeting with the then army chief as a representative of general Manjur. But I do not know if he was involved with Zia's assassination." Hafizuddin trashed the allegation of his connection with the Nov 3 incident. "If I were involved with the incident, I would have been tried as Zia had become army chief only three days after the rebellion." He said Hannan made such remarks being jealous of his becoming secretary general. He asked the party followers not to be misguided by Hannan's remarks. "BNP will work in line with its constitution. Chairperson is behind bars. Saifur Rahman will lead the party in her absence. The standing committee's decision is final. "Khaleda Zia is my leader. But she is not among us now so the standing committee will run the party," he said. Hafizuddin said those detached from the people were spreading misleading information instead of abiding by the party decision. The acting secretary general asked authorities for better treatment of BNP's senior joint secretary general Tarique Rahman and his brother Arafat Rahman Coco. BNP joint secretary Ashraf Hossain and chairperson's adviser ZA Khan were present. Hannan in his briefing accused Hafizuddin of lying. "We have to think if such liars and frauds can be allowed to stay in the party." He said he did not lose security deposit in polls, as alleged by Hafizuddin. "It was a conspiracy. My opponent conspired against me and rigged vote to defeat me." He renewed his claim that the Oct 29 meeting of the standing committee was illegal, which meant every decision the meeting had taken was illegitimate. Hannan asked party followers to socially and politically boycott the so called pro-reform leaders. bdne
