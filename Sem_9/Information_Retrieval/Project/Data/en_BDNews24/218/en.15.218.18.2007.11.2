<TITLE> UK court approves terrorist suspects' deportation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three Algerian men and a Jordanian faced deportation from Britain after a special court dealing with foreign terrorist suspects rejected their appeals on Friday. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission dismissed arguments that the men -- whom the media can identify only by letters -- would face torture on returning to their home countries. Britain regards the men as a serious security threat and says one of them had direct ties to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Human rights groups say that if Britain has evidence against them, they should be put on trial. Gareth Peirce, a lawyer for two of the Algerians, said they would launch a further appeal and condemned the secrecy surrounding the court. She said she had no idea of the content of confidential 'closed evidence' that formed part of its deliberations. "We have been trapped in the vice of secret hearings, secret courts, secret decisions on appeal," Peirce told reporters, adding that the men were only prolonging their legal battle because they feared for their lives in Algeria. "It is inconceivable that any human being would continue to run this marathon in custody if he did not absolutely fear he would face torture or death as the alternative." Britain says one of the Algerians, known as U, had ties to bin Laden and also supported militants behind bomb plots in 1999 and 2000 against Los Angeles airport and a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France. Human rights groups have attacked the drawn-out proceedings against the men. One, known as Y, was in fact tried and acquitted of a plot in Britain involving ricin poison, but later re-arrested as the government clamped down on suspected militants after suicide bombers struck London in 2005. Lawrence Archer, a juror in Y's case who is now campaigning on his behalf, said the Algerian was effectively "tied in a box with both hands behind his back" as he fought the legal system. "Mentally he's completely crushed," said Archer, who has visited Y in jail within the past few weeks. Britain says it is confident the suspects will be well-treated on their return, on the basis of case-by-case assurances received from the Algerian government. In the case of Jordan, it signed a memorandum in 2005 in which Amman promised that any suspect detained after being deported would be treated humanely and given frequent visits from an independent body approved by both governmen
