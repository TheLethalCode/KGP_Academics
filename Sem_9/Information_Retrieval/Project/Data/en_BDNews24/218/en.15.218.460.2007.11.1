<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet Wednesday approved a proposal to make the Anticorruption Commission an autonomous body. The proposal is designed to amend the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004, which describes the graft watchdog as no more than 'independent and neutral'. "The amendment [after final vetting] will now make the commission autonomous as well," the Press Information Department said in a statement. The ACC had earlier sent the proposal to the Cabinet Division seeking autonomy. Approval for the amendment will be effective after a vetting from the law ministry, according to a decision taken at a meeting at the Chief Adviser's Office, chaired by Fakhruddin Ahmed. The council of advisers also approved in principle the National ID Card Ordinance to introduce "modern and digitised" national ID cards to citizens at home and abroad. The meeting addressed a number of other issues including the vendors agreement, which is necessary to transfer the assets and liabilities of Sonali, Janata and Agrani banks to public limited companies. The advisory council meeting also discussed proposals for further amendments to the Islamic University Act 1980 and Islamic University (Amendment) Act 2006. In line with the amendments, the Madrasa Education Board will conduct the exams of Fazil and Kamil students who have signed up for a two-year course for academic year 2005-2006. On the other hand, the Islamic University will conduct the exams of Fazil and Kamil students who have signed up for a three-year course for academic year 2005-2006. bdn
