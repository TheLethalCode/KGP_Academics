<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia and Sri Lanka are to play for a new trophy named after the two most successful bowlers in test history, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Saturday. Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne retired this year with a world record 708 test wickets and Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan is just eight behind going into the two-test series between the teams starting in Brisbane on Thursday. The series winners will collect the Warne-Muralitharan trophy for the first time. "The two greatest bowlers in world cricket history have lent their names to a perpetual prize that will be played for in test Series between Australia and Sri Lanka," CA said in a statement. The trophy celebrates the 25th anniversary of Australia-Sri Lanka test cricket and features casts of Warne and Muralitharan's right hands. "We've had some great battles in the past and helped raise each other's game to the heights that we've reached," Warne said. "The rivalry between Australia and Sri Lanka has grown immeasurably over the last decade and I know my former Australian team mates will be super keen to be the first country to win the trophy when they do battle." Warne and off-spinner Muralitharan will unveil the trophy before the second test in Hobart starting on Nov. 16
