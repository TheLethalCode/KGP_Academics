 CAIRO, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of Orascom Construction Industries surged to a record high on Thursday, propelled by foreign buying after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates. Shares of OCI, the largest Arab construction company by market value, jumped 2.9 percent to 514.89 Egyptian pounds ($93.79 million) after hitting a record 520 pounds during the session. They helped push the benchmark Case 30 index to a fresh life-high of 9,567.31 points. The index ended 1.5 percent higher at 9,527.17 points. "We are seeing foreign buying on the large-cap stocks after the rate cut in the US," Mohamed Kotb, investment manager at Jazira Asset Management, said. OCI was also boosted by news it would make $372 million from the sale of its 50 percent stake in Egyptian Container Handling Co. to Dubai port operator DP World, Kotb said. Shares of Telecom Egypt, Egypt's sole land-line phone provider, jumped 5 percent to 20.80 pounds. They have rallied 22 percent over the past month. Shares were gaining on rumours the firm may bid for stakes in one of Lebanon's mobile firms expected to be sold in February, said Teymour el-Derini, trader at Beltone Financial. Telecom Egypt is interested in regional expansion and would look at opportunities that come up, said Tarek Tantawi, manager for investor relations at Telecom Egypt. He would not comment on Lebanon specifically. Shares of Ezz Steel gained 4.4 percent to 57 pounds as investors anticipated the firm would profit from high steel prices, Derini said. "The global trend of steel prices and commodity prices is up," he said. The Hermes index rose 1.6 percent to 84,248.95 points and the broader CIBC index lost 0.54 percent to 404.40 points.
