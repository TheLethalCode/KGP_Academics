 ISTANBUL, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN television on Saturday Pakistan's declaration of emergency rule was "highly regretable" and she hoped its intention was to have free and fair elections. Pakistan's internal security has deteriorated sharply in the past few months with a wave of suicide attacks by al Qaeda-inspired militants, including one last month that killed 139 people.
