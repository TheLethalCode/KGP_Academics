<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)--Canadian lawyer, William Sloan, arrived in Dhaka Saturday to monitor the trial proceedings of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, and other political detainees, under the interim administration, an Awami League spokesman said. Corrected Sloan, a human rights lawyer and former president of the Canadian chapter of the American Jurist Association, arrived in Dhaka early Saturday and checked into the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. Sloan's visit comes on the heels of fellow Canadian lawyer Payam Akhavan's visit last month that drew international attention to Hasina's detention and trial and pushed the plight of his client further into the local media spotlight. Hasan Mahmud, special assistant to the Awami League president, told bdnews24.com that Sloan would stay in Bangladesh for one week during which he would talk to lawyers who are defending Hasina. He will also monitor the human rights status of Hasina's detention and trials during his stay, Hasan said. Human rights lawyer Sloan previously visited Dhaka to attend a convention organised by the Awami League some years ago. bdnews24.
