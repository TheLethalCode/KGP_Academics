 Brussels, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers struggled for unity over Kosovo's independence on Monday but Spain, grappling with its own separatist movements, dissented and vowed not to recognise the new state. EU president Slovenia said it expected many of the 27 member states to recognise Sunday's declaration of independence, but each country was free to do as it pleased. "The government of Spain will not recognise the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo," Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos told reporters on arrival for a meeting of EU foreign ministers. "We will not recognise because we consider ... this does not respect international law," he said, adding that to be legal, secession from Serbia required either an agreement between the parties or a U.N. Security Council resolution. The EU ministers were expected to adopt a statement taking note of Kosovo's declaration, pledging to work for stability and reaffirming the "European perspective" of the entire Western Balkans -- a code phrase for eventual EU membership. Spain proposed a draft stating that each member would decide on its relations with Kosovo and reaffirmed the EU's commitment to the principle of territorial integrity of states. Diplomats said it could be a basis for a compromise which all EU countries except perhaps Cyprus could back. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin would not take a final decision on Monday, but Kosovo's ethnic Albanian Prime Minister Hashim Thaci, a U.S.-backed former guerrilla leader, said in Pristina he expected first recognitions "any minute". "The aim is to have a platform of unity within the EU, on which each member state can act," Merkel told reporters. An EU diplomat said German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier would indicate Berlin's intention to recognise Kosovo after Monday's meeting. LEADERSHIP British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said the EU must show leadership in the Western Balkans. At the weekend diplomats said the main European powers involved in Balkan diplomacy -- Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- could announce recognition directly after the EU meeting, with the United States making the same move on Monday. Aside from Spain, at least five -- Cyprus, Greece, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania -- have indicated they will not do so now because of legal misgivings or concern about restive minorities in their own countries. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged restraint after Serbian nationalists stoned Western embassies in Belgrade in anger at the declaration of independence by Kosovo's Albanians. "The EU has already decided to send a mission, a mission of stability, a mission of rule of law. It should contribute to the stability of the Balkans," Solana told reporters. The EU agreed on Saturday to send 2,000 police, justice and civil administrators to help build Kosovo's institutions. NATO said in a statement its 17,000-strong KFOR stabilisation force would "respond resolutely to any attempts to disrupt the safety and security of the population of Kosovo". EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Kosovo was a unique case and would not set a precedent. He praised Kosovan leaders for promising to respect minority rights in line with a plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. Russia, Serbia's closest ally, prevented the U.N. Security Council from adopting his blueprint for supervised independence last year. That led Kosovo to declare statehood in coordination with Western powers.
