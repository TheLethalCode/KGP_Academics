"The RAB will put in place a foolproof security arrangement in the Central Shaheed Minar area to help observe International Mother Language Day with honour," he said. Noorani told bdnews24.com that some 600 RAB members would be deployed to the Shaheed Minar along with other security forces. Two hundred RAB officers will mount watch in plainclothes, he said. Checkpoints will be located on Fuller Road, TSC, Doyel Crossing, Palashi, Chankharpul and BDR Gate. The security officers will be backed up by a squad of 22 dogs active enough to detect any weapon or bomb. Observation towers have already been set up in the Shaheed Minar area to ensure security for people, Rezaul Karim who is in charge of RAB-3's media wing told bdnews24.com. Noorani urged people to maintain discipline and said: "All have to go by the rules to avoid disorder in the first hours of the Ekushey February."
