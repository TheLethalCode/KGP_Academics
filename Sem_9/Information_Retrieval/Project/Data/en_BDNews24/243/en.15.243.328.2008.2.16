<TITLE> Blackouts in China city as snowy weather revisits </TITLE>

 Beijing, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than two million people have been hit by power cuts in China's Qujing city and thousands have been stranded on highways as snowy weather revisits the southwest region, state media said on Saturday. China has yet to recover from the worst power shortages in recent years that have hit central and southern parts since late January, as the coldest winter in decades damaged power cables and crippled coal deliveries to power stations. Power plants at Qujing, the second-largest city in Yunnan province, have barely enough coal reserves for three days and snow has blocked roads, Xinhua News Agency said, citing local government officials. By Saturday, 80 percent of the city's population suffered blackouts, and residents had to use candles, kerosene or charcoal for light and heat, Xinhua said. Six highways had been closed for two days, stranding more than 30,000 passengers, as road travel began to pick up earlier this week with the end of the Lunar New Year break. China said on Thursday it aimed to complete repairs to power lines and restore normal power supply by the end of March, after millions of families spent the Lunar New Year in the dark while facing soaring prices for food and other necessities.
