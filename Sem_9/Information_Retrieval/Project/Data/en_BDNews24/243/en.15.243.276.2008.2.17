 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday ordered three Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh activists to be put to death for carrying out a 2005 bomb attack on an office of cultural organisation Udichi in Netrakona. Judge AHM Mustaque Ahmed's Speedy Trial Tribunal Court-2 handed down the death sentences to JMB Sura members Salauddin, also known as Salehin, Asaduzzaman Chowdhury Ponir and Yunus Ali. Salehin rejected the verdict and said: "I'll appeal to the court of Allah." The court acquitted Fahima, wife of JMB kingpin Bangla Bhai, who was also accused in the bombing case and executed in 2007 in a murder case. Salauddin, Asaduzzaman and Fahima were taken to the courthouse from jail before the verdict. Yunus Ali is fugitive. According to case details, the accused met on Dec 6, 2005 in Mymensingh town to plan the suicide bomb attack on the Udichi office in Netrakona. They carried out their plan two days later on Dec 8, with an explosion that killed eight people and injured at least 40. The suicide bomber was named as Arif, alias Kafi. Two separate cases were later filed with Netrokona Sadar Police Station, one under the Explosives Act and the second was a murder case. Sunday's verdict was given on the first case filed under the Explosives Act. Public prosecutor Abdul Latif Talukdar said that the trial proceedings of the murder case were underway at Dhaka's Speedy Trial Tribunal Court-1. bdnew24.com
