 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com Business Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The country has imported rice and wheat worth about Tk 60 crore a day in the first 14 days of February, according to a central bank estimate. The record import widens the trade deficit. Economists and traders said the imbalance would continue to increase until boro harvest. A huge amount of foodrice and wheatis imported through government and private channels. Pressure mounted on businessmen to scope out other countries after India put restrictions on exports of non-basmati rice in a change of policy. According to Bangladesh Bank, in the first two weeks of February, 2.08 lakh tonnes of rice have been imported while 87,000 tonnes of wheat came in the same period. Only 25,000 tonnes of rice and 10,000 tonnes of wheat came to the country in the same period of 2007. The cost of the imported rice in the first 14 days this month was $82.28 million while the cost of the imported wheat was $35.37 million. Meanwhile, the trade imbalance in the first five months of the current fiscal year has stood at $209.90 crore. BB's statistics showed that the trade deficit in the July-November period in the past was not as wide as it was in the same period of this fiscal year. In the same period of fiscal 2006-07, the trade deficit was $116.10 crore. MA Taslim, an economics teacher of Dhaka University, said: "Imports have outstripped exports, widening the trade deficit. The import of a huge quantity of food items is the main reason for such a huge trade imbalance." "We had always a trade deficit. But two spells of flooding and a devastating cyclone have damaged crops extensively. It has prompted a huge volume of food imports. The trade deficit could decrease after the boro harvest." "I hope we will get a bumper boro output, and it will help narrow the trade deficit. If the boro production is not satisfactory the food import will increase. In that case we will be in trouble." Mohammad Golam Mowla, a rice importer and general secretary of Moulvibazar Traders Association, said that the country was facing a food crisis because of recent natural disasters. For that, he said, the import has increased. The stocks of rice have dwindled from government warehouses. The government is importing more food to meet demand. bdnews
