<TITLE> AIDS, malaria on WHO chief`s agenda in Angola </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Johannesburg, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The director-general of the World Health Organization on Monday met with officials in Angola in a bid to improve cooperation in the fight against AIDS, malaria and other common diseases in the African nation. Oil-rich Angola has struggled to rebuild hospitals, clinics and other parts of its health infrastructure since emerging from a 27-year civil war in 2002. It has one of the world's worst infant mortality rates. WHO director-general Margaret Chan will be briefed on the financial and technical challenges facing Angola's health sector on her visit this week, the state-run ANGOP news agency said on Monday, citing a health ministry statement. Chan is expected to visit health clinics that provide primary care to women and children and meet with United Nations employees and representatives of non-governmental organisations in Luanda, the Angolan capital. "My visit is primarily intended to understand the problems that exist and what is the most effective way for the WHO to help this country," Chan told reporters after arriving on Sunday at Luanda's international airport. Angola's government is presiding over an oil-fuelled boom and has earmarked more funds for health, but hospitals and clinics battle to provide basic services, especially in rural areas that suffer from a shortage of doctors and nurses. One quarter of Angolan toddlers and infants die before the age of 5, often from measles, malaria or malnutrition, and cholera and polio also are re-emerging as major health threats in the country. Former colonial power Portugal established a rudimentary healthcare system while ruling Angola, offering vaccinations and medical check-ups, but it crumbled after independence in 1975. A subsequent civil war between the Movement for the Popular Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government and Western-backed rebels left millions even more vulnerable to disease.
