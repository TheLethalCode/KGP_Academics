<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former captain Saurav Ganguly still wants to play one-day cricket for India despite being dropped for the triangular series in Australia. Ganguly, 35, one of three Indians to score over 10,000 runs in one-day cricket, was passed over for the Australian tri-series despite his solid performances at test level. "They (the selectors) just asked me whether I wanted to continue one-day cricket," Ganguly told private television news channel Times Now on Saturday. "I said, 'yes definitely, at least for the next 7-8 months.'" Looking ahead at his one-day possibilities, the left-handed batsman said: "There is the Australia series, then India go to Sri Lanka for tests and one-dayers. "So there are five one-dayers there and then the Champions Trophy in September and rest of the year is full of test cricket." Ganguly was left out by tri-series selectors after the team's first-round exit at the one-day World Cup and a surprise victory by a young squad in the Twenty20 version last year
