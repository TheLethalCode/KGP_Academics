<TITLE> China's patriotic ruins to return as showbiz park </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese company, mixing patriotism with showbiz, launched plans on Monday to build a full copy of the vast imperial gardens whose destruction 148 years ago remains a potent symbol of China's long domination by the West. The Old Summer Palace in northern Beijing was overrun in 1860 by British and French troops who burned and pillaged many of the hundreds of traditional Chinese and Western-inspired pavilions, fountains and gardens reserved for the emperor and his guests. Their attack was retaliation after Western prisoners in the Emperor Xianfeng's care were tortured and killed. The gardens were partly rebuilt only to be sacked again by Western forces in 1900. The ruins of the "Garden of Perfect Brightness" -- the literal rendering of its Chinese name -- have become a sombre memorial of China's humiliation at the hands of Western aggression, used to teach school students patriotic lessons in the need for a strong country under Communist Party control. But the privately owned Hengdian Group has unveiled plans to build a full-scale copy of the gardens that backers say would be a symbol of China's restored wealth and cultural pride. "The burning and destruction of the Garden of Perfect Brightness was a humiliation for our country and nation", Xu Wenrong, founder of the Hengdian Group and "chief commander" of the project, told a news conference in Beijing. "Building a new Garden of Perfect Brightness is a good deed to wipe away this disgrace from our country and people," said Xu, a gravel-voiced 73-year-old former farmer, adding that the project would ignite both "patriotic fervour" and hopes for world peace. The garden will be built over five years on 400 hectares near Hengdian Town, the company's rural headquarters, in the prospering eastern province of Zhejiang. Hengdian is famed for providing sets for Chinese films and television dramas, and the new gardens would be a lucrative backdrop for imperial soap operas popular with Chinese audiences. "The goal is to build a Chinese Hollywood," said Zhang Zhongcan, the Communist Party chief of the Dongyang city area that includes Hengdian Town. But Xu said the project was a patriotic charity that aims to collect 20 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) for the building and paying to recover or reproduce hundreds of statues and relics looted from the Beijing original. People who donate 500 million yuan or more will be honoured with full-body golden statues of themselves on the site, the Hengdian Group said. It expects 10 million tourists a year to visit the gardens within six years of their opening in 2013. The mix of patriotism, entertainment and commercial chutzpah driving Xu's plan has, however, irked critics. "The remnants of the Old Summer Palace are witnesses to that period of history, and no matter where you rebuild it, there's not much value in it," Ruan Yisan, a historian at Tongji University in Shanghai, told local media when talk of Hengdian's plans began to spread. This is not the first plan to resurrect the ruined gardens, first built from 1707, which featured ornate European-style buildings and fountains designed with the help of Jesuit missionaries. Several years ago, a Beijing fast food entrepreneur promoted plans to restore parts of the ruins in the capital, only to be shouted down by critics who said the shattered pillars and floors should lie undisturbed as a reminder of the grim past. Xu Jialu, a vice chairman of China's national parliament, said Hengdian would never be able to "clone" the old gardens, based on designs and craft skills that have disappeared. But they would restore some of its "glory and splendour", and remind the world of China's resurgent cultural pride, Xu sa
