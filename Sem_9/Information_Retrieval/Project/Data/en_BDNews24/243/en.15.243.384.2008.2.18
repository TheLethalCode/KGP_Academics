<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is "closely" observing the situation in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia Sunday, an official statement said. "We are following the issue very closely with like-minded countries, and also the relevant on-going Security Council deliberations at the UN," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in the statement. "The interests of the people of Kosovo have always been close to Bangladeshi hearts, and we are proud to have contributed to the stability of that region through our peace-keepers." "Decisions on matters such as this are always taken on the basis of perceived national self interest, the moral questions involved, and the realities on the ground, as will be the case in this respect," it said. Kosovo, a tiny Muslim majority state in the former Yugoslavia, declared the independence with supports from the United States and the European Union. Serbia and its close ally Russia rejected the independence, saying such a move by Kosovo was a violation of a UN resolution (No. 1244). Russia also threatened to use its veto power in the voting for Kosovo's membership to the UN. The UN is scheduled to hold a special session on Kosovo's independence Monday. bdn
