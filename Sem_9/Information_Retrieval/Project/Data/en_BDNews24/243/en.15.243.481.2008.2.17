<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  A polished hundred from Hashim Amla guided South Africa to 329 for eight at stumps on the first day of the lone warm-up three-dayer against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Mark Boucher denied Farhad Reza's hat-trick to remain unbeaten on 64 along with Dale Steyn, who was on 19 not out at the close of the day. Medium pacer Farhad raised the hope of folding the opponents on the first day, sending back both AB de Villiers (39) and Johan Botha (0) in the fifth and sixth deliveries in the 75th over. But, experienced Boucher denied Farhad the hat trick in the first delivery of the 77th over changing his strike end with Morne Morkel, who was turned out to be Farhad's third victim in the third ball of the same over. Bangladesh pacer Syed Rasel made the inroads to South Africa's batting line-up, removing openers Graeme Smith (2) and Jean-Paul Duminy (17) before Amla and Jacques Kallis produced solid resistance to recover their initial setback. They together took their side to 159 for three from a precarious two for 35, but both were removed by left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Junior soon after lunch. Amla drove Enamul for a four to reach his hundred off 112 balls before he was caught by Junaed Siddique at first slip off the same bowler for a stroke-filled 103 consisting of 18 boundaries. There could have been more joy for the hosts had their fielders not allowed Kallis to survive twice on naught and 17. Kallis was finally caught by Farhad Reza off Enamul at mid-on for 36. Ashwell Prince assaulted medium pacer Aftab Ahmed sending him twice over the wildish mid wicket before giving a return catch to the same bowler in the same over for 32. South Africa put up 129 runs in the first session losing both openers. They added 98 runs losing three wickets in the third session after resuming at 231 for five at tea. Farhad returned three for 53 while Enamul and Rasel took two wickets each for 71 and 86. bdne
