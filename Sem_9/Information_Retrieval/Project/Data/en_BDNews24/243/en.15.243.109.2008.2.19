 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)BDR will set up 13 new security camps along the borders with India and Myanmar to check the smuggling of subsidised fertiliser to the two neighbouring countries, a top official said Tuesday. "The prices of fertiliser in India and Myanmar are double or triple the prices in Bangladesh," home secretary Abdul Karim told reporters after a meeting, chaired by home affairs adviser MA Matin. Fertiliser is being smuggled to those countries in large amounts, with Myanmar receiving the bigger share. Tuesday's meeting decided to provide specific coloured bags for fertilisers in each district. At the same time, the government made it mandatory for all marine transports to be properly registered and licensed, asking the Department of Shipping to enforce the measure, the secretary said. Karim added that BDR, Bangladesh Coastguard and other responsible security agencies have been asked to take strict steps to stop smuggling of fertiliser and other products. The meeting was also attended by BDR director general Shakil Ahmed, along with members of law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. "Phensydil and Hilsha smuggling has also increased. Police and other law enforcement officials have been asked to take steps to counter it," Karim told reporters. In the last three months alone, smuggled goods worth Tk 173 crore have been rescued, a Tk 63 crore rise from the previous three-month period," Karim said. Asked about the home ministry's success in listing the names of major smugglers and their godfathers, the secretary said only one agency has submitted a list to the home ministry so far. "Other related agencies have been asked to submit their lists at the earliest but the lists will not be made public," he said. bdnews24.c
