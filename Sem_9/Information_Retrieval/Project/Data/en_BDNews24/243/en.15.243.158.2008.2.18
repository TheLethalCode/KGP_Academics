<TITLE> Italy's Berlusconi denies election lead shrinking </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Silvio Berlusconi has dismissed opposition claims the gap is closing in opinion polls ahead of April's election, with the media tycoon insisting he will lead the centre-right back to power in an easy victory. "The Italians have understood that the left is unable to, is incapable of governing," Berlusconi said in an interview with Il Giornale, a daily newspaper owned by his brother. Walter Veltroni, a former mayor of Rome who became centre-left leader after Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government collapsed in January, said at the weekend he was rapidly closing a 10-point opinion poll gap on Berlusconi. "In a week we've gained two points -- impressive! We are now less than six (points behind)," he said. "The upturn has begun." The latest published opinion polls show Berlusconi's People of Freedom (PDL) party with 37-40 percent of the vote, compared with 29-35 percent for Veltroni's Democratic Party (PD). Berlusconi's position is bolstered by an election alliance with the Northern League, a party that campaigns for autonomy for Italy's wealthy north, which polls around 5-7 percent of the national vote in opinion polls. But Berlusconi's hopes of a landslide may be frustrated by the refusal of a former ally, the small centrist Union of Christian Democrats (UDC), to join the PDL, a new party merging his Forza Italia with the post-fascist National Alliance. Renato Mannheimer, pollster at Corriere della Sera daily, said the UDC might get 6-7 percent of the vote, which under Italy's complex electoral system could rob Berlusconi of victory in enough regions to severely limit his parliamentary majority. "The lack of an alliance with the UDC ... would mean a significant reduction in Berlusconi's advantage in terms of Senate seats and seriously put into doubt his future government's ability to survive," said Mannheimer. Both Berlusconi and Veltroni promise tax cuts and emphasise they would bring "change" -- despite the fact that 71-year-old Berlusconi has already been prime minister twice and Veltroni, 52, has spent a lifetime in local and national politics. Veltroni has adopted a version of Barak Obama's catchphrase "Yes we can!", hoping to emulate the Illinois senator's rise in popularity. But Berlusconi mocked his rival's decision to take to the campaign trail on a luxury tour bus. "Mine is staying in the garage," said Berlusconi, a billionaire more used to travelling by private plane. "Veltroni should try not to catch cold or get too tired, although he'll have lots of time to rest in oppositio
