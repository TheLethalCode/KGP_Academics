 BRUSSELS, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union officials appealed for calm in the Balkans and unity in Europe as they met on Monday to consider the bloc's reaction to Kosovo's secession from Serbia. EU president Slovenia said it expected many member states to recognise the new state swiftly, although countries were free to do as they pleased. EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana urged restraint after some Serbian nationalist protesters stoned Western embassies in Belgrade in anger at Sunday's declaration of independence by Kosovo's Albanian majority and the prospect of recognition. "I would like to make an appeal to everybody to act responsibly," Solana told reporters on arrival for an EU foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels. "The EU has already decided to send a mission, a mission of stability, a mission of rule of law. It should contribute to the stability of the Balkans," he said. Despite differences over recognition, the EU agreed on Saturday to send some 2,000 police, justice and civil administrators to supervise Kosovo and help build institutions. EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said Kosovo was a unique case and did not set a precedent for other breakaway regions in the world. He praised Kosovan leaders for committing themselves to respect minority rights in line with a status plan drafted by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari. Russia, Serbia's closest ally, prevented the U.N. Security Council from adopting his blueprint for supervised independence last year. That led Kosovo to declare statehood in coordination with Western powers. Diplomats said the main European powers involved in Balkan diplomacy -- Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- could announce recognition directly after the EU meeting, with the United States making the same move on Monday. Most others EU states are expected to make clear they will follow suit. However at least six -- Cyprus, Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania -- have indicated they will not do so now because of legal misgivings or concern about restive minorities in their own countries. NOT IN HASTE? "I understand many of the member states will recognise," Slovenian Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel said on arriving to chair the meeting. Dutch Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen indicated that the Netherlands, a stickler for human rights and international law, would take its time before deciding. "Recognition is not something you do in haste. We'll study the constitution, we'll study the declaration of independence," he told reporters. Danish Foreign Minister Per Stig Moller said he hoped the EU would produce a common platform on relations with Kosovo and Serbia, although recognition will be left to individual member states. Commenting on Belgrade's alliance with Moscow to resist Kosovo's independence, he said: "It is very, very important that Serbia knows it is not going to be part of Russia but part of Europe." The EU ministers were expected to adopt a statement taking note of Kosovo's declaration, pledging to work for stability and reaffirming the "European perspective" of the entire Western Balkans region -- a code phrase for eventual EU membership. A senior diplomat doubted they would make explicit reference to Kosovo starting the long process that leads to EU accession. "That might be a bit too specific for some member states," he said. Cyprus, concerned about the possible repercussions for the Turkish Cypriot north of the Mediterranean island currently only recognised by Ankara, was most reluctant to give its blessing. Kosovo's Prime Minister Hashim Thaci declared Kosovo an independent and sovereign state on Sunday in a move that prompted Belgrade to vow undying but peaceful resistance to the loss of its cherished, overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian provin
