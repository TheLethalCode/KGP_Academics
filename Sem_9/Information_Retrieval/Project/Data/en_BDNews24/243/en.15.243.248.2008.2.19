 HONG KONG, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Investors put January's global market slump behind them on Tuesday and, daring to trust that the US economy would not spring any more ugly surprises, ventured into banking stocks and US-focused exporters. But fear of a US economic slowdown, which has dogged markets for months, could hammer stocks again if symptoms persist and financial bookmakers expect markets in London, Paris and Frankfurt 0.2 to 0.5 percent lower. With US markets on holiday on Monday, there was none of the bad news that has stung global markets repeatedly since October, allowing traders to breathe easy and hope that January's trough would prove to be rock bottom. "It's not that a sick person is cured, it's just that the sick person has recovered somewhat from the initial shock of being diagnosed with an illness," said Harushige Kobayashi, head of the research department at Maruwa Securities. MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan was up 1.9 percent by 0644 GMT, but still 18 percent below its November peak. Japan's Nikkei average closed up 0.9 percent, but remains 21 percent below its October high. Commodity and oil prices stayed high with crude oil bubbling up to $96.30 in Asian trade as worried about Venezuela's row with Exxon Mobil outweighed concern about demand sagging. Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal Exchange touched a four-month peak of $8,065.

The strong metals prices helped lift Australian stocks 1.1 percent, despite the strength of the Australian dollar which hit a three-month high against the U.S. currency as central bank minutes pointed to another interest rate rise next month. Australia's rise was bolstered by rebounding banks. The financial sector, which has borne the brunt of bad news over the last year, also found some favour elsewhere in Asia as investors began to hope European banks' results this week would show improvement in writing down subprime mortgage losses. South Korean banks helped the Korea Composite Stock Price Index to hit a one-month high, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was led up by Bank of China, which said it had set aside enough provisions to cover subprime exposure and would report "marked" profit growth. "People are thinking the write-off for subprime will be less than expected," said Y.K. Chan, strategist at Phillip Securities. "People are buying shares gradually, even though we had a sell-off yesterday. But there could be more bad times just around the corner as investors are awaiting a slew of economic indicators, including US January housing starts due on Wednesday. China's yuan rose for the fourth straight session and set a new high against the dollar as inflation set a fresh 11-year record and raised expectations that Beijing would let the currency rise later this ye
