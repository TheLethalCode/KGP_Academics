 Minsk, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police detained Belarus's most prominent opposition leader, Alexander Milinkevich, on Monday during a protest by entrepreneurs against rules they say restrict small businesses, his press service said. Milinkevich, an academic who challenged President Alexander Lukashenko's re-election in 2006, was detained as police broke up a rally by a few dozen businessmen in October Square, Minsk. "Police detained Milinkevich and two of his comrades who had intended to go the meeting of entrepreneurs," the opposition leader's press service said. "Milinkevich said they wanted some details about a rally by the businessmen which took place on Jan. 10." Milinkevich was one of two opposition figures to run against Lukashenko for the presidency in 2006 and still plays a major role in the opposition despite periodic splits in its ranks. Witnesses said the daughter of jailed opposition activist Alexander Kozulin, another candidate in the 2006 election, was also picked up by police after holding up a poster demanding her father's release. The detentions took place as authorities in Belarus, a country of 10 million that borders Russia and three European Union states, seek to improve ties with the West by releasing several people described in the West as "political prisoners". The opposition says only three such detainees remain, including Kozulin -- jailed for 5-1/2 years for his part in organising mass post-election protests in 2006. The Belarussian president, accused of crushing freedom of speech and assembly, has been barred from entering the EU and United States on grounds of rigging that vote. Entrepreneurs held two rallies in January, each attended by about 2,000 people, to denounce new rules barring them from hiring workers outside their immediate families or obliging them to re-register and pay higher tax rates. Police broke up the second rally. Dozens of protesters were jailed for up to 15 days for public order offences. Lukashenko denounced the protesters, saying they had been manipulated by the small liberal and nationalist opposition. The country's roughly 200,000 entrepreneurs, many of whom run market stalls, had attracted larger crowds than recent opposition rallies but called off a planned strike and protest earlier this month. Some activists went ahead anyway with Monday's rally.
