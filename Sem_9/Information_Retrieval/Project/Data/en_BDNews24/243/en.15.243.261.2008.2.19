<TEXT>
 MILAN, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac will struggle to overcome a dislocated finger in time for Wednesday's Champions League clash at Arsenal, coach Carlo Ancelotti said on Tuesday. Dida, who recently lost his first team place to Australian Kalac, is already out for the first leg of the first knockout round tie with a back injury. Third-choice keeper Valerio Fiori, who has not played for the European champions since the 2003/04 season, is poised to step in should Kalac be unavailable. "I don't think Kalac will make it. For a goalkeeper a finger is very important but we will see after training this evening. If he can't train, Fiori will play," Ancelotti told reporters as Milan prepared to fly to London. "Milan are not in the best condition, but no one is at the moment, neither in Italy nor in Europe. "However, these matches don't come down to fitness, but to prudence and experience. We feel like experts in this sense and are used to these types of games." Kaka, Clarence Seedorf and Alexandre Pato have all just recovered from knocks while Ronaldo has been ruled out for at least nine months with a knee injury
