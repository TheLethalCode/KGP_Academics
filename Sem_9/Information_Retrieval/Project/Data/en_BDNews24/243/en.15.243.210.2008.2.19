 MOGADISHU, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Four Somali policemen and three civilians have been killed in the heaviest fighting for weeks between government troops and suspected Islamist-led insurgents in the capital Mogadishu, witnesses said on Tuesday. Residents said battles broke out on Monday evening around the sprawling Bakara Market, which the authorities say is a hotbed of rebel activity. Locals cowered in their homes as both sides exchanged artillery rounds and bursts of machine-gun fire. "I saw four dead men in police uniforms lying in the street," said one witness, Abdi Hassan. Another resident, Faiza Ahmed, said a government truck mounted with heavy weaponry burned nearby as masked gunmen armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades briefly manned a major junction abandoned by government forces. Witnesses said one stray mortar round killed an elderly man when it hit his home in an area next to the market. Dahir Mohamed Mohamud, deputy director of Mogadishu's Madina Hospital, said 11 people wounded in the fighting had been admitted and two of them had died in the emergency room.

Hundreds of under-equipped African Union peacekeepers from Uganda and Burundi have been unable to quell the bloodshed. Government officials were not immediately available to comment on the latest fighting.

"A huge number of government forces were engaged in search operations inside the market," said market trader Mohamed Osman. "I wanted to open my shop but I couldn't because I was afraid I'd be caught in the middle of gunfire like yesterday." An elder from Mogadishu's dominant Hawiye clan accused administration officials of plotting to wipe out the market. "As Hawiye elders we condemn the government's actions against the civilians doing their businesses there," Mohamed Hassan Haad told Reuters by telephone. "Bakara is not a base for insurgents or for any other anti-government group. The main reason why the government blames the market is it wants to loot it." In separate violence in southern Somalia overnight, militiamen loyal to Mogadishu's ousted Islamic Courts group attacked Doble, a small town just across the border from Kenya. Ahmed Nur Dalab, chairman of the area's traditional elders council, said the heavily armed gunmen destroyed video halls and killed the owner of a movie and music rental sh
