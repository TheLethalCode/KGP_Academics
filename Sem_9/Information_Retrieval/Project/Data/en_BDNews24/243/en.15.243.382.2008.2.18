<TITLE> Suu Kyi party says charter plan `threat to Myanmar` </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Yangon, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The party of Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi criticised on Monday the junta's plan to push through its military-drafted constitution in a May referendum, but stopped short of calling for a "no" vote. In its first formal response to the regime's announcement this month of the referendum and multi-party elections in 2010, the National League for Democracy (NLD) said it "will worsen the political, economic and social crises being faced in the country". "It is not conducive to holding a meaningful political dialogue and national reconciliation, which is desperately needed in the country," the NLD said in a statement. The statement did not say whether the party would take part in the referendum or elections, if the regime allows it. The NLD, which won a 1990 election only to be denied power by the military, boycotted the constitution-drafting process because of the continued house arrest of its leader, Nobel Peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Dissident groups are already campaigning for a "no" vote, saying the as yet unfinished charter is an attempt by the junta to legitimise its grip on power after 46 years of military rule. The NLD said the junta's plan "will disrupt peace and stability in the country and disgrace the country among the international community. The authorities will be responsible for all these consequences". Last week the military, which has ruled the former Burma in various guises since 1962, accused pro-democracy and dissident groups of trying to tear the country apart, and urged the public to back its "roadmap to democracy". Although not yet completed, snippets of the charter revealed in state-controlled media suggest the army commander-in-chief will be the most powerful figure in the country, able to appoint key ministers and assume power "in times of emergency". It also gives the military a quarter of the seats in parliament and a veto over decisions made by legislators. The United States says the referendum will be a sham conducted in a "pervasive climate of fear". The United Nations, which is trying to foster talks between the generals and Suu Kyi, has been more cautious in its criticism. The 10-nation Association of South East Asian Nations, which has been frustrated at the generals' foot-dragging on reform since they joined the group in 1997 but which has refused to get tough, has called the timetable a "clear, definite beginning".
