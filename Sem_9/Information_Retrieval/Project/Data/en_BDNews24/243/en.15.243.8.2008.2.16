 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)- The Election Commission will set up a polling centre inside Dhaka Central Jail for local government elections, after completing the ongoing enrollment of inmates as voters, an election official said Saturday. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, after a visit to the central jail, told reporters that Dhaka city's prison population would be able to cast their votes in the centre. Prisoners of other Dhaka district jails would be able to cast their votes through postal ballots, he added. Sakhawat made the visit to view the progress of the ongoing voter registration in the central jail. The enrollment work with photographing of prisoners began Thursday, after data gathering was completed. "All citizens have the right to vote," the commissioner said. "The right to get national ID cards also needs to be ensured. The issue of enrolling the inmates in the voter list is important from the perspective of human rights," he added. "The prisoners are happy to get this chance for the first time ever." Sakhawat said mobile teams would start visiting hospitals in the city from Sunday to register sick patients as voters. The commissioner said all those citizens who have been unable to register as voters so far under Dhaka City Coporation will be given an extended deadline to enroll by Feb 29. "Handicapped and elderly people left out from the process will also get the chance to register." Former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia now detained in two separate special jails would be registered as voters by the end of this month, Sakhawat said. When questioned, the comissioner would not make any comment over the recent letter sent by BNP chairperson Khaleda to the EC. In the letter, Khaleda reportedly asked the commission to hold talks only with Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the party secretary general as appointed by her. "We will not make any comment to the media yet. We will not say anything until the letter comes to us," he said. Deputy inspector general of prisons Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, who accompanied the commisisoner on his visit, said : "The letter has not reached the Election Commission yet." "If there is any political content in the letter it cannot be sent to the Election Commisison." bdnews24.
