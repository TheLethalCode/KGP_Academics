<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury said Sunday malpractice and corruption among government employees could not be curbed, despite salary increases for them during AL and BNP rules. "The first step in curbing corruption is to inculcate a strong resolve among government employees which should motivate them to affirm: 'I'll not resort to any malpractice'," Hasan Mashhud said at a Shariatpur discussion meeting on the ongoing nationwide anti-graft drive. "Once this is done, cases of corruption will halve in no time," the ACC boss said. The chairman of the anti-graft watchdog conceded that there was much to gain through corrupt practices while there were still hardly any risks involved. "The risks have to be heightened and resistance against corruption must be mounted too." "Now we have to combat this all-pervading vice." "First, we must all condemn corruption at all levelsin our families, schools, colleges, madrasas and mosques," Mashhud said. "Make corrupt practices highly risky through raising social movements and through people's rallies," he advised. "We all must see to it that the malpractices of the corrupt are revealed to everybody and the corrupt remain under constant social pressure all the way." bdnews24.c
