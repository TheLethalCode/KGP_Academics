 SYDNEY, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India beat Sri Lanka by two wickets with just five balls to spare in a thrilling tri-series clash at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday. India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit the winning runs in the last over to reach his half-century and help his team sneak past Sri Lanka's total of 238-6. Yuvraj Singh, who has struggled for runs all summer, found form at the perfect time to score an invaluable 76 and guide his team to their second win from six matches in the series. India now have 12 points and trail Australia, who top the standings with 17 from five games. Sri Lanka are bottom with just six points from their five outings. "Congratulations to Yuvraj, he was one of the batsmen I really wanted to get runs. The way he batted was excellent," Dhoni told reporters. "That's what we needed. We've got some confidence and we're winning matches." Kumar Sangakkara was named man of the match after making 128 for Sri Lanka and sharing a 153-run third wicket partnership with his skipper Mahela Jayawardene, who made 71. They steered Sri Lanka out of trouble to post a competitive total on a scorching day at Adelaide Oval but their bowlers just came up short against an inspired Indian middle-order. "It was a very good game," Jayawardene said. "We had opportunities but Yuvraj came in the middle and batted really well then Dhoni finished it off." "Every game now for us is like a semi-final where we've got to go out there and win each time." The top two teams after their eight group games go into a best-of-three match final which starts on March 2. India made a great start when they dismissed Sri Lanka's openers inside the first three overs. Tillakaratne Dilshan fell to a catch behind when he was on four and then Sanath Jayasuriya was run out at the non-striker's end for a duck. CAREFUL DISPLAY Sangakkara and Jayawardene steadied the innings with a careful display, taking few risks as they set about building a competitive total. Jayawardene brought up his half-century off 74 balls before he was unluckily run out when Sangakkara played a straight drive off Praveen Kumar that brushed the bowler's fingers and crashed into the stumps with the Sri Lankan skipper short of his ground. Sangakkara reached his 50 off 88 deliveries then his hundred off 141 before throwing his wicket away in the last few frantic overs after putting his team in a strong position. India could not have made a worse start to their reply when their master batsmen Sachin Tendulkar was bowled by Lasith Malinga for a duck in the second over and they slumped to 35-3 within the first 12 overs. The out of form Yuvraj proved an unlikely hero, belting eight boundaries and a six to race to his half-century off 46 balls. When he departed, Irfan Pathan joined Dhoni at the crease and contributed 31 before he fell with victory in sight. There were some signs of nerves when India lost two more wickets before reaching their victory target but Dhoni held his composure to score the winning runs and bring up his half-century in the process
