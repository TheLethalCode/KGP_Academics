<TITLE> SC defers Hasina hearing to Feb 25 </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19(bdnews24.com)- The Supreme Court Tuesday deferred hearing to Feb 25 on a petition filed by the government seeking approval to move against a previous rule involving charges of extortion against Sheikh Hasina. The High Court had earlier dismissed the extortion case against the former prime minister but the government is now desperate to move against that rule. The government Monday filed the petition with the Appellate Division, and the division's full bench headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin sat Tuesday morning to hear the petition but it later halted the process. Hasina's lawyers Monday immediately urged the Appellate Division to stay any hearing on the government's petition, which seeks a motion for "leave to appeal". Leave to appeal is sought from the Appellate Division to set in motion a case in which the High Court handed down a verdict. Tuesday's decision came after Hasina's counsels appealed for time since their head counsel was abroad. Barrister Shafique Ahmed stood for Hasina and said they needed time since his senior colleague barrister Rafique-ul-Huq was abroad. Barrister Shafique wanted the court defer the hearing until Feb 24. Attorney general Fida M Kamal did not oppose the move by Hasina's counsels and said he needed another day for personal reasons. The court then fixed Feb25 for next hearing. The government's petition involves the High Court's dismissal of the Tk 3 crore extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against the former prime minister. The Supreme Court on Feb 12 halted the proceedings of an interim appeal by the government against the verdict. Instead of ruling as expected after a morning hearing, the apex court asked the government to file a regular appeal by Feb 19. bdnews
