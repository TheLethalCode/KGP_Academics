 LONDON, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Oil climbed towards $96 a barrel on Monday, as investors weighed the effects of a slowing US economy against an escalating row between OPEC member Venezuela and oil major Exxon Mobil. The quarrel between Venezuela and Exxon has helped oil prices bounce back from this year's low of $86.11, but analysts said worries about the US economy could cap oil's gains. US crude rose 41 cents to $95.91 a barrel by 1013 GMT. Oil closed 4 cents higher at $95.50 on Friday, after touching a one-month high of $96.67. London Brent crude rose 37 cents to $95. "Oil prices are remaining at firm levels, buttressed by perceived supply side risks," David Moore, a resource analyst at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a research note. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Sunday the state could sue Exxon for unpaid oil taxes, and repeated threats to cut oil sales to top consumer the United States if Washington attacked the South American country. Exxon said it was still prepared to talk to Caracas about an amicable settlement regarding the forced acquisition of its oilfields after winning a battle to freeze $12 billion of assets. "We have indicated to the Venezuelan government that we're still prepared to talk but should that not be the case we'll protect our rights," Robert Olsen, Chairman of Exxon told Reuters on Monday. Venezuela, one of the largest crude exporters to the U.S., already cut shipments to Exxon last week after the firm won court orders to freeze $12 billion of Venezuela's assets. The head of the International Energy Agency said last week the impact of Venezuela's cut off in crude oil exports would likely be limited and probably not require the release of global emergency crude stockpiles. Oil producers in the Middle East have also assured the US they could compensate for a supply disruption if Venezuela slows exports. US economic data on Friday showed the mood of US consumers deteriorating in February to a point that could signal a recession. US data also suggested bubbling price pressures, raising the possibility of stagflation -- simultaneously slowing growth and rising inflation. Implying further price strength, crude speculators on the New York Mercantile Exchange increased net long positions last week, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission released on Friday. Net crude long positions increased to 39,922 in the week ending Feb. 12, up from to 27,448 in the previous we
