<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  With the hope of confirming the quarterfinal berths, the Bangladesh Under-19 team take on Ireland Wednesday in their second match of the ICC U/19 World Cup at Bayuemas Oval, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Tiger cubs Monday made a flying start with a massive 178-run win over Bermuda in their Group D opener, and they will look to another convincing triumph against Ireland, who went 10 wickets down to England on the opening day. England Tuesday stormed into the quarterfinals from Group D handing a massive 10-wicket defeat to Bermuda, and Bangladesh seem on course to the last eights from the same group. The team management will certainly expect another superb show from the bowers, who bundled Bermuda out for just 82 runs half way of the innings, against Ireland. Ireland's fragile batting line-up collapsed to 109 all out in 31.2 overs against England, who blunted the Irish bowlers to reach the target in 15.5 overs without any loss. A large number of Bangladeshi expatriates in Malaysia are encouraging the Junior Tigers, who, however, have to provide the food for the bowlers putting on a healthy total on the board as they did against Bermuda. Riding on three fifties from Nasir Hossain, Ashiqul Islam and Ashraful Hossain, Bangladesh posted a challenging total of 260 for eight in 50 overs against Bermuda. Bangladesh will play their last group match against England Friday.
