<TEXT>
 London, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Up to 35 women may have been drugged and raped by a London taxi driver, police said on Monday. Thirty women have come forward after a man was arrested last Friday in southeast London on suspicion of rape. Police were initially investigating five attacks in which victims were picked up in a black cab near Oxford Street, King's Road or London Bridge. The suspect is accused of attacking his passengers after offering them spiked glasses of champagne which he said were to help him celebrate a lottery win. The most recent reported attack took place on Feb. 5 after a 33-year-old woman was picked up near London Bridge Station. "Every case is being linked," a Scotland Yard spokesman said.
