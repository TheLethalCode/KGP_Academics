 MOSCOW, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, the front-runner to become Russia's next president, said on Monday he and not outgoing president Vladimir Putin would be running the country if he is elected to the Kremlin's top job next month. The powerful and popular Putin has said he is prepared to serve as prime minister after he leaves office, a situation that some analysts say will mean that Putin will remain the real power in the land. In an interview less than two weeks before the presidential election he is likely to win, Medvedev said he was in no doubt who would be in charge. "Our country was and remains a presidential republic. It cannot be any other way," he said in the interview in Russia's Itogi news magazine, which was published on Monday. "There cannot be two, or three or five centres (of power). The president is in charge of Russia, and under the constitution there can only be one president."

Opinion polls rank Medvedev as strong favourite to win the March 2 presidential election, helped by Putin's endorsement and the strongest economy in a generation for which many voters credit Putin and his team. If Putin does become prime minister, Russia would face the unusual arrangement of having its most powerful leader since the end of the Cold War in a junior role answering to a president who for years has been his protege. Putin has said he does not intend to change the prime minister's role to give himself more power. But he said last week he viewed the premiership as Russia's top executive post, an interpretation at odds with the way the job has been perceived under Putin's presidency. In a telling moment, he also said he did not plan to hang Medvedev's portrait on his office wall, breaking with the standard etiquette for Russian officials to display portraits of the serving head of sta
