 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique returned to the national cricket team's fold for Bangladesh's Test series against South Africa in Feb-March. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Tuesday announced a 14-member squad for the two Tests series at a press conference at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Rafique was dropped from the Bangladesh squad during the recent three-ODI and two Tests series against the Black Caps in New Zealand in Dec-Jan. The three-member selection committee, led by Rafiqul Alam, picked 14 cricketers from the preliminary 17-member squad keeping all-rounder Farhad Reza, spinner Enamul Haq Junior and pacer Syed Rasel out. Farhad Reza and Enamul were in Test squad during the Tigers' two Tests series against hosts New Zealand while Rasel returned home from New Zealand sustaining an injury. Injured Tamim Iqbal has also been kept in the squad as the left-handed opener has been recovering his left-thumb injury quickly and expected to play the first Test, beginning on Feb 22 at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The second and final Test is scheduled for Feb 29-March 4 at Birshreshthha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittagong. The selector also kept two specialised spinners and three pacers on the side. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Habibul Bashar, Aftab Ahmed, Zunaed Siddique, Tamim Iqbal, Shahriar Nafees, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice-captain), Shahadat Hossain, Mushfiqur Rahim, Sajedul Islam, Shakib Al Hasan, Rajin Salah, Abdur Razzak and Mohammed Rafique. bd
