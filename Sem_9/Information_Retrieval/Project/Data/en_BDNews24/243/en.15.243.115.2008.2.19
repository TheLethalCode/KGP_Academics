 HONOLULU, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham believes this week's inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship in Hawaii can provide the catalyst for a successful second season with the Los Angeles Galaxy. England midfielder Beckham's first campaign in Major League Soccer was severely restricted by knee and ankle injuries, but he is confident of a better showing under new coach Ruud Gullit in 2008. The 32-year-old will play his first match in two months against Japanese J-League side Gamba Osaka at Honolulu's Aloha Stadium on Wednesday (1800 local, 0400 Thursday GMT), with a place in the tournament final at stake. MLS champion Houston Dynamo takes on Australian A-League team Sydney FC in the second semi-final later that night (2030 local, 0630GMT Thursday). Asked if he expected major improvement from the Galaxy this year following their failure to reach the MLS playoffs, Beckham said: "There has to be. "It is a fresh start with a new manager, a new regime and a new togetherness. Many things have already changed, definitely for the good, and we want to build momentum and start winning things." MATCH FITNESS The Galaxy has concentrated on building fitness since returning from their off-season two weeks ago, with Beckham having also trained with English Premier League leaders Arsenal for several weeks prior to flying back to the United States "We are not match-fit yet," he said. "The games here are pre-season friendlies but we will still be taking them very seriously. "My approach doesn't change whether it is the World Cup, Premiership, La Liga or a friendly. I want to win." For former Chelsea and Newcastle manager Gullit and his players, the trip to Hawaii is the start of an extensive pre-season tour which will also feature up to three matches in Asia. Gullit voiced concerns about his team playing on artificial turf just weeks ahead of the new MLS season, admitting the Aloha Stadium surface may affect his tactics and selection. "I am not happy we have to play on (artificial) turf," the Dutchman said. "Some players have issues with it and will only be able to play a certain number of minutes. "It is a disappointment but we must deal with it and that is why we brought a big squad with us." Gamba Osaka, the third place finisher in last season's J-League, are using the Pan-Pacific Championship as part of their pre-season regime and have been training in Hawaii for the past week. Captain Satoshi Yamaguchi told how the prospect of playing against Beckham had invigorated the squad. He said: "Everyone looks forward to the opportunity to share the field with a player like Beckham. It is an exciting time for us.
