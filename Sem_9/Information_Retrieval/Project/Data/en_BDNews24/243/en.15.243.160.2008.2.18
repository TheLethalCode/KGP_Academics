 Barisal, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)-Language Movement veteran Abul Hashem died Monday from old-age complications in the southern city of Barisal. He was 87. He died at the home of Shahera Begum, daughter of freedom fighter Abdul Gani Hawlader, who sacrificed his life in the fight against the Pakistani military in 1971. Hashem, a resident of Patuakhali district, took refuge at Shahera's home, passing his days before death in hardship. He had always introduced Shahera to others as his daughter. The body of Hashem was taken to his ancestral land in Patuakhali after a namaz-e-janaza. Hashem was born at Ichadi village in Golachipa upazila. He passed SSC in 1946 and got admitted to BM College in Barisal town. He took part in the Language Movement in 1952 and played a vital role in organising a movement in the south. Hashem was awarded a gold medal in 1979 for his contribution to the 1952 movement. Barisal Municipality and Bangladesh College Teachers Association also gave him citations of honour. bdnews24.com ran an interview on Feb 9 where he described his role and how he struggled through his life. bdnews24.c
