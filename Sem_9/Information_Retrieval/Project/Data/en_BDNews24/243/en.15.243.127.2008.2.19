 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Tuesday rejected bail petitions for former prime minister Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman in two extortion cases. Metropolitan magistrate Md Shaheen Uddin rejected the appeals after Tarique's lawyers prayed for bail. Khan Mohammad Aftabuddin, owner of Reza Construction Firm, filed an extortion case of Tk 1.32 crore with Gulshan Police Station on March 27 last year. Syed Abu Shahed, coordinator of Rose Construction and Al Amin Construction Company, filed another extortion case of Tk 4.89 crore with the same police station on May 4 last year. In the bail hearing, Tarique's lawyers said that their client was included in the extortion cases based only on the confession of his friend and business partner, Giasuddin Al Mamun. The FIRs did not bear the name of Tarique, they maintained. Their client should be cleared of charges, they said. General recording officer Babul Miah, who stood for the state, argued that Mamun in his confessions had said that Tarique had taken most of the money. Lawyers for Tarique were Advocate Sanaullah Miah, SM Joinal Abedin and Mesbah. bdnew
