<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)--Canadian lawyer, William Sloan, arrived in Dhaka Saturday to review the trial proceedings of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina under the interim administration, an Awami League spokesman said. Hasan Mahmud, special assistant to the Awami League president, told bdnews24.com that Sloan would stay in Bangladesh for one week during which he would talk to lawyers who are defending Hasina and review the proceedings against her. Sloan met with Hasina's lawyers over dinner Saturday evening, during which he was briefed on the cases against the former prime minster and their current status. He will also monitor the human rights status of Hasina's detention and trials during his stay, Sloan told reporters after the dinner. The Quebec lawyer's visit comes on the heels of fellow Canadian lawyer Payam Akhavan's visit last month that drew international attention to Hasina's detention and trial and pushed the plight of his client further into the local media spotlight. Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, a member Hasina's defence team, told reporters at his Motijheel office Saturday that Sloan had been appointed as Hasina's international counsel by family members before his arrival in Bangladesh. The Canadian human rights lawyer will seek permission to meet with Hasina and is expected to be present in court during the next hearing of the Bangabandhu Memorial Trust case scheduled for Feb 19, barrister Taposh said. The barrister also said that Sloan was forced to visit Bangladesh on a tourist visa as "visa categories are restricted in this country". Sloan, a human rights lawyer and former president of the Canadian chapter of the American Jurist Association, arrived in Dhaka early Saturday and checked into the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in Dhaka. Sloan previously visited Dhaka to attend a convention organised by the Awami League some years ago. bdnews24.
