"I'm proud they drove it in their wedding because it not only put someone in jail, it saved them and took them out of jail again," Azaria's father Michael told New Idea magazine. Lindy Chamberlain was tried and convicted of the baby's murder in 1982 and jailed for life. Michael Chamberlain received a suspended sentence for being an accessory to the murder amid international headlines. Both were later exonerated.
