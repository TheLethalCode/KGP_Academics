 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said Monday that the economy was under pressure and investment was in decline. "The government is trying to recover by encouraging short-term investment that will generate job opportunities," Azizul said. The adviser emphasised that economic activities would get a momentum if the Better Business Forum could perform well. "Demand is outstripping output, leaving a negative impact on the economy," the adviser told a delegation of the Economic Reporters Forum in his ministry. "The government did not get expected results in the field of investment. The government has taken measures to encourage investment in the private sector as well as in the public sector," Azizul said. The ERF delegation drew his attention to allegations that some "corrupt people" listed by the Anticorruption Commission are the members of the BBF, a platform designed to add dynamism to business activities and encourage entrepreneurship. The adviser said a man cannot be declared corrupt unless he is proved corrupt. "The ACC collects information from different sources and prepares a list. As a result, some names may have appeared on the list," he said. Asked if the fuel prices will increase, the adviser avoided a direct reply and said: "You will get to know if it happens." If the agriculture sector will see any increase in subsidy in the upcoming budget, Azizul said if the government subsidise the farm sector further, it will curtail such benefits to other sectors. He, however, said the government would continue to support agriculture for more production and its expansion. Asked about the annual development programme, Azizul said there was no possibility of any big change in the budget for the next fiscal year. He said the next budget would attach highest priority to the construction sector, power and energy, water resources development, human resources development, poverty alleviation and social safety net. About the future of investment proposals by Asia Energy and Tata, the adviser said the government was not pondering anything before finalising coal policy. Asked whether dearness allowances for government officials would be enhanced in the face of a price spiral, the adviser said the negative impact of price hike had been felt by all. The economy is bearing the brunt of an increase in prices of rice, edible oil, onion and fuel on the global market, he said. "For the same reason, subsidy in the budget has increased. In such a situation the government will consider increasing the dearness allowances. The matter may get attention in the next budget," Azizul said. ERF president Nazmul Ahsan and general secretary Sajjad Alam Khan Topu led the organisation's team to the meeting. bdnews24
