 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)The government Sunday decided in principle to abolish the system of Gram Sarker, a spokesman said. The interim cabinet gave initial approval to Gram Sarker (Annulment) Ordinance 2008, at its regular meeting chaired by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed at his office. The ordinance will be sent to the law ministry for further review. The concept of Gram Sarker (village government) stemmed from isolated local development efforts by local administrators in the so-called Panchayat system. In 1980, the experimental system received political attention from the administration of Ziaur Rahman who appeared to have believed in the system of "mass mobilisation for rural development". "After examining the ordinance further, the council of advisers will give final approval," the chief adviser's press secretary Syed Fahim Munaim told reporters after the meeting. The committee formed with adviser AMM Shawkat Ali as its head to strengthen the local government bodies recommended abolition of Gram Sarker Act, passed by the four-party alliance government in 2003. Munaim said the meeting had also approved a plan to build apartments for government officials on public land through shared ownership with private developers. "Construction firms will be appointed through bidding. The flats will be allocated to the officials at comparatively low prices for 99 years," Munaim said. He said the concept paper for 20-year "Strategic Transport Plan" for greater Dhaka was presented at the meeting. The cabinet gave the green light to the concept paper. The cabinet decided to hold its March 5 meeting in the southern town of Barisal. The day before the meeting, the advisers would visit Sidr-ravaged areas.
