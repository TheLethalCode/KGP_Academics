<TITLE> Cyprus votes in cliffhanger presidential race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Nicossia, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Cypriots voted on Sunday for a new president in a cliffhanger three-way race seen as crucial to any revival of peace talks on the divided island and to Turkey's hopes of joining the EU. No clear winner is likely from Sunday's vote. Polls forecast a tight contest between incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos and challengers Demetris Christofias and Ioannis Kassoulides. Voting was scheduled to end at 1500 GMT, with final results expected at around 1830. If no candidate receives 50 percent of the vote, a runoff will be held on Feb. 24. The winner will be mandated to seek a peace deal to reunite Cyprus's ethnic Greeks and Turks, divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 sparked by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Cyprus is now represented in the EU by its Greek Cypriots, with north Cyprus a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara. Without a solution, Greek-led Cyprus will never agree to Turkey's admission into the EU. The problem could also complicate cooperation between NATO, of which Turkey is a member, and the security arm of the EU, the ESDP. "The future is in our hands. I hope that with the help of the people we can achieve the solution we want and deserve," Papadopoulos, 74, said as he cast his vote on Sunday. He is expected to emerge marginally ahead of the other two candidates in the first round. He has overseen a buoyant economy and Cyprus's admission to the euro zone on Jan. 1. TOUGH ON DIVISION Papadopoulos led Greek Cypriot opposition to a 2004 U.N. reunification plan which was accepted by Turkish Cypriots, and says he will oppose any attempt to revive it. Kassoulides and Christofias say they will attempt to forge closer links with Turkish Cypriots. "Our aspiration is to reunite this country and its people, Greek and Turkish Cypriots ... people deserve better," said Christofias, 62, head of the island's powerful Communist party. Kassoulides, 59, said he wanted to see Cyprus move closer to Europe. "Today we decide to move Cyprus forward as a modern EU state ... and to start the real struggle to end the (Turkish) occupation," he said. Greek Cypriots are deeply divided on whether Papadopoulos moved the island closer to a deal, or towards partition. "I voted for Tassos (Papadopoulos) because he has the strongest personality," said 31-year-old accountant Michalis Aletraris. "He has the right approach on the Cyprus problem, which I think will lead to a fair solution for both sides." Businesswoman Phedra Kyprianides, 42, felt differently. "I didn't vote for Papadopoulos because I want to live in a state where it is no longer 'them and us'... and where we all feel safe," she said. Turkish Cypriots say a Papadopoulos victory could impact the pace of new peace talks. "If Papadopoulos wins it will be a blow for relations, but if either Kassoulides or Christofias win a new hope will emerge," said Basaran Duzgun, editor of the Turkish Cypriot Kibris newspaper.
