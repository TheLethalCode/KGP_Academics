<TITLE> Mandy Moore aims to inspire life balance online </TITLE>

 NEW YORK, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mandy Moore has recorded five albums, starred in films and television since she was 15 and launched her own fashion label, but recently she faced a fear shared by many other women -- going on vacation on her own. "I was always kind of terrified of going on vacation alone. That thought really scared me, but I wanted to push that bruise and do it anyway," said Moore, 23, as she launched a Web site, www.uPumpItUp.com, designed to help women balance their lives. "I ended up having the most incredible time. It was so peaceful, not having to answer to anyone or take anybody else's opinions into account," she told Reuters. "It is empowering and it's such a simple thing to do." Moore said www.uPumpItUp.com, which she chairs, is aimed at helping women balance their "wellness" by sharing such stories to challenge and inspire each other to better their lives. Moore said she hoped women would realize they are "worthy of taking time" for themselves. "We all struggle with finding time for ourselves between family and friends and work and all those other obligations and we neglect ourselves," she said. "Having that sense of balance in life between personal and all that other stuff is kind of essential to leading a happy life," said Moore. She said one tip she had taken from one of the "wellness" experts on the Web site was to compliment at least one person a day. She also plans to take cooking classes and blog about her experiences online. Despite growing up in the spotlight, Moore, who has starred in movies such as "License to Wed," "American Dreamz" and "A Walk to Remember," credits her family and friends with keeping her grounded, even though "it sounds cheesy." And while her romantic life has found its way weekly celebrity magazines -- she has been linked to tennis player Andy Roddick and actors Zach Braff and Wilmer Valderrama -- Moore has kept a reputation as one of Hollywood's good girls. "I think when it really comes down to it, it's a conscious choice to put yourself out there," said Moore, who heads to Australia later this month to tour with U.S. pop star Kelly Clarkson and also perform with Australian singer Ben Lee. "Being in this industry with so much content out there, so much of your life is not your own," she said. "So when you're not working the last thing I want to do is put myself in any situation for people to know more about it. I'm not interested in living that life."
