 KATHMANDU, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A convoy of fuel tankers is making its way to Nepal's capital under armed police guard in an attempt to break a crippling blockade which has led to shortages of petrol and food, officials said on Tuesday. The strike and blockade, which began last week in Nepal's southern plains, has been called by ethnic Madheshi groups demanding greater autonomy for the region. It has left the highways to the Kathmandu Valley, home to 2 million people, deserted. Thousands of cars and motorcycles have been lining up for several hours outside the few petrol pumps in Kathmandu which remain open, while most public buses and taxis have stopped operating. Hospitals say they are facing a shortage of oxygen, which is produced by factories in the south. Authorities said 36 tankers began the journey to the capital late on Monday, using the cover of a night curfew. "There were some attempts to defy the curfew and stop the tankers but we managed to send them on," said Bhola Shivakoti, district administrator of Birgunj, the biggest town near the Indian border. "When those trucks return after offloading the oil we'll send more supplies in a similar manner." Consumer groups said the turmoil in the south, through which nearly 90 percent of Nepal's imports pass, had led to the hoarding of essential goods such as rice, lentils and cooking gas. "Prices of fresh vegetables and fruits have increased by 25 percent from last week," said Jyoti Baniya of the Forum for the Protection of Consumer Rights. DEMANDED MORE SAY The Madheshi protesters want the Terai, a narrow strip of fertile land where nearly half of Nepal's 26 million people live, turned into an autonomous region, and have also demanded more say in central government. At least one person was killed on Sunday and dozens were wounded when police fired on Madheshi protesters demanding electoral reforms ahead of a national poll on April 10. Ian Martin, head of the United Nations Mission in Nepal, appealed to the government not to use excessive force against protesters and asked strike organisers to remain peaceful and refrain from using children in demonstrators. Similar Madheshi protests last year claimed at least 45 lives. The government has vowed to press ahead with April's election for a national assembly expected to prepare a new constitution and formally declare an end to the nearly 240-year-old monarchy. The vote is the centrepiece of a 2006 peace deal with the Maoists, which allowed the former rebels to join the political mainstream. But Madheshi ethnic groups say the pact failed to address their demands and have threatened to boycott the elections, which have already been delayed twice. Analysts said the dispute had cast a large shadow over the polls. "The strike will adversely affect activities like the travel of election officers, materials and equipment as well as the movement of political leaders," said Yubaraj Ghimire, editor of the news magazine, Samay. "If we are talking about fair and reasonably acceptable elections the chances of its taking place in April are almost gone," he sa
