<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)The central bank has given a deadline of two weeks to commercial banks to lower interest rates on bank loans to "tolerable levels". Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed issued the directive Monday in an emergency meeting with representatives of the Bangladesh Association of Banks, an organisation of private banks, at the central bank office in Motijheel. The central bank boss told reporters after the meeting that a lengthy and detailed discussion took place on lowering the interest rate spread between deposits and loans to rational or tolerable levels. BAB members responded to the directive saying it is difficult to lower the rate of interest on bank loans if the rate of interest on national savings bonds and government treasury bonds is not lowered. However, they said a decision would be taken by the deadline set by the central bank, but only after further discussion among the commercial banks. Salehuddin said the banks had been asked to send their specific proposals on lowering the interest rate spread to Bangladesh Bank by Feb 28. The governor said the central bank would promptly take the final decision on their proposal if it met the requirements. Bank owners also agreed at the meeting to lower charges on different services including L/Cs, bank drafts and credit cards. They will send a specific proposal in this regard to the central bank within 15 days, after which "rational charges" would be fixed, Salehuddin said. BAB chairman and Exim Bank chairman Nazrul Islam Majumder, speaking to reporters after the meeting, said: "We think the rate of interest on bank loans should be cut in the national interest." "But it will not be possible for us if the interest rate on the national savings bonds and government treasury bonds is not lowered." With the rate of interest for savings bonds at 12.5 percent and the rate of interest on government treasury bonds at 15 percent, no-one wants to keep deposits with banks, he said. "A tolerable interest rate is being fixed considering the interests of businessmen, depositors and shareholders alike after a lengthy review." "All concerned will be benefited by it." Asked how by much the rate of interest would be lowered, Salehuddin replied: "A decision in this regard will be taken after receiving proposals from the banks." Further discussion on these issues is set to be held with representatives of the Association of Bankers Bangladesh, an organisation of private bank executives, on Feb 20, said the central bank chief. Bangladesh Bank has long been advising banks to lower interest rates on bank loans and to limit the gap between interest on deposits and loans. But the banks had yet to give any positive response. In such a backdrop, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in a letter to the Bangladesh Bank governor on Jan 29 asked the bank to take effective steps to lower the interest rate spread and the rate on loans. The governor acted up by holding a meeting with the finance adviser and chairmen of private banks in the first week of February. The meeting decided to lower rates of interest on loans to increase investment in the country. The central bank was directed to formulate policy in this regard. Monday's talks between the central bank and bank owners were a follow-up on that meeting. bdnews2
