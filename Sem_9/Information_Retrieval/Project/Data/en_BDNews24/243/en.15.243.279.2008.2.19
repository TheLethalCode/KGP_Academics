<TITLE> China must send `right signals' to Myanmar:UN envoy </TITLE>

 BEIJING, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations envoy to Myanmar called on China on Tuesday to send the `right signals to its military government to ensure its plans for political reform and eventual multi-party elections are inclusive and credible. Earlier this month, Myanmar's ruling generals announced a referendum on a new, as yet unfinished, constitution in May, to be followed by a general election in 2010 -- moves toward reform that follow huge anti-government demonstrations last year. "This is a significant step as it marks the first time that we have an established timeframe for the implementation of a political roadmap with a clear objective," Ibrahim Gambari told reporters in Beijing, where he met Chinese officials. But the moves would only be credible if they were accompanied by the release of political prisoners, lifting of restrictions on opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and if the generals allowed opportunities for the expression of opinions on the constitution, he added. "China -- and others -- should be sending that message," he said. China is a neighbour and one of the few diplomatic allies of military-ruled Myanmar, whose government has been under pressure to reform since it cracked down on the pro-democracy protests that were led by the country's Buddhist clergy last September. "We ask China and others to send the right message, the right signals to the authorities in Myanmar to continue to cooperate concretely" with his office, Gambari said. Asked if he felt he was closer to gaining access to Myanmar, which he has not visited since November, Gambari said: "Yes", adding he expected to visit again "well before April". He was speaking after meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and other ministry officials, talks he described as "genuinely open discussions, constructive discussions". Beijing supported a U.N. Security Council statement deploring Myanmar's violent crushing of the protests, the largest anti-government movement there in 20 years. But China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the Council, has stressed its support did not mean it would agree to harsher measures against Myanmar, where it buys timber and has interests in the former Burma's rich natural gas reserves. On Tuesday, China repeated its position that Myanmar's troubles should be resolved through dialogue, not sanctions. "At this time, pressure and sanctions cannot solve any problems," Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao cited Vice Foreign Minister Wang Yi as telling Gambari. Gambari said China's engagement in the face of sanctions from Western powers did not necessarily undermine moves toward political reform at what he called a critical time for Myanmar. "I think it works both ways," he said. Countries that trade with Myanmar can leverage that "to send the right messages that business and investment will be sustained by ... a stable, democratic Myanmar with full respect for human rights", Gambari sa
