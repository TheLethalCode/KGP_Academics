<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luca Toni scored a second-half hat-trick to give Bayern Munich a 3-0 win away to Hanover 96 on Sunday, restoring their three-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Toni maintained his remarkable form since moving to Germany from Fiorentina for 11 million euros ($16.15 million) last year by settling the game almost single-handedly under heavy rain in Hanover. The Italian World Cup winner took his tally to 13 goals in the Bundesliga and 22 in 26 games in all competitions. Victory gave Bayern 43 points from 20 matches. Werder Bremen are second on 40 after winning 2-0 at home to Nuremberg on Saturday. Hamburg SV moved up to third place on 37 points by winning 3-0 at home to Bochum in Sunday's other match. Ivica Olic put them ahead five minutes before the break and a second-half double from David Jarolim made certain of Hamburg's first league win in 2008. Toni's latest match-winning contribution will have cheered him up after thieves broke into his house in Italy over the weekend. "I just hope the goals keep on coming," Toni told Premiere TV. "But the important thing is not that I score but that Bayern keep on winning and get the title." Bayern were struggling to make headway in the heavy conditions before Toni chested down a headed through ball from Mark van Bommel and produced a perfect strike on the turn for the opening goal in the 58th minute. The Italian World Cup winner doubled the lead when he beat the offside trap again six minutes later, taking a pass from Bastian Schweinsteiger and slipping a shot past Robert Enke. Toni completed the hat-trick when he headed over Enke on the rebound eight minutes from time
