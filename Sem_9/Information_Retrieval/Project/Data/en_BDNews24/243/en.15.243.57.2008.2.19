 Cox's Bazar, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  An overloaded boat carrying more than 100 islanders capsized Tuesday at Moheshkhali, leaving at least three children dead, an official and survivors said. At least 10 other people were missing after the accident occurred at 9:30 am, said Moheshkhali upazila nirbahi officer Rashedul Amin Rescuers immediately recovered three bodies from waters but their identities could not be determined immediately. The boat sank when it was traveling from Gorokghata ferry terminal at Moheshkhali to Hazrat Malek Shah shrine at Kutubdia, Amin said. He said most of the passengers safely swam ashore. The official said overloading was the reason behind the accident, and rescuers were trying to trace the missing. Such capsize in the Bay of Bengal is common because of lax monitoring, rough weather and poor navigation. bdnews24.
