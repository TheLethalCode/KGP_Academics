 Mogadishu, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Somali President Abdullahi Yusuf was unharmed on Sunday after suspected Islamist insurgents hit his official presidential complex in Mogadishu with mortar bombs for a second day, one of his aides said. Witnesses said the shelling wounded at least five people, but a presidential aide told Reuters that Yusuf was safe and the mortars did not land anywhere near his private quarters. "Five mortars were fired at the president's house, one of them landed outside the gate of the palace wounding two women and three men," witness Abdulahi Mohamed told Reuters by phone. "Another fell inside while others blasted at the corners of the palace." Yusuf's interim government and its Ethiopian military allies are battling an insurgency that was triggered when the allied forces ousted in January 2007 Islamist leaders, who had ruled Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia for six months in 2006.
