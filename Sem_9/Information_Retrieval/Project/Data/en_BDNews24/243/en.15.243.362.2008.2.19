<TEXT>
 SYDNEY, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asafa Powell is running out of time to compete at Thursday's grand prix meet in Melbourne after the 100 metres world record holder received stitches to his knee when he tripped on the stairs of his Jamaica home last week. Although the injury is regarded as a minor one, Powell pulled out of last weekend's Sydney meet and says he may have to withdraw from Melbourne, where he is supposed to be the star attraction. "There is still some inflammation inside so we just have to get rid of that," he told reporters in Melbourne on Tuesday. "It's a very long season, so if I'm feeling unbearable pain then I will pull out." Powell, who won the Commonwealth Games gold medal on his last trip to Melbourne in 2006, said the injury was causing him some pain but would not stop him competing at this year's Beijing Olympics although he did want to take any unnecessary risks. "I didn't know what to expect after the workout and when I went back this morning it was really sore and I was quite surprised, although my coach explained to me that he expected that to happen," he said. "It's getting better day by day and this morning it looked a lot better than yesterday but it felt worse. "We will see how it goes in the morning (on Wednesday) but this is not a year to risk it.
