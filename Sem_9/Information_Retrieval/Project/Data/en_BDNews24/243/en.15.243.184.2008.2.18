<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)A High Court bench Monday declared illegal the appointment of Kazi Habibul Awal as acting law secretary, in a verdict that also spotlighted the roles of the chief justice and the Supreme Court registrar in the recommendation procedure. Updated Justices Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Shahidul Islam delivered the verdict on a writ petition filed by retired district judge Md Aftab Uddin. Awal, additional secretary at the law ministry, was appointed acting law secretary on June 28 last year. The court pointed to apparent discrepancy in the procedure of seeking and giving recommendations for the appointment. The court observed that the government sought opinion from the Supreme Court for appointing Awal as secretary, current charge, at the law ministry, but the SC recommended appointing him secretary-in-charge. "How can the Supreme Court registrar (Ikteder Ahmed) recommend appointing Kazi Habibul Awal as secretary-in-charge?" "The matter should be investigated." For this, the HC judges ordered that the copy of the verdict must be sent to chief justice Md Ruhul Amin. Aftab Uddin on July 8 filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the validity of the appointment alleging irregularities in the appointment process. The High Court on July 8 issued a rule nisi on the government and Awal asking them to explain why the appointment process would not be declared illegal. After the final hearing into the petition, the judges on Monday ruled it illegal and ordered that the copies of the verdict be sent immediately to the chief adviser who is in charge of the establishment ministry, the chief justice and the law and justice adviser. The court said Awal was not eligible for promotion in line with the 2002 promotion rules for deputy secretary, joint secretary, additional secretary and secretary. The HC verdict also said: "The opinion given for appointing Kazi Habibul Awal as acting secretary was not of the Supreme Court. It was the opinion of the chief justice." According to article 94 of the constitution, the Supreme Court means the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, the judges explained. "The Supreme Court consists of the judges of both divisions. But the two judges on this High Court bench were not aware of anything about the matter." In reaction to the verdict, the writ petitioner's lawyer Advocate Kamrul Islam Siddiqui told bdnews24.com: "Following the verdict, Kazi Habibul Awal no longer remains the acting law secretary. However, he may stay as additional secretary as before." Ajmalul Haq QC also participated in the hearing for the writ petitioner. Additional attorney general Salahuddin Ahmed represented the government. Barrister Amir-ul Islam participated in the hearing on behalf of Awal. bdnews24.com
