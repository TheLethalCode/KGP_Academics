 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Under-19 cricket team begin their ICC U/19 World Cup campaign Monday taking on Bermuda in their Group D match at Bayuemas Oval in Malaysia. The Junior Tigers left the country with an eye on the coveted trophy and wanted to finish the group phase on top beating all opponents-- Bermuda, Ireland and England. "We first want to beat all three teams in the group phase and then want to go step by step on way to our goal," skipper Suhrawardi Shuvo told reporters before leaving the country. Bangladesh are in a superb form as they had been in practice for last three months. They clinched a four-match warm-up series 2-1 against West Indies this month, and also crushed Sri Lanka and Nepal at home before defeating Pakistan 3-2 in the five-match series despite going 2-0 down in December in Pakistan. The junior team also outplayed South Africa, but went down to India in the tri-nation series final in South Africa. The boys also handed a massive 167-run defeat to hosts Malaysia before going five-wicket down against holders Pakistan in World Cup warm-up matches. Bangladesh will take on Ireland in the second match on Feb 20 before playing the third and final match against England on Feb 22. Bangladesh finished fifth in ICC U/19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006. Squad: Suhrawardi Shuvo (cap), Mahmudul Hasan (vice-cap)Dollar Mahmud, Rubel Hossain, Gulam Kibria, Rony Talukdar, , Nasir Hossain, KM Shakil, Mohammad Nadimuddin Mintu, Mithun Ali (wicketkeeper), Saikat Ali, Amit Majumder, Ashiqul Islam, Shubhashis Roy and Ashraful Hossain.
