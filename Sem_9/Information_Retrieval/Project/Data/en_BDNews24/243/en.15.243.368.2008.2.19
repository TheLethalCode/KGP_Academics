<TITLE> Arsenal seek to quickly rediscover best form </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal urgently need to rekindle the dazzling form that has taken them to the top of the Premier League when they face European champions AC Milan in the Champions League on Wednesday (1945 GMT). On Saturday they gave one of their worst performances during coach Arsene Wenger's 11 years at the club when they lost 4-0 at Manchester United in the FA Cup at Old Trafford. If they play that badly again in the first leg of their first knockout round tie against the Italians at the Emirates Stadium, they will seriously undermine their chances of advancing to the quarter-finals. Wenger said the prospect of facing Milan meant he would not go crazy pondering Saturday's display. "What can I do?" Wenger said on his club's Web site (www.arsenal.com). "I never felt we were really in the game and afterwards that can make you crazy. But I have difficulty being crazy today because I am more worried about the consequences it could have on the team." Although Arsenal have injury or other worries concerning 12 of their first team squad, Wenger still lined up with nine internationals against United. They will also be strengthened by the return to the starting line-up of Emmanuel Adebayor who had scored for nine successive matches before Saturday when he only appeared for the last 20 minutes as a substitute. Arsenal, unbeaten in 17 Champions League home matches, have played some superb football this season centred on the outstanding Cesc Fabregas, and despite Saturday's uncharacteristic loss, they start as favourites to beat Milan. Even though Milan's best performances this season have been reserved for their European ties, if Arsenal hit top form with Aleksandr Hleb, Fabregas and Adebayor all working in unison, Milan's grip on the trophy could be prised open. HOLDERS BOOSTED The holders are boosted by the return to the squad of 18-year-old Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato, who is available after missing three games with an ankle injury. He has scored four times since his arrival in January but will probably have to settle for a place on the bench. Kaka returned in Saturday's 0-0 draw at Parma after missing two matches with tendonitis in his knee and the playmaker looks set to float behind either Alberto Gilardino or Filippo Inzaghi against Arsenal. Goalkeeper Dida has been ruled out after injuring his back while sitting on the bench at Parma but Zeljko Kalac, who had recently taken the Brazilian's first team place, is in the squad despite dislocating a finger in training. If Kalac's recovery suffers a setback, third-choice keeper Valerio Fiori is poised for a rare start having not played for Milan since the 2003/04 season. Ronaldo suffered a serious knee injury in last Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Livorno and has been ruled out for at least nine months. Milan endured a tough first half of the season domestically despite waltzing through their Champions League group. The Rossoneri did not win at home in the league until January and even though they have hauled themselves up the table in recent weeks, performances have still been patchy with an ageing side struggling to exert pressure in the first half of matches. Paolo Maldini, 39, who retires at the end of the season and made his 1,000th career appearance at Parma, said: "Arsenal await us but we are the champions. We will perhaps have some players back and the atmosphere will definitely be fantastic." Possible lineups: Arsenal: 1-Jens Lehmann; 27-Emmanuel Ebouye, 10-William Gallas, 5-Kolo Toure, 22-Gael Clichy; 13-Aleksandr Hleb, 4-Cesc Fabregas, 16-Mathieu Flamini, 19-GIlberto Silva; 25-Emmanuel Adebayor, 9-Eduardo AC Milan: 16-Zeljko Kalac; 44-Massimo Oddo, 13-Alessandro Nesta, 4-Kakha Kaladze, 3-Paolo Maldini; 10-Clarence Seedorf, 8-Gennaro Gattuso, 21-Andrea Pirlo, 23-Massimo Ambrosini; 22-Kaka, 11-Alberto Gilardino Referee: Claus Bo Larsen (Denmark
