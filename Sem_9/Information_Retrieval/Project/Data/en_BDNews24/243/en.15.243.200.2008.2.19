 MUMBAI, India, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - All-rounder Andrew Flintoff made four runs off 14 deliveries for England Lions in his first competitive match since suffering a recurrence of an ankle problem last September. Flintoff did not bowl in the limited-overs practice match against a Mumbai Cricket Association XI but took a catch at second slip as the tourists won by three wickets with a ball to spare at the Brabourne Stadium. The 30-year-old underwent a fourth ankle operation in October. Flintoff joined up with the Lions as part of his rehabilitation programme and will then continue with a Lancashire county team currently in India for a pre-season batting clinic. England Lions are scheduled to play two more one-day practice matches this week
