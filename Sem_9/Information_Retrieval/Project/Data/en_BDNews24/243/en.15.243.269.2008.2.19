 TOKYO, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Citigroup, which has been raising funds since taking a huge hit from the U.S. subprime mortgage meltdown, has sold its Japan headquarters to rival Morgan Stanley in a deal reportedly worth US$445 million.

Neither Citigroup nor Morgan Stanley disclosed the financial terms of the deal, but the Nikkei business daily said the transaction was worth 48 billion yen ($445 million).
