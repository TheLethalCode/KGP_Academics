<TITLE> Stripping Jamal Uddin of title was illegal: HC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Sunday ruled that stripping former Air Force chief Jamal Uddin Ahmed of his air marshal title was illegal. Jamal was promoted to air marshal from air vice marshal by the Awami League government on June 3, 2001 but the BNP-led coalition government stripped him of his title after coming to power in the Oct 2001 election. Jamal retired from his post the same day he was promoted. In an order on Oct 17, 2004, the Ministry of Defence cancelled the title. On Dec 13, 2004, Jamal appealed the decision with the High Court, and the court temporarily halted the government's decision. A bench of justice ABM Khairul Haque and justice Abdul Awal on Sunday in their final rule said that the way the title had been taken away was "illegal". Jamal was happy with the verdict. "I am really happy," he told bdnews24.com after the verdict. "It's a gross irregularity when a government annulled a legal decision taken by a lawful government. I have got justice from the High Court," he said. bdnew
