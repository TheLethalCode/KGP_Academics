<TITLE> Porto can't rely on history on return to 2004 final venue </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Coach Jesualdo Ferreira knows there is little point trusting in history when Porto return to the scene of their second European Cup win to play Schalke 04 in the Champions League on Tuesday. On their last visit to the Arena AufSchalke for the 2004 final, a Porto team then coached by Jose Mourinho and inspired by Deco produced an outstanding performance to beat Monaco 3-0. Champions League memories do not get much better but facing an aggressive Schalke side backed by 50,000 baying fans will be a quite different experience, especially as most of the 2004 squad including Deco have long since moved on. "Everyone knows the Porto history, you don't have to mention the symbolism," Jesualdo told a news conference on Monday ahead of the first knockout round first-leg tie. "But we know Schalke will give us problems. "The stadium and the atmosphere will be very special. We know you can't win a game with history." MORE EXPERIENCE What Porto do have is much more Champions League experience than Schalke, who are through to the knockout phase for the first time. "We know Schalke have a very strong spirit and are powerful in attack," the coach said. "They're a very good German team. "We'll be banking on our international experience. We know what we have to do to get through. We'll have to fight." Porto, who have a 10-point lead at the top of the Portuguese league, will be without injured defender Jose Bosingwa. For Schalke, the game will be their 100th match in European competition and coach Mirko Slomka is eager to secure what would be a 50th win. "Nothing would be more beautiful than making it 50 wins out of 100," said Slomka. "The aim is to win and even better to win without conceding a goal.
