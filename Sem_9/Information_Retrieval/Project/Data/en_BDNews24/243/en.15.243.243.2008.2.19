 JERUSALEM, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel and the Palestinians need to pick up the pace of peace negotiations if they hope to reach a deal this year, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are due to meet in Jerusalem later in the day. The two sides remain divided over the scope of a future agreement. Addressing North American Jewish leaders in Jerusalem, Fayyad said "not enough has happened" since a US-hosted Middle East peace conference in November to suggest a treaty can be reached in the next 11 months. "If indeed this is going to happen, the pace has to be stepped up and stepped up significantly," he said. Olmert has said the goal of peace talks with Abbas was to reach an understanding on "basic principles" for a Palestinian state by the end of 2008, rather than the full-fledged agreement that Palestinians have been seeking.

Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be capital of the state they hope to establish in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Other core issues the two sides have pledged to tackle include borders and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

We'll see what comes up in that," Fayyad told reporters. DRAWING THE LINE A senior Israeli official said the idea was to focus initially on borders, then turn to the thornier issues of Jerusalem and refugees. "You don't want to start with the most difficult stuff and fail. If you start with Jerusalem and refugees and you fail, then what?" the official said. Holding off negotiations on Jerusalem makes political sense for Olmert because it will help the Israeli leader hold together his fragile coalition government for now. The ultra-religious Shas party has threatened to leave the coalition if the negotiations focus on the fate of Jerusalem, which both Jews and Palestinians want as their capital. Abbas's authority has been limited to the occupied West Bank since Hamas Islamists seized the Gaza Strip in June, casting doubt on his ability to make sweeping compromis
