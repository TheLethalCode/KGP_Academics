 MANILA, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was described as `evil' in a Senate inquiry into official corruption on Monday, the most personal attack yet in a spiralling scandal. The inquiry, into allegations of bribery in a telecoms deal, has prompted renewed calls for Arroyo's resignation and sparked the biggest protests since 2005, when tens of thousands of people demonstrated against her amid accusations of election fraud. Rodolfo Lozada, the probe's star witness, told senators that Romulo Neri, Arroyo's former economic planning chief, had wanted to resign due to controversy over the state's $329 million deal with China's ZTE Corp, which was allegedly overpriced by $130 million to fund kickbacks. "He called President GMA evil," Lozada, a former senior government official, said in emotional testimony. "He's been agonising over it." Asked why Neri wanted to resign, Lozada replied: "Because the president has lost all moral authority over him." Neri said he couldn't recall such a comment about Arroyo. "I can't remember that statement," he said at a news conference at the presidential palace. He said like all government employees he had sometimes considered resigning. "We are all victims of the oligarchic structure of the Philippines," he said. Analysts say Arroyo's position remains secure because the powerful Catholic Church has not called for her to go and she has the support of the military and the lower house of Congress. She has already survived three impeachment bids and at least three coup plots and her final term runs out in mid-2010. Middle-class Filipinos, sometimes referred to as the "SUV crowd" for their preference for expensive sports utility vehicles, have, however, started to join small protests. Last week, around 10,000 people demonstrated in Manila's financial district and opposition groups are planning further rallies, particularly on Feb. 25, the anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The government said on Monday that Feb. 25 would be a holiday for workers, potentially reducing turnout at rallies by giving people a long weekend to spend with friends and family. A JOB TO DO More than 50 former top government officials, including an ex-central bank chief, urged Arroyo's cabinet to quit on Sunday. But her officials said they were sticking by her. "As far as we (the economic team) are concerned, we have a mission to accomplish," said Finance Secretary Margarito Teves. On Monday, the peso finished at 40.67 against the dollar, stronger than Friday's close at 40.755, but the main stock index bucked the regional uptrend to finish down 0.62 percent. Under pressure from Lozada's revelations, country's anti-corruption agency, finally opened its own inquiry on Monday into the ZTE deal, which Arroyo was forced to cancel last year. Unlike the Senate, the Ombudsman has the power to file charges against anyone found guilty of graft, but Filipinos are sceptical about its independence because its head, Merceditas Gutierrez, was appointed by Arroyo and is a former classmate of the president's husband, Mike Arroyo. Gutierrez inhibited herself from the probe. "My primary concern is the conduct of this hearing should leave no room for doubt," she said. The president's husband, who has been named in the corruption scandal, failed to appear at the Ombudsman investigation. Neri was also a no-show. The former chief of the National Economic and Development Authority told the Senate last year that he was offered a $4.4 million bribe to approve the ZTE deal. But Neri, who was moved to an education post in July, has refused to testify again at the Senate, saying part of his work was confidenti
