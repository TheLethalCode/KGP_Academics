 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)Five companies are still in the race to win bids to set up three international gateways (IGWs), which will end the government's monopoly over internet telephony. The open bidding that took off at 10am Monday staggered into Tuesday. As many as 31 local private firms took part in the auction, run by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Telecoms players were not allowed to bid for licence. Also, for the first time, the government prohibited foreign investors from applying for the licence. Revenues will be shared among four groups: IGW, ICX (interconnection exchange), ANS (access network service) providers and government. Of the total revenues to be earned, 15 percent has already been allocated for ICX and 20 percent for ANS operators (landline or mobile operators). An overseas call will be routed from IGW through ICX to landline phone and mobile users (ANS users). The auction came after the government approved the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services (ILDTS) Policy 2007 to liberalise VoIP operations. The government has established a three-tier telecommunications infrastructure. The first stage is international gateways connected to submarine cables and interconnection exchanges. The second stage is interconnection exchanges linked to the international gateways and access network service. Direct service to customers is the final stage. The bidding started with Euro Piu Telecom's offer of 25.25 percent in revenue share with the government. Before the start of the bidding Monday, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said the open bidding was arranged for the sake of transparency. "A new era in the telecommunication sector will open with the setting-up of private IGWs," he said. Alam forecast that up to Tk 1,000 crore would be earned in revenue from the sector a year. As many as 42 firms sought to take part in the bidding but the BTRC short-listed 38 for participation. Finally, 31 firms joined the bidding by depositing Tk 3 crore in security money. The selected firms have to deposit Tk 15 crore in licence fees each in 10 workdays from the day of bidding. Every year each firm will have to deposit Tk 7.5 crore for renewal of licence. IGWs must start operating within six months of getting licence, according to terms and conditions. The licence will be given for 15 years. Former FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain, director of Mir Telecom, which participated in the bidding, said: "Although there was open bidding in other areas, this is the first open bidding in the telecoms sector." "I welcome the move," he said. The bidding for ICXs will be held at Radisson Wednesday and the bidding for IIG (international internet gateway) will be held at the BTRC office on Feb 25. bdnews24.
