 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tennis world number one Roger Federer said on Monday he planned to stay in the game for years to come. "My goal is to play for as long as possible, possibly until I am 35," the 26-year-old Swiss told reporters after winning the Laureus Sportsman of the Year award for a record fourth year in a row. Federer, who has won 12 grand slam titles, said his aim was also to surpass Pete Sampras's record of 14. "It's definitely on my mind now," he said. "Actually when I was playing Pete in an exhibition (late last year) we were joking about it. I was hoping to break his record this year but it looks a tough task now after losing the Australian Open. "I think it would be a good result for me if I tie it this year." Federer said he was hugely disappointed following his semi-final defeat to Novak Djokovic in Melbourne last month. "The first moment it hits you hard. You are really disappointed," he said. "Then the next day when you wake up, you feel a bit better if you think that you had given your all. "But I feel refreshed and relaxed now as I haven't been practising at all," he added. "It's been a two-week vacation but I'll start working out again shortly to get ready for the Dubai Open in early March. "So these two weeks have been a good break for me because I'll be busy pretty much until the U.S. Open." FRENCH OPEN Federer said winning the French Open was his other big goal. "Obviously, it's a big goal for me. I hope it's not the one that will elude me," he said. "I've heard people say that this year is probably my last chance, but I totally disagree. I think I have a few more years ahead of me if I can't do it this year." Asked to name his main rivals, the world number one said: "Well, obviously two guys stand out, Djokovic and Nadal. But I rate Rafael Nadal as my biggest rival." The Swiss also gave his backing to world number four Nikolay Davydenko, who is being investigated for his involvement into match-fixing -- a charge the Russian has always denied. "It's pure speculation, it's not a fact," Federer said when asked to comment on the problem. "He (Davydenko) is not guilty. He should be left in peace if he is not found guilty. Honestly, I am not too worried about it (gambling in tennis)." Federer said it was unlikely he would play in the St Petersburg Open for as long as it clashed with another ATP event in his home town of Basel. "If they could schedule the St Petersburg Open at another date I definitely will consider it or maybe I could play Marat Safin in an exhibition here," he said. "We've had some great battles in the past, so I think it would be fun playing him here.
