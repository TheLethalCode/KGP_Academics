<TEXT>
 Brussels, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers will discuss on Monday the bloc's reaction to Kosovo's secession from Serbia, with some EU capitals expected to give it immediate recognition as a state. Diplomats said the major European powers involved in Balkan diplomacy -- Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- could announce recognition directly after the meeting, just before the United States is expected to make the same move. Most of the others are expected to make clear they will follow suit. However at least six -- Cyprus, Greece, Slovakia, Spain, Bulgaria and Romania -- have indicated they will not do so immediately because of misgivings over a move that both Belgrade and its ally Russia oppose. EU ministers will haggle over a statement making clear that recognition of Kosovo is a matter for individual states but which will be closely examined for how strong a signal it gives of the EU's determination to guide the ethnic Albanian territory towards the distant prospect of EU entry. "I hope we are going to have a platform that is united with virtually everyone," Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told reporters at an event in Brussels on Sunday night. "My aim is to have 26. I think that is achievable," he said of an outcome that would be near-consensus in the 27-state bloc. Cyprus, concerned about the possible repercussions of Kosovo independence for the Turkish Cypriot north of the Mediterranean island that is currently only recognised by Ankara, is seen as being most reluctant to give its blessing. "Apart from the handful expected to announce recognition immediately, there could be a large number of countries who will make clear after the meeting their intent to recognise," added one senior diplomat after closed-door talks between officials from EU states on Sunday. However the diplomat doubted the EU statement on Monday would make explicit reference to the prospects of Kosovo joining the long process that leads to EU membership. "That might be a bit too specific for some member states," he said, adding that the statement would instead likely contain a general reference to the "European perspective" of Western Balkans countries. Kosovo's Prime Minister Hashim Thaci declared Kosovo an independent and sovereign state on Sunday in a move that prompted Belgrade to vow undying but peaceful resistance to the loss of its cherished, overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian province. Protesters called "hooligans" by Serb media attacked the U.S. embassy in Belgrade, where riot police drove them back. Three hand-grenades were tossed in the Serb-dominated north of Kosovo, one of them exploding in a U.N. car park. Both the EU and NATO have urged all parties to act calmly and the European Union on Saturday approved longstanding plans to launch a 2,000-strong supervisory mission to support police and judicial authorities in Kosovo
