 ARGHANDAB, Afghanistan, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suspected suicide bomb attack at a picnic spot in the southern Afghan province of Kandahar on Sunday killed at least 60 people, and possibly as many as 80, the provincial governor said. "Sixty of the martyrs were brought to hospitals and 20 more dead bodies were taken from the site. We think 80 people were killed in this suicide attack," Kandahar governor Assadullah Khalid said. Dozens of people were wounded in the attack which happened in a field where a crowd of people including police were watching dog fights in Arghandab, on the western outskirts of Kandahar city, he told reporters. Khalid said the country's deadliest attack this year was the work of Afghanistan's enemies, a term used by the government to refer to Taliban insurgents and their al Qaeda militant allies. The Taliban, behind a surge of suicide attacks against foreign forces and the Afghan government, could not immediately be contacted for comment. The head of an auxiliary police force in Kandahar, Abdul Hakim, was among the dead, Khalid said. STRONGHOLD Thirteen other policemen and six children were also killed, a police official near the site of the blast said. "The match was going on and all of a sudden the explosion went off," said witness Abdul Rahman whose brother was killed. Dog-fighting is a popular pastime in Afghanistan. A Reuters journalist counted at least 30 dead bodies being taken from the scene of the blast. Police sealed off the site. Body parts were scattered at the site and ambulances took wounded to hospitals. Several police vehicles were damaged by the explosion. Kandahar is a stronghold of the Taliban who largely rely on suicide attacks and roadside bombings in their campaign to force foreign troops out of Afghanistan and topple its government. U.S.-led forces overthrew Taliban's government in 2001 after its leadership refused to hand over al Qaeda chief, Osama bin Laden, architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on the united States. Despite the presence of more than 50,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the U.S. military, as well as some 140,000 Afghan troops, the militants have made a come back in the past two years, during which more than 11,000 people have been killed. Most of the violence has been concentrated in areas bordering Pakistan where the militants have taken refuge in lawless border areas, from where they have also attacked deeper into Pakistan. Some Western politicians say more troops are needed to tackle the insurgency or Afghanistan will slide back into anarchy. President Hamid Karzai who has been leading Afghanistan since the Taliban were ousted instead wants the strengthening of the Western-trained Afghan forces and more fun
