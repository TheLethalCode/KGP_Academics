<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  Both South Africa and the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI had good batting practice in the warm-up match ahead of Bangladesh's two Test series against the Proteas, beginning on Feb 22 at Mirpur Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The warm-up three-dayer ended in a draw after rain forced to call off the match just before tea break on the third and final day Tuesday at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. It was almost certain that the match was heading for a draw after the BCB XI ended the second day Monday at 263 for five, chasing South Africa's total of 397 all out in the first innings. The home side declared their first innings at 412 for nine, taking a slim 15-run lead against the visitors as skipper Shakib Al Hasan blazed a half-century. South Africa made 47 for no loss with Graeme Smith (32) and Ashwell Prince (9) remaining unbeaten when rain stopped the match 10 minutes before tea. Match referee Raqibul Hasan declared the match draw after consulting with both captains. Shakib and Roqibul Hasan played an anchor role in the middle to put on 110 runs for the fifth wicket before Shakib was caught behind wicketkeeper Mark Boucher off Johan Botha for 73, leaving the side at 342 for six. The left-handed middle order batsman, who resumed the day on 20, clubbed 14 fours facing 68 balls while Roqibul made a patient 44 off 92 balls before he was also caught behind Boucher off Dale Steyn. Later, Mushfiqur Rahim and Farhad Reza scored 26 and 10 to help BCB XI past the visitors' total. The BCB XI, having resumed on 263 for five, added 149 runs losing four wickets before declaring their first innings at 412 for nine. Johan Botha was the pick of the attack with three for 76 followed by Morne Morkel (2/70) and Makhaya Ntini (2/85). bd
