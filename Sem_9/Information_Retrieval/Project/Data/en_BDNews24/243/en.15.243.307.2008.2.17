 MILAN, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paolo Maldini thanked his mother for standing by him during his career after making his 1,000th professional appearance in AC Milan's draw at Parma on Saturday. The 39-year-old, who retires at the end of the season, reached the milestone as a second-half substitute. "I would like to dedicate this achievement to my family, in particular my mother who has followed me all these years and has always stayed close," he told reporters. Maldini made his debut for Milan aged 16 against Udinese in a Serie A match in January 1985. He also amassed a record 126 caps for Italy, captaining his country on 64 occasions before retiring from the international game in 2002. Ever the professional, he was disappointed his stuttering Milan side could not mark his achievement with a better result than a goalless draw, although they have edged up to fourth. "Tonight I've played my 1,000th match, it is a number that remains impressive, it is only a shame that we haven't won the three points but there are always highs and lows," he said. Not content with five European Cups and seven Italian league titles, the one-club man is desperate to end his playing career with a record ninth European Cup final in Moscow in May. The holders must overcome English league leaders Arsenal in the last 16 and Maldini is looking forward to the first leg tie in London on Wednesday. "Arsenal await us but we are the champions. We will perhaps have some players back and the atmosphere will definitely be fantastic," he said
