<TITLE> Manna fans clash with police </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Fans of late popular film actor Manna engaged in clashes with the police at the FDC Monday as they tried to break police cordon and enter the premises to pay their last respects. Police fired three rounds of tear gas shells to disperse the rowdy mob. People thronged the Film Development Corporation to get a glimpse of their favourite film star for the last time. As police did not allow them to enter, the agitated mob went on the rampage and hurled brickbats and stones at the police, attempting to storm the main gate and vandalised freely. The namaj-e-janaza of the actor was held twice at the FDC at 11:00 am and 11:30 am. The coffin was scheduled to be conveyed to the central Shahid Minar for allowing people to pay their last homage. From Shahid Minar, Manna will be taken to his village home in Tangail for burial. The veteran actor suffered a heart attack Sunday and died at United Hospital in Gulshan. bdnew
