 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jacob Zuma, president of South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC), may take a fifth wife, just weeks after tying the knot with a fourth, the Sunday Times newspaper reported. Zuma, 65, married 33-year-old Nompumelelo Ntuli, the mother of two of his children, in early January. The Sunday Times reported that he had paid lobolo (bride price) for two women, 35-year-old Thobeka Mabhija and Bongi Ngema, the mother of his 3-year-old son, and was expected to marry one of them soon. Zuma has previously married four times and is believed to have 18 children. Traditional Zulu culture allows him to take more than one wife. Zuma's spokesmen were not immediately available to comment. The paper said Zuma's present and future wives were arguing about who would be first lady should he become president of South Africa in 2009, but said his brother, Michael, was unaware of such a dispute. "There could be a dispute among the women which I'm not aware of, but this issue has never been discussed in the family," he told the paper. Zuma is facing charges of corruption, fraud, money laundering and racketeering, and will stand trial in August. He and his legal team are in Mauritius, trying to block the handing over to the National Prosecuting Authority of certain documents in connection with the corruption charges. Zuma was acquitted in a rape trial in 2006, when he justified having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive woman by saying he had taken a shower afterwar
