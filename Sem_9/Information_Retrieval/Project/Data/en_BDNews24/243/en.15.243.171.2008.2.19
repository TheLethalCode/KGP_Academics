Wates said it is physically impossible to swing the chair backwards more than a few centimetres. He said each year 7,000 British school children need to go to hospital after injuring themselves by tipping backwards on chairs. Swivel chairs in most offices have five feet to prevent such tilting, but most schools can't afford these designs. The ergonomic Max chair costs just 15 pounds ($29.22), and before it has even been properly launched Wates' company, DLB Limited, has already received orders for 1,500 chairs from 18 schools.
