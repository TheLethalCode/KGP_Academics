 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Telecoms Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)Bangla Trac Communications, Novotel Limited and Mir Telecom Tuesday won bids to set up three international gateways (IGWs), which will end the government's monopoly over internet telephony. Full Story The open bidding that took off at 10am Monday staggered into Tuesday. Tarique-e-Haque is the managing director of Bangla Trac. Novotel is owned by Tusuka Fashions, with Arshad Jamal as its chairman and CEO and Mushiuzzaman Chowdhury as managing director. Former FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain owns Mir Telecom. As many as 31 local private firms took part in the auction, run by the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission at Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Telecoms players were not allowed to bid for licence. Also, for the first time, the government prohibited foreign investors from applying for the licence. BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam said that state monopoly BTTB would face competition ahead, from private operators. "And I believe the BTTB can face the challenge with the resources it has," he added. Revenues will be shared among four groups: IGW, ICX (interconnection exchange), ANS (access network service) providers and government. Of the total revenues to be earned, 15 percent has already been allocated for ICX and 20 percent for ANS operators (landline or mobile operators). In the 26-hour bidding, Novotel rose to 51.75 percent in the last call, with a lead over Bangla Trac (51.50 percent) and Mir Telecom (51.25 percent) in revenue share with the government. But Bangla Trac and Mir Telecom finally raised their bid to 51.75 percent to be the winners. The three bidders ended up with the remaining 13.25 share of the total revenues for themselves each. The bidding started with Euro Piu Telecom's offer of 25.25 percent in revenue share with the government. The auction came after the government approved the International Long Distance Telecommunication Services (ILDTS) Policy 2007 to liberalise VoIP operations. The government has established a three-tier telecommunications infrastructure. The first stage is international gateways connected to submarine cables and interconnection exchanges. The second stage is interconnection exchanges linked to the international gateways and access network service. Direct service to customers is the final stage. An overseas call will be routed from IGW through ICX to landline phone and mobile users (ANS users). Before the start of the bidding Monday, the BTRC chairman said the open bidding was arranged for the sake of transparency. "A new era in the telecommunication sector will open with the setting-up of private IGWs," he said. Alam forecast that up to Tk 1,000 crore would be earned in revenue from the sector a year. After the completion of the bidding, the BTRC chairman said: "The businessmen were patient in participating in the 26-hour bidding. We have proved that it is possible to hold bidding in a transparent manner." He said the prices for incoming call had been fixed at 6 cents. The call rate may be lowered depending on demand. Mir Telecom director Mir Nasir Hossain said: "Illegal VoIP operations will not exist if we can work together with the BTRC. It will be possible to give the government a huge amount of revenues. Large amounts of money have been siphoned off the state coffers which could have remained in the country. We welcome the initiative of the BTRC." He said that the local entrepreneurs in the power and gas sectors could also be invited to participate in open bidding like this. The former FBCCI president said transparency would increase if the licences in other sectors were also given through open bidding. On the highest bidding, Novotel's deputy managing director Rezaul Kabir said: "We can make profit. So we made the highest call." As many as 42 firms sought to take part in the bidding, but the BTRC short-listed 38 for participation. Finally, 31 firms joined the bidding by depositing Tk 3 crore in security money. The selected firms have to deposit Tk 15 crore in licence fees each in 10 workdays from the day of bidding. Every year each firm will have to deposit Tk 7.5 crore for renewal of licence. IGWs must start operating within six months of getting licence, according to terms and conditions. The licence will be given for 15 years. There were a total of 111 bids. Confidence Steel Limited gave the highest 19 bids. BTRC handed over "award letters" to the three winners Tuesday. The bidding for ICXs will be held at Radisson Wednesday and the bidding for IIG (international internet gateway) will be held at the BTRC office on Feb 25. bdnews24.com
