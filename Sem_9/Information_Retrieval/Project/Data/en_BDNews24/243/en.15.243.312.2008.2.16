<TITLE> Ex-Nazi guard arrives in Italy after extradition </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rome, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former Nazi guard extradited from Canada arrived in Italy on Saturday to serve a life sentence for war crimes committed there during World War Two. Michael Seifert, who had lived in Canada since 1951, landed at Rome's Ciampino airport before dawn on Saturday. Italian TV footage showed the 83-year old, wearing a baseball cap, walking slowly with the help of a cane as local police escorted him out of the airport. An Italian military tribunal convicted Seifert in absentia in 2000 for torturing and murdering at least 17 people while serving as a guard at a prison camp in the northern city of Bolzano between December 1944 and April 1945. A copy of the sentence, posted on the website of Italy's Defence Ministry, said Seifert -- known at the camp as "Mischa" -- had tortured his victims with fire, broken bottles, clubs and ice-cold water. It said Seifert in one instance had raped a pregnant woman detained in an isolation cell before killing her, while in a separate episode he had left a 15-year old Jewish prisoner to die of hunger. Seifert has acknowledged being a guard at the prison, which held Jews and political prisoners awaiting transfer to German concentration camps, but denied that he had killed anyone. Dubbed by Italian media the "Excutioner of Bolzano", Seifert was turned over to Italian authorities in Toronto on Friday. The top military prosecutor in charge of the trial, Bartolomeo Costantini, said on Saturday Seifert was fit enough to go to jail but may end up serving the sentence under house arrest because of his age. "His conditions are compatible with detention," Costantini told Sky Italia television after Seifert was temporarily taken to a military prison. Seifert was born in 1924 in Ukraine, then part of the Soviet Union, and began work as a guard in the Nazi SD security service after the German occupation. He was a member of the SS while serving at the Bolzano camp, Italian court documents said. He moved to Canada after the war, claiming to be from Estonia, and found employment as a mill worker in Vancouver, where he raised a family and lived until he was arrested at Italy's request in 2002. Seifert fought his extradition in Canadian courts, but the Supreme Court of Canada refused last month to hear his appeal. Seifert's lawyers had argued he had been convicted unfairly in Italy and that Canadian officials were biased against him in allowing the extradition. The Canadian Jewish Congress welcomed news of the extradition on Friday, saying it showed Canada was not a safe hiding place for people wanted for war crimes. The group has estimated that 1,000 to 3,000 people with Nazi pasts were able to get into Canada illegally between 1947 and 1956.
