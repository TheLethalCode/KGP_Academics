<TITLE> Late own goal puts Portsmouth through in FA Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An own goal by Preston North End's Darren Carter four minutes into stoppage time gave Portsmouth a fortunate 1-0 away win in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday. Keeper Andy Lonergan missed Niko Kranjcar's last-ditch corner and the ball curled towards the far post where midfielder Carter kicked a desperate attempt at a clearance into the roof of the net. England goalkeeper David James, the man of the match, saved a penalty on the hour to keep Portsmouth in the game against Preston, who are only one point above the Championship (second division) relegation zone. James went to his right to parry Simon Whaley's spot kick after Sylvain Distin had brought down Billy Jones. In the day's earlier match, Middlesbrough were held to a 0-0 draw at Championship side Sheffield United and will host the replay at the Riverside stadium on Feb. 26. JAMES BRILLIANT At Preston, the first real chance fell to Portsmouth but Lonergan tipped over Sulley Muntari's 36th-minute free kick. However, Preston created the greater number of chances in the second half with James making a string of fine saves including a full-length dive to get to Neil Mellor's shot. "They really didn't deserve to lose that game but then that's football," Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp said. "It was a good performance from Preston. If they played like that every week they wouldn't be in a relegation battle, would they?" Of James's penalty save, he added: "You're quietly confident that he's going to save it...You wouldn't want anybody else in the goal at that time." Sheffield United dominated a tight match at Bramall Lane in which their former England striker James Beattie hit the post with a free kick in first-half stoppage time. Boro striker Mido had a bicycle kick tipped over by United keeper Paddy Kenny near the hour and defender Emanuel Pogatetz's header was cleared off the line at the end. Only four Premier League sides go into Monday's quarter-final draw, holders Chelsea and last year's finalists Manchester United both having won their ties on Saturday. Saturday's other winners were League One (third division) Bristol Rovers and Championship sides Cardiff City, West Bromwich Albion and Barnsley, who upset Liverpool at Anfield
