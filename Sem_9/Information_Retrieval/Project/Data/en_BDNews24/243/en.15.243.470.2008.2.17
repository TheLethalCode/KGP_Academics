 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com)  Prison authorities filed seperate cases against four VIP inmates found using mobiles phones inside their cells, a senior official said Saturday. "If convicted they face a maximum one year jail sentence," inspector general of prisons Zakir Hassan told bdnews24.com. Preparations are underway to file cases against 2 more VIP detainees for the same offence, he added. "Two cases have been filed against each of the four with the Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court ," Hassan said, naming the four as former communications minister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda, former air vice marshal Altaf Hossain Chowhdhury, and former planning minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir. The prisons chief said the first cases were filed nearly one and a half months ago while the second one was filed a week ago. Cases are also being prepared against BNP minister Amanullah Aman's wife Sabera Aman and former lawmaker Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, he added. The division status of five VIP detainees held in Dhaka Central Jail was under review after they were caught using mobile phones inside the jail, prison authorities said earlier Saturday. The five detainees are Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Salauddin Quader Chowdhury. "They may have their division revoked for using mobile phones inside their cells in violation of the jail code," Hassan told bdnews24.com. Zakir said prison authorities have sent a letter to the chief judicial magistrate asking for stern action to be taken against the five. "There is also the possibility that one or two other inmates have mobile phones. We are conducting surprise raids to find out," the prisons chief said. The IG said the five VIP detainees possibly acquired the mobile phones while being transferred to and from the court. "While they are in court it is often fairly relaxed and they can talk freely with many people." "On some occasions they are returned belatedly to jail after their court appearances. They could receive mobile phones at any stage of this process," he said. The caretaker government had arrested and detained all five on charges of corruption. Their cases are currently under trial. bdnews24.com/ahd
