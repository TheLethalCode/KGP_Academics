<TITLE> Law, Depp and Farrell to replace Ledger in film </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Actor Jude Law will appear as Heath Ledger's character, along with Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell, in the unfinished film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus," Law's spokeswoman said on Monday. They will all play the role of Tony in the fantasy film which Ledger had been filming before his death. The 28-year-old Australian, who was nominated for an Oscar for "Brokeback Mountain," was found dead in his Manhattan apartment on January 22, after an accidental overdose of six prescription drugs. It was not immediately clear how the role will be reconstructed for three actors. Shooting for the movie, directed by Terry Gilliam, had just finished in London and had moved to Vancouver, Canada, before it was suspended on the news of Ledger's death. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is described as a fantastical morality tale about a traveling theatre company which can control the imagination of others. Law has a string of film credits to his name including the remake of "Alfie, "Cold Mountain" and "The Talented Mr Ripley." Depp, who has been nominated for an Oscar three times, is currently attracting rave reviews for his role in "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street." Irishman Farrell has appeared in "Pride and Glory," "Veronica Guerin" and "American Outlaws.
