<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Febr 17 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court in a ruling Sunday asked the government to provide judicial magistrates with logistic and manpower support by Feb 20. A seven-member bench of the Appellate Division headed by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin issued the order, postponing the hearing on the motion until Feb 20. On Jan 31, the SC ordered the government to submit a progress report on providing the judicial magistrates with "necessary staff and vehicles" by Feb 17. After submitting the report on compliance with the SC order, attorney general barrister Fida M Kamal said the government was sincere about completing the procedural activities relevant to separation of the judiciary from the executive. "The government would like to accomplish the tasks as soon as possible," he said. The court asked the attorney general to explain why the government was not doing so then. Fida M Kamal said the bureaucracy has its own way of work and the bureaucrats are following their "methodical ways" of doing the job. The court adjourned the hearing on the issue until Feb 20, setting the deadline for the government to provide the judicial magistrates with assisting staff to enable them "function effectively". The attorney general said: "He'll convey the court's directive to the government." Earlier on Dec 12, the SC had ordered the government to provide the judicial magistrates with required staff, vehicles and other logistical support and come up with a progress report. bdnew
