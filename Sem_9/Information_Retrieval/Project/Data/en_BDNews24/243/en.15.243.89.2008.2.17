 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com) -- GMG Airlines will start operating flights to London, Singapore and Karachi, raising the number of its existing international routes to nine, said an airline official Sunday. GMG general manager Ismail Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com: "Flights on the new routes will start next year. An application to the civil aviation ministry is being progressing at the moment," Bhuiyan said. According to the International Air Transport Association, the number of passengers on international flights from Bangladesh has increased by 10 percent a year, over the last three years. In the face of aircraft shortage, Biman Bangladesh Airlines suspended flights on six international routes, including New York, last year. The national carrier has also stopped flights on four domestic routes last year. Biman currently operates flights on 20 international and three on domestic routes. GMG has been operating international flights to Kolkata, Delhi, Katmandu, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Dubai for the last four years. In addition to GMG Airlines, Aviana Airways, United Airways and Best Air operate flights on three domestic routes to Chittagong, Sylhet and Cox's Bazar. GMG Airlines have two Dash-8s, three Boeing MD-80s, a Boeing 737 and a Boeing 747 in their fleet. GMG plans to lease more aircraft when the new flights go into operation. bdnew
