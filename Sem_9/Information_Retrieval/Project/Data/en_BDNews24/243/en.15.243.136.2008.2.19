 KIGALI, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush will commemorate the Rwandan genocide on Tuesday, one of the darkest episodes in Africa's recent history, and call attention to the current conflict in Darfur which he also calls genocide. Moving on from Tanzania, the centrepiece of his five-nation African tour, Bush arrived in Rwanda's capital Kigali, where he will visit a memorial to the 1994 genocide in which 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were murdered by Hutu extremists. He will also announce $100 million to help train and equip African peacekeepers headed to Sudan's Darfur region, a White House spokeswoman said. Rwanda's share would be $12 million. Security was tight as Rwandan President Paul Kagame, a military guard of honour and a troop of traditional dancers received the US leader. The airport was closed to other planes and Rwandan military helicopters buzzed in the sky overhead. Kigali will be a sober interlude after Bush's three-day visit to Tanzania, where he was feted both by cheering crowds and the country's leader, Jakaya Kikwete, who praised the US leader and called him a friend of Africa. The U.S. president will visit a genocide museum where the remains of some 250,000 victims are buried. In the past, genocide survivors have criticised Washington for not intervening to stop the slaughter. "There's nothing we can tell him -- we do not even plan on meeting him because I am sure he knows about the plight of Rwanda genocide survivors," Theodore Simburudali, president of the Ibuka genocide survivor group, told Reuters. In 1998, U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was in power at the time of the genocide, visited Rwanda and apologised for not making more of an effort to halt the bloodshed. Kagame and other presidents on Bush's tour are seen by Washington as a new generation of progressive African leaders. Bush, unpopular in much of the world for his handling of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is respected in many parts of Africa, where he has spent more money on aid than Clinton. He has pledged to increase total assistance to $8.7 billion by 2010, double 2004 levels. BUSH LAUDED Bush was lauded in Tanzania for his personal programmes to fight AIDS and malaria and for aid schemes that emphasise self-reliance rather than unqualified assistance. The president's Millennium Challenge Corp. funds development in nations that meet criteria for good governance, fighting corruption and free market economic policies. In Tanzania, which Washington considers a model of African development, Bush signed over a $698 million grant, the largest under the programme. After meeting Kagame, Bush will visit an HIV/AIDS project before talking to Rwandan troops who have served in Sudan's Darfur region as African Union peacekeepers. "We feel proud because it's recognition of our contribution towards bringing security and stability, not only to Darfur but also our region. The U.S. government has been our strong partner in this," Rwandan army spokeswoman Jill Rutaremara told Reuters. The United States has helped train and transport Rwandan troops serving in Darfur, where Washington says genocide has occurred during five years of violence in which international experts say 200,000 have died. Sudan's government denies this, saying only 9,000 have died. Bush is not visiting Kenya, despite being next door in Tanzania, but he sent Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice there on Monday to support former UN chief Kofi Annan's efforts to mediate in a post-election crisis that has killed 1,000 people. Rice called on Kenya's government and opposition to accelerate a power-sharing deal and said there could be no "business as usual" with the country until the unrest ended.
