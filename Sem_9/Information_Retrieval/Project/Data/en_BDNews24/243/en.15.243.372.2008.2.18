<TITLE> UK`s pension watchdog wants new life assumptions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's pensions watchdog has proposed companies use more realistic projections of how long employees will live after they retire, which is likely to mean many firms will have to put more money into their pension schemes. Firms that do not use the most conservative assumption for the life expectancy of their workers, known as "the long cohort", in calculating their pension liabilities will have to justify their stance to The Pensions Regulator, the body said on Monday. Firms that assume further improvements in life expectancy are unlikely to occur will also attract the scrutiny of the regulator, it said. "It is the regulator's view that some projections that have been in common use can no longer be considered reasonable assumptions," the regulator's chief executive, Tony Hobman, said. The regulator is worried that companies have ignored growing evidence that people are living longer and are not putting aside enough money to pay workers' pensions. "Scheme members living longer adds to the cost of pensions and it is right that schemes recognise this in their funding," Hobman said. The proposals will go out to consultation until May 12.
