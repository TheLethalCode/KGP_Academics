 SEOUL, Feb 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korea has again denied running a clandestine programme to enrich uranium for weapons, long suspected by the United States, a top US nuclear envoy said on Wednesday. US envoy Christopher Hill was speaking after talks in Beijing on Tuesday, when he pressed North Korean nuclear envoy Kim Kye-gwan to meet his country's side of an international agreement to own up to all its nuclear weapons programmes.

"We cannot pretend that activities don't exist when we know that the activities have existed." The United States in 2002 first accused the North of running a covert nuclear programme by enriching uranium, a charge that triggered the demise of a 1994 deal to disarm the North's nuclear arms programme. Plutonium and enriched uranium can both be used to fuel nuclear weapons. North Korea tested a plutonium-based nuclear weapon in October 2006, alarming Washington and Asian neighbours. Hill described the nuclear talks among the two Koreas, China, Japan, Russia and the United States as being in a rough patch but said that they had not reached a dead end. And he quoted Kim as saying North Korea was committed to making progress in the nuclear deal. "Mr. Kim Kye-gwan was very careful not to describe this as any kind of stalemate," he said before leaving for Tokyo later on Wednesd
