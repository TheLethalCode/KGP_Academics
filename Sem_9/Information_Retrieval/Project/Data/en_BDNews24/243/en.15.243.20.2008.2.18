 Brussels, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France recognised Kosovo's independence on Monday, Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner announced after European Union foreign ministers adopted a joint statement on the breakaway Serbian province's future. Kouchner said President Nicolas Sarkozy had written to the president of Kosovo to convey France's official recognition. "It's the end of the Balkan troubles. I hope it's over. And now we need reconciliation, even now I know that will take a long time," he told a news conference.
