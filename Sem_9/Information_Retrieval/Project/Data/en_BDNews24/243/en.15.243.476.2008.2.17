<TEXT>
 NICOSIA, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Cypriots voted on Sunday for a new president in a cliffhanger three-way race seen as crucial to any revival of peace talks on the war-divided island and to Turkey's hopes of joining the EU. No clear winner is likely from Sunday's vote. Polls forecast a neck-and-neck contest between incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos and challengers Demetris Christofias and Ioannis Kassoulides. Voting was scheduled to end at 1500 GMT, with final results expected at around 1830. If no clear winner emerges a runoff will be held on Feb. 24. The winner will be mandated to seek a peace deal to reunite Cyprus's ethnic Greeks and Turks, divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 sparked by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Cyprus is now represented in the EU by its Greek Cypriots, with north Cyprus a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara. Without a solution, Greek-led Cyprus will never agree to Turkey's admission into the EU. The problem could also complicate cooperation between NATO, of which Turkey is a member, and the security arm of the EU, the ESDP. "The future is in our hands. I hope that with the help of the people we can achieve the solution we want and deserve," Papadopoulos, 74, said as he cast his vote on Sunday. TOUGH ON DIVISION Papadopoulos led Greek Cypriot opposition to a 2004 UN reunification plan which was accepted by Turkish Cypriots, and says he will oppose any attempt to revive it. Some Cypriots said they voted for him because he was the toughest on the key issue. "I voted for Tassos (Papadopoulos) because he has the strongest personality," said 31-year-old accountant Michalis Aletraris. "He has the right approach on the Cyprus problem which I think will lead to a fair solution for both sides." Kassoulides and Christofias say they will attempt to forge closer links with Turkish Cypriots. "Our aspiration is to reunite this country and its people, Greek and Turkish Cypriots ... people deserve better," said Christofias, 62, head of the island's powerful Communist party. Kassoulides, 59, said he wanted to see Cyprus move closer to Europe. "Today we decide to move Cyprus forward as a modern EU state ... and to start the real struggle to end the (Turkish) occupation," he said. Papadopoulos is tipped to be marginally ahead of the other two candidates in the first round. He has overseen a buoyant economy and Cyprus's admission to the euro zone on Jan. 1 2008. Under overcast skies and rain -- a welcome respite to a crippling drought which has sapped Cyprus's water reserves to dangerously low levels, about half of the almost 516,000-strong electorate had voted by midday. Tight reporting restrictions are supposed to prevent the media influencing voters. Most appeared to flout the rules. "The race is a bad remake of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly," wrote Patroclos, a columnist for the Cyprus Mail dai
