 Munshiganj, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed said Monday that the prime task of his administration was to transfer power to a democratic government through elections. "A free and fair election is important to meet that target. Work is going on for that cause," the chief adviser said, as he exchanged views with local people and officials at Tongibari in Munshiganj. He said the country was overcoming corruption gradually. "We can free ourselves from corruption if we have a motto that we will not commit corruption and will not allow anybody to do so either," he said. Earlier, the chief adviser opened the sixth Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge on the Dhaleswari river through Muktarpur. He said plans are underway to bring the greater Dhaka under an integrated communication network. He said the government would start the main work of Padma Bridge at Mawa next year to link the south and southwestern regions with the rest of the country. Fakhruddin said that Mukterpur bridge would make a new era of economic and social development in the country. "A developed communication system is vital for the development of a country. The government is working to extend and develop communication system for a prosperous economy." "The bridge will help start direct road communications with the capital and other parts of the country that will boost social and economic activities," Fakhruddin said. "Employment opportunities will increase and daily commodities can be easily transported. It will make a positive impact on the market price." He said that the bridge would act as a landmark in the friendly relations between Bangladesh and China. Communications adviser Ghulam Quader said: "The development of the area was hampered as there was no direct communication system." "Farmers can easily sell products from now on." Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Zheng Qingdian said that his country was happy to provide assistance in the socio-economic sector of Bangladesh. He hoped the bridge would strengthen the relations between the two countries. The length of the bridge was 1.52 kilometres and it costs Tk 208 crore. The work started in 2005. bdnews2
