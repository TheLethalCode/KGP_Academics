 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Ahahani Limited, Victoria SC and Surjo Torun have almost confirmed their Premier Division Twenty20 League semifinal berths with straight third triumph Sunday. Biman Bangladesh, Kalabagan KC, Old DOSH also kept their hope alive to move into the semifinals with their second win, but holders Mohammedan SC continued their shaky performance to concede to their third straight defeat, sparking an early exit from the season's curtain-raiser. A five-scalp from pacer Ziaur Rahman guided Abahani to record a convincing six-wicket win over City Club, who set Ahahani to chase a paltry 77 runs to win at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan (BKSP) ground-1. The Dhanmondi-based outfit lost four wickets to reach the target with 2.3 overs to spare as middle order Tushar Imran remained unbeaten on 41 off 41. Earlier, Zia made the inroads into City Club's batting line-up, claiming five wickets for just 12 runs in allotted four overs. At the Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium (DCS), Ehsanul Haq Sejan blazed an unbeaten 82 off 48 balls as Victoria handed a six-wicket defeat to Partex SC. Sejan and Farhad Hossain (41) together put on 79 runs for the third wicket as Victoria reached 154 for four in 18.4 overs after Partex posted a fighting total of 152 for seven in 20 overs. An unbeaten 5o from Shamsur Rahman Shuvo powered newcomers Surjo Torun to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Sonargaon Cricketers, who tasted third defeat in as many matches at the BKSP ground-1. Surjo Torun made 108 for three in 15.3 overs after bowling Sonargaon out for a paltry 107 in 19.3 overs. Last year's runners-up Old DOHS defeated Young Pegasus by 53 runs at the BKSP ground-2. DOHS scored a moderate 129 for five in 20 overs riding on skipper Mehrab Hossain Junior's 63 not out and Anisur Rahman Sanchoy's 32. In reply, Pegasus stopped at 76 for seven in the stipulated overs in the face of some superb bowling from Mahbub Alam (2/12), M Munur (2/13) and Rashedur Rahman (2.14). A top order batting display helped Kalabagan KC record a two-wicket win over BKSP, who made 146 for nine in 20 overs at the DCS. Kalabagan reached the target of 147 with three balls to spare losing eight wickets as top order batsmen  Nazmus Sadat (36), Arif Reza (26) and Hannan Sarkar (39)  gave the winners a solid start. At the BKSP ground-2, Biman outplayed Mohammedan by five wickets. The national flag carrier scored 132 for five in 19.5 overs, chasing 131 for nine in 20 overs set by the Motijheel-based Mohammedan.
