<TITLE> BNP unity possible if reformists own Delwar: Hannan Shah </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)Unity with BNP's reformist faction will be possible only if it is willing to acknowledge Khandaker Delwar Hossain as the party secretary general, ASM Hannan Shah said Tuesday. Released on bail by the additional chief judicial magistrate's court in Gazipur last Thursday, Shah, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's adviser, was admitted to United Hospital in Gulshan the same afternoon and returned home after six days of treatment. "There shouldn't be any hurdle on the path of unity once everybody owns the secretary general nominated by Khaleda Zia," the BNP leader told reporters after his release from hospital. Shah in a message for the party's reformists said: "Let's go by our chief's calling and work together." Shah said he trusted that the court's verdict on the EC invitation letter to BNP would be in their faction's favour. Of his most recent bail order issued by a lower court, Shah said: "Truth has triumphed over falsehood in the verdict." "I believe that the party leaders and workers will be with me as long as I stay loyal to Khaleda Zia," he added. Shah urged authorities to deliver the detained party chairperson's letter, as addressed, to the chief election commissioner. "She has only explained the stance of her party in that letter; it has nothing to do with any political decision." Shah was released from Narayanganj jail on Feb 13 on interim bail issued by the High Court. He was rearrested the following day in connection with a case filed with Kapasia Police Station in Gazipur. Since emergency rule was imposed on Jan 11, 2007, Shah has been arrested on four separate occasions, the first being on May 14. After his initial release, he was arrested twice for breaching emergency powers rules. Hannan said doctors had advised him to take rest for a week. bdnews
