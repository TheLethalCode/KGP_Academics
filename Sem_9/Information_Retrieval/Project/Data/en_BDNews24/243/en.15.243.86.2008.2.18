 MANILA, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of people protested against US soldiers involved in humanitarian missions in Muslim areas of the southern Philippines on Monday, saying the troops' presence could be provocative. About 6,000 US troops are taking part in annual training exercises with Philippine troops over two weeks but they will only hold humanitarian missions in the south of the archipelago, where Muslim communities are suspicious of their activities. Zainab Ampatuan, head of the Suara Bangsamoro (Voice of the Moro People) political party, said about 20,000 people gathered in the southern cities of Davao, General Santos, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato and Pikit to protest the presence of US soldiers in Muslim villages.

The campaign against the militants has caused civilian deaths and sometimes the evacuation of local communities. The Philippines was a colony of the United States in the early 20th Century and Washington started settling Christian families in the south, where Muslims were once in a majority.
