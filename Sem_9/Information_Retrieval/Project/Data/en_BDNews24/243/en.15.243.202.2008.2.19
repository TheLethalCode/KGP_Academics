<TEXT>
 ROME, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster said he would risk fielding defender Gabriel Heinze in Tuesday's Champions League game at AS Roma despite the danger of a relapse of the thigh strain that sidelined him for more than a month. The nine-times European champions are short-handed at the back due to injuries to Pepe, Christoph Metzelder and Marcelo for the first leg of the last 16 tie. "I don't think there's much of a risk (of the injury returning), but we have to take it," Schuster told a news conference on Monday. "It would have been perfect if he could have played (in Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Real Betis) in Seville. It wasn't possible. But I think he is in shape and has the desire to help us. Maybe he won't play the whole match." In-form Brazilian forward Robinho, Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder and Argentine striker Javier Saviola will also be missing through injury for the Primera Liga leaders, who have lost two of their last three games. DOMESTIC DIP The German coach said he was not worried about returning to European action during a dip in domestic form. "It's not a bad moment. I simply would like to be facing (Roma) with more players at my disposal, so it isn't the perfect time in that way," he said. "But for other reasons it is a good moment for us. It will be a difficult tie but we are confident in a competition that is an important part of Real Madrid." Captain Raul said Real would not let the importance of the game inhibit their offensive style. "It is more important to score more goals than to keep a clean sheet," the striker said. "We must play well for the whole 120 minutes of the tie. We can't wait for the return leg because by that time it could be too late." The striker said the Spanish champions were motivated by the desire to make up for recent Champions League disappointments. "We have not gone beyond the last 16 in recent years and one of the aims we have set ourselves this year is to regain prestige in Europe. Roma are a competitive, fast team that play very well and will create problems. But tomorrow we have a great chance and we want to take advantage of it.
