<TEXT>
 Beijing, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The chief US envoy to talks on North Korea's nuclear programme arrived in Beijing on Monday, the first leg of a northeast Asia tour aimed at forging progress on disarming the isolated state. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper said in its evening edition that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill was likely to meet his North Korean counterpart, Kim Kye-gwan, in Beijing, but Hill said that was not certain. "As is always our practice, we always let them know I'm here. We don't have anything set up yet. But if it's possible I am here tomorrow, but we don't have any meeting scheduled as yet," Hill told reporters. Hill will visit Seoul and Tokyo later in the week, ahead of a trip through the region by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The visits come amid stalled efforts to persuade North Korea, which defied international pressure and conducted a nuclear test in October 2006, to give up its atomic ambitions. Under the terms of a disarmament deal announced in October last year, North Korea was offered 1 million tonnes of heavy fuel oil, or the equivalent in aid, and the prospect of improved diplomatic relations. In return, it agreed to disable the Yongbyon nuclear reactor complex at the heart of its atomic programme and provide a full declaration of its nuclear activities by the end of 2007. But though it began the disabling process, the impoverished country has since stalled on its commitments, complaining that the energy aid and U.S. concessions were not coming soon enough. "I don't know if things are in stalemate, because stalemate implies they cannot change. I think the issue is the DPRK needs to be prepared to make a complete and correct declaration," Hill said. North Korea's formal name is the People's Democratic Republic of Korea. A Stanford University researcher who went to the North last week on a non-government trip said that despite the delays North Korean officials appeared willing to proceed with disarmament steps but only after their own demands were met. The multilateral talks aimed at disarming North Korea group the United States, the two Koreas, Japan, Russia and China.
