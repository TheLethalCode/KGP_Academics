<TITLE> Poultry farm owners allege graft in damages </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Poultry farm owners have alleged that some livestock officials inflate the numbers of culled birds in fixing compensations for farms plagued by the bird flu virus. Officials and owners of the farms share the extra-money siphoned off government funds under the cover of inflated numbers, several farm owners alleged Sunday. Mohammad Salahuddin Ahmed, director (administration) of the Directorate of Livestock, denied the charges. The government is providing compensations ranging from Tk 60 to Tk 95 for owners for each culled bird, officials said. Several poultry industry insiders, preferring not to be named, said the livestock officials involved in detecting and culling the birds often take "good birds" for eating but label the farms as "infested by the virus". They alleged that the officials often secretly allow the farm owners to sell their infected birds to the open market but they show that the birds have been culled. "They all want to make money but they forget that they are helping the deadly virus spread," said an official of a leading poultry farm. "They want double benefit." Such corrupt practices could imperil the industry further, he said, adding: "It will encourage the officials to cull good birds." A senior official of Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association said that they had received a number of such allegations. The official, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the owners of the infected farms really need support by the government but corrupt practice should not go on in the name of support. "I think this is an important issue that needs to be dealt with seriously," the official said. Salahuddin Ahmed of the livestock directorate told this correspondent that the allegations had been manufactured by a "certain quarter". "A certain quarter is trying to camouflage the issue. Several people involved in the industry are trying to cash in on the issue by making such allegations," he said. "The sector is in trouble. We are trying to support the farm owners with limited resources," Salahuddin said. "Such false allegations would just hinder the government's good efforts," he said. Salahuddin said his department follows a standard procedure in fixing the compensations. At the district level, a six-member committee led by the deputy commissioner fixes the compensations after proper inspection, he said. Salahuddin referred to examples in India where cash incentives are provided for the affected farm owners. "The money is paid by cheque. And the deputy commissioner hands the cheques to the owners. No question of corruption can arise," he insisted. The authorities have culled more than 600,000 birds since March 2007 when the virus was first detected in the country, according to the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock. The virus has already spread to 42 out of 64 districts amid fears that it will leave the burgeoning industry in further trouble. Veterinary staffers culled some 95,000 birds at a farm in the capital's Badda area Sunday after the authorities confirmed that Omega Poultry Farm has been infected by the H5N1 strain of virus. Poultry is a billion-dollar industry, which directly employs some three million people, according to Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association. bd
