 London, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown defended his reputation for sound economic management on Monday in the face of mounting criticism over his decision to nationalise ailing bank Northern Rock Plc. The government, which rejected two private sector-led bids for the bank, announced on Sunday legislation allowing it to take over Britain's fifth-largest mortgage bank. Following is a list of some previous bank nationalisations or bailouts by the British government: Bank of England Clement Attlee's Labour government brought the Bank of England, which had been privately owned since 1694, into full public control in 1946. Slater Walker Securities Slater Walker Securities, owned by Jim Slater, veteran stock market guru, nearly collapsed in 1975 amid allegations that it lent money to an associate company in a questionable share support scheme. The Bank of England intervened in October 1975, advancing the firm 70 million pounds as a standby facility. Johnson Matthey Bank, National Home Loans In 1984 the Bank of England rescued Johnson Matthey Bank, buying it for one pound and putting in its own managers to run it. National Home Loans hit trouble in 1991 after a fall in UK property prices, plus closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) which hit liquidity at its National Mortgage Bank subsidiary. A Bank of England-backed lifeboat rescued NHL from collapse and from 1992 new chairman Jonathan Perry oversaw a turnaround in the company's fortunes. BCCI Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), a Middle East-backed bank licensed to operate in Britain, collapsed owing creditors and depositors more than 10 billion pounds ($17.6 billion). In July 1991, the Bank of England closed BCCI in Britain in coordination with the United States and other countries. Northern Rock The Bank of England bailed out the mortgage lender in September 2007, promising emergency funds after the global credit crunch hit its ability to raise cash in money markets. The government said on Feb. 17 that it would nationalise Northern Rock for a temporary period, abandoning efforts to find a private sector buyer for the ailing lender. Sources: Reuters; HM Treasury
