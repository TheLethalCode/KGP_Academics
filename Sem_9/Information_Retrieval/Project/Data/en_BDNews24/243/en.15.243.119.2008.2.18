<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Boca Juniors eased to a 4-0 victory over Argentinos Juniors in the second round of the Clausura championship on Sunday, the big win serving as an ideal warm-up for next week's Libertadores Cup opener. The South American champions, who begin the defence of their Libertadores title with a trip to Veneuzelan club Union Atletico Maracaibo on Wednesday, could only draw 1-1 with Rosario Central last week but were far more clinical against Argentinos. Veteran striker Martin Palermo opened the scoring midway through the first half, pouncing on a rebound when Argentinos goalkeeper Juan Carrera failed to hold a shot by Hugo Ibarra. Striker Rodrigo Palacio doubled the advantage early in the second half when he latched on to a defence-splitting pass by former Barcelona and Villarreal playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme. Midfielder Jesus Datolo added a third with a sharply-angled shot in the 82nd minute and Leandro Gracian completed the rout from the penalty spot in injury time. Argentinos defender Sergio Escudero was dismissed for the foul that led to the spot-kick. River Plate drew 0-0 at Newell's Old Boys, offering some encouragement to former Argentine international Diego Simeone, who had seen his team lose to Peru's San Martin in the opening Libertadores Cup clash last week. Apertura champions Lanus have also struggled to rediscover last year's form and suffered another setback with a 1-0 loss at Huracan, while Independiente came close to emulating Boca's scoreline with a 4-1 win over Tigre. On Saturday, San Martin maintained their 100 percent start to the campaign with a 1-0 upset of San Lorenzo, Estudiantes-La Plata beat Gimnasa-Jujuy 2-0 and Velez Sarsfield overcame Olimpo by the same margin. All three winning teams have six points from two matches
