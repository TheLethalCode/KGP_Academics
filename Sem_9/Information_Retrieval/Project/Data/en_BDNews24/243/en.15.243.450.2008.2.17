<TITLE> BTTB runs without chairman </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb17 (bdnews24.com) - The failure to appoint a chairman to the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board has severely impacted the state-run agency's performance, BTTB officials said Sunday. The position has remained vacant since former BTTB chairman DM Moudud Chowdhury went on 'leave preparatory to retirement' on Jan 31. Post and telecommunication ministry officials said a proposal containing the names of three potential candidates to the post was sent to the chief adviser's office at the end of January. MA Malek, the special assistant to the chief adviser in charge of telecommunication, told bdnews24.com Sunday that a proposal had been sent to the relevant authority on time. On condition of anonymity, officials at both the ministry and the BTTB said the overall performance, and particularly the financial activities of the organisation, had slowed considerably since the chairman's post was vacated. One official said many important decisions had been held up, including employees' loans from the general provident fund, which require the chairman's approval. A BTTB agreement with the Power Grid Company for the use of an alternative optical fibre cable from Cox's Bazar to Dhaka is still unimplemented, said a BTTB official. Implementation of the state-run organisation's annual development programme has also been slowed. bdnews
