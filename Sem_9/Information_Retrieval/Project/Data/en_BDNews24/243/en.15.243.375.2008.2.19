<TITLE> Lucrative league taking shape as 'auction' looms </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MUMBAI, India, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With over $1.7 billion being spent on franchise sales, television and promotion rights, the Indian Premier League (IPL) is poised to become one of the most lucrative sporting events to be launched in Asia. On top of those funds, a further $40 million will be splurged by the eight franchises on cricket's top names in Wednesday's player 'auction' for the Twenty20 league starting on April 18. Dubbed 'The Great Wednesday Bazaar' by the Indian media, the Mumbai sale is sending the cricket world into a spin, with pay cheques starting at six figures for the services of leading players for what is essentially 44 days of action. The officially sanctioned IPL, set up to counter an unofficial Twenty20 league that started last year, will feature 59 matches aimed at prime-time television in a country with the largest global cricket audience and multi-million dollar deals. In addition, organisers clinched a five-year title sponsorship rights deal worth $50.3 million, signifying the rising corporate involvement in cricket in India, which has the fastest growing major economy after China. No single event has made global cricket news in this manner since Kerry Packer's circuit did over thirty years ago, but unlike the IPL, the late Australian media magnate's event was a breakaway league. However, the IPL is expected to impact the financial fabric of the international game as much as Packer's brainchild did. The International Cricket Council (ICC) is already feeling the heat as calls grow for a permanent slot for the league in the next Future Tours Programme to avoid a clash of interests with players on national duty. Before any plans for league's long-term future can be made, all eyes will be on the events in Mumbai where an intriguing spending battle is set to unfold. One franchise owner confirmed that India's one-day captain Mahendra Dhoni's starting price had been set at $400,000 per season for Wednesday's auction, which features more than 80 international players. GILCHRIST WANTED The wicketkeeper-batsman will be in the same bracket as Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Saurav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh, who have all been designated to their city-based franchises and will earn 15 percent more than the next-highest paid player in their side. Retired Australian spinner Shane Warne is also set to be placed in the top bracket. Australia captain Ricky Ponting will start at $350,000 and his team mate Adam Gilchrist, wanted by all the franchises for his devastating batting ability, is expected to go for at least three times the wicketkeepr's reported floor price of $275,000. Each franchise can spend a maximum of $5 million on eight contracted players with the 'open' auction aimed at giving an equal opportunity for every team to procure at least one leading performer. However, the spending cap has been given a frosty reception by some members of Indian national camp, who feel they have been denied a chance to earn more. IPL chairman Lalit Modi countered by saying the league was modelled to finance the franchises. "You got a billion dollars coming in and out of that, $800-900 million will go to the franchises over a 10-year period," Modi told Reuters. "And the single biggest revenue is the ticket revenue. It is an asset. "Eighty percent of the broadcast revenue goes to the franchises, 60 percent of all sponsorship revenue goes to the franchises and 100 percent of all gate receipts go to the franchises," he added. "Each team will receive all of their sponsorship earnings as well as 87.5 percent of their owned licensing programme. "There is an entrepreneur out there offering $130 million to buy out an existing team but nobody is selling because they see the model now.
