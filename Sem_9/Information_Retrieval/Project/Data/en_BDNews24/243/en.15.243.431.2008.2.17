<TEXT>
 MILAN, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan extended their lead at the top of Serie A to 11 points on Saturday after David Suazo's double earned a 2-0 win over Livorno while second-placed AS Roma lost 1-0 at Juventus in the late game. In the day's top match Juve, who are third, took the lead when Alessandro Del Piero rifled in a free kick just before halftime to hand his side victory in an open game. Roma's best chance came moments later when defender Nicola Legrottaglie diverted Rodrigo Taddei's cross onto his own post. "We go on the field with aggression and determination and today we have played a good match," Del Piero told Sky. Manager Claudio Ranieri took a risk by playing Del Piero, David Trezeguet and Vincenzo Iaquinta in a three-pronged attack and the gamble almost paid off early on with Iaquinta going close. Juve were more defensive in the second period but Roma could only muster a few opportunities with Gianluigi Buffon saving Daniele De Rossi's free kick. Juve are now just a point behind Roma, who host Real Madrid in a Champions League last 16 first leg tie on Tuesday. European champions AC Milan warmed up for Wednesday's Champions League clash at Arsenal with a 0-0 draw in Parma, which edged Carlo Ancelotti's men up to fourth. Fiorentina could retake the Champions League qualifying spot if they manage at least a point at home to Catania on Sunday. GREAT POSITION Milan welcomed back Kaka from injury but it was the struggling home side that threatened more in the first half with Andrea Pisanu missing his kick from a great position. The visitors improved after the break with Kaka being denied by Parma goalkeeper Luca Bucci and Paolo Maldini coming on for his 1,000th career appearance. Milan's keeper Dida was carried away on a stretcher after suffering from a back problem while sitting on the bench. They had already lost fellow Brazilian Ronaldo to a serious knee injury in Wednesday's 1-1 draw with Livorno. Saturday's three matches were brought forward to allow Italy's three Champions League representatives more time to prepare for their midweek battles. Inter's Suazo made the most of his chance with coach Roberto Mancini resting top strike duo Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Julio Cruz ahead of Tuesday's game at Liverpool. The Honduran striker was virtually unmarked when he headed in Cristian Chivu's free kick after 14 minutes and soon netted his seventh goal of the campaign for the unbeaten champions after Livorno failed to clear Maxwell's cross. "I'm worried. There were no doubts about our goals. What will they talk about tonight?" Mancini jokingly asked on Sky given recent controversies surrounding some of Inter's goals. Inter received another boost for their trip to Anfield with Luis Figo coming as a substitute to make his first appearance since breaking his leg in November
