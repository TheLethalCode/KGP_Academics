<TITLE> Voting in Pakistan poll ends, low turnout expected </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Islamabad, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Polling stations across Pakistan closed their doors at 5 pm (1200 GMT) on Monday, as voting ended in an election for a new National Assembly and provincial assemblies. Pakistan is in the midst of a security scare following a wave of suicide attacks by Islamist militants, and election officials at a number of polling stations reckoned turnout was low in a vote that could be crucial to President Pervez Musharraf's future. It is not a presidential election, but if a hostile parliament emerges it could try to drive the former army chief from power, possibly by seeking his impeachment for declaring emergency rule last November in order to purge the Supreme Court and fill it with judges who rubber-stamped his own re-election late last year.
