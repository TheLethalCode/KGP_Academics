 Wellington, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Helicopters rescued 10 sailors from a French trimaran that overturned off the east coast of New Zealand on Monday. Three aircraft winched the sailors from the Groupama III after it capsized about 80 nautical miles (150 kilometres) off the coast of the South Island and took them to the city of Dunedin. "All are uninjured and were all dressed in survival gear when they were picked up from the yacht's hull," the New Zealand Rescue Coordination Centre said in a statement. The crew were given medical checks before being released. The yacht was taking part in the Jules Verne Round the World Yacht Race when it overturned in three-metre (10 feet) swells and winds of about 30 knots (56 kmh), forcing the crew onto the upturned hull. It is not known what caused the boat to capsize. The alarm was raised by French rescue authorities, who received a signal from the yacht's emergency beacon and notified their New Zealand counterparts
