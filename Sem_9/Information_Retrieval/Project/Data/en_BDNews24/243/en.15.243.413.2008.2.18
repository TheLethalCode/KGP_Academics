 MADRID, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Third-placed Villarreal lost ground to Barcelona in the Primera Liga standings on Sunday when they were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Racing Santander. Manuel Pellegrini's side dominated for long periods at the Madrigal but failed to take advantage, with Italian striker Giuseppe Rossi missing a penalty early in the second half. The result left Villarreal eight points adrift of Barcelona in the standings on 43, two clear of Atletico Madrid who host Athletic Bilbao in one of Sunday's late matches. Barca closed to within five points of Real Madrid on Saturday when they beat Real Zaragoza 2-1 away while the leaders slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Real Betis. Racing slipped to eighth after the draw at Villarreal and are now a point behind Almeria who extended their unbeaten run to seven matches with a 1-0 win over relegation-threatened Real Murcia. Basement side Levante clinched only their fourth win of the season when they came from behind to beat Osasuna 2-1 at home, but the Valencia-based side remain seven points adrift at the bottom of the table. Recreativo Huelva also fought their way back from a goal down to clinch a 3-2 victory over Deportivo Coruna in a tense battle between two more relegation candidates, with Uruguayan defender Martin Caceres heading in the winner two minutes from time
