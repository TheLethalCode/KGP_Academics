<TITLE> Spain`s struggling middle class key to election </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Alcala De Henares, Spain, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Spanish prime minister has never met Manuel Sierra, but this amiable 40-year-old twiddling his thumbs in a deserted real estate office is just the sort of man he is worried about. Sierra has time aplenty to reflect on the contrast between government descriptions of a vibrant economy and the struggle he sees around him. "Maybe the economy in general, the economy of the whole country isn't doing so badly. I don't think he (Zapatero) is lying, it's just that for workers and for families maybe it's not in such good shape," Sierra told Reuters. It's a difference in perception that could cost a vote for Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, an untiring cheerleader for his government's economic record, in national elections on March 9. These elections were meant to be easy for the Socialists, after four years in which a construction boom helped power the average Spaniard's purchasing power past Italy's. Zapatero, who won power in 2004 thanks to indignation at the former Popular Party government's attempt to blame Islamist train bombings in Madrid on Basque separatists, has cultivated young voters with social reforms like legalising gay marriage. But the economic boom was built on debt, and the credit crunch has now paralysed the property market. This has been a heavy blow to ordinary Spaniards -- whose real wages have not risen for 10 years while the bonanza proceeds have gone mainly to companies -- and a boon for the PP. Sierra, long a Socialist voter, is thinking of abstaining in the elections. Polls show the conservative PP is gaining ground and as little as 1.3 percentage points behind the Socialists, so people like Sierra have Zapatero's team worried. Things are tough on the streets of Alcala de Henares, he said, the birthplace of Cervantes but now a dormitory for Madrid where the Socialists have spotted a hive of disaffected voters. "I see people with no idea how to pay the mortgages on their flats, they're indebted and defaulting more. Wages stay the same or hardly rise and food's getting expensive," Sierra said. Spanish unemployment rose to 8.6 percent in fourth quarter 2007, Eurostat data showed, and economists expect it to rise above 9 percent this year. House prices have fallen 3.1 percent from their July peak, property website Facilisimo.com. said. BOOST FOR PP The bad economic news could not have come at a better time for PP leader Mariano Rajoy, now trying to appeal to the commopn man after focusing mainly on the Basque separatist group ETA. "I'm asking for the vote of the Spanish middle class, the workers, the wage earners, the guy who has to struggle to earn his money," Rajoy told a campaign meeting in Logrono on Sunday. Some predict the election will result in an uncomfortably small Socialist majority in parliament, enabling regional parties to extract a high price for supporting the government. "We're doing well among young people and we're doing well with women. We're a bit worse with men and with people over 65. But there's an urban middle class vote, a lower-middle class vote which could worry us," said Antonio Hernando, a Socialist congressman involved in election planning. Zapatero accuses Rajoy of being tied to the Catholic Church, of being negative and backward-looking. Rajoy countered: "I've got my feet on the ground, not on the moon." The PP has promised that seven million workers earning under 16,000 euros a year will pay no income tax if it is elected. The Socialists responded by promising everyone a 400 euro rebate. Rajoy's riskiest gambit has been to make immigration a major issue for the first time in a Spanish election, calling for restrictions on the Islamic veil and proposing a visa system that would make it more difficult for Muslims to come to Spain. "He's aiming at voters in dormitory towns around Barcelona, Madrid," Hernando said, "Middle and lower-middle classes, people feeling pressured, who fear strangers." PP voters are famously loyal, but the PP has also alienated whole regions, notably the Basque Country and Catalonia. "The PP has its traditional voters in the bag, very motivated. However they're going to struggle to get any more voters," said Juan Luis Paniagua, head of the political science faculty at Madrid's Complutense University. The Socialists think the PP is not trying to attract votes at all but wants to push disenchanted Socialists into abstention in the knowledge that a lower turnout hurts the left most. Sierra is considering staying at home. He is angry about the economy, and Rajoy's criticisms of immigration seem reasonable. "It's not racism or anything but sometimes these people get better access to services than Spaniards, like childcare and stuff. I don't want to be racist but I don't want to be taken advantage of," Sierra said.
