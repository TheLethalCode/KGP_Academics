<TEXT>
 PARIS, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Second placed Girondins Bordeaux thrashed Monaco 6-0 on Sunday to close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon to one point. The first half was dull and goalless but the visitors moved up a few gears after the break, with Argentine forward Fernando Cavenaghi and playmaker Johan Micoud contributing to the demolition with two goals each. Morocco striker Marouane Chamakh and substitute forward Gabriel Obertan also played their part in a brilliant display of fluent football with a goal each. Monaco collapsed and were 3-0 down when they had Uruguay midfielder Diego Perez sent off for a vicious tackle on forward David Bellion in the 65th minute. Lyon have 49 points from 25 games, with Bordeaux on 48 and AS Nancy on 41. Monaco dropped to ninth in the 20-strong table, 14 points off the pace. "The first half was tight but in the second, we played extremely well," said the Bordeaux coach, former France defender Laurent Blanc. "We must enjoy this and just keep going without changing anything to our plans," he added. MARSEILLE RECOVER "I know what you want to hear but I will not mention it," Blanc told reporters, refusing to talk of the title, which would be Bordeaux's sixth and their first since 1999, as an objective. Monaco coach Ricardo, formerly with Bordeaux, did not look for excuses: "I take full responsibility for this," he said. "You just can't concede six goals in one half, it's not normal." Olympique Marseille recovered from a goal down to beat Paris St Germain 2-1 in the late match. Midfielder Jerome Rothen put visitors PSG in the lead with a penalty on 29 minutes but Marseille fought back with goals before the break from Nigeria defender Taye Taiwo and Senegal forward Mamadou Niang. Once a classic, that fixture has lost much of its appeal with PSG, who slide down to 16th, no longer among the frontrunners. Marseille, now in full swing after a lean spell, move up to fourth, 11th points behind Lyon and three behind Nancy, who lost 4-0 at St Etienne on Saturday. Lyon, chasing a seventh consecutive title, slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Le Mans on Saturday in their last warm-up before welcoming Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday
