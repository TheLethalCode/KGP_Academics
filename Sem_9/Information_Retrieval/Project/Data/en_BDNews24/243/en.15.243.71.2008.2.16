 Nairobi, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush ratcheted up the pressure on Saturday for a power-sharing pact in Kenya to end a post-election crisis that has killed 1,000 people, but many Kenyans were sceptical about a quick deal. Bush, who began a five-nation visit to Africa on Saturday, is sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Kenya to support mediation efforts between the government and opposition chaired by former United Nations chief Kofi Annan. "In terms of Condi's visit, the key is that the leaders hear from her first hand that the United States desires to see that there be no violence and that there be a power sharing agreement that will help this nation resolve its difficulties," he told reporters after arriving in the West African state of Benin. Rice is due in Kenya on Monday as Annan, who advocates a "grand coalition" to solve Kenya's troubles, meets President Mwai Kibaki and opposition leader Raila Odinga. Commenting on Rice's planned visit, a senior U.S. administration official said she would back Annan's settlement plan. While some issues had been resolved, the power sharing deal will "take a little bit more time," the official added. Many Kenyans believe a shared government offers the best, immediate formula to resolving a dispute over who won the country's closest-ever presidential vote on Dec. 27. Odinga says he was rigged out of victory, while Kibaki maintains he won fairly. The stand-off triggered ethnic lashes that left 300,000 people homeless, shattered Kenya's image as one of Africa's most stable democracies, drove away tourists and disrupted food and fuel supplies to regional countries. On Friday, Annan said the two sides had agreed on a range of issues, including an independent review of the vote. The two teams had also had "narrowed considerably" the options for a governance structure -- considered the main stumbling block in the talks -- but would consult their leaders before resuming talks on Tuesday. POWER-SHARING In Nairobi, many expressed cautious optimism that the talks held in a secluded luxury safari lodge had made progress, but many were sceptical about a breakthrough on the power-sharing terms. "I think there's tremendous progress," said Gilbert Oswani, who works in customer care. "Since Kofi Annan started chairing these meetings the country has calmed. But, the point here is power-sharing. The government should be 50-50." The opposition wants to draft a new constitution, share power in the government and hold a new vote within two years. The government is seeking constitutional and electoral law reforms, but only applicable to the next election due in 2012. Government officials have said this week the only power-sharing being considered is giving opposition members ministries in Kibaki's half-filled cabinet. This is unlikely to satisfy the opposition. "Most Kenyans are interested in peace, and it doesn't matter how it comes," said Paul Mutegi, a consultant. "But, the two groups are interested in power and nothing else. I don't see this going very far," he added. Amid the political power struggle, there are hardline supporters on both sides who have threatened more unrest if their leaders capitulate.
