<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Monday got off to a flying start in the ICC U/19 World Cup with a massive 178-run win over minnows Bermuda in their Group D opener at Bayueams Oval, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The Junior Tigers folded Bermuda at 82 in 26.1 overs after three fifties from Nasir Hossain, Ashiqul Islam and Ashraful Hossain helped them post a fighting total of 260 for eight in 50 overs. It was not easy for Bermuda to face Bangladeshi spinners Suhrawardi Shuvo and Mahmudul Hasan after pacer Dollar Mahmud and Rubel Hossain made the inroads into the batting line-up. Dollar, country's lone hat-trick pacer in domestic first-class competition, struck the first blow to trap opener Terryn Fray lbw for one in his second over while his new-ball partner Rubel Hossain also trapped one-down Greg Maybury for one in the next over to reduce Bermuda to 18 for two inside four overs. Opener Christopher Douglas and Rondey Trott (20) tried to repair the dent, contributing 34 runs for the third wicket before first-change pacer Shubhashis Roy uprooted Douglas's stumps for a 32-ball eight, leaving Bermuda at 52 for three in 12 overs. Afterwards, Shuvo and Mahmud cleaned up the middle and tail, sharing six wickets as Bermuda slumped to 82 all out from 52 for three. Skipper Shuvo returned three for nine while Mahmud took as many for 12. Dollar, Rubel and Shubhashis took one wicket each. Put in to bat first, Nasir and Ashiqul played an anchor role in the middle after Bangladesh opener Ashraful Hossain offered a fine start. Nasir and Ashiqul together put on 99 runs for the sixth wicket after being reduced to 130 for five. Nasir returned for the highest 84 giving a catch to Greg Maybury off Malachi Jones delivery. Man of the match Nasir clubbed eight fours and one six facing 95 balls before he was the sixth Bangladesh batsman out. Ashiqul played a run-a-ball 69 not out smashing two sixes and as many fours to help Bangladesh go beyond 250-mark. Opener Ashraful Hossain gave a fine start though Bangladesh lost M Mithun (9) and one-down Nadimuddin (11) deplorably. Ashraful hammered eight fours in his 81-ball knocks. Bangladesh take on Ireland in the second match Wednesday. bd
