<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com) -- Acting BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed Sunday alleged that the caretaker government was conspiring to destroy the party. "They have not stopped, even after bringing one fabricated case after another against Khaleda Zia and her family. They have also tortured them as part of their plan," said Rizvi at a news briefing at his Shyamoli home. The BNP leader said the caretaker administration had been unable to prove any of the cases against Khaleda or her family. Rizvi also alleged that the caretaker administration had tortured Akhter Hamid Paban, the younger son of BNP's disputed secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, in a bid to tarnish his father's image. The acting office secretary claimed the BNP chief had not been brought before a court within the legally specified time limit. "Her two sons have also been detained the same way. The media have already published how Tarique Rahman was tortured," Rizvi said. Rizvi claimed that the condition of Paban was "serious". "Paban is suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure among other things. Although the court ordered his proper treatment, this has not happened," he said. The BNP leader said that although Paban had been granted bail by the High Court he was still taken to the police station and tortured. "He was struck on the head with a pistol, after which he became seriously ill," he said. bdnew
