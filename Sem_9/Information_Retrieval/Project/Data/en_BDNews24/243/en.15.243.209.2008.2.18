 Islamabad, Feb 18 (BBC) -- People in Pakistan vote in a crucial election Monday, overshadowed by political violence and fears of fraud. The parliamentary poll was delayed after the killing of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, and is intended to complete a transition to civilian rule. The two major opposition parties say President Pervez Musharraf's allies are planning massive fraud. They have vowed to protest if they suspect foul play. The worst act of pre-poll violence saw 47 killed at a rally Saturday. The elections for the lower house of parliament were originally scheduled for 8 January, but were postponed after the assassination of Bhutto on 27 December. Polling stations opened at 0800 (0300 GMT) and close at 1700. A spokesperson for Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which is leading in opinion polls, said the vote was "not going to be a free and fair election". The party accused the pro-Musharraf PML-Q of plotting to stuff ballot boxes. Bhutto's former rival, Nawaz Sharif, whose party is also ahead of Musharraf's supporters in polls, said a "massive rigging plan" had "been implemented". Bhutto's widower and successor as party leader, Asif Ali Zardari, said in an interview with the UK's Sunday Times newspaper that his party would have "no choice but to take to the streets" if the elections were rigged. However, he was more conciliatory on Sunday, when political rallies were banned and he made a visit to his late wife's tomb in Sindh province, a PPP heartland. He said: "If God gives us a chance... we will try to take all foes and friends together. "I think we have reached the breaking point where if we don't band together, we will lose this great nation which we call Pakistan." The authorities have stressed repeatedly that the vote will be free and fair. But President Musharraf has also warned against street protests. Close to half a million security personnel, including about 80,000 soldiers, have been deployed for the voting. On Sunday, four soldiers were killed when their vehicle hit an explosive device in Baluchistan province, police said. In two separate incidents in Lahore, gunmen opened fire on supporters of Sharif's PML-N party, with the latest report saying three men had been killed, including a candidate in the provincial election. Saturday's attack took place in the town of Parachinar, near the border with Afghanistan, when a suicide car bomber drove into a crowd of people that had gathered outside the house of a politician allied to the PPP. Correspondents say the election turnout may be low as many voters fear further violence. Analysts say polls suggest a fair vote is likely to result in a hung parliament, with none of the three biggest parties winning a majority. The BBC's Barbara Plett in Pakistan says that if the PPP then joins forces with pro-Musharraf parties, there may be a backlash within its rank and file, which blames the president for Bhutto's murder. But, she says, if it forms an alliance with Sharif's party there could be confrontation with the presidency. Sharif has refused to work with the president unless he reinstates judges sacked when he imposed emergency rule late last year, in what was widely seen as an attempt to head off a challenge to his re-election as president. It the two opposition parties jointly gain two-thirds of the seats, they may try to impeach President Musharraf. Musharraf stepped down as army chief late last year. He has ruled the country since seizing power in a coup in 1999. The nuclear-armed country is a key ally in the so-called US "war on terror", with President Musharraf's government facing a growing pro-Taleban insurgency.
