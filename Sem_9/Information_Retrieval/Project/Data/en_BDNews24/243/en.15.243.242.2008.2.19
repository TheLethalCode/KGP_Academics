 JERUSALEM, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steve Fossett, declared dead on Friday five months after he went missing while flying in Nevada, was no stranger to lonely exploits in out-of-the-way places. The American millionaire aviator, sailor, balloonist, record-breaker and all-round modern-day adventurer had friends in some unlikely spots. A decade ago, a muddy field in southern Russia was where I ran into him. He stood alone on the freezing Russian steppe, and while the world slept off New Year festivities, he surveyed the deflated wreckage of his latest attempt to become the first man to circumnavigate the globe in a balloon. He was smiling. Irrepressibly. It could be said Steve Fossett could afford to smile, having banked his millions from a career in Chicago's financial markets and turned to indulging his passions for speed, endurance and round-the-world records. However, he might have been forgiven for losing the trademark schoolboy grin at that moment in early January 1998. He had touched down just short of violent Chechnya, where foreigners then risked kidnapping and death. The local governor, clinging to a Soviet-era suspicion of foreigners, was thinking of throwing the hapless balloonist in jail for entering Russia without a visa. He was surrounded by journalists, who had stumbled blearily in the mud after a hasty late-night flight from Moscow, alerted to the lone flyer's emergency landing. Yet the energy and enthusiasm of the man were infectious. He bounded around, vigorously salvaging equipment from his balloon "Solo Spirit". He was 53 then, yet showed no sign of five almost sleepless days aloft, during which he had at one point to climb out of his gondola to fix a fault. He refused to dwell on his setback and bubbled instead about his plans for another attempt -- unselfishly, he spoke of his hopes for rivals' bids to beat him to the prize of a world first. "MY FIRST AMERICAN" Fossett seemed to charm all around him, officials and farmers alike. The solitary adventurer had soon assembled a team of willing local helpers and bureaucrats breaking off their New Year holidays to speed his passage home. At one stage, women rode up on horseback to the landing site, offering vodka and food. His expensive rivalries with fellow wealthy adventurers such as Richard Branson could scarcely have seemed more remote from the lives of the Russians of the Krasnodar region, who were struggling then to survive the collapse of communist-era collective farming. Having descended on them from the skies, Fossett posed for photographs with the farm workers who had helped him bring his massive craft under control -- an object of curiosity whose all-American can-do spirit seemed to win over those who met him. "He's the first American I've ever seen in the flesh," giggled one grandmother to the watching journalists. For us, it was the end of a long day in slush-covered mud and our thoughts were turning to hot baths and warm beds. For Fossett, getting home meant cross-country ski marathons: "And then the sailing season starts..." He set dozens of records in those fields as well as in the air. He did finally go around the world non-stop in a balloon -- not the first to do so, but the first to do it alone. As Branson, his partner in numerous exploits said shortly after Fossett disappeared in September, if anyone could survive coming down alone in a plane in the wilds of the American West, it was Steve Fossett. Sadly, it seems that was not to
