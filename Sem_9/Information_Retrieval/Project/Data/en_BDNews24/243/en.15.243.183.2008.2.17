<TITLE> Germany frets for economic model after tax scandal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Sat Feb 16, BERLIN (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - German leaders expressed concern on Saturday that a tax evasion scandal which has put hundreds of prominent Germans in the police spotlight risked discrediting the country's post-war economic model. A raid on the home of Deutsche Post Chief Executive Klaus Zumwinkel in a probe into suspected tax dodging has heightened resentment towards top managers, who many Germans feel have profited from economic growth at workers' expense. Thursday's police swoop on Zumwinkel, who has led Deutsche Post for 18 years, is likely be followed by police visits to hundreds more prominent Germans as part of a probe into offshore accounts, sources close to the investigation have told Reuters. "Tax cheating: Now the rich are trembling," ran a front-page headline on Saturday's edition of mass-selling daily Bild. Conservative Economy Minister Michael Glos told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper Germany's top managers should be aware of their example to society. "Otherwise, our social market economy will be implausible," he said. "Then our country would be a takeover candidate for the Left," he added, referring to the Left party, a group of ex-communists and disaffected former Social Democrats whose growing appeal has pulled the main political parties left. Germans' faith in executives has been shaken in the last few years by a series of corporate scandals, and by firms putting downward pressure on wages at a time when the economy has seen its strongest burst of activity since reunification in 1990. ETHICS Daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung said no other board members of firms listed in Germany's DAX leading share index were being targeted in the tax evasion probe. But a series of scandals in the last few years has engulfed top firms like carmaker Volkswagen and conglomerate Siemens, whose successes have generated the corporate prowess on which Germany's post-war identity is founded. "The Zumwinkel case and the other emerging cases of tax evasion show: We need a display of self-purification in the economy," Glos said. "Our managers must develop ethics." Frank Bsirske, head of services trade union Verdi, said people were fed up with executives lining their pockets. "They preach restraint for others and stuff their pockets full themselves," he said. "It can't go on like this." With regard to the Zumwinkel case, Bsirske added: "This is a moral problem for society as a whole and shakes the credibility of our country as a business location and our top managers." Zumwinkel will resign as Deutsche Post chief on Monday, the company said on Friday. He faced pressure to go after prosecutors said they suspected him of dodging about 1.0 million euros ($1.47 million) in taxes by transferring money to tax haven Liechtenstein. Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck told reporters Zumwinkel had admitted evading taxes. Zumwinkel himself was not available for comment. Robert Zollitsch, the new chair of Germany's Catholic bishops' conference, said anyone suspected of evading millions of euros in taxes should be called to account. "Such behavior may on no account be passed off as trifling, but instead must be perceived by society as morally reprehensible," he told Bild am Sonnta
