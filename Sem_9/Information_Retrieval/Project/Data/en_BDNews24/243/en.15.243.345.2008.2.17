 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com Correspondent Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  Students will be allowed to take SSC or HSC board examinations from this year even if they fail in the qualifying tests, a government official said Sunday. Contacted by bdnews24.com, deputy education secretary Babul Kumar Saha confirmed that the ministry had taken a decision on the matter and issued a circular. Babul said the circular was being sent to schools and colleges. According to the circular, the ministry analysed results of different public examinations and found many meritorious students were unable to take part in the qualifying tests for diverse reasons and many good students failed in a course by accident. So it cannot be acceptable to revoke these students the right to take the final exams, the ministry said. The government cancelled the 2003 circular that made it mandatory to pass in the qualifying tests to take the SSC and HSC exams. The education ministry instead recommended model tests be held before the public exams in efforts to get students up to an expected level. The model tests would help them to be prepare for the final exams, it said. According to the previous circular, the students had to pass the qualifying tests to be allowed to sit for public exams, and Secondary School Certificate and Higher Secondary Certificate exams in particular. The present circular suggested the model tests could be held under the supervision of the Upazila Nirbahi Officer or Upazila Secondary Education Officer. If not possible, educational institutions could hold model tests on their own. It asked the educational institutions not to charge any fees for model tests. The school's fund should bear the expenses. bdnews
