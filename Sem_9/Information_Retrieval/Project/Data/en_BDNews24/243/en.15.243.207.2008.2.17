 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)The foreign ministry clarified Bangladesh's position Sunday with regard to the Indian high commissioner's recent remarks on import of rice from India. "Rice procurement from India was being conducted on the basis of commercial purchase, which should be a win-win situation for both parties, without undue cost to either," the foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry issued the clarification in response to a statement made to the media Thursday by Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty that India could not feed Bangladeshis by leaving Indians hungry. India, which pledged to export 5 lakh tonnes of rice to Bangladesh, on Feb 9 has increased the prices of rice recently and halted rice export for a period. Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee while visiting Bangladesh in December said India had stopped exporting rice altogether to feed its own people. But, he assured that the ban on rice export would be relaxed for Bangladesh. Bangladesh now depends heavily on import of rice from India as Bangladesh fears possible food shortages by March. Last year, the country faced two severe floods and one devastating cyclone causing huge damage to standing crops, especially paddy. Besides India, Bangladesh has also taken diplomatic measures to import rice from Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam. All of the Southeast Asian countries in principle have agreed to export rice to Bangladesh. bdne
