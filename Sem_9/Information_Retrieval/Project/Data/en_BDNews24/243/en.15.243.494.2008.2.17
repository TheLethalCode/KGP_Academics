 Nicosia, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Greek Cypriots were voting to elect a new president on Sunday in a cliffhanger vote which could affect reunification prospects for the war-divided island this year. Polling stations opened at 0500 GMT and voting was scheduled to end at 1500 GMT, with final results in by around 1830 GMT. Almost 516,000 people have the right to vote. The election is confined to the Greek Cypriot south of Cyprus, split along ethnic lines in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek Cypriot coup. Polls have shown the election will be split between incumbent Tassos Papadopoulos, Communist Demetris Christofias and right-wing-backed Ioannis Kassoulides. None are expected to muster the requisite 50 percent plus, making a Feb. 24 runoff a certainty. Nine candidates are standing. The winner of the election will be tasked with negotiating with the Turkish Cypriot community on a resumption of peace talks, stalled since Greek Cypriots rejected a United Nations settlement proposal in 2004. Papadopoulos was a harsh critic of the blueprint. His challengers say they will be more proactive about finding a settlement on the island, which has harmed Turkey's chances of joining the European Union.
