<TITLE> Asian stocks hamstrung by US spending worry </TITLE>

 HONG KONG, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks drifted lower on Monday as weak US consumer data sparked fresh concerns over the spending power of the American shopper, while oil traded above $95 a barrel and other commodities tested, and in some cases, broke, record highs. The dollar was steady against the yen and the euro, with all eyes on a raft of US economic indicators this week for further clues on the health of the world's top economy as the credit market turmoil plays out. The Aussie dollar hit a three-month high on its hefty yield advantage. After an optimistic start, Japan's Nikkei average gave away early gains to close just 0.1 percent higher. MSCI's measure of Asian stocks outside Japan fell 0.3 percent by 0600 GMT. "It seems perhaps as if the downside's firming up and the Nikkei now may slowly rise," said Takeshi Osawa, senior fund manager at Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management. But Osawa said the Nikkei could slip again in coming months if the yen advances strongly against the dollar or companies post poor full-year results. Among the gainers in Japan were Toshiba Corp and Sony Corp T> , which jumped after a Toshiba source told Reuters it would concede defeat in the high-definition DVD format war, avoiding a costly marketing battle. Steelmakers Nippon Steel Co and JFE Holdings Inc also rose after agreeing to a 65 percent price rise for iron ore, cementing a cost that could have been worse. "The market was relieved now that one of the negative factors weighing on the shares had been played out," said Takashi Aoki, vice president at the equity investment division at Mizuho Asset Management. But the iron ore price hike was less well-received in South Korea, where POSCO Co Ltd, the world's fourth-largest steel maker, gave up earlier gains to close down 0.2 percent. Australian iron ore miners Fortescue Metals Group Ltd, Mount Gibson Iron, Murchison Metals Ltd jumped about 5 percent on the news, but the reaction from bigger rivals Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton was muted, falling 2.3 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. AUSSIE BANK WOES Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.9 percent, dragged down by news of more problems in the banking sector to rack up 12.3 percent of losses since the start of the year. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd's shares slid after the country's third-biggest lender warned it may face a $200 million hit on its exposure to a U.S. bond insurer. Seoul ended flat, while Singapore's stock market and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were both lower. Raw materials price pressures have plagued stocks for months, and supply problems continued to buoy oil and commodity metals. U.S. crude prices broke above $95 a barrel, up 16 cents at $95.66 by 0614 GMT, egged on by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who said on Sunday the state could sue U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil for unpaid taxes, and repeated threats to cut oil sales if the United States attacked his country. Precious metal platinum used to tackle emissions in car exhaust fumes, breezed to an all-time high for the 13th day in a row, while palladium raced in pursuit, notching up a seven-year record. "In Japan, many automobile companies are very nervous about future platinum prices," said Yukuji Sonoda, precious metals analyst at Daiichi Commodities in Tokyo. "They will increase stocks for another two or four months." The dollar was little changed against the yen and the euro as many investors awaited further clues on the health of the US economy. With US markets off for Presidents Day holiday on Monday, traders are looking to pointers this week from the minutes of the January meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy makers, data on January inflation, and a regional Fed gauge of factory activity in February from the US mid-Atlantic region. Profit reports from top retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co, both slated for release on Tuesday, could provide new insight on consumer sentiment. But traders said the dollar was finding some support on gains in Asian stock markets as well as hopes that the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and the newly enacted fiscal stimulus package could rekindle US economic growth later this year. b
