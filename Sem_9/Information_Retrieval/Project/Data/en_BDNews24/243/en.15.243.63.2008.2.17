 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh can only proceed towards development keeping the huge potential of the agriculture sectorand high-value agricultural products in particularat the forefront, according to two new reports launched by World Bank Sunday. The first, High-value agriculture in Bangladesh: An assessment of agro-business opportunities and constraints , says the growing demand for high-value commodities such as fruit, vegatables, spices, fish and livestock, could reach $8 billion by 2020. Not only would producers and suppliers benefit enormously from such demand, but high-value agriculture could be the means to raise the rural poor from poverty, said the joint study by World Bank and South Asia Enterprise Development Facility. High-value agriculture products tend to be highly perishable with many risks involved in marketing the commodities, say experts, but the rewards associated with such agricultural development are high: new opportunities for producers, economic growth without depleting natural resources and growth that directly benefits the poor. The findings are in accord with the World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development , also launched Sunday at the same programme held at the Sonargaon Hotel. According to WDR 2008, agricultural growth has the greatest direct impact in raising people out of poverty compared to growth in other sectors. Throughout the developing world, GDP growth attributable to agriculture can benefit the income of the poor two to four times more that GDP growth in other sectors. Experts speaking at the launch of the reports urged concerned quarters to increase investment in agriculture to ensure food security and overall development, saying Bangladesh's potential to increase production equalled that of Southeast Asian neighbours such as Vietnam. But to realise this potential, the private sector must come forward to invest intensively in agriculture, speakers said, while the government would have to take the driver's seat in formulating policy. Co-director of the World Development Report 2008 Alain de Janvry said political assistance is needed most for the development of Bangladesh's agriculture sector, in the form of agriculture friendly policies. Janvry stressed the agriculture sector of Bangladesh has great potential, but requires equally great investment by the private sector and increased subsidies by the government for its development. The end result would make the country self reliant in food and create employment opportunities and greater income for the rural poor, he added. Managing Director of Palli Karma Shahayak Foundation Quazi Mesbahuddin Ahmed said the agriculture sector has been neglected for too long, which is the reason why food demand has to be met through imports. Mesbahuddin pointed out that in 1980 more than 20 percent of ADP allocation was to agriculture, but the current Annual Development Programme allocated only 5 percent. Sattar Mandal of the Agricultural Economics Department, Bangladesh Agriculture University, welcomed the World Bank's policy shift towards agricultural development. He said a crisis was now prevailing in the country's agriculture sector, with no alternative to more investment to overcome the crisis. Alongside extensive investment from the private sector, he hoped the government would take the driver's seat and prepare an effective and timely policy, as well as ensuring basic supplies of diesel, fertiliser, electricity, irrigation and seeds to farmers. World Bank country director Xian Zhu said appropriate policies and investments are needed in key infrastructure to make it viable for farmers to switch to high-value commodities and increase agricultural production. bdnews
