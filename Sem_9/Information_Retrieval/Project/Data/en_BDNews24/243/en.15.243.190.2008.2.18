<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)- A special court is expected to make a decision Tuesday if Sheikh Hasina gets bail in a case involving charges of corruption in setting up power plants during her term as prime minister. Judge Mohammad Feroze Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 had earlier set Feb 19 to hear a petition by defence seeking bail for Hasina. On Feb 13, Hasina's lawyers appealed to the court seeking bail. Apart from Hasina, seven other people are accused in the case. The charges involve that the accused illegally took about Tk 3 crore in return for allowing two companies to set up three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna in 1996-2001. The money has allegedly been used to buy a house and land in the name of Bangabandhu Memorial Trust, according to case documents. On Feb 13, the defence said that trying the charges under emergency powers rules was illegal and Hasina deserves bail. They argued that the so-called charges took place years before the state of emergency came, and that the case could not be handled under the emergency rules. Trying any charge under emergency rules means the accused were not allowed to seek bail. On Feb 13, Hasina could not attend the court because of her reported illness. Seven other accused are former power secretary Tawfique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, former PDB chairman Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group directors Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, United Group directors Hasan Mahmud Raja and Abul Kalam Azad and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum curator Syed Siddiqur Rahman. bdnew
