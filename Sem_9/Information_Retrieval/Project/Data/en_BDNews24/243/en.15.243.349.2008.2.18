<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  The police escorted the coffin of Manna out of the capital for burial in Tangail after at least 50 people were injured in clashes between fans of the popular film actor and police. A United Hospital ambulance carrying the body set out for Manna's home village in Tangail, 42 kilometres northwest of Dhaka, amid tight security, Monjurul Quader, the actor's brother-in-law, told bdnews24.com. Relatives took the body to Tangail instead of the Central Shaheed Minar after thousands of film fans strained security measures as they scrambled to pay their last respects to Manna, who soared to dizzying heights of popularity. The police fired teargas shells to control the rowdy mob at the Film Development Corporation premises, witnesses said. Thousands of people thronged the Shaheed Minar in the morning and blocked roads in and out of the area. Many fans climbed trees to have the last glimpse of the film actor. Two police officials were severely injured in the clashes: Bulbul Ahmed and Abdul Mannan. The FDC officials took the two to hospital for treatment. Bangladesh Film Actors Association president Miju Ahmed protested the government's delayed condolence message. "This is unfortunate," he said. "The government's attitude seems that it does not care for film actors," he said. In a statement, acting information secretary Jamil Osman expressed condolences over the death of Manna. Bikalpadhara president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury and son Mahi B Chowdhury went to the FDC to pay their last respects to the actor. bdnews24.co
