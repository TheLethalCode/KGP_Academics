<TITLE> AB Bank adds to market jitters </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)Stocks finished lower Monday, a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission fined a top market player, AB Bank, Tk 10 crore in a regulatory move which added to market jitters. Bourses also witnessed a significant decrease in turnover and trading volume from those the previous day. Investors had to sell their holdings on lower margins to buy scrips as merchant banks were reluctant to disburse loans, according to market analysts. "As merchant banks are hesitant to issue loans, investors have to sell their holdings at lower profit to buy other shares," said Yaweer Sayeed, who manages over Tk 1 billion in funds of AIMS of Bangladesh. This phenomenon has led to decreased turnover and volume on the bourses, he added. The SEC on Sunday slapped a fine of Tk 10 crore on AB Bank's merchant banking unit on charges of approving loans to clients, mostly relatives and employees, far exceeding the permitted limit. AB Bank was accused of skewing the market situation by creating artificial price hikes in certain issues. A top official of a brokerage house, asking not to be named, said the market was short of funds, but appreciated the merchant banks' cautious attitude. "The market is still in the process of recovering the damage due to fund shifting during the two state-run oil companies' debuts," he said. However, merchant banks were acting responsibly about their role in the market as investors would act on rumour at this moment and create more instability, he explained adding, "Our investors are just not mature enough." The DSE general index slumped from the beginning of trade on Monday and continued to fall until the midday session. It, however, started to return from losses just before the last hour, but immediately fell again to finish lower. The benchmark DGEN or general index closed at 2900.05, down 36 points, or 1.22 percent. The DSI or all share price index ended on 2447.22, down 31.58 points, or 1.27 percent.

Decliners outnumbered advancers 163 to 49, with eight scrips holding steady. The day witnessed banks, power and pharmaceuticals finishing lower while insurance and mutual funds advanced.
