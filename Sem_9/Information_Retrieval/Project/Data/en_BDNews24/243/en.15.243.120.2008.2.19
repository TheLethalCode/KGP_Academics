 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)The charge framing hearing in a corruption case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina on the setting-up of barge-mounted power plants has been suspended until Feb 26. Judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 on the Sangsad Bhaban premises suspended the hearing as former power secretary Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury, also accused in the case, was not produced before the court. The court will also decide on Feb 26 on whether the former prime minister would be granted bail. Hasina, who appeared ill, was taken to court at 3.05pm from special jail, also sited on the Sangsad Bhaban complex. Hasina's lawyers on Feb 13 appealed to the court seeking bail for her, prompting the judge to fix Feb 19 for delivering an order. The Awami League chief, arrested on July 16 last year, could not be presented before the court on Feb 13 as she was sick. Hasina fell ill in special jail on Feb 11. Jail authorities said she had been suffering from high-blood pressure. During the hearing on the appeal for bail, Hasina's lawyers referred to the scrapping of businessman Azam J Chowdhury's case against her and said the case was also taken under the Emergency Powers Rules. Hasina should be granted bail in the barge-mounted power plant case as well, the lawyers argued. State counsels opposed the bail prayer. Anticorruption Commission deputy director SM Shabbir Hasan on Sept 2 last year filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station against eight people, including Hasina. Others accused in the case are former Power Development Board chairman Nooruddin Mahmud Kamal, Summit Group director Md Aziz Khan, director Farid Khan, United Group director Hasan Mahmud Raja, director of the same group Abul Kalam Azad and Bangabandhu Memorial Museum curator Syed Siddiqur Rahman. The case alleged that the accused took bribe of about Tk 3 crore for buying land for Bangabandhu Memorial Trust in return for landing the firm an order to set up three barge-mounted power plants in Haripur, Shikalbaha and Khulna. Hasina was shown arrested in the case on Sept 19 last year. Besides, Toufiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury surrendered to court on Jan 16. Hasina on Oct 28 filed a writ petition with the High Court challenging the validity of taking the case under the Emergency Powers Rules. She also prayed for bail in the case. The High Court on Nov 4 granted bail to Hasina and suspended the proceedings. The Appellate Division on Nov 26 stayed the High Court order, setting in motion the proceedings of the case again in the trial court. bdnew
