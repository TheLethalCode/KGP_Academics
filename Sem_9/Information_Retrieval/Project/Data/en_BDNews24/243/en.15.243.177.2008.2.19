 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)--Bourses witnessed losses for a third day Tuesday amid merchant banks' reluctance to give loans and investors' continued confidence on mutual funds. Investors' confidence on mutual funds was rising as regulatory corrections left the prices of other scrips fluctuating, according to market watchers. "The market is getting more complicated influenced by regulatory moves and fluctuating prices of the so-called good issues as well. People are starting to find their investments safer with mutual funds," said Salahuddin Ahmed, chief executive of the Dhaka Stock Exchange.
