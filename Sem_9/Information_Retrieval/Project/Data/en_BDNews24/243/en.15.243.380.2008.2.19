<TITLE> Hundreds rally in Okinawa over US rape suspect </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Tokyo, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - About 300 women gathered on Japan's southern island of Okinawa on Tuesday to protest the suspected rape of a 14-year-old girl there by a US Marine, calling for US troops to leave, media reported. A 38-year-old Marine, Tyrone Hadnott, was arrested last Monday on suspicion of raping the girl in a car. He denied rape but admitted forcing her to kiss him, police have said. "Why do Okinawa's treasures, our children, have to be harmed like this," Yoko Higa of a women's group in Okinawa, was quoted by Kyodo news agency as saying at the rally. "I am so mad, fire is burning from my head. I demand that the bases leave now." Keiko Itokazu, an upper house lawmaker, also spoke out against the U.S. military presence in Okinawa. "This case prevents women and children from living here in peace," Kyodo quoted her as saying. "Let's work to have the U.S. troops -- they are not good neighbours -- leave Okinawa as soon as possible." The incident in Okinawa has revived memories of the rape of a 12-year-old girl on the island in 1995, which sparked huge protests against U.S. bases and raised concerns about damage to the broader security relationship. Okinawa plays host to the bulk of the some 50,000 U.S. troops based in Japan. Local residents often complain about the noise, crime and pollution associated with the bases. In events further angering residents, two Marines were arrested on the southern Japan island at the weekend, one accused of trespassing and the other of drink driving. Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Monday he would discuss ways to prevent such incidents with US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice when she visits Tokyo next week.
