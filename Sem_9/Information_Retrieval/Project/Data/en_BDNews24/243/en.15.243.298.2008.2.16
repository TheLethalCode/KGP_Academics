<TITLE> Proteas to take on BCB XI in tour opener Sunday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) - Visiting South Africa begin their month-long tour of Bangladesh taking on a strong Bangladesh Cricket Board XI in the lone warm-up three-day match at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium Sunday. Both teams will look to some batting practice ahead of two- Tests series between the Proteas and the Tigers with the BCB naming a strong warm-up squad comprising 13 test caps out of 15 members. But, no side has yet finalised their playing eleven, though Shakib Al Hasan will lead the home side. The Proteas will certainly look to cope with the subcontinent conditions and familiarise themselves with the slow and low wicket, on which Bangladesh plan to restrict them. South African coach Mickey Arthur said that his boys were concentrating on the three-dayer as they did not hope to get a bouncy wicket in the subcontinent. South Africa captain Graeme Smith, however, said that they had no wicket worry and they were much comfortable to play spin, especially in the longer version matches. The Proteas, however, get a little chance to play the spinner as the BCB XI has just included one specialist spinner, Enamul Haq Junior, on the warm-up side. BCB XI captain Shakib Al Hasan takes the match as a preparation for the batsmen ahead of the first Test, scheduled Feb 22-26 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. "It is a great chance for the players to have batting practice in the match as most of the warm-up squad players are also on the national side," said Shakib. "Our main concentration is to improve our batting performance and stick to the middle whether runs come or not," said the left-handed batsman. Warm-up squad: Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Shahriar Nafees, Nazim Uddin, Rajin Saleh, Aftab Ahmed, Mushfiqur Rahim (vice Captain), Enamul Haque Jr, Sajedul Islam, Talha Jubaer, Farhad Reza, Syed Rasel, Roqibul Hassan and Habibul Bashar. South Africa squad: Graeme Smith, Ashwell Prince, Hashim Amla, Johan Botha, Mark Boucher, AB de Villiers, Jean-Paul Duminy, Jacques Kallis, Neil McKenzie, Morne Morkel, Andre Nel, Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson and Dale Steyn.
