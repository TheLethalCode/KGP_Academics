<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)The Appellate Division Tuesday ordered a status quo until Feb 26 on a High Court verdict that declared the appointment of acting law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal illegal. Appellate Division chamber judge MA Matin passed the order after a brief hearing into an appeal of the government and Awal seeking a stay order on the HC verdict. The next hearing will take place at the regular bench of the Appellate Division on Feb 26. In a Monday verdict, the High Court declared illegal the appointment of Awal as acting law secretary and without legal authority on a writ petition filed by retired district judge Md Aftab Uddin. Awal, additional secretary of the law ministry, was appointed acting law secretary on June 28 last year. Aftab filed the petition on July 8 with the High Court challenging the validity of the appointment alleging irregularities in the appointment process. Additional attorney general Salauddin Ahmed represented the government and barrister Amir-ul Islam defended Awal in the hearing to move the prayer for the stay order on the HC verdict. If the High Court verdict is not stayed, activities at the law ministry will slow, the lawyers argued in court. On the writ petitioner's behalf, Ajmalul Haq QC opposed the appeal for a stay order on the HC verdict. bdnew
