 By Nopporn Wong-Anan BANGKOK, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thailand's new government set out its economic priorities on Monday, promising village handouts, cheap loans and a debt moratorium for the poor as it revived the populist policies of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects were given lower billing in the government's policy agenda unveiled for the first time in parliament on Monday. There was no mention of the capital controls which tarnished Thailand's investment reputation when they were imposed in late 2006 to rein in a surging baht. Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej, who said last week a review of the curbs would take 2 months, set 19 priorities for his six-party coalition government in its first year, most of them policies to spur domestic spending. "It is a government priority to enhance the grassroots economy so they have the potential to earn more and pay less," Samak told parliament in an apparent reference to rural Thais who gave his People Power Party the most seats in a December poll. Samak, 72, promised to boost cash handouts to villages for development projects, replace loan sharks with a state-owned "Peoples' Bank", forgive the debts of farmers and the poor, and build new homes for low-income earners in Bangkok. He did not estimate the cost of the programmes, which echo the policies that handed Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party landslide election victories in 2001 and 2005. Analysts worried that an excessive focus on domestic consumption could fuel inflation -- already at an 18-month high - and undermine efforts to curb the strength of the baht, now trading around 10-year highs. "Such grassroots stimulation plans will bring inflation," analyst Somyos Chamchoy of KasikornBank's research unit said. "The threat is inflation which will undermine the government's attempts to fight a strengthening baht". SEEKING SIGNALS The baht, which evolved into a two-tier market after controls were imposed in December 2006, was at 31.64 to the dollar in offshore trading on Monday after rising sharply from a five-month low of 32.70 last week. It was at 32.52 onshore at 0753 GMT on Monday. Analysts estimate that Thailand's economic growth slowed in 2007 to around 4.5 percent, the weakest pace in 6 years, following the bloodless military coup in 2006. They see a moderate pick up to about 4.8 percent growth this year. Samak said his government would "accelerate the country's key investment projects," delayed for two years by political strife. The list included more mass transit lines and possible airport expansions, Samak said, but economists want more details. "We want a clear signal on what the government will do with the mass transit project, which has been delayed for two years," an economist at a foreign bank said, referring to 9 promised new rail lines in the Thai capital. Samak offered few specifics, but he promised measures that are "conducive to stable economic growth by looking after inflation and the baht in line with economic conditions and market mechanisms". Some analysts expect the capital controls, which triggered the biggest one-day sell-off in Thai shares in late 2006, will not be removed completely until the second half of 2008 while the baht remains near 10-year highs, threatening key exports. Investors are also looking for clarity on the Foreign Business Act, which the previous military-appointed government attempted to tighten rules on foreign investment, but failed to get it passed into law. The parliamentary debate was due to end on Wednesd
