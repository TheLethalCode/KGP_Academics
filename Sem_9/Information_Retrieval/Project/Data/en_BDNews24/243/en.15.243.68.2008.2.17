 SYDNEY, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mitchell Johnson took three wickets as Australia defeated India by 50 runs in a low-scoring tri-series one-day international at Adelaide Oval on Sunday to move closer to a place in the tournament finals. India looked to have a great chance of winning when they restricted the Australians to 203 for nine but could only manage 153 in return as they were bowled out in the 42nd over. Johnson led the way while fellow paceman Nathan Bracken, all-rounder James Hopes and spinner Brad Hogg collected two each to help Australia snatch a bonus point for their big winning margin. Australia's victory lifted them to 17 points from five games. India remain in second place on eight points while Sri Lanka are at the bottom with six points but with a game in hand. "We all know we haven't played our best cricket yet, especially our batsmen, but we're at the top of the competition table," Australia captain Ricky Ponting said in a televised interview. "I think it's a good sign that we're winning games pretty comfortably when we're not playing at our best." Michael Clarke, who had to pass fitness test on a bruised rib just to play, was named man after the match after scoring 79 on a day when no other player got to 40. India all-rounder Irfan Pathan had earlier captured the prize scalps of Clarke, Matthew Hayden (13), Mike Hussey (5) and tailender Nathan Bracken (0) to finish with 4-41 and give his team real hope of winning. Ishant Sharma chipped in to dismiss dangermen Adam Gilchrist (15) and Andrew Symonds (3) cheaply to leave Australia reeling at 73-5 before the lower-order fired. Clarke shared a 72-run partnership with Hogg for the seventh wicket which only came unstuck when Hogg was run out for 32. Hopes also made a brisk 19 but none of Australia's other specialist batsmen made more than 15 as India's seamers made rapid inroads into the batting line-up. "I thought if we could get 220 tonight we'd have a good chance but fortunately we didn't need it," Clarke said. "Our bowlers did a great job tonight and we worked our backside off in the field and got a good result." India, who went into the match a batsan down after icking five specialist bowlers, made a dreadful start to their run chase when they crashed to 59-4 in the 16th over. Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (37) and Yuvraj Singh (26) steadied the innings with a fifth wicket stand of 56 but once they went the tail folded. "In the context of the tri-series we just have to go out there and do our best," Dhoni said. "I think our bowlers are up to the mark but it's time for the batsmen to do as well." India's next match is against Sri Lanka at Adelaide Oval on Tuesday while Australia's next game is against Sri Lanka in Melbourne on Friday
