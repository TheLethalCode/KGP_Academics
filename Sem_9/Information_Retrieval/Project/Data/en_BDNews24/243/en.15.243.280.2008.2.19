 HONG KONG, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks rose 1.5 percent in thin trade on Tuesday, tracking strong Asian markets, as Bank of China surged after its chairman said it had set aside enough provisions to cover its exposure to subprime credit. Outperforming Chinese financials and advancing resource shares backed by strong commodity prices pushed Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies to their highest close in two weeks. Investors shrugged off China's report that its annual consumer price inflation surged to 7.1 percent in January, the highest in more than 11 years, on the heels of fierce winter weather. "Investors believe that the Chinese government will not raise rates in the near term after the bad weather," said Patrick Shum, strategist at Karl-Thomson Securities. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 363.92 points at 24,123.17. The China Enterprises index of H shares , or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, gained 2.5 percent, or 342.69 points, to end at 13,972.94. For now, analysts said the market would continue to drift within a range, with 25,000 seen as the resistance level. "We're still directionless," said Daniel Chan, senior investment strategist at DBS Bank. "Every day, every week, the credit crunch continues. If the U.S. continues to be under pressure from subprime, Hong Kong will be under pressure." Mainboard turnover was HK$78.8 billion (US$10.1 billion), nearly even with Monday's HK$78.1 billion. FINANCIALS SURGE Bank of China was the day's most active stock and top blue chip gainer, up 7.8 percent at HK$3.3. Bank of China Chairman Xiao Gang also said the Chinese lender would report marked profit growth for 2007. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd vaulted 3.5 percent to HK$5.38. The country's top lender said on Monday its non-performing loan ratio had dropped further in 2007 due to enhanced risk controls. Bank of Communications gained 4.7 percent to HK$9.
