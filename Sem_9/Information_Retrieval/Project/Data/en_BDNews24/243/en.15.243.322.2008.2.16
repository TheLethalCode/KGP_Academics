 Dhaka, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com) -- The division status of five VIP detainees held in Dhaka Central Jail is under review after they were caught using mobile phones inside the jail, prison authorities said Saturday. The five detainees are barrister Nazmul Huda and wife Sigma Huda, former air vice-marshal Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, former planning minister Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and former lawmaker Salauddin Quader Chowdhury . "They may have their division revoked for using mobile phones inside their cells in violation of the jail code," inspector general of prisons Zakir Hassan told bdnews24.com. A court could hand down a sentence of imprisonment for the offence, he added. Hassan said prison authorities have sent a letter to the chief judicial magistrate asking for stern action to be taken against the five. "There is also the possibility that one or two other detainees have mobile phones. We are conducting surprise raids to find out," the prisons chief said. The IG said the five VIP detainees possibly acquired the mobile phones while being transferred to and from the court. "While they are in court it is often fairly relaxed and they can talk freely with many people." "On some occasions they are returned belatedly to jail after their court appearances. They could receive mobile phones at any stage of this process," he said. The caretaker government had arrested and detained all five on charges of corruption. Their cases are currently under trial. bdnews24.
