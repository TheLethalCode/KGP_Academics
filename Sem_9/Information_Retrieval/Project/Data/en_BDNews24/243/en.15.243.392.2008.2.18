<TITLE> Banks watch competitive threat from Northern Rock </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's government will within days take control of about 800,000 home loans and 1 million savings accounts after nationalising Northern Rock, creating a unique rival at a jittery time for UK banks. Banks will effectively be competing with UK Ltd. for months and maybe years -- raising concern they could be at a disadvantage in key savings and mortgage markets. "The business model that's put in place is absolutely crucial as far as the rest of the industry is concerned," a person in the banking industry said. "Are we talking about a Northern Rock that's effectively in run off or one that will compete for new business in savings and mortgages? There is some concern," he added. Ron Sandler is stepping in as Northern Rock's executive chairman and arrived in Newcastle on Monday to discuss his plans with management and staff. Sandler will have autonomy to take all operational and commercial decisions, but key issues such as the merits of a future private sale will inevitably be made with the bank's owner, the government. Sandler said his new strategy "will require returning the bank to a more sustainable size", but provided few details. European competition authorities will constrain what it is allowed to do, and may restrict its ability to pursue new mortgage lending. "Precisely what those constraints will be is not known," Sandler said, but added: "Within those constraints we will compete vigorously." Northern Rock is Britain's fifth-biggest mortgage provider, accounting for one in 13 home loans, after aggressively lending in a booming housing market in recent years. Against the backdrop of a slowing housing market Northern Rock is expected to shrink its assets to about half the size before the crisis, when they were 113 billion pounds ($220 billion). That could be achieved within two to three years as customers move to other lenders when current fixed rate deals expire, and be beneficial for other lenders, analysts said. FIGHT FOR SAVINGS Of more concern could be the market for retail savings, an area that banks are targeting more aggressively to fund business due to a rise in the cost of wholesale funding. Northern Rock suffered the first run on the deposits of a major UK bank for over 140 years when its funding crisis erupted in mid-September. Its retail deposits are estimated to have more than halved to about 10 billion pounds during its crisis. "This (nationalisation) means that Northern Rock's battered deposit franchise has a competitive advantage, particularly over the smaller banks (Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley) where consumers may perceive slightly higher risk," said James Invine, analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. The government already backs National Savings and Investments, which offers a range of savings products within a set framework. Share prices for UK banks rose on Monday, mostly on optimism ahead of 2007 results over the next two weeks and also because banks could benefit from the decline of Northern Rock's mortgage book, analysts said.
