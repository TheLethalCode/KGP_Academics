 Jakarta, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indonesia has banned some current and former top central bankers from travelling overseas as part of an investigation into a graft case, a senior immigration official told Reuters on Saturday. The country's graft-buster agency (KPK) is investigating a case in connection with a report from the Supreme Audit Agency, which found evidence that a foundation linked to Bank Indonesia had illegally paid members of parliament and funded legal assistance for top central bank officials. The director of immigration investigation and law enforcement, Syaiful Rachman, said his department has banned 16 current and former Bank Indonesia officials and a former parliament member from travelling overseas after a KPK request. The list includes former central bank governors, Sudrajad Djiwandono and Syahril Sabirin, and former deputy governor Aulia Pohan, the father-in-law of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's son. "The travel ban has been effective since Feb. 13 and is effective for one year," said Rachman. KPK's spokesman, Johan Budi, confirmed the agency's request to the immigration office. "In order to support the investigation process, they must remain in Indonesia. So anytime they are needed they are still here," Budi told Reuters. The immigration office on Feb. 1 had imposed overseas travel ban for three top central bank officials, including governor Burhanuddin Abdullah, who have been named as suspects for the graft case by KPK. Abdullah denied any wrongdoing, telling Reuters in an interview on Friday that he hoped to prove his innocence.
