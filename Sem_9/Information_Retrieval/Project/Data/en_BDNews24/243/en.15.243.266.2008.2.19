 GLASGOW, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona hope a change in fortune, the return of striker Samuel Eto'o and an improvement in Ronaldinho's form will help them beat Celtic in the first leg of their Champions League last 16 tie at Parkhead on Wednesday (1945 GMT). The Catalans rode their luck at the weekend to claim a 2-1 win at Real Zaragoza that allowed them to close to within five points of leaders Real Madrid. Thierry Henry looked to have controlled the ball with his arm when he opened the scoring, Zaragoza spurned a chance to equalise when they missed a penalty and Ronaldinho's winner came from a controversial spot kick seven minutes from time. "It's true that we had a bit of good fortune, but it was about time," said midfielder Xavi. "You also have to look for it and the team had a very positive attitude throughout the game." Ronaldinho started on the bench once again but showed a few promising touches when he came on and kept his cool with his superbly struck penalty. Eto'o, whose appearances in the Champions League this season have been limited to just one match because of injury, sat out the Zaragoza match after returning from the African Nations Cup but is in the squad for the Celtic clash. Barca have missed the Cameroon international's pace and more direct style of play and have been struggling to find the net in his absence. NO ILLUSIONS There have been no such problems for Celtic, who have racked up 13 goals in their last three outings including a 3-0 win over Hearts at the weekend. Celtic manager Gordon Strachan is under no illusions about the difficulty facing his side as they attempt to oust the 2006 winners from Europe's elite club competition. "We must accept there will be periods of the game when they will have the ability and will look comfortable," he was quoted as saying by Scottish Sunday newspapers. "We don't want to run around like headless chickens and be picked off." Midfielder Scott Brown is suspended and new signing Andreas Hinkel, who scored against Hearts, is ineligible having played for Sevilla earlier in the competition. It is Barca's second visit to Glasgow in the Champions League this season, having drawn 0-0 against Rangers at Ibrox in the group phase. Celtic can draw hope from their feat in knocking Barcelona out of the UEFA Cup at the last 16 stage in 2004, although the Catalans beat them 3-1 at Parkhead in the group stage of the Champions League the following season. Probable teams: Celtic: 1-Artur Boruc; 5-Gary Caldwell, 3-Lee Naylor, 44-Stephen McManus, 48-Darren O'Dea; 46-Aiden McGeady, 18-Massimo Donati, 19-Barry Robson, 25-Shunsuke Nakamura; 10-Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, 27-Scott McDonald. Barcelona: 1-Victor Valdes; 5-Carles Puyol, 3-Gabriel Milito, 4-Rafael Marquez, 22-Eric Abidal; 24-Yaya Toure, 20-Deco, 8-Andres Iniesta or 6-Xavi; 19-Lionel Messi, 14-Thierry Henry, 9-Samuel Eto'o.
