 LONDON, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Undefeated Italian champions Inter Milan moved 11 points clear of their rivals at the weekend while in France Olympique Lyon's advantage at the top of Ligue One was cut to a single point when Girondins Bordeaux thrashed Monaco 6-0. In England, the FA Cup competition lost Liverpool and Arsenal in the fifth round and in Spain the weekend results left only Real Madrid and Barcelona in serious contention for the Primera Liga title. ITALY Unbeaten champions Inter Milan went 11 points clear at the top of Serie A after David Suazo's brace sealed a 2-0 win over Livorno and second-placed AS Roma lost 1-0 at Juventus. Juve, now a point behind Roma in third, won the weekend's big game when Alessandro Del Piero arrowed in a free kick just before halftime. AC Milan could manage only a 0-0 draw at Parma. Although they moved into fourth on Saturday, Fiorentina snatched back the Champions League qualifying spot on Sunday when Adrian Mutu's superb winner secured a 2-1 win over Catania. ENGLAND Chelsea and Manchester United, who met in last season's FA Cup final with the London club winning 1-0, reached the quarter-finals on Saturday with ease. Chelsea beat League One (third division) side Huddersfield Town 3-1 while United crushed Arsenal 4-0. Liverpool were upset 2-1 at Anfield by Barnsley, who are in mid-table in the Championship (second division). Only half the teams going into Monday's last-eight draw are from the Premier League and Middlesbrough have yet to win their tie, having been held 0-0 by Championship side Sheffield United with a replay at home set for Feb. 23. Portsmouth had a stoppage-time own goal to thank for a 1-0 win against Preston North End, who are fighting to avoid relegation to League One. SPAIN Barcelona closed to within five points of Real Madrid at the top of the Primera Liga after a controversial 2-1 win at Real Zaragoza on Saturday while Real Madrid slumped to a 2-1 defeat at Real Betis. Barcelona substitute Ronaldinho fired home from the penalty spot seven minutes from time after Zaragoza defender Juanfran was adjudged to have handled the ball. Thierry Henry looked to have controlled the ball with his hand when he scored Barca's opener while Zaragoza striker Diego Milito missed a penalty late in the first half. Real Madrid started strongly against struggling Betis with midfielder Royston Drenthe putting them in front early on, but Betis turned the tables on the leaders with two quickfire headers in the space of four minutes. With Villarreal drawing 0-0 at home to Racing Santander and Atletico Madrid going down 2-1 at home to Athletic Bilbao, the title race has effectively boiled down to a two-horse race. Real lead the table on 56 points and Barca follow on 51. Villarreal are now eight points further back on 43. GERMANY Luca Toni struck a hat-trick to give Bayern Munich a 3-0 win away to Hanover 96 on Sunday, keeping the Bavarians three points clear of closest rivals Werder Bremen. Bayern were struggling to make headway against Hanover before Toni pounced on a headed through ball from Mark van Bommel and scored on the turn. The Italian stroked in the second and headed in the third to make it 13 league goals this season and keep Werder at arm's length after their 2-0 win at home to Nuremberg on Saturday. Hamburg SV moved up to third place, a further three points behind, when they won 3-0 at home to Bochum on Sunday. FRANCE Second-placed Girondins Bordeaux thrashed Monaco 6-0 on Sunday to close the gap on Ligue 1 leaders Olympique Lyon to one point. Argentine forward Fernando Cavenaghi and playmaker Johan Micoud contributed to the demolition with two goals each. Lyon, chasing a seventh consecutive title, slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Le Mans on Saturday in their last warm-up before welcoming Manchester United in the Champions League on Wednesday. NETHERLANDS PSV Eindhoven registered a little-deserved 1-0 victory at neighbours Willem II Tilburg, with Timmy Simons converting an 84th-minute penalty, to stay nine points clear at the top of the Dutch league with nine matches remaining. Johnny Heitinga and Kenneth Perez hit doubles to inspire Ajax Amsterdam to a 6-2 win over Sparta Rotterdam and second place as Heerenveen were held to a 2-2 draw by Heracles Almelo and slipped to fifth. Feyenoord and NAC Breda had 1-0 wins over Vitesse Arnhem and Graafschap Doetinchem respectively to stay level on points with Ajax. Jonathan de Guzman scored for Feyenoord, while Rogier Molhoek's 75th-minute goal earned Breda the three points
