<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  The government Monday filed a petition with the Appellate Division seeking approval to move against the High Court verdict that dismissed an extortion case against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina's lawyers immediately urged the Appellate Division to stay any hearing on the government's petition, which seeks a motion for "leave to appeal". Leave to appeal is sought from the Appellate Division to set in motion a case in which the High Court handed down a verdict. A full bench of the Appellate Division is set to hear the appeal Tuesday against the High Court's dismissal of the Tk 3 crore extortion case filed by businessman Azam J Chowdhury against the former prime minister. The Supreme Court on Feb 12 halted the proceedings of an interim appeal by the government against the verdict. Instead of ruling as expected after a morning hearing, the apex court asked the government to file a regular appeal by Feb 19. Deputy attorney general Zahirul Islam Mukul told bdnews24.com Monday: "A petition for leave-to-appeal has been filed with the related department of the Supreme Court against the HC verdict in the extortion case against Sheikh Hasina." Mukul, acting for the government, said the appeal would be placed at a full bench of the Appellate Division Tuesday. He said that lawyers on behalf of Hasina, however, had filed a motion to stay the hearing on the government appeal. Hasina's lawyer Fazle Nur Taposh said they had sought time from the court as Hasina's senior counsel Rafique-ul-Huq was visiting his ailing brother abroad. Barrister Rafiq is expected home on Feb 24. Barrister Fazle added that although the government had filed a petition for leave-to-appeal, Hasina's defence had not received a copy of the document. On Feb 6, the High Court dismissed the extortion case filed by Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, and ruled that trying the charges under emergency powers rules was illegal. Azam Chowdhury filed the extortion case on June 13 last year against Sheikh Hasina and her cousin Sheikh Selim. The case was brought under emergency powers rules on July 16, the day Hasina was arrested. bdnews24.
