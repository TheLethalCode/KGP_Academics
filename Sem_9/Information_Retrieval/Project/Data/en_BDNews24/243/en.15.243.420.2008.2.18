 Cairo, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest opposition movement, is the target of a detention campaign by Egyptian police and says the aim is to disrupt Islamist preparations for local elections now scheduled for April 8. Here are some facts about the Muslim Brotherhood, often cited as a model for Islamist movements in Arab countries. -- Charismatic schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna founded the Brotherhood in the Suez Canal town of Ismailia in 1928, partly in response to the British occupation of Egypt. It was one of the first and most successful movements advocating Islam as a political programme in a modern context. Within 20 years the movement had grown to have more than 100,000 members, with several branch movements in other Arab countries. -- The Brotherhood once had a secret paramilitary section but it now says it is committed to promoting its policies through non-violent and democratic means. The Egyptian government, which sees the Brotherhood as the greatest threat to its survival, has failed to prove any serious act of violence by the Brotherhood leadership for more than 50 years. -- Brotherhood leaders argue that after social and economic reforms and given the freedom to choose most Egyptians would willingly embrace a form of Islamic law. -- The government has repeatedly denied the Brotherhood the right to form a political party, arguing that the constitution, which the government wrote, bans religious parties. The Brotherhood in turn has said it will not seek recognition as a party under procedures which it rejects as authoritarian. -- The government banned the Brotherhood in 1954 after accusing the group of trying to assassinate President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a charge the Brotherhood has always denied. A long period of repression began to ease under President Anwar Sadat in the 1970s. The ban formally remains in place but the Brotherhood operates openly within limits that vary at the whim of the authorities. It has an office in Cairo and its members can stand in elections without disguising their affiliation. -- In the parliamentary elections of 2005, which took place under U.S. pressure for political liberalisation, members won one fifth of the seats in parliament, more than any opposition group has held since the overthrow of the monarchy in 1952. -- In the absence of systematic polling in Egypt, no one has a clear idea how much popularity the Brotherhood enjoys. But the group does have an extensive and well-organised network of committed organisers and has won public support through the charitable work of its professional members. They are also influential in professional organisations such as the doctors' and lawyers' syndicates. -- Government and ruling party officials have been looking for legal ways to reduce the political role of the Brotherhood, official sources say. But in the absence of a workable plan, the government has relied on the police to disrupt the movement's activities. Members can expect to be detained for long periods without trial or charge, especially when elections are imminent. -- About 450 members of the Brotherhood are now in custody, most of them held over the last few weeks. -- The Brotherhood's main foreign ally is the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas, which has its origins in the group's Palestinian branch. While non-violent at home, the Brotherhood approves of violence against Israel, arguing that jihad is a just response to the occupation of Palestinian territory.
