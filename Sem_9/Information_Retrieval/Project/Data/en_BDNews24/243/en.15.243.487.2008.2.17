 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government is looking to develop Chittagong into a 'world standard port, world standard city' by 2008, an adviser said Sunday. A ministerial meeting is scheduled for Feb 19 at the Chittagong Circuit House to identify the hurdles to transforming the city into a commercial capital and prompting port development, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman told a delegation of Chittagong Journalists' Forum, Dhaka in his office. "The government has initiated plans to make Chittagong a commercial capital and develop port activities by 2008, with the slogan 'world standard port, world standard city'," he said. "Other cities of the world with major ports are of international standard. But Chittagong still remains provincial," Zillur said. Development projects in Chittagong, including tackling water-logging in the port city, and recovering illegally occupied land of the Chittagong Development Authority, are underway, he assured. "A taskforce will be directed to recover those lands," the adviser said speaking of the illegal occupation. Development plans are also being finalised on various national initiatives to expand trade and commerce countrywide, the adviser added. These include raising Biman Bangladesh Airlines to international standards, establishing integrated road networks with Myanmar and automating customs processes. bdnew
