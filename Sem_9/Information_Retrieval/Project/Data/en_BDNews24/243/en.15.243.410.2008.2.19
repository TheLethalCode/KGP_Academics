 MANILA, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Philippine military has exhumed what it believes is the body of Dulmatin, an Indonesian militant wanted for the 2002 Bali bombings that killed over 200 people. "His body was recovered yesterday afternoon," Major General Ben Dolorfino, the marine commandant, said on Tuesday. "We are conducting DNA tests to confirm." The tests, which will be carried out by the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, will take around two weeks to complete. Washington has offered a $10 million bounty for Dulmatin, a leading member of Jemaah Islamiah (JI). JI is a Southeast Asian Islamic militant network blamed for a number of attacks, including the Bali blasts. Dolorfino said an informant led them to the body, which was dug up in Tawi-tawi, the southernmost tip of the Philippine archipelago. "Based on the description of the informant, he suffered gunshots in the head, chest and right foot," Dolorfino said. Dulmatin, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, has eluded the Philippine military and its U.S. advisers for years, although security forces found his wife in 2006 and their children the following year in a rebel hideout in the Philippine south. They have since been deported to Indonesia. If Dulmatin is dead it would be another major blow for JI, which has seen many of its leaders and supporters killed or captured by Indonesian security forces. A handful of JI members are believed to be operating in the southern Philippines and on Tuesday the military paraded an Indonesian national it said was a JI operative and part of Dulmatin's group. General Hermogenes Esperon, the military chief, said Mohamad Baehaqi, alias Latif, was arrested on Feb. 17 and was linked to bombings in 2006 which killed 20 people. "He was arrested with two Filipino companions in a Muslim rebel hideout," Esperon said, adding a rifle, a shotgun, a pistol, bomb-making materials and notes in Arabic and Bahasa were also seized. Dulmatin was believed to have fled to the southern Philippines in 2003 with Umar Patek, another JI member, after both were implicated in the Bali blasts, which killed mainly Australian tourists holidaying on the resort island. Dulmatin was reported injured in a clash with the military on January 31 when they raided his hideout. Both Dulmatin and Patek have been working with members of Abu Sayyaf, a Philippine group responsible for the bombing of a ferry close to Manila in 2004 that killed over 100 people in the Philippines' worst terrorist attack. Foreign Islamic militants have a history of helping to train militant Muslims in the southern Philippines, a largely Catholic country, in bomb-making techniqu
