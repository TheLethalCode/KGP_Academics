 NEW YORK (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Women seeking to advance in their careers should work hard and cultivate an image of extreme competence and professionalism. Right? Wrong, says Nina DiSesa, the first woman to become chairman of McCann Erickson New York, the flagship office of global advertising agency McCann Erickson. Instead, she advises women who want to overtake men in the race for the inner circle of business to use the arts of seduction and manipulation, or, as she puts it, S&M. "S&M is not about sex!" DiSesa told Reuters. "The art of S&M is about getting what we want and what we deserve in a man's world." DiSesa presents her unorthodox business approach, as well as a behind-the-scenes' view of the world of big advertising, in her first book, "Seducing the Boys Club -- Uncensored Tactics from a Woman at the Top" (Ballantine Books). According to her, the fun, high-paying, place at the top of most companies is usually unfriendly to women. But fortunately it is just a boys club that can be broached by feminine technique. "Business is not a level playing field for men and women. No matter how much we hate to hear it, it's still true," she said. "We can ignore that fact, or we can use whatever we've got to overcome the double standard." DiSesa contends that women tend to deal well with their fathers, brothers, friends, lovers and husbands, but when women deal with men in the workplace they treat them differently. And they tend to lose. "Manipulation is simply a way to deal effectively with the men in our business life and doing it in a way that makes them like us, trust us and ultimately promote us," she said. "Women tend to forget in the workplace that if a man doesn't like her or trust her, he usually won't back her up. No matter how talented she is." Women on their way to the top need to master the art of becoming "benevolent manipulators" of their environment, she says. Example? Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's emotional and teary-eyed speech ahead of winning the Democratic primary elections in New Hampshire in January. "It worked! She won the primary in New Hampshire, didn't she?," DiSesa said. "That's classic S&M." Tears should signal passion, commitment and humanity, and not weakness, she said. But more importantly, women should meld so-called feminine characteristics -- nurturing, compassion, listening -- with the traits of their male counterparts: competitiveness, decisiveness and combativeness. "Women have a couple of great advantages when they start out," said DiSesa. "Their ability to 'read a room' during important meetings for example, it's way better than most guys'." Unlike the average man, women lack decisiveness and are so afraid of making a mistake that they often suffer from decision-anxiety, she writes. On top of that, women believe it's good to multi-task, while men tend to concentrate on one thing at time, which can be more effective in business. Perhaps more controversially, DiSesa writes that women can lack a sense of humor, fail to keep bringing in money in the long run, and can become stubborn once they've climbed a couple of steps in the corporate ladder. "Many women get drunk with power, get arrogant, stubborn, bitchy and forget that in the end she has to keep making money for the company -- that's the greatest power of all," she said. "Make money and you win, always." She accepts that many women are likely to resent her advice. "Young women will probably hate it," she said. "But once they're in their mid-30's and getting nowhere past middle management, they'll wish they'd read it sooner."
