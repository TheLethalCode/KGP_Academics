 Islamabad, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Twenty-one people were killed in Pakistan on Saturday in a suspected suicide bomb blast near the office of an election candidate supported by assassinated opposition leader Benazir Bhutto's party, an official said. The campaign for Monday's general election has been overshadowed by security fears, especially after former prime minister Bhutto was killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack on Dec. 27. "It's a very bad situation. Bodies are lying everywhere but we have not yet counted them," Muneer Hussain Bangash, a doctor in the main government hospital in the northwestern town of Parachinar, told Reuters. An intelligence official in the region said 21 people had been killed and the toll could rise. A resident of the town, in the Kurram region on the Afghan border, said the explosion occurred as the candidate's supporters were going into his office after a rally. He said he saw limbs scattered on the ground. Witnesses said the blast appeared to have been caused by a suicide car bomber who rammed his vehicle into the crowd outside the candidate's office. Saturday is the final day of the election campaign. Sunday is a cooling-off day. The government has deployed more than 80,000 troops for the vote.
