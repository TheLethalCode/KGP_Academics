 Dar Es Salaam, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W. Bush arrived in Tanzania on Saturday after pushing for a power-sharing deal to solve the bloody political crisis in neighbouring Kenya. Bush arrived from Benin to begin the second and longest leg of a five-nation African tour that will also take him to Rwanda, Ghana and Liberia. He will not visit Kenya, which is torn by the worst crisis in its history following a disputed election, but is sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice there on Monday.
