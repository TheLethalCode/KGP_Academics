 Ismailia, Egypt, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian police shot and killed an Eritrean women trying to sneak across Egypt's border into Israel on Saturday after she disobeyed orders to stop, security sources said. Murfit Meery, 37, was trying to cross into Israel in the El Kuntilla region in the eastern part of the Sinai peninsula, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Her daughters aged 8 and 10, travelling with her, were taken into custody. Sinai is the main route for traffickers trying to take mainly African migrants into the Jewish state for work or asylum.
