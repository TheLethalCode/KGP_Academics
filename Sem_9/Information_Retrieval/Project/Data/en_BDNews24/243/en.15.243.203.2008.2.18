 Kathmandu, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three ethnic groups from Nepal's southern plains threatened on Monday to boycott this year's polls for a constituent assembly if a string of demands including regional autonomy was not addressed before the vote. The government and Maoist former rebels have set April 10 for the elections for the national assembly expected to prepare a new constitution and formally declare an end to the nearly 240-year-old monarchy. The vote is the centrepiece of the 2006 peace deal with the Maoists, allowing the former rebels join the political mainstream. But the ethnic groups from the southern plains say the pact had failed to address the demands of the Madheshis and violent protests in the plains have clouded the peace pact. The plains, known as the Terai, are home to nearly half of the country's 26 million people. Many Madheshis want the region to become a largely autonomous state within Nepal, and they are calling for a greater say in the running of the central government. "We want meaningful elections which are not possible in the existing atmosphere in the Terai without addressing our demands," said Mahanta Thakur, coordinator of the United Democratic Madheshi Front of three protesting groups. "If the elections are held without solving the problem there is no meaning to such polls," he told reporters. STRIKE Ethnic groups launched an indefinite strike in the region last week to press for their demands that also include electoral reforms for greater representation in the national assembly and more jobs in the government and army. The strike has halted fuel supplies that pass from India into Nepal, while the closure of shops, factories and roads has resulted in the shortage of essential goods. In the capital Kathmandu, which is outside the Terai, food prices have risen and there are long queues for fuel. On Sunday, police fired on Madheshi protesters who pelted them with stones in a town in southwest Nepal, killing a demonstrator. It was the first fatal clash since the strike began. At least 45 people were killed in similar street protests last year. But Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala has vowed to press ahead with the elections, Nepal's first national vote since 1999, despite the crisis. Earlier, Upendra Yadav, chief of the Madheshi People's Rights Forum, which organised most of last year's protests, warned the restive region could see more tension if the polls were forced on the Terai. "Armed groups will get a space to play and a secessionist movement could develop," Yadav told Reuters.
