Oct 24 - UN Security Council agrees to talks on Kosovo's future, mediated by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari. Jan 21, 2006 - Rugova dies of lung cancer. April 3, 2007 - With no compromise in sight, Ahtisaari proposes independence supervised by the European Union. June 7 - At a G8 summit in Germany, Russia makes clear it will veto a draft UN resolution circulated by Western powers.
