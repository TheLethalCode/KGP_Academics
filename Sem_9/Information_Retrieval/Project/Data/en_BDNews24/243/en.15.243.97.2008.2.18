 KANDAHAR, Afghanistan, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeting a foreign military convoy in Afghanistan killed 35 people in an attack near the Pakistan border on Monday, a provincial governor said. The attack, a day after more than 100 people were killed in the deadliest suicide raid since the Taliban were overthrown in 2001, comes as some Western politicians call for a stronger resolve to stop Afghanistan sliding back into anarchy.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she saw no need to change parliamentary mandates that set limits on the number of troops her government can send to Afghanistan despite mounting pressure from NATO allies. "We are not changing the mandates as they are at the moment," Merkel told reporters. "I see no need for a change at the moment." Germany, which has roughly 3,300 troops in Afghanistan, is under pressure from allies, particularly the United States, to send additional soldiers and shift them from the north to the more-dangerous south to help battle Taliban insurgents. The main mandate, due to expire in October, allows Germany to send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to Afghanistan. German media have reported Merkel's government seeks to increase the number of troo
