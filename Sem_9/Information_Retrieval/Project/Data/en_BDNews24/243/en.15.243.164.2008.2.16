<TEXT>
 Cotondu, Feb 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Saturday the United States wanted to see a power sharing agreement in Kenya to end the post-election conflict that has killed 1,000 people in the East African state. Bush, who began a five-nation visit to Africa on Saturday, is sending Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to Kenya to back mediation efforts between the government and opposition coordinated by former United Nations chief Kofi Annan. "In terms of Condi's visit, the key is that the leaders hear from her first hand that the United States desires to see that there be no violence and that there be a power sharing agreement that will help this nation resolve its difficulties. That's what diplomacy is," Bush told reporters after arriving in the West African state of Benin.
