 KARACHI, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani shares gained more than 3 percent and the rupee steadied off six-year lows on Tuesday on relief the country's general election had passed with less violence than feared and without allegations of rigging. While concerns about the prospect of further upheavals lingered after opponents of President Pervez Musharraf won most of the votes, investors were happy opposition parties were unlikely to dispute the result or call for street protests. The prospect of clashes on the streets and risk of a confrontation with the army had been investors' worst-case scenario. "I think the markets are seeing a rally now that the uncertainty is over," said Sakib Sherani, chief economist at ABN AMRO Pakistan. "The market is also anticipating that a lot of foreign investors, who were on the sidelines and waiting for this uncertainty to be over, will now jump in," he said. The Karachi Stock Exchange's benchmark 100-share index ended up 3.1 percent at 14,797.47 points, little more than 100 points off its October record high. The rupee firmed after falling to its lowest level in more than six years last week, trading below 63 to the dollar. On Monday, international credit rating agency Standard & Poor's included Pakistan in a list of countries whose sovereign ratings faced risks on account of political stability and weak policy environment.

No party is expected to win a majority in the 342-seat National Assembly but the opposition parties of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, were set to be the biggest. "If we get a parliament that is hostile towards Musharraf, than the celebrations could be very short-lived," said Shuja Rizvi, director of broking operations at Capital One Equities. "But the market would think of that in the second phase. The holding of peaceful elections is no less an achievement, and could push the market to record highs," he said. The chance that a national government will emerge was a positive, even if it meant the end of Musharraf, who came to power in a coup in 1999. Business people have been happy with Musharraf for most of the last eight years as the economy was transformed from near bankrupt to one of the fastest growing economies in the world. But Musharraf's moves to impose emergency rule and purge the judiciary last year created growing uncertainty in the business community, holding back investment decisions. Shamim Ahmed Shamsi, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said "it would be would be wonderful" if the two main opposition parties could join hands to form a government, along with other smaller parties. "If that's the situation, then the business prospects will get better as peace would prevail in the country," he sa
