 Dhaka, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com)  Opener Junaed Siddique struck a clean century as the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI responded well on the second day of the warm-up three-dayer against visitors South Africa at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium Monday. The BCB XI were 263 for five at stumps, still trialing by 134 runs after South Africa amassed a monumental 397 all out riding on two centuries from Mark Boucher and Hashim Amla. Skipper Shakib Al Hasan (20) and Roqibul Hasan (12) resume the third and final day Tuesday looking to some more batting practice ahead of the two- Test- series between Bangladesh and South Africa, beginning Feb 22. Junaed hardly faced any trouble from the Proteas bowlers before he gave a return catch to Makhaya Ntini for 103, leaving the side at 227 for four. The left-handed opener, who drove Morne Morkel for a four to reach his hundred, clubbed 15 fours facing 168 balls. Junaed and Shahriar Nafees put up a fine 58-run opening start before pacers Makhaya Ntini and Morne Morkel struck blows in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 66 for two. Ntini had Nafees (31 off 37 balls) caught behind by keeper Boucher while Morkel took Rajin Saleh (7 off 22 balls) in same way behind the wicket. Junaed pairing with Nazimuddin and Aftab Ahmed kept the Proteas bowlers at bay. He added 76 runs with Nazimuddin (22) for the third wicket and another 85 runs for the fourth wicket with Aftab before being caught and bowled by Ntini in the 54.3 overs. Eight balls later, Aftab also returned to the dressing room after being trapped lbw by Morkel for 45. Morkel and Ntini took two wickets each got 48 and 65. Earlier, South Africa having resumed batting on 329 for eight added another 68 runs losing remaining wickets as Boucher pushed his overnight score to hundred. Boucher, who resumed on 64, sent spinner Enamul Haq Junior over the long-on to reach his hundred after Hashim Alam shone on the first day to make 103. The wicketkeeper-cum-batsman remained unbeaten on 107 off 164 balls when Ntini was the last batsman out for 11. Boucher hammered 14 fours and two sixes staying 218 minutes on the pitch. Enamul broke the ninth wicket between overnight pair Boucher and Dale Steyn, who gave a catch to Syed Rasel at mid-wicket for 32 after resuming on 19. Boucher and Steyn shared a significant 91-run partnership after the Proteas struggled to 274 for eight on the first day. Left-arm spinner Enamul raised his wicket tally to three for 93. Farhad Hossain and Rasel grabbed three and two for 73 and 106. bdnews
