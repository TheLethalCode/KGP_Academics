 Patuakhali, Feb 19 (bdnews24.com)  The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, called on all Tuesday to work together for the development of the country. "We have tackled the devastating cyclone, Sidr, jointly. If we work together we will be able to make Bangladesh a developed country," the army chief said while opening a Fishermen's Rehabilitation Project at Kalapara upazila in Patuakhali. Moeen said that the army would remain beside the affected people until their rehabilitation was complete. He said that the army was able to keep its vow that no person would die for want of food, water and treatment. The army relief fund has received Tk 26.05 crore in donations so far, Moeen said. All the money would be sent to the affected people, he pledged. Moeen said that all establishments, including mosques, should be built in cyclone-prone regions so that people shelter there during natural disasters. He thanked members of the armed forces for their efforts in the battered areas. The army chief distributed over 20 trawlers and boats among 55 families in Patuakhali. The FRP will provide 400 trawlers and boats to the affected fishermen that would, in turn, help 10,000 fisher families, he added. bdnews24.c
