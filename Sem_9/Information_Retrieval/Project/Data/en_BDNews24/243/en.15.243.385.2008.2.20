<TEXT>
 New York, Feb 20 (Billboard) - Irish rockers U2 have hit the studio in Dublin to continue work on their next studio album with longtime collaborators Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois. "We're going to try and break new sonic ground and deliver a masterpiece," Lanois told Billboard.com. "The sleeves are rolled up. Bono is all charged up with a lyrical angle." U2, Eno and Lanois have spent time working on new material on three prior occasions in France and Morocco. "There's so much material," he said, referring to speculation that the sessions could yield two new albums. "When you get Eno and I and those guys in the room, before lunch there's like eight things." There's no date yet for the project, which will be the follow-up to 2004's "How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb," which won the Grammy for album of the year
