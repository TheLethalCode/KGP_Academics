 TEHRAN, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday technical reasons were behind the delay in talks between Iranian and US officials on Iraq and denied new US charges that Tehran was stoking violence in its neighbour. Tehran on Thursday postponed what would have been a fourth round of talks. The move has prompted Washington to question Tehran's commitment to dialogue. Washington accuses Iran of destabilising Iraq.

In response to Satterfield's comments, Hosseini said Iran "has had no hand in the unrest in Iraq, there are no pieces of evidence in this regard".
