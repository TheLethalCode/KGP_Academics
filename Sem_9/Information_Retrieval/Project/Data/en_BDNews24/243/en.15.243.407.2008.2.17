<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com)Representatives of a Romanian recruiting agency met with foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury Sunday to discuss sending Bangladeshi workers to the east-European country. Antoneo Gamba and Christina Curpanaru from Ware Company met the adviser in his office to seek governmental assistance. "Bangladesh is the first country in Asia to export manpower to Romania," Iftekhar told reporters after the meeting. Iftekhar, also the expatriates' welfare and overseas employment adviser, said the export of workers to Romania would lead to an expanded labour market throughout Eastern Europe. "More than 100 skilled workers have already gone to Romania, and a further 1,000 will soon go," the adviser said. Christina Curpanaru said the Bangladeshi workers would be paid in line with Romania's salary structure.
