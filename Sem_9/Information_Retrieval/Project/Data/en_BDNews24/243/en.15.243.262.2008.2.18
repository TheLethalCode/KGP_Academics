 United Nation, Feb 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven Western countries said the UN Security Council could not agree on the future of Kosovo, which declared independence on Sunday, and the region's security and stability must be assured through the European Union and NATO. "We regret that the Security Council cannot agree on the way forward, but this impasse has been clear for many months," Belgian Ambassador Johan Verbeke said in a statement on behalf of Belgium, France, Italy, Britain, Croatia, Germany and the United States. "Today's events ... represent the conclusion of a status process that has exhausted all avenues in pursuit of a negotiated outcome," he said after a meeting of the 15-nation council called by Russia. Council president Ambassador Ricardo Alberto Arias of Panama confirmed to journalists that the differences of opinion between the West, which favors accepting Kosovo independence, and Russia, which wants to block it, "remain basically the same". The Western statement said the status quo in Kosovo "had become unsustainable and a coordinated and stable process, with international support is better than prolonged instability". It said a nine-year-old UN resolution provided the framework for transition to "a sustainable new status" for Kosovo -- a position contested by Russia, which says the resolution requires the United Nations to nullify an independence declaration. "We are determined to take up our own responsibilities, as states and through the EU and NATO, to secure stability and security in the region," the Western statement said
