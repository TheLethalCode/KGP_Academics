Australia had been scheduled to tour from March 10, playing three tests, five one-day internationals and a twenty20 match. However, a joint statement by both cricket boards on Tuesday said: "Subject to the appropriate security clearance, and by mutual consent, the tour would be compressed and will be played tentatively between March 29 and April 27". Cricket Australia (CA) will send a security delegation to Pakistan in early March to assess the venues and security arrangements, the statement added. "I am glad that we had very open and fruitful discussions with CA where we were assured that CA was committed to touring Pakistan," said Shafqat Naghmi, chief operating officer of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
