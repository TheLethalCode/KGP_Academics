 BAGHDAD, Feb 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Negotiations to free a CBS News journalist seized in the southern Iraqi city of Basra a week ago are being held up over discussions about how he should be released, a leading Shia militia group said on Sunday. The British journalist, who has not been named, and his interpreter were seized from a hotel in the centre of Basra last week. The interpreter was freed on Wednesday and negotiators had been confident the journalist would also be quickly released.

Last August, Sadr, who led two uprisings against US forces in 2004, ordered his followers to observe a six-month ceasefire. However the US military says rogue elements, which it accuses Iran of supporting, have ignored the freeze. The journalist for the US network CBS is the latest member of the media to have been caught up in the violence that has engulfed Iraq since the US-led invasion. In August 2005, Steve Vincent, a freelance U.S. journalist was found shot dead in Basra four days after he wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times criticising the spread of Shia Islamist fundamentalism in the city. The Committee to Protect Journalists has called the Iraq war "the deadliest conflict for journalists in recent history," with 126 journalists and 50 support workers killed since 20
