<TITLE> Roddick into Melbourne semis after Djokovic quits </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Novak Djokovic's defence of his Australian Open title ended abruptly on Tuesday when the Serb retired from his quarter-final against Andy Roddick midway through the fourth set. American Roddick had been leading 6-7 6-4 6-2 2-1 when a visibly distressed Djokovic, who had been eating and consuming energy drinks throughout the match played under a scorching afternoon sun, said he could no longer continue. The temperature in Melbourne steadily increased throughout the day and was 36 degrees Celsius when the contest ended. "I had cramping and soreness in the whole body," Djokovic told reporters. "I think the people could see that I was struggling with movement. "I couldn't serve the way I served in the first two sets. That third set I just started dropping 20, 30 kilometers per hour first serve. "Obviously it was much easier for him to return. "He saw that longer rallies are not comfortable for me at that point, so he was using it wisely. "(It was a) really unfortunate way to end my Australian Open 2009. I really tried my best, but sometimes you can't fight against your own body." MEDICAL TIME-OUT The writing was on the wall for the 21-year-old Djokovic once he had called a medical time-out in the third set after he had struggled to hold serve for a 2-1 lead. He received treatment on his right leg, neck and shoulders but looked exhausted when play resumed and lost the next five games. Roddick held four break points in the first game of the fourth set and while Djokovic battled back to hold serve it may have sapped any semblance of energy he had left, as the seventh seed won the next two games. The third-seeded Djokovic then walked off court, consulted the doctor and told chair umpire Carlos Ramos of Portugal "no more", before he went to congratulate Roddick. "I didn't know what was going on, if it was an injury or cramps," Roddick told reporters. "He just said the heat was a little much and he was starting to cramp a little bit. "I said, 'I'm sorry that you didn't get a proper chance to defend' (and) I told him I had a lot of respect for him." Roddick advanced to his fourth Melbourne Park semi-final and will be aiming to reach his first final when he meets either second seed Roger Federer or Argentina's Juan Martin Del Potro. STARTED WELL Djokovic had begun the match well, with neither man able to break serve, though the third seed was dictating the exchanges and forcing Roddick deep beyond the baseline. The Serb dominated the tiebreak, racing out a 4-0 lead, which he was able to hold on to seal the set with a forehand winner in 49 minutes. Roddick, however, seized the initiative in the second set when he broke Djokovic following a protracted rally that he ended with a smash after both men had scrambled around the court. The 26-year-old American held one set point in the ninth game, which Djokovic saved, before Roddick served out to love to tie the match. Roddick broke Djokovic in the first game of the third set and while Djokovic broke back immediately, any fight he had left drained away in the third game. The last men's grand slam champion to quit while defending his title was Pat Rafter at the 1999 U.S. Open. Rafter retired in the fifth set of his first round match against Cedric Pioline
