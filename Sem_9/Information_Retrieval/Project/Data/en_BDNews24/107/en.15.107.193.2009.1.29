"They then rushed him to hospital in a patrol vehicle, but could not save his life." Around 60 million Indians in Tamil Nadu have strong historical and cultural ties with Tamils in Sri Lanka. They have been protesting the Sri Lankan government's offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). After a series of major victories, Sri Lankan troops have cornered the LTTE in a shrinking patch of jungle and are fighting to finish one of Asia's longest-running wars. But humanitarian agencies say about 250,000 civilians are trapped in the cross-fire. The death in Tamil Nadu came amid other protests in the state against the Sri Lanka government. Some students went on a hunger strike on Thursday, and in other towns traders shut down shops to protest against the military action in Sri Lanka. Tamil Nadu's ruling party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, is one of the pillars of the ruling Congress coalition and it has pressured the government to act to save Sri Lankan Tamils.
