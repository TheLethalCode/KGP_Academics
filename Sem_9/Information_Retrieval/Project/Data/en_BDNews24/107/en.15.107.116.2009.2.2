 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) The BNP's efforts to gear up the party will bring grassroots functionaries to the capital for crucial meetings with central leaders, the party's policymakers decided on Sunday. The standing committee formed six committees, each headed by a joint secretary general, to conduct the discourse with thana or upazila level leaders, and gave them less than a month to come up with reports. "We discussed ways to reorganise the party," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters after a meeting that lasted two and a half hours Sunday night. "With a view to choosing grassroots leaders through elections, the meeting decided to call thana level leaders to Dhaka," Delwar said. Abdullah Al Noman, joint secretary general, will head the committee for Dhaka Division. He will be assisted by organising secretary Mizanur Rahman Minu. For Chittagong, the Gayeshwar Roy-led team will include Kazi Asaduzzaman of the Swechhashevak Dal. Nazrul Islam Khan, accompanied by Shamsuzzaman Dudu of Krishak Dal, will deal with Sylhet Division. Selima Rahman, aided by organising secretary Md Shahjahan, will lead the Khulna efforts; Mirza Abbas, to be supported by organising secretary Amanullah Aman, will handle Rajshahi. The Barisal job went to prof M A Mannan and organising secretary Moshiur Rahman. Delwar said the thana leaders will start arriving from Feb 3 and the joint secretaries general will file their reports by Feb 28. "The election to the grassroots committees will be followed by that of national executive and standing committees," Delwar said. bdnews
