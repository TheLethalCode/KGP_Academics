<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1(bdnews24.com) Bangladesh is set to devalue the Taka this month to help exporters compete in the crisis-ridden global market, the finance minister hinted Sunday. "The devaluation of the Taka has become an important issue," A M A Muhith said after a meeting with textile industry leaders. "We are trying to prevent a fall, but it may be difficult to stay competitive in the global trade at the current valuation," the minister told reporters. "We'll discuss with all concerned and decide within 15-20 days," he said. "All the competing countries have devalued their currencies. If we try to protect the Taka, our exports will suffer amid tougher competition." A BTMA team led by president Abdul Hye lobbied the minister to demand support from the government. "Yarns worth about Tk 30,000 crore are lying unsold at our mills," Hye said. "Garment factory owners are importing from India. Price of Indian yarn is lower than ours. "We produce yarn with cotton imported from India. That is why our price is higher than India," the BTMA president said. Hye said the textile owners suggested devaluation of the Taka, 25 per cent cash subsidy, duty-free import of capital machinery and a reduce interest rate as solutions to their crisis. The minister made it clear to reporters that he had not committed anything. Hye argued that Pakistan had recently devalued their currency by 30 percent and India 25 percent. "It will be difficult for us to sustain our industries if we don't," Hye said. BTMA directors Beximco Group chairman Sohel F. Rahman, Square Group's Tapan Chowdhury and Jamuna Group chairman Nurul Islam Babul were among those who also met the minister.
