<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered six United Hospital doctors, accused of negligence in the death of film star Manna, to surrender to trial court within eight weeks. The six doctors petitioned a HC bench for bail on Thursday. The bench of justices Abdul Wahab Miah and Delwar Hossain rejected the bail petition, adding it would be considered after the doctors surrendered to the trial court. Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court issued arrest warrants against the six on Wednesday after a judicial probe stated that the film star's death was due to negligence and charged the doctors with 'destroying evidence'. The actor was admitted to Gulshan's United Hospital with chest pain on Feb 17 last year. Manna's family claimed doctors neglected to see him immediately, delaying treatment after he was admitted. He died before they arrived. Brother-in-law Reza Quader filed a murder case seven months later with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. The six doctors facing arrest are Enayet Hossain, Jahiruddin Mahmud Ilias, Momenuzzaman, Khandaker Mahbub Sohail, Fatema and Mainul Islam Majumder. bdnew
