 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Andrew Strauss made a century to lead the touring side to a 217-run victory over St Kitts & Nevis in the opening match of their West Indies tour on Tuesday. Strauss, who was out for a second-ball duck in the first innings, struck 103 from 116 balls before retiring in England's second innings total of 265 for five declared. Ian Bell, vying with Owais Shah for the number three spot in the four-test series against West Indies, scored 52. Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar took three wickets for a match haul of seven as St Kitts & Nevis collapsed to 221 all out shortly before the close on the third and final day. England received another boost when a scan on all-rounder Andrew Flintoff's side strain revealed no serious damage. Shah, who scored an unbeaten 125 in England's first innings 424 for eight declared, will have further checks after scratching the cornea of his left eye. England meet West Indies A in another three-day match on Thursday before the first test starts in Kingston, Jamaica next Wednesday
