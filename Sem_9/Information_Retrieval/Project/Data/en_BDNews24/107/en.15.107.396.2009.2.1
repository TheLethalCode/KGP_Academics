 KABUL, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A suicide car bomber hit a convoy of foreign forces on the outskirts of the Afghan capital on Sunday, wounding three Afghan civilians, a police spokesman said. The attack happened near a bridge on Kabul's western edge, he said. Both NATO and U.S. military forces regularly use the road and have been attacked there by Taliban insurgents in the past. Spokesmen for both the NATO and US-led forces in Afghanistan said they had no information on whether there were any casualties among the foreign troops. The attack occurred on the main road to the south of the country from Kabul which runs through Maidan Wardak, a province that has seen a sharp increase in violence in the past year as Taliban militants have moved into the area. Some 3,000 US troops, the first of up to 30,000 extra American soldiers expected to be sent in Afghanistan this year, were deployed in Maidan Wardak and neighboring Logar province last month
