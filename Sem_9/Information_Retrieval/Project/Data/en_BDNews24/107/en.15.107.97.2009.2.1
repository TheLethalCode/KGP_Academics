 MIAMI, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England captain Andrew Strauss is "cautiously optimistic" all-rounder Andrew Flintoff will be fit for the first test against West Indies starting on Wednesday. "'Fred' is ahead of where the medical staff wanted him," Strauss told England's official website (www.ecb.co.uk). "So that is really encouraging. But you can never be 100 percent sure on these things until the day before the game. We are cautiously optimistic at the moment. Flintoff had a scan earlier this week after suffering a side strain and the results suggested the injury was not as serious as may have been feared. The Lancastrian did not play in the three-day game against West Indies A which finished in a draw on Saturday but had a solid workout in the middle, bowling about six overs. "Once the scan came back with no tear, we were always keen to play him in the first Test but you never know how these things will react and how stiff and sore he is going to be," said Strauss. "So far he looks as though as he has come through it well and we will see how he goes in the two practice days before the Test," he added. England made 414 in their innings in St Kitts, replying to West Indies A's 574 for eight declared. Strauss made 97, former skipper Kevin Pietersen 90 and Paul Collingwood 82. The first of the four test series in the Caribbean starts on Wednesday at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica
