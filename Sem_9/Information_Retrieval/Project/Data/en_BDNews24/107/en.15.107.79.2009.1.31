 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)Convicted former Dhaka MPs such as HMB Iqbal, Haji M Selim and Haji Mokbul Hossain joined a city Awami League meeting on Saturday, convened apparently to discuss campaign strategy for the forthcoming mayoral election. Iqbal, Selim and Mokbul, who allegedly fled Bangladesh but returned after their party swept to power, were all convicted to long prison terms in trials conducted during the state of emergency. The meeting, attended among others by state minister for law Quamrul Islam, Dhaka city unit's acting general secretary, was told that general secretary Mofazzal Hossain Maya would soon return to the country, a source with knowledge of the meeting proceedings said. TV footage showed the leaders taking part in the meeting deliberations. All three, Iqbal, Selim and Mokbul, were widely blamed for their alleged role in violent activities during the AL's 1996-2001 stint in power. A party statement Saturday night said the city AL leaders decided to organise "party-activist meetings at the thana level". The statement said the home minister, Sahara Khatun, will also attend these meetings. It did not however mention the mayoral election, slated for some time in March. Acting president of the city unit, M Aziz, chaired the meeting at the party central office at the Bangabandhu Avenue. b
