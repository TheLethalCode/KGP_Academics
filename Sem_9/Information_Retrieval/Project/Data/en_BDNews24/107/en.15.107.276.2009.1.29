 Dhaka. Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The ACC's draft of a four-point amendment to the Anticorruption Commission Act 2004 includes a proposal to make the Commission a party to the cases it files. "The government is the plaintiff to the cases filed by the ACC, and also appoints lawyers of its choice, but the Commission wants to change that," ACC director general Hanif Iqbal told reporters on Thursday. The Commission lacks skilled manpower for inquiries and investigations into special types of crime, said Iqbal. "The Commission has asked for authority to attach skilled hands from any government arm to the ACC." He said the draft amendment also proposes prior approval from the ACC in case of a graft case filed by the police. The ACC also wanted to relieve itself of the burden of dealing with "minor" corporate graft. "Under Section 408 of the law, the Commission has to deal with minor forms of graft by companies, which disturbs the more important work of the Commission. This section should be amended," said Iqbal. Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tabled the proposal to amend the Act earlier in the week, but returned it for further scrutiny by the law ministry. The Anticorruption Commission Act has seen amendments twice, in 2007, since it came into being in 2004. bd
