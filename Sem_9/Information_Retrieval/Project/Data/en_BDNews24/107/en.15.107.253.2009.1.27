<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)A meeting between treasury and opposition benches over the rearrangement of the House's seating order ended inconclusively on Tuesday. Opposition chief whip Joynal Abedin Faruk walked out of the meeting, which began around 4pm, as the ruling party's chief whip Abdus Shahid proposed that the BNP should get just three to four seats on the front bench to the left of the speaker. Speaker Abdul Hamid called the meeting with the two chief whips on Tuesday in a bid to put an end to the row over the seating plan made by outgoing speaker Md Jamiruddin Sircar. "The chief whip told me that BNP will get just three to four seats at the left side on the front bench," Faruk told bdnews24.com. "They want to put more ministers and senior ruling party MPs on the left side, replacing the opposition." "But I could not agree with him. I urged him not to change the seating arrangement with a view to making parliament effective as they wanted," he said. "The rearrangement proposal is not a sign of making parliament effective," he added. Faruk referred to Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure, saying the speaker was the proper authority to plan the seating order. He said there was no instance in the world that ruling party MPs take seats to the left of the speaker. "I will talk to party high-ups and let the speaker know our decision," said the chief whip of the main opposition party BNP. bdn
