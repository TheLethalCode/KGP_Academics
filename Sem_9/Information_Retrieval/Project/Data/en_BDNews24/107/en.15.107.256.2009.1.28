 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Nurul Islam Nahid, the education minister, Wednesday received strong endorsements from top educationists for his plans to introduce "one syllabus for all" primary students in Bangladesh. The education policy drawn up by the Qudrat-E-Khuda Education Commission in 1974 will be taken up with some modernisation, the minister told a meeting at his ministry. The minister pointed to 11 separate systems of primary education in the country at present, and said: "This creates discrimination and, at the primary stage, we want to launch one syllabus for all." The former communist leader received support from such luminaries as Serajul Islam Chowdhury, writer and professor emeritus at Dhaka University. "The three mediums of educationEnglish, Bangla and Madrassahave deepened social division," the professor said. "The government wants to introduce one system of education at least up to the SSC level," the minister said. Chairman of the University Grants Commission Prof Nazrul Islam said that no action has been taken by the education ministry even after reports of corruption at universities were submitted. "Corruption at universities has been at an unthinkable level," the UGC chief said and suggested a separate commission be formed in this regard. He also recommended private universities include Bangla language and culture in their syllabuses. Professor Jamilur Reza Chowdhury, Brac University vice chancellor, expressed concern about the fall in numbers of science students and asked for measures from the government in this regard. Professor Zafar Iqbal, supporting 'single format education', a proposal to combine science, humanities and commerce at the secondary level, said, "The Qudrat-E-Khuda proposal is splendid and can be implemented with a few adjustments." Another commission, instituted by the 1996-2001 AL government and led by prof M Shamsul Huq, later worked on the 1974 report by Qudrat-E-Khuda. Professors Zillur Rahman Siddiqui, Ranglal Sen, Mustafa Nurul Islam, Hafiz G A Siddiqui, K M Saaduddin, Anupam Sen and others spoke at the meeting with the minister. The new Dhaka University vice chancellor AAMS Arefin Siddiqui was also present. bdn
