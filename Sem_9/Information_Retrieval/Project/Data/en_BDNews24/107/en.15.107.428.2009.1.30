<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Jan 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong-il appears to have rebounded politically from a recent health scare and is making major decisions, a US national security official said on Thursday. "Kim appears to be in the saddle right now, making key decisions for his government," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The demise of the 66-year-old Kim without a clear successor could add to the uncertainty about the country's future. North Korea is trying to develop nuclear weapons, but its economy is reportedly in ruins and its population bordering on famine. There have been recent signs that the 66-year-old Kim's health was improving. Last week he met a senior Chinese official in Pyongyang, in his first reported meeting with a foreign dignitary since a suspected stroke in August. The South Korean news agency Yonhap reported earlier this month that Kim had picked one of his sons, the little-known Jong-un, to succeed him. However, Kim's eldest son, dismissed speculation last week saying only his father could decide succession issues. He also declined to discuss his father's health with reporters. A report published by the US Council on Foreign Relations think tank this week questioned any reported improvement in Kim's health. "It is possible...that Kim Jong-il's condition may actually be much worse than press reports suggest, and that his capacity to govern -- if it hasn't already been seriously compromised -- may be short-lived," it said
