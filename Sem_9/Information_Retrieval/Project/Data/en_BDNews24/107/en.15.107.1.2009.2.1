<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafa Nadal feared his hopes of winning his first Australian Open title were slipping when he felt a sudden pain in his hamstring during Sunday's final with Roger Federer. Nadal won the match 7-5 3-6 7-6 3-6 6-2 but not before a mighty scare from his Swiss opponent and his own weary body. The Spanish world number one was already worried about his fitness after spending more than five hours on court during his semi-final win over fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on Friday night. But his concerns increased when his leg started to hurt during the third set and he called for a trainer to help him out. "I ended the match against Verdasco with the right leg, the quadriceps and hamstring very tight," Nadal said. "In the third set it started to (hurt) I wasn't cramping but it was scary." Nadal asked the trainer to massage his leg during the change of ends but was reluctant to call for a medical timeout incase he needed it later in the match. The powerful lefthander said the pain never went away but he was able to fight through it to seal an epic victory. "I was a little bit tired. I was little bit worried about my physical performance because (when) I trained, it was tough to keep up the concentration. "I spoke with my coach before the match and he told me to go out there and fight all the time and believe in the victory." Nadal's win earned him a sixth grand slam title after his four consecutive wins at the French Open and his 2008 success at Wimbledon. He became the first man since Andre Agassi to win grand slam titles on three different surfaces and at 22, he still has plenty of time left to win the only major that has eluded him, the U.S. Open. "This is very special, it's a dream to win here, a grand slam on hard court," Nadal said. "I have worked very hard all my life to improve my tennis outside of clay. "I have six right now, I'm happy with my six. "Every title is tough to win. I don't know if I'm gonna win more, but for sure I'm gonna continue trying. "When I won my first one I didn't know if I would win any more. You never know when that will stop so you have to be cautious and be humble." While Federer was reduced to tears after the match, Nadal said he was also overcome with emotion after receiving the winner's trophy and a cheque for A$2 million (US$1.28 million) from the only person to have twice completed the Grand Slam. "My uncle always told me Rod Laver was the best because he won the whole grand slam, the four in a row, two times," Nadal said. "Everything was very special. I was sorry it was a tough moment for Rog today but he's a great champion. "He's the best and a very important person for our sport.
