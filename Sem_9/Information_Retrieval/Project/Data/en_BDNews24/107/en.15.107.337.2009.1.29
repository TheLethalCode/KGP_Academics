<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A lack of aggression cost Elena Dementieva her 15-match winning streak and a place in the Australian Open final, but the Russian has no regrets. "I think it was a good match," Dementieva told reporters after her 6-3 6-4 loss to Serena Williams. "I think Serena played really well today. I was maybe not aggressive enough and maybe I was playing not deep enough, which allowed her to be very aggressive and dictate the game. "I just had a good run, you know, from the beginning of the year. I played a lot of matches. I won all of them. "And I feel like today I was not quick enough. I was not maybe aggressive enough against her. But I have no regrets. I had just a great time here." Dementieva arrived at Melbourne Park having triumphed at events in Auckland and Sydney, but under the roof on Rod Laver Arena she was unable to replicate her best form against a powerful Williams seeking a fourth title here. "I think she was very powerful today," the 27-year-old said. "She was moving better today, and her first serve percentage was quite high. So it was really difficult on her service game to do something, to put any pressure on. "I mean, she was very focused today it was a good match.
