 QUITO, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paraguay's Nacional blasted five second-half goals to rout Ecuadorean army club El Nacional 5-0 away as the South American Libertadores Cup kicked off on Tuesday. Raul Roman set the unfashionable visitors on their way when he fired the opener from long-range in the 50th minute of the preliminary round, first leg tie. El Nacional, who had dominated the first half, fell to pieces and the visitors ran riot, apparently unhindered by the high altitude of Quito, which lies at 2,800 metres above sea level. Midfielder Jorge Nunez helped himself to two goals while Ramon Caceres and Marcos Melgarejo added the others.
