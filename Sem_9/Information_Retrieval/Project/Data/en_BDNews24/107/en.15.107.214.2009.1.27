<TITLE> Samsung wins US LCD patent ruling against Sharp </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO,Tue Jan 27,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp said it had been ruled against in a US LCD patent row in which South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co sought to stop it importing some related products to the United States. But Sharp said that the decision by an administrative law judge at the US International Trade Commission was still preliminary and that it would not stop Sharp from import and sales activities there. A Sharp spokeswoman said the company, the world's third-largest LCD TV maker behind Samsung and Sony Corp, planned to appeal, and that a final decision by the commission would likely come in late April. The commission is also looking into Sharp's complaint over alleged LCD patent infringements by Samsung, but a decision on that case has yet to be made. Sharp sold 4.8 million LCD TVs outside Japan in the year ending in March 2008, and the United States accounted for about half of those overseas sales. Shares in Sharp rose 2.1 percent to 685 yen on Tuesday, underperforming the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index, which gained 4.1 percent
