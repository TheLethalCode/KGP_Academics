 Gopalganj,Jan 31(bdnews24.com)- The finance minister on Saturday voiced concerns over maintaining the value of the Taka as currencies have been fluctuating across the world hit by severe economic recession. "The values of currencies have been facing dangerous volatility. Our Taka has not fallen in comparison," said Abul Maal Abdul Muhith. "The value of our currency stands in a relatively stable position. But I fear whether we will be able to keep its value intact," Muhith told reporters at Tungipara at noon.
