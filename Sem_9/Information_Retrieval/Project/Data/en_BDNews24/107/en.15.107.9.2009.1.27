 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Only 20 percent of acid throwing cases have seen convictions in six years since the National Acid Control Council was formed in 2002. Charges were pressed in 60 percent of cases, Council members said at a meeting with the home minister on Tuesday. "Some 1,585 cases were lodged between 2002 and 2008," state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed told reporters after the meeting. Charge sheets were pressed in 926 cases. Of these, final reports were submitted in 647 cases. Just 12 cases remain under investigation at present. Convictions were seen in only 190 cases. The accused in the remaining cases were released, said the state minister. Home minister Sahara Khatun ordered law enforcers at the meeting to be more vigilant in investigating acid violence related cases, he said. "Orders were given to law enforcers to be more meticulous in acquiring evidence and ensuring that the criminals do not slip through any loopholes," said Tanjim. "If any official is found to be negligent in pursuing a case then punitive measures will be taken," he said. The meeting also advised police to be active in preventing transportation of acid on open trucks and ensure closed containers. The Acid Control Council, formed under the Acid Control Act 2002, received an allotment of Tk 2 crore from the government for the current fiscal year, said the state minister. bdnew
