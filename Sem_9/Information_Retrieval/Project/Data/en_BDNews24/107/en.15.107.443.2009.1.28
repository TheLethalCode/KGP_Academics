 By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)Hisham Melham, US bureau chief of Al Arabiya TV, is being feted as a star of the Washington press core for having landed the first interview of President Obama on Tuesday. The question everyone here is asking is why Obama chose to give his first interview to an Arabic-language TV channel based in Dubai. The reason, of course, is not hard to figure: he was trying to reach out to the Muslim world and demonstrate a genuine interest in resolving the intractable Middle East conflict. To most analysts, it signaled a shift  in style and manner, at least  from the Bush administration, with Obama offering what he depicted as a new readiness to listen rather than to dictate. The interview, taped on Monday night and broadcast throughout the Muslim world on Tuesday, had Obama striking a conciliatory tone toward the Islamic world, saying the moment was ripe for negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. The president said it was his job "to communicate to the Muslim world that the Americans are not your enemy." Obama added that "we sometimes make mistakes," but said that America was not born as a colonial power and that he hoped for a restoration of "the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago." What has struck many analysts as truly reflecting an approach that is fundamentally different from his predecessor, was his instruction to his newly appointed Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, "to listen and not to dictate". Mitchell left for the region on an eight-day "listening" tour Monday. That very approachto be a listener and a frank admission to acknowledge mistakes in the pastappeared to have been received positively in the Islamic world. Speaking on the "News Hour with Jim Lehrer" on Tuesday night Hisham Melham said the initial reactions to the interview across the Middle East seemed positive. In general, people who saw it said they thought that it marked a startling break from the rhetoric of previous American administrations. But there were others who were not so optimistic given the broken promises that characterised previous American administrations. "Let's see your promise, American president, for an independent Palestinian state," said a commenter on Al Arabiya's Web site. "And let's see your promise for peace with the world, and especially the Islamic world. Then for sure we will learn to love America through your actions." In discussing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Obama said "the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away." He also said that although he would not offer a time frame, he believed that it was "possible for us to see a Palestinian state." He described such a state as one "that allows freedom of movement for its people, that allows for trade with other countries, that allows the creation of businesses and commerce so that people have a better life." "Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them," Obama said. "They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that, instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table." Obama said Israel "will not stop being a strong ally of the United States, and I will continue to believe that Israel's security is paramount." "But I also believe that there are Israelis who recognise that it is important to achieve peace," he added. "They will be willing to make sacrifices if the time is appropriate and if there is serious partnership on the other side." He also said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should not be seen in isolation. "I do think it is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of what's happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan," Obama said. The president criticised Iranian leaders, however, for acting in ways that "are not conducive to peace and prosperity in the region," including their suspected pursuit of a nuclear weapon, threats against Israel and "their support of terrorist
