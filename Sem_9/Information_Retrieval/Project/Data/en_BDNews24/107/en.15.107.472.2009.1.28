 PRETORIA, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa continued their World Cup preparations with a 1-0 win over Zambia in a friendly international in Pretoria on Tuesday, a record-breaking fifth successive victory for the 2010 tournament hosts. Captain Teko Modise converted a curling free kick early in the second half to hand a South African side made up of only home-based players another morale-boosting victory. The win over Zambia marked the first time South Africa have won five games in row although they have all come against African opposition. South Africa next face internationals against more testing opposition, starting against Chile next month and Norway in March. Zambia coach Herve Renard failed to travel for the match with officials giving contrasting explanations for his absence, ranging from his resignation to staying back in Zambia for "administrative reasons". Renard is reported to be upset at the shoddy preparations of his side who begin the final phase of African World Cup qualifiers in March
