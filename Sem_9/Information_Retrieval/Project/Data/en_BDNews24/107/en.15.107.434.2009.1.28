<TEXT>
 PARIS, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker David Trezeguet has dropped plans to come out of international retirement, saying he will never play for France again. "For me, Les Bleus, it's over for good," the 31-year-old, who said last month he was considering a return after announcing his international retirement in July last year, told France Football magazine in an interview published on Tuesday. Trezeguet, back in training with Juventus after knee surgery in September, said he was ready to resume playing at club level. "I'm waiting for a sign from the coach," he said. "I can't say I'm at 100 percent yet but I'm ready to play." As for France, Trezeguet, who has a difficult relationship with national team coach Raymond Domenech and has often been overlooked by him, said he would not change his mind again. "During my injury, I've had time to think about it and analyse what happened during the last four years with Domenech," said Trezeguet, whose last appearance for his country was in a 1-0 win over England in March last year. "My decision is clear and irrevocable," he added. A member of France's 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000-winning squads, Trezeguet has scored 34 goals from 71 caps, putting him third on his country's all-time scoring list behind Thierry Henry (48) and Michel Platini (41)
