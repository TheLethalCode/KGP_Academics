 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  A citizens' group has called for removal of "controversial figures" from public posts in the national interest. The demand made special reference to the prime minister's energy adviser Toufique-e-Elahi, who it said was involved in "activities subversive to the state's interests." "The government is paving the way for disaster by appointing controversial people like Toufique," convenor of the 'committee for protection of oil-gas-mineral resources, power and port', Sheikh Mohammad Shahidullah, told a discussion at the National Press Club on Tuesday, In a statement, the convenor claimed the adviser, during the previous Awami League government, had the then prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurate the overseas office of a multinational company. "Because of him, legal ways to demand compensation for the Magurchara gas fields explosion were closed," said Shahidullah. He said the public was becoming concerned about energy security because such a person was made energy adviser with full ministerial rank. Professor Anu Ahmed, member-secretary of the committee, said, "We want to extract the mineral resources of the country but we must move away from deals of the past that are against the interests of the nation." Dr Shamsul Alam, welcoming the government's decision to put war criminals to trial, said, "Hopefully, soon the 'energy criminals' will also be put to trial." Former secretary Syed Abdul Maksud said the energy adviser was released from prison "just days ago". "It is absurd that so many advisers have the rank of minister," added Maksud. Long time associate of the committee Dr Hossain Monsur, who was chairman of Petrobangla during the previous AL government, said the power sector saw no growth over the past seven years. "The energy sector has become dependent on foreign entities," he added. bdnews24.
