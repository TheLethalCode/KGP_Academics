 MADRID, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news from the Primera Liga ahead of this weekend's matches (all times GMT): Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano strained his left knee in Thursday's King's Cup quarter-final win over Valencia and will be out for at least a couple of weeks, the Andalusian club said on their website (www.sevillafc.es). The Brazilian will miss third-placed Sevilla's game at Sporting Gijon on Sunday (2000 GMT) as well as his country's international friendly against Italy in London on Feb. 10 and the league derby against Real Betis, the club said. Real Madrid coach Juande Ramos will be without midfielder Guti, number two goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek and central defender Christoph Metzelder for Saturday's match at Numancia (2100). Guti and Dudek have failed to recover from muscle strains and Metzelder is suffering from lower back pain, the champions said on their website (www.realmadrid.com). Ramos also left Dutch winger Royston Drenthe, who was whistled by disgruntled fans in the 1-0 win over Deportivo Coruna last weekend, out of the squad for Saturday. Ramos said he was happy with the depth of the current squad and had not asked the club's directors to sign any more players before the January transfer window closes. "I talk to the sporting director and the president about a lot of things but I have not asked for any player," he told a news conference. "The sporting director knows the squad  and they are convinced we can win any competition we are in." Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola played down the chances of the club becoming the first to win the treble (Primera Liga, King's Cup and Champions League) this season and urged his players to keep their feet on the ground. "If it was so easy to get the treble, it would have been done already several times  but it has not happened," Guardiola told the club's website (www.fcbarcelona.cat) after Barca secured a place in the semi-finals of the Cup by beating Espanyol on Thursday. Atletico Madrid midfielder Ever Banega said the players knew the importance of beating Real Valladolid at home on Sunday (1600) and getting their first victory of the year. "If we are not winning at least 1-0 after 15 minutes it's possible that the fans will start whistling but we are relaxed about it," the Argentine told Friday's As newspaper. "We will go out and play with patience." Villarreal defender Gonzalo Rodriguez has recovered from a knee injury and could return against Deportivo Coruna on Sunday (1600), he said on the club's website (www.villarrealcf.es). The Argentine's partner in central defence, Uruguayan Diego Godin, is also available again after serving a one-match suspension as fifth-placed Villarreal look to keep up the pressure on Valencia in fourth. Malaga assistant coach Julio Cesar Dely Valdes said the club had done well to claw their way up to seventh in the standings but the players could not afford to relax as the season had a long way to go. Saturday's match at Athletic Bilbao (1900) will be a tough one as the Basque club are full of confidence after Wednesday's win over Sporting Gijon in their King's Cup quarter-final, he said on the club's website (www.malagacf.com)
