 ANTANANARIVO, Jan 28(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tens of thousands of opposition supporters demonstrated in Madagascar's capital on Wednesday, two days after an earlier anti-government rally descended into violence that killed nearly 40 people. Witnesses in the main square of Antananarivo, May 13 Plaza, estimated the crowd number as at least 40,0000, adding that armed police were watching closely but the mood was calm. The rally was called by opposition leader and city mayor Andry Rajoelina. The 34-year-old firebrand politician accuses President Marc Ravalomanana, 59, of turning Madagascar into a dictatorship. The president, a self-made dairy tycoon who used to hawk yoghurt on the streets of Antananarivo, accuses his rival of trying to overthrow the government. "I appeal to people to remain calm," Ravalomanana said in a statement in front of the damaged state media compound in Antananarivo. The death toll from Monday's violence rose when the fire service said up to 37 corpses of suspected looters had been found in a store burned during the unrest. The macabre find in the shell of a former three-storey clothes store would take the death toll from this week's violence on the Indian Ocean island to 39. "We have found perhaps as many as 37 bodies," said the fire officer in charge at the scene, revising a previous toll of 25 corpses announced late on Tuesday. "It is hard to determine the precise numbers because the bodies are badly damaged, and there are limbs scattered all over the place," he added in a telephone interview. Rajoelina and Ravalomanana have both called for calm, but are yet to start talks between themselves to resolve the impasse. TOURISM AND MINING The political crisis is denting Madagascar's image as a popular tourist venue and a destination for foreign investment in its mining and oil exploration sectors. Major foreign investors include Rio Tinto and Sherritt International, which plan to extract nickel, bauxite, cobalt and Ilmenite. Companies are also looking for oil, gold, coal, chrome and uranium. The top diplomat for the African Union (AU) said the unrest and deaths risked destabilizing Madagascar and urged dialogue between the feuding sides. Jean Ping "is deeply concerned by the prevailing political tension and the risk it poses to the stability of the country," said an AU statement. "He urges all stakeholders to resolve the current crisis through dialogue and respect for constitutional order and legality." Rajoelina's supporters torched a state media building earlier in the week at the height of the street violence. The president said an arrest warrant had been issued for Rajoelina's cabinet director General Dolin Rasolosoa and for Roland Ratsiraka, the nephew of ex-president Didier Ratsiraka. The government shut the mayor's radio station last month after it ran an interview with the former president from France. Paris, which controlled Madagascar from the late 19th century until independence in 1960, has called on the Malagasy authorities to show restraint in the search for "a peaceful and lasting solution," a foreign ministry statement said. The world's fourth largest island, Madagascar has a history of political unrest. In December 2001, both Ravalomanana and his predecessor Ratsiraka claimed victory in a presidential election. Eight months of instability and sporadic violence followed before a court upheld Ravalomanana's victory. Ratsirika fled to France.
