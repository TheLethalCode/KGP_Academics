 Dhaka,Jan 29(bdnews24.com)Police recovered 12 parts of a body from different sites in the capital's Lalbagh area on Thursday, but said the head could not be traced. "We arrested two local gang members ' Zahir' and 'Saiful' with suspected links to the murder," Lalbagh acting officer in charge Naba Jyoti Khisha told bdnews24.com. The officer said police recovered three body parts from a lane behind Mowchak colony in South Polashi, three pieces from Lane Seven of Shaheed Nagar and six pieces from a lane in Champatali. "The pieces were wrapped in polythene bags. Police recovered them following information of local residents. But there was no trace of head of the deceased." A man named Nazimuddin Badsha claimed the body was that of his brother, phone-fax trader Azgar, but police did not confirm the ID. "Locals have said that the trader Azgar was last seen with Zahir. Azgar's brother Nazimuddin, who identified the body, has made allegations against Zahir. The latter is under interrogation," said the Lalbagh police officer. Nazimuddin told bdnews24.com that his brother had a phone-fax shop called Naorin at 32, Rajnarayan Road. "A few days back, local gangster Zahir and others demanded Tk 3 lakh for 'dish' business. Zahir and the others murdered him for not paying," alleged Nazimuddin. He said Zahir called Azgar away from his shop on Wednesday night. "After that, he has been missing." Zahir has admitted he met Azgar at 9pm Wednesday, but denied involvement in any murder. "Seven of us, including Azgar, were planning a cable TV business." Over two hundred people in Lalbagh and Old Dhaka staged a demonstration on Thursday, however, demanding punishment of Zahir who is known as an "top criminal" in the area. They took a procession to Lalbagh Police Station in the evening. bdnews24.com
