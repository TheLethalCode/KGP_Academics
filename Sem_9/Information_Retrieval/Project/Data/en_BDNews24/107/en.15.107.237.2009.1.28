<TITLE> Nadal to benefit from cool session in searing Melbourne </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal will be spared the searing heat on Wednesday after Australian Open organisers scheduled him on a night match for his quarter-final against Gilles Simon. The in-form world number one hardly needs assistance from the scheduling but will take any advantage he gets as meteorologists predict the hottest week in Melbourne for 100 years. A day after champion Novak Djokovic wilted in the heat to relinquish his hold on the title, Nadal will be out to preserve his record of being the only man yet to drop a set this year. "Probably I am playing a little bit better than last year, I think," the 2008 semi-finalist said. "I am not saying I gonna be in the final or I gonna be in semi-finals (but) I think the feeling is a little bit better." Simon knows he has his work cut out for him. "I have to run five hours to win. I have no choice," he laughed. "Usually I think that it's easier to play against them (world number ones) because you really know what you have to do. "You just have to do a perfect match to win. If it's not perfect, you lose. "It's easier when you get into the court. It's easier to stay focused on the match because you know that every point is important. "Well, just have to be perfect to win. So I prefer to play in that way." In a less-than-gallant result of the organisers's scheduling, the women will face the full force of the heat. Elena Dementieva takes on Venus Williams's conqueror Carla Suarez Navarro, while Serena Williams tackles Svetlana Kuznetsova. "She's a good player, obviously. Gets a ton of balls back. She's extremely strong. I think we have a similar game. I think it will obviously be a great match," second seed Serena said of the Russian. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga play Fernando Verdasco for a place in the semi-finals to complete the day session
