 HARARE, Thu Jan 29,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - More than half of Zimbabwe's population, suffering under a severe economic and political crisis, will need food aid in February and March, the World Food Program said on Thursday. The WFP said in a statement that it aims to assist 5.1 million people in February while a group of US-sponsored aid organizations plans to assist 1.8 million more people in the southern African country. "The overall total for people in need of assistance in February and March is around 7 million," the WFP said. Zimbabwe's economic meltdown has been worsened by a cholera outbreak across the country which has killed nearly 3,100 people and infected 58,993 -- the worst Africa death toll from cholera in 15 years. The normally preventable disease has spread as rival political parties struggle to implement a power-sharing agreement reached in September and seen as a chance to ease the humanitarian crisis and save the faltering economy. Regional leaders decided at a summit on Tuesday that a unity government should be formed next month. Fears of the cholera spreading in Zimbabwe have stepped up pressure on rival parties to end the political uncertainty. WHO figures dated January 28 showed an increase of 67 deaths and 1,291 new infections. The outbreak has hit the entire country, leading to a high overall case fatality rate of more than 5 percent. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has said he agreed to form a government with President Robert Mugabe although his Movement for Democratic Change voiced disappointment with the deal reached at the summit. MDC officials are expected to meet on Friday to discuss how to proceed
