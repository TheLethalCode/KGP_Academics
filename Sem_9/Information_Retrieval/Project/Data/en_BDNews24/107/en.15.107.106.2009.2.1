 NAIROBI,Sun Feb 1, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Kenyan half brother of US President Barack Obama has been arrested for possession of marijuana, local media reported on Sunday. George Hussein Obama, born of the same father as the US leader, was arrested on Saturday in Nairobi's sprawling Huruma slums, where he lives, Kenyan media reported. The Daily Nation said Obama would be charged in court on Monday with possession of a banned drug and resisting arrest. "Police officers arrested a man who was in possession of two rolls of bhang (marijuana) and he is being charged with that offence," area police chief Jasper Ombati, was quoted as saying. The Nation said Obama had been at the Huruma police post since his arrest, although some other media said he had been released. Contacted by Reuters, Ombati said: "I don't know what you are talking about," before hanging up the telephone. A national police spokesman could not be reached. George Obama works as a mechanic in Huruma and hardly knows his brother, the first black president of the United States, who is hero-worshipped in Kenya due to his ancestral roots. During the US election campaign, some right-wing US commentators said the lowly circumstances of George Obama showed Barack Obama's double standards. But George Obama told media he was happy with his life and his case had been exaggerated for political ends
