 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's new Brazilian football coach Edson Silva Dido vowed to elevate national football as he signed a one-year contract with BFF on Saturday. "I feel honoured to be appointed head coach of the Bangladesh national team. I hope for a successful journey to lift Bangladesh football up to a level as best I can," said Dido at the signing ceremony at Bangladesh Football Federation House. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin, vice presidents Badal Roy, Shawkat Ali Khan Jahangir and technical director Shahidur Rahman Shantoo were among those present. The BFF also renewed the contract with local coach Shafiqul Islam Manik, who will be deputy for Dido. It was the first official press meet for Dido, who arrived in Dhaka on January 24 to get an early idea of Bangladesh football, with the 46-year old coach studying at least six B. League matches including Mohammedan versus Abahani, the two teams making up most of the national players. The Brazilian coach says he first wants to focus on the preparation of the national team for April's AFC Challenge Cup at home so that the boys can offer some changes in their game. "First of all, we want to prepare the national team for the coming AFC Challenge Cup in the next one and a half months and then we will look at the long-term programme that will be made by my staff." "Besides, I will focus on all national teams (by age-group) and exchange knowledge with the local coaches, who are most important for building young footballers. We should make sure that we deliver good coaches because the young footballers need to learn the basics and this is not possible until you have many professional coaches. Asked what would be his coaching method, Dido said, "Mine is mixed Brazilian background and Dutch; I like to work with both. Tactics and system are not much to talk about as there is only one system and that is to win the game. My method is for offensive football and you have the best defence by attacking, attacking and attacking." The former Flamingo star said that as a coach he would also help the footballers to believe that they are capable of playing against any side in any competition. He added, however, that he had a lot of work ahead to apply his method, change the players' behaviour, and use the culture of Bangladesh as his coaching substance. For a better training, Dido felt the need of a physio as well as a goalkeeping coach. Argentinean trainer Ariel Colman is scheduled to arrive Dhaka in the middle of February, just before the start of training camp. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin said they had brought a foreign coach as per their commitment and would provide all kinds of assistance so that Bangladesh could emerge a competitive team in future. The BFF boss said he would love to see Bangladesh top in South Asia in the SAFF Games in early 2009 at home. In reply to a question, Salahuddin said renewal of Dido's contract after a year would depend on both parties
