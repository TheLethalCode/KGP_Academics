 NEW DELHI, Fri Jan 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has tightened security across its major airports after a series of "hijack alerts" passed on to them by intelligence agencies following the Mumbai attacks, officials said on Friday. Indian security officials said the latest general advisory to remain alert against possible hijacking attempts was issued by the government on Thursday. "There was no specific alert, but a general advisory was issued to airport authorities, asking them to remain vigilant against possible hijacking," Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor told Reuters by telephone. "A lot of private planes and helicopters also operate in the airports these days and there is always a possibility of a plane being hijacked." Indian intelligence officials have warned the government that militants could hijack a plane to either seek release of those lodged in Indian jails or use it smash into government buildings. A hijack alert was issued to authorities in Kolkata, officials said. "We stepped up security further the moment the alert came," Jayati Ghosh, senior official of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the main security agency manning India's airports said from Kolkata. Authorities had stepped up security in all airports considerably on the eve of India's Republic Day celebrations on Jan. 26. "We were on high alert in any case," added Rohit Katiyar, a CISF official at the New Delhi airport
