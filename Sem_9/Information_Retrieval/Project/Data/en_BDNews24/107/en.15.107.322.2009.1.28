 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  With an abnormal hike in the price of eggs, the government has fixed profit margins of poultry farmers, said fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas on Wednesday. "The government has taken the decision to keep the price of eggs within people's reach," said the minister after a meeting with poultry farm owners. According to the newly fixed rate, traders can keep a profit of Tk 0.60 a piece for eggs and Tk 10 at the highest for selling a chicken. The minister also revealed that production costs for each egg and chicken are Tk 5.52 and Tk 107 respectively. "But they are being sold at Tk 7.50 and Tk 130 respectively in the market after passing through several middlemen. Prices have been fixed to counter this excess profit." President of the Poultry Owners' Association, Taher Ahmed Siddiqui said, "The prices in the market are not abnormal and they are usually high in winter." He said that a poultry feed crisis and price hikes in the international market have also had an impact. Adviser to the association, Khondokar Mohammad Mohsin, said that a large number of poultry was culled under the caretaker government, due to fears of bird flu. The number of farms has halved, falling to 78,000 from around 160,000, he said. "This had a huge impact on the industry and prices will not become normal for another year or more," he said. The minister said, "We talked about problems faced by the poultry farmers and asked them to submit suggestions for their solutions within seven days." "Once we get their recommendations, the government will make all efforts to settle the problems," said Biswas. bdnew
