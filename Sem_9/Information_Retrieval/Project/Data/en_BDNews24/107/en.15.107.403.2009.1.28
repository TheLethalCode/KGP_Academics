 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The 9th Jatiya Sangsad is set for its first prime minister's question and answer session at its second sitting on Wednesday after a two-day break. The sitting is scheduled for a 4:45 pm start. The agenda of the day includes the traditional Wednesday question and answer session, which usually takes up about half an hour. The House will also see a thank you motion on the president's speech given on Jan 25. Prior to the sitting, the parliamentary advisory committee will meet for the first time at around 3:30pm, with the speaker in the chair, to fix the duration of the first parliament session and schedule for the upcoming election of a new president. Speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com on Tuesday that the House would see a new seating order, after the outgoing speaker's arrangement has given rise to dispute between the ruling Awami League and main opposition party BNP. Hamid met the chief whips of the ruling and opposition parties Tuesday afternoon in a bid to put an end to the row over the seating order but the meeting ended inconclusively. According to the seat plan, laid out by outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, BNP was granted nine seats on the front row on the left of the speaker. But the ruling party Awami League opposed the arrangment, saying it was disproportionate. It proposed three out of 10 seats on the front bench as the main opposition had only 30 seats in 300-seat parliament. AL chief whip Abdus Shahid told bdnews24.com they hoped the front bench arrangement would be proportionate to the ratio of seats in the parliament. "The matter will be resolved before today's session," he said. bdnew
