 Dhaka, January 25 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh's biggest ICT event, the BASIS SoftExpo from Jan. 27-31, will showcase local skills and strengths, say organisers. "The exposition will display the reservoir of ICT resources and skills in Bangladesh," Bangladesh Association of Software & Information Services president Habibullah N Karim told a press conference at the national Press Club Sunday. Organisers hope to attract local and foreign investors to expand outsourcing for the Bangladeshi ICT sector, and thus create an opportunity for thousands of skills jobs, Karim said. "The event also aims to educate people about the advantages of technology and its application in our day to day life," he said. "It will create a great opportunity to move towards a 'Digital Bangladesh'." 'Linking people with technology' and branding Bangladesh as a country of immense ICT possibilities constitutes the theme of the SoftExpo-2009. To be held at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre, the exposition will attract over 200 local and international companies, organisers say. Besides the stalls and displays, there will also be several roundtable conferences.
