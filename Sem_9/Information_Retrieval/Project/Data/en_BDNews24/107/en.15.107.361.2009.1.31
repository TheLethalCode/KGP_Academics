 MILAN, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's Serie A matches, which are due to kick off 15 minutes late in a players' association protest over two doping bans: Juventus striker David Trezeguet, who had knee surgery in September, is pushing for a start in Saturday's home game with Cagliari (1930 GMT) having made his first substitute appearance since September in Wednesday's 2-1 defeat at Udinese following knee surgery. Second-placed Juve could also welcome back captain Alessandro Del Piero after he missed the Udinese game with a knock. Midfielder Claudio Marchisio, one of the revelations of the Serie A season, signed a new contract until 2014 on Thursday. In-form David Beckham hopes to shrug off a muscle problem in his leg in time for AC Milan's trip to Lazio on Sunday (1930). The Rossoneri, in third, will be without suspended duo Mathieu Flamini and Paolo Maldini. Lazio have also been hit by suspensions with Pasquale Foggia, Stephan Lichtsteiner and Fabio Firmani all out. Striker Adriano serves the second game of his three-match ban when leaders Inter Milan host Torino on Sunday (1400) while Sulley Muntari is also suspended, leaving coach Jose Mourinho with a quandary in midfield. Stuttering Napoli, who entertain Udinese on Saturday (1700), start life without Daniele Mannini after the winger was banned for a year by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for turning up late to a doping control in 2007. The kick-off protest follows Mannini's ban and that of Brescia's Davide Possanzini
