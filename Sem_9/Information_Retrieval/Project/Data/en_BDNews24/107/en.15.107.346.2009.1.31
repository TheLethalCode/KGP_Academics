<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdews24.com)  The Bangladesh Better Business Forum, a public-private platform created by the caretaker government, will be kept functioning, said the finance minister on Saturday. "We have decided to continue with the activities of the BBBF, on request of the FBCCI and other business organisations," Abul Maal Abdul Muhith told bdnews24.com. "It will be reconstituted in a cabinet meeting very soon." The BBBF was launched in 2007, with the then chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed heading it. Businessmen have welcomed the decision. "The BBBF has performed well as an institution for the last two years," FBCCI president Annisul Huq told bdnews24.com. "It helped many decisions to get fast tracked as the head of the government was its chief." "There was very little red tape, so to speak," he said. bdnews
