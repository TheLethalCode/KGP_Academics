 BEIJING, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fifteen people suffocated when a fire sparked by birthday fireworks swept through a bar and restaurant in eastern China, state media said on Sunday, in an accident similar to one last September which killed 44. Seventeen people were injured in the blaze in Fujian province on Saturday night, Xinhua news agency said. The Latin-style bar and restaurant in Changle was set ablaze just before midnight, when about 10 young men and women celebrating a birthday set off fireworks at their table, Xinhua said. "The festive explosive set the ceiling on fire and the entire place was soon engulfed in flames," it quoted a local government spokesman as saying. Saturday was the last day of the week-long holiday marking the Spring Festival, or Chinese Lunar New Year, which fell on January 26. The fire was put out in about 30 minutes and 15 people were found in the charred debris, having died from suffocation. "The flames spread very fast and many of the diners were unable to escape," Li Ming, a guest who suffered slight injuries, was quoted as saying. The city, whose name translates into "lasting happiness," is about 30 km (20 miles) from the provincial capital, Fuzhou, with a population of 680,000. China's night clubs have a grim record of fire safety and often act as fronts for prostitution and drug-selling under police protection. Fireworks set off during a dance show at an illegal night club in Longgang, a blue-collar area just across the border from Hong Kong in southern China, sparked a blaze that killed 44 people and injured at least 64 in September last year. China has jailed a senior police officer for 11 years for taking bribes and dereliction of duty in connection with that blaze. A fire at a karaoke club and bath-house in Tianshifu township in northeastern Liaoning province in 2007 killed at least 25 people and injured dozens
