<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of Nurul Islam, the Gonotantree Party president who died tragically after a fire in their Lalmatia home last December, has rejected the death report by an investigative committee. "We demand re-investigation by a committee formed of local and international specialists," said Islam's wife Ruby Rahman, who also lost her son in the fire, at a press conference on Tuesday. The committee, headed by DMP additional commissioner during the caretaker government Abdus Salam, says in its report that the fire broke out due to a short circuit and that caused sparks to explode gas cylinders in the fridge. It also says that Islam's son died of asphyxiation during the fire on Dec 2 as carbon monoxide and other poisonous gases were created with the burning of upholstery. Also speaking at the press conference on Tuesday, the party's acting president Mohammad Afzal countered the report's findings. "The flat of Nurul Islam was protected by circuit breakers and video footage after the accident did not show any signs of a gas explosion," he said. He added that for the last two years the TV and fridge were "disconnected". "We think that the investigation has been slapdash and therefore demand re-investigation." Other Gonotantree Party leaders attended the press conference at the party office. bdnews
