<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  A second-half strike from Alamu Bukola Olaleken helped Mohammedan edge giant-killers Rahmatganj MFS 1-0 in the second-leg encounter in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Tuesday. With the ninth win in 16 matches, Mohammedan raised their point tally to 32, still six and three points behind of leaders Abahani Limited and second-placed Sheikh Russel KC, who, however, played a match more. Rahmatganj, who beat both Abahani 2-1 and Mohammedan 1-0 in their first-leg matches, remained at 20 also playing 16 outings. Mohammedan, who virtually slipped out of the title race after going down to Abahani 2-1 in their previous match, looked a bit shaky on the field and hardly impressed a few hundred spectators at the big bowl. There was no sign of plan in the first half and the ball was mostly concentrated in the midfield though the black and whites yielded a couple of chances. Mohammedan should take a lead in the first half when Abdul Komol Baten floated a Bukola left-side cross over the Rahmatganj crossbar at the top of the eight-yard box in the 19th minute. Egyptian midfielder Hazem Khaled Mahmoud tried his luck from a long range to drive a powerful shot in the 38th minute, but Rahmatganj goalkeeper Mohammad Ali frustrated him saving it at the cost of a corner. Mohammedan came close to a lead in the stoppage time in the first half when Bukola snatching a ball from goalkeeper Ali from the touchline chipped in front of the open net, but defender Ashraful Islam headed it out to save Rahmatganj, who recorded two wins out of six second-leg matches. After the lemon break, Mohammedan reorganised to launch some attack, but not before their goalkeeper Aminul Haq thwarted a dipping shot from Jahangir Patuari in the 59th minute to save the Motijheel-based outfit. The popular black and whites finally broke the deadlock when Nasir from the right whipped a cross for Maruful Islam, who drove the cross to the Rahmatganj crossbar and Bukola headed the follow-up home to raise his goal tally to 12 to join second highest scorers Abahani's Emeka Christina and Rahmatgan's Idris Kasariya. Bukola then again came close to double the margain, but both of his attempts inside the box were denied by Rahmatganj goalkeeper Mohammad Ali and Mohammedan left the field with the fourth win in the second leg. bd
