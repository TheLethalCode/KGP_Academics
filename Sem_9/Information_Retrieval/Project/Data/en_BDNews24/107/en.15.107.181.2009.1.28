 DAMBULLA, Sri Lanka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sanath Jayasuriya stroked a well-paced 107 to guide Sri Lanka to 246 for seven in the first game against India on Wednesday. The 39-year-old became the oldest centurion in one-day cricket, scoring his 28th one-day hundred which also took him past the 13,000-run mark. Jayasuriya raised 118 runs for the second wicket with fellow left-hander Kumar Sangakkara (44) to lay a strong foundation for a good total on a traditionally low-scoring venue. Jayasuriya faced 114 deliveries and hit 10 fours and one six. All rounder Farveez Maharoof, promoted up the order, chipped in with 35 from 27 deliveries, hitting a six and two fours. Paceman Ishant Sharma was the most successful of the bowlers, claiming three for 52 from his 10 overs. Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and chose to bowl first in the hope of exploiting early seam movement. Tillakaratne Dilshan was run out for a duck in the first over but Jayasuriya and Sangakkara negotiated the initial threat of the new ball with intelligent and cautious batting. On 169 for two, Sri Lanka looked poised for a large total but India pegged back the hosts in the latter stages of the innings. Thilina Kandamby (17) spooned a catch to mid off and Jayasuriya skied a catch to mid off, reducing Sri Lanka to 171 for four. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene's low-scoring run continued as he top-edged a sweep and was out for 11. Indian opener Virender Sehwag pulled out of the first game in the five-match series because of a back injury
