<TITLE> Seating row: Speaker meeting whips </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Speaker Abdul Hamid is meeting the chief whips of the ruling and opposition parties Tuesday afternoon in a bid to put an end to the row over the seating order in the House. According to seat arrangement, laid out by outgoing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar, main opposition BNP and three other parties were granted two front rows on the left of the speaker. But the ruling party Awami League opposed the plan, saying it was disproportionate. It proposed three out of 10 seats on the front bench as the main opposition had only 30 seats in 300-seat parliament. Chief whip Abdus Shahid told reporters on Tuesday that the outgoing speaker made the seat arrangement "unilaterally", and that it was "not acceptable". "We have protested it. The opposition party will get three seats based on the seats they got in the election," he said. "The new speaker has already said the seats will be rearranged," Shahid added. Opposition chief whip Jaynal Abedin Faruk said that it was the tradition of the parliament that the ruing party would be seated on the right and the opposition on the left side of the speaker. "The outgoing speaker followed the tradition. But the way the ruling party wants to make the seat plan for the opposition is not acceptable," he said. "If the speaker takes such decision unilaterally the opposition parties including the BNP will think in a different way," Jaynal said. He said that he would attend the meeting. "The speaker has called me and I will go there. I will inform our Madam (BNP chief Khaleda Zia) of the meeting," he said.
