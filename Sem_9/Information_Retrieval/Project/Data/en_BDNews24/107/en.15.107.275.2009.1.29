 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said Thursday the new president could be announced as soon as Feb 11. The Election Commission has announced the presidential polls schedule, with election on Feb 16, deadline for nominations submissions on Feb 8 and withdrawals by Feb 11, said the polls chief. "In case of more than one candidate, the election will be held on Feb 16, but a lone candidate would mean a new president elected on Feb 11, the date of withdrawal of nomination," Huda told reporters. The ruling Awami League has so far announced the party's senior presidium member Zillur Rahman as presidential candidate. The 'Presidential Election Act' requires the EC to announce the election schedule during the first session of parliament. According to the Constitution, the new president has to be elected within 30 days of a new parliament convening. "Usually seven days is given for nomination-related formalities followed by a day for scrutiny and another day for withdrawal," EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed told bdnews24.com. "In case of more than one candidate, the CEC oversees the polls as the returning officer in parliament." "But in case of a lone candidate he or she is declared elected uncontested," said the EC official. The ballot papers used do not carry symbols but the names of candidates, and MPs sign their names against their choice in public, he said.
