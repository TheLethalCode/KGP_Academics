 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami has criticised the government's efforts to form a South Asian taskforce to combat terrorism. Domestic law enforcing agenciesRAB, police, BDR as well as armywere enough to expunge terrorism, he said. "If we let foreign forces into our country then that would be inviting more trouble," said Nizami at a two-day meeting of the party's Majlish-i-Shura, its top policy-making body. "Corridors are being given to India in the name of transit, but we must keep in mind matters of independence and sovereignty," said the Jamaat amir. Nizami said radicalism had been identified as 'deviant' by all mainstream Muslim parties. "This threat can be exterminated through internal cooperation." On the outcome of the Dec 29 electios, the BNP ally said: "Jamaat believes in democracy, but the belief held by certain quarters that we forced BNP to election, is not right." Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed, Abdul Kader Molla, barrister Abdur Razzak and other central leaders were present at the Majlish meet. bdnews24.
