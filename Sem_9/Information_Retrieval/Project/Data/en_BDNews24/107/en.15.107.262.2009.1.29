 MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Melbourne heatwave ruined Vera Zvonareva's hopes of reaching a first grand slam final, the Russian said, but it was not the temperature which affected her. Instead the fact that Australian Open organisers shut the centre court roof to keep out the blistering heat had thrown her. "I think it was very difficult. I think the conditions were totally different from previous matches," Zvonareva said after her 6-3 7-6 loss to fellow Russian Dinara Safina. "I think I'm a player who needs lots of time to get used to the conditions. I really felt it was a little bit faster. "I felt like, well, we were playing indoors, so it was different. I couldn't really find my rhythm." The Russian baseliner said she had not had a chance to acclimatise to the new conditions. "I jumped on the Rod Laver (court) for like 10 minutes. I got the chance 10 minutes today a little bit. Otherwise, no chance (to practise)," she said. "I think I'm an all surface, all court player. I really can play anywhere (but) I'm a player who needs time to adjust to the new conditions. "I would prefer to play a match or two  I could never play my best tennis in the first match of the tournament. It's impossible, probably like lots of other players. "So I felt like I was a little bit off the rhythm today and it was a little bit different for me. "But, well, the same conditions for both of us. Well, that's it.
