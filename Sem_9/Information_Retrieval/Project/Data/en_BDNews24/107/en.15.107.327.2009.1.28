<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Judicial Service Association says it is set to sue the law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal for "humiliating" comments against judges. The judges' organisation, in an emergency meeting on Wednesday, also raised a motion of censure against the law secretary's recent comments. BSJA president and Dhaka district and sessions' judge Mohammad Abdul Gafur sought opinions from members on a statement by the law secretary made at a press conference on Monday. The judges alleged that the law secretary delivered a "humiliating statement" against them to the press. They said the law secretary had compared their association with "a trade union", which was unjust and violated his service code. The law secretary had himself accused the judges on Monday of breaching their service code by "personally attacking" him. The judges on Wednesday denied they had made any personal attack against him. They demanded the law secretary "apologise unconditionally to the nation" for his statements. Law secretary Habibul came down hard on the association of trial court judges on Monday for what he called "a personal attack", after they called for the secretary's removal the previous week. "Action should be taken against the judges. The way they have made comments attacking me personally has tarnished my image among my family and in society," the law secretary told reporters at the Secretariat. The lower court judges had demanded Habibul's removal as law secretary for what they called his alleged actions "against" them. The BSJA chief, Abdul Gafur, had publicly stated that the High Court declared Habibul's appointment as law secretary illegal, yet he was "taking steps against judges." Habibul replied on Monday: "The final verdict is still pending on my appointment as law secretary. The matter is awaiting verdict in the Appellate Division." "Under the circumstances, the judicial officials are attempting to influence the higher court proceedings by making comments against me," he said. "Action should be taken against them on charges of breaching their code of service," said the secretary. bdnew
