 TBILISI, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian Prime Minister Grigol Mgaloblishvili resigned Friday after three months in the job, a senior government source told Reuters, citing poor health. The 35-year-old career diplomat had been undergoing treatment in Germany for a kidney condition, and was due to hold a news conference Friday. "The statement we are expecting will be about the prime minister's resignation," the source said. "It's very difficult for him to work because he's quite sick." Georgian media reports have spoken of a growing rift between Mgaloblishvili and President Mikheil Saakashvili, who was said to be disappointed with the prime minister's performance. Georgian and Russian media reported last month that Saakashvili hit Mgaloblishvili during an argument. Saakashvili has publicly denied this. Mgaloblishvili has made no public comment. Mgaloblishvili was appointed on November 1 under a government shakeup ordered by Saakashvili after the former Soviet republic's crushing military defeat by Russia in August. He was Georgia's fourth prime minister since Saakashvili came to power on the back of the 2003 "Rose Revolution."
