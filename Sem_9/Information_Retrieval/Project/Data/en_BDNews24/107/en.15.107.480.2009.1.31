<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  The city has turned into a photo lovers' paradise with major galleries exhibiting works from around the world as Dhaka hosts Chobi Mela V, the International Festival of Photography, Bangladesh 2009. Two exhibitions were inaugurated at Drik Gallery Saturday, Gallery-1 holding a show titled 'Buena Memoria' by Argentine photographer Marcelo Brodsky. A look into the young days of the photographer, the show is a nostalgic journey into days lost in the endless abyss of time. Gallery-2 featured 'Bangladesh 1971', presenting photographic document of the liberation struggle. Inaugurated by photographer Naibuddin Ahmed, this will be especially evocative for the 1971 generation and informative for those of a new generation wanting to taste the spirit of the liberation war. Both exhibitions will run till Feb 9 from 12 noon-8pm. Slices of the decade-long war in Nepal, that finally led to the beginning of a new era, are on show at the Bengal Art Gallery, as part of the photography extravaganza, touted by many as "the largest photography exhibition in Asia". A People's War is a look into the internal conflict in Nepal between 1996 and 2006. Pinpointing various dimensions of the war, the exhibition captures revolutionary zeal, the indelible pain of losing a near one, the psychological toll of warfare and everyday life moulded to suit a time of crisis. From euphoria of victory to the solemn realisation of death, the sentiments covered are multi-layered. The exhibition was inaugurated by Nurul Kabir, editor of New Age. The show will also run till Feb 9. Featuring over 60 exhibitions with 1,000 works by artists from 33 countries, the Chobi Mela's launch on Friday featured two outstanding intellectuals Mahasweta Devi and Noam Chomsky taking on the subject of 'Freedom', the theme of this year's festival. Indian social activist, Magsaysay award winner and writer Devi inaugurated the near-month long Mela by cutting the ribbon for an exhibition titled 'A Long Walk to Freedom', recreating the life and history of Nobel peace laureate Nelson Mandela, at the National Museum. She later 'met' with renowned linguist, political philosopher and author Chomsky by live video conference at the Goethe Institute to discuss the festival's theme in a lively hour-long debate that began at 8.30pm. Shahidul Alam, director of the festival says the world mostly associates photographs from Bangladesh with poverty, floods or cyclones. "Our aim was to move away from this tradition and show the world photographs of every type of joy and sorrow." The Chobi Mela, first launched in 1993, will run from Jan 30 to Feb 20 this year and its aim is to attract visitors from all walks of life. "Over sixty exhibitions, over thirty participating nations, well over a thousand images, and over fifty visiting artists from Asia alone, are impressive statistics, but the emphasis on figures is misleading," say the festivals' organisers. "The dozen or so workshops, the weeklong sessions of presentations, debates, lectures and discussions  will perhaps be what the visitors remember the most." The works of top class photographers from Bangladesh and around the world will be shown at 63 exhibitions in 11 venues around the capital, including prominent galleries and open spaces like Karwan Bazar. bd
