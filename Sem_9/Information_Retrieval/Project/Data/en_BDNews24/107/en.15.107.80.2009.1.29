<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has asked the government to bring five special judge's courts back to Dhaka for quick disposal of corruption cases. "We have requested the government to bring the courts back as the five special courts currently in the city are facing extreme pressure with graft cases," ACC director general Hanif Iqbal told bdnews24.com on Thursday. "Trial process of new cases is also being held up as the courts in the city cannot accommodate new cases due to the burden of old cases." "The courts outside Dhaka could share the load," he added. The law ministry issued an order last December to relocate five of the 10 special courts out of the capital. Two were moved to Chittagong, two to Khulna and one to Rajshahi. The special courts were originally set up at the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban to try graft suspects during the tenure of the two-year caretaker government. bdnew
