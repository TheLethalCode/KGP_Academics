<TITLE> Ensure army never 'turns on us': Alamgir </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com) Senior Awami League MP Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir on Sunday urged parliament to prevent any further military intervention into state affairs in future. "The army, who are supposed to guarantee our security, our safety, we must make sure they never turn their guns on us," Alamgir told parliament. "Otherwise, future generations will not pardon us." The former state minister also alleged that the Anticorruption Commission had become a "den of corruption", and proposed a parliamentary probe body to investigate the ACC's antigraft drives. Alamgir had harsh words too for president Iajuddin Ahmed, while delivering his speech on the president's Jan 25 address to parliament. "The president betrayed the republic and breached his oath in office," said the MP. Alamgir also alleged "the highest amount of money was laundered when Fakhruddin Ahmed was Bangladesh Bank governor". "I also propose a parliamentary body to investigate this." Echoing Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, Alamgir came down heavily on Iajuddin and ACC chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury. "It is painful for me to thank this President. "The ACC during Iajuddin's time turned into a den of corruption," said Alamgir who got 13 years for alleged corruption during the caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. He also questioned the legality of the ACC chairman's appointment and termed him a "shameless" person. "Was the appointment of the ACC chairman legal? Were the ACC rules legal?" "I propose formation of a parliamentary body to investigate the illegal activities of the ACC," he said. "This ACC tried to control politics in the name of anti-corruption drives. This ACC violated the constitution in the name of anti-corruption drives". He asked why had the ACC appointed 12 out of 18 directors from the members of the armed forces. "Is it true that only members of the defence forces are honest," he questioned. "This president has betrayed the republic. They (the president and the caretaker government) will have to be accountable for their betrayal," said Alamgir, who was state minister for planning in the previous Awami League government. Asaduzzaman Noor, A B M Golam Mostofa, Abu Jahir, A H Mahmud Ali, M A Mannan, Shamsul Haq Cowdhury, Israfil Alam and Nurul Islam also addressed their fellow MPs Sunday. The house was adjourned until 4.45 pm Monday. bdn
