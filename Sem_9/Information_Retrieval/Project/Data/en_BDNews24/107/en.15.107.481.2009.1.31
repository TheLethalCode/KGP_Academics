<TITLE> Maoists offer peace talks in Chhattisgarh </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 RAIPUR,India Jan 31(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maoist rebels in Chhattisgarh said on Saturday they were ready to hold peace talks, an offer welcomed by the state government. The Maoists' peace offer is the first since negotiations collapsed in Andhra Pradesh in 2004 where too they are active. "Our party is ready to talk to the government in the interest of the people, in the interest of the working, downtrodden masses, provided the government creates a conducive atmosphere," the Communist Party of India-Maoist's arm in Chhattisgarh and neighbouring Orissa said in a statement. Maoists, who are banned in several states including Chhattisgarh, control vast tracts of rural land in about a dozen states in east, central and parts of south India. The rebels say they are fighting for the rights of farmers and the poor, an insurgency that has claimed thousands of lives in the past four decades and has been described by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as the country's gravest internal security threat. "We welcome the offer. This is cheering news," Raman Singh, the Chhattisgarh chief minister, told Reuters about the rebel move. Another state official said the government would now look into the offer and decide on the scope of the talks and other details such as dates and interlocutors. The peace offer comes at a time when the rebels are under pressure in Chhattisgarh, the state worst-hit by the insurgency, after a police crackdown. A state police official said the talks offer could be a rebel ploy to buy time. "It is a diversionary tactic against the ongoing anti-Maoist operation that has weakened them substantially in their stronghold," said Pawan Deo, police deputy inspector general. It was not immediately clear how one section of the Maoists could offer talks, while their counterparts carried on the insurgency in other parts of the country. On Saturday, suspected Maoist rebels struck in Jharkhand, gunning down five villagers for opposing their activities, police said. In 2004, talks between a group of the rebels and Andhra Pradesh collapsed after each side accused the other of violating a ceasefire. The rebels regularly attack government property and railway stations and kill police and local politicians.
