 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Former communications minister Nazmul Huda was freed on bail Sunday night, facing a prison term of 26 years and 20 still-pending cases. "Nazmul Huda was freed from guard at his cabin at BSMMU Hospital around quarter to nine at night," deputy inspector general of prisons Shamsul Haider Siddique told bdnews24.com. Supporters greeted the former minister as he was released from the hospital to be taken home by wife Sigma Huda, daughter and other family members. The High Court on Jan 28 granted Huda three months' bail in a bribery case, the last of the cases against the BNP leader, clearing the legal barriers to his release from jail. The former minister at one point faced a total of 22 cases, of which he was acquitted in one and another case was withdrawn. Joint forces arrested him on Feb 3 last year. A special court has so far sentenced Huda to a total of 26 years in two extortion cases and one for amassing wealth beyond known sources of income. bdnew
