 MILAN, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - AC Milan are willing to pay a fee for David Beckham to remain at the Serie A club but Los Angeles Galaxy have yet to agree, chief executive Adriano Galliani said on Tuesday. The 33-year-old midfielder is on a two-month loan at Milan from Galaxy in an effort to stay in the England national team reckoning during the U.S. close season. "If Beckham comes to an agreement with Galaxy, we are ready to pay a figure. In the coming days we will meet his advisors," Galliani told Sky Sport 24. "If Los Angeles Galaxy decide not to sell him, they won't sell him." Beckham has consistently said he will return to Los Angeles when the loan runs out on March 9 but calls for him to stay have grown since he scored his first Milan goal in the 4-1 win at Bologna on Sunday. He has been tidy in three starts for the seven-times European champions and coach Carlo Ancelotti and top players at such as Kaka have already said they would like him to stay long-term. "If he decides to leave (Galaxy) and wants to do it we will welcome him with open arms but he is owned by another club and we must thank them because they have been very kind to us," Galliani added. "The player wants to stay with us but even he knows he must return to America." Beckham's spokesman Simon Oliveira told Reuters last week: "There is always going to be speculation in sports pages and newspapers. David is enjoying his time in Milan but he is contracted to return on March 9th to L.A. "It still stands and absolutely no conversations have taken place regarding changing that.
