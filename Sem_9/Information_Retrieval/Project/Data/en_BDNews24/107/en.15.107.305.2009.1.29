<TITLE> Sarkozy ex-wife burgled by jewel thieves </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Thu Jan 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thieves broke into the home of the former wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy this month and stole 500,000 euros ($654,000) worth of jewellery, police sources said on Thursday. Cecilia Attias, who divorced Sarkozy in 2007 just months after he took office, has since married public relations executive Richard Attias. Police sources said thieves broke into her upmarket house on the outskirts of Paris some days ago, but investigators have not had the chance to interview her because she is understood to be in Dubai where her husband runs an events promotion business. Sarkozy's relationship with his former wife was a turbulent one, marked by a very public separation in 2005 when Cecilia briefly left him for Attias. They eventually got back together but Cecilia's distaste for official life grew more marked after Sarkozy's election victory in 2007 and the couple officially separated in October 2007 after 11 years of marriage. Months later, Sarkozy married former supermodel Carla Bruni. A noted fashion lover who wielded considerable political influence before her split from Sarkozy, Cecilia has been making something of a media comeback and is currently adorning the cover of at least two glossy magazines on Paris newsstands
