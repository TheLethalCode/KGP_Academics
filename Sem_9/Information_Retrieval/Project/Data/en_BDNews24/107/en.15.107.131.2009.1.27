 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Jagannath University closed its doors sine die on Tuesday after clashes between police and students that left at least 50 people injured. "The first year admissions process and administrative activities will continue normally," vice chancellor Prof Abu Hossain Siddique told bdnews24.com, emerging from a syndicate meeting at around 6pm. The university syndicate came to the decision in an hour-long meeting chaired by the VC, following the clashes that erupted as JagU students protested at the "illegal occupation" of 12 halls outside the campus by local leaders and businessmen. The VC said he had sought the government's intervention to recover the grabbed halls owned by the university. Witnesses said the clashes at the university, situated in Old Dhaka, ignited around 10am when a group of Chhatra League students broke out in demonstrations to demand the recovery of the halls. The police baton charged and threw teargas to disperse them. The Awami League-backed students retaliated by hurling brickbats. Jamaat-backed Chhatra Shibir students also rallied in front of the Bangladesh Bank office demanding the halls be freed from occupation by "outsiders". As the police asked them to leave they too became involved in altercations. Kotwali police chief Abdul Hannan told bdnews24.com at least 50 people, including policemen, were hurt and police were trying their utmost so that the clashes did not spread further. The injured police were rushed to Rajarbagh Police Hospital and the students to Sumona Clinic in Old Dhaka, he said. VC Siddique told bdnews24.com after chairing the syndicate meet: "The university authorities will bear the cost of treating the hurt students, and also help to release arrested students." Earlier, on Saturday, JagU students had staged demonstrations on the campus and confined the vice chancellor to his office demanding a halt to the illegal occupation by "outsiders" of the12 dormitories situated outside the campus. They lifted the siege at the VC's office after proctor Kazi Asad assured the students of a quick solution. The demonstrators said they would go for tougher moves if their demands were not met by Monday. bdnews2
