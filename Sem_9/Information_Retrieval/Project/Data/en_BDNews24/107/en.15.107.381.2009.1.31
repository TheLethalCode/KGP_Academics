 Gazipur, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com) Two leading Imams from India delivered sermons Friday at the spiritual sessions on the first day of the Bishwa Ijtema, the second largest congregation of Muslims in the world after the hajj. Maulana Ibrahim, the Imam of Delhi Jame Masjid, gave his Aam Boyan (Main Sermon) after the Jumma prayers. Maulana Ahmed Lat, another leader of Tablig Jamaat from India, delivered his Aam Boyan after the Magrib prayers in the evening. The Dhaka-Mymensingh Road choked with traffic as devotees began arriving ahead of the midday prayers. Many just stood on the road to say their Jumma prayers as the Ijtema ground could not accommodate them. Hafez Maulana Zubayer, the Imam of Dhaka's Kakrail Jame Masjid, led the Jumma congregation of hundreds of thousand.
