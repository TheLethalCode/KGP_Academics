 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a High Court order that declared illegal Dhaka University's admission criteria for seven departments. The Appellate Division bench, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, upheld the previous ruling rejecting the DU appeal seeking a stay on the HC order. Barrister Abdur Razzak, counsel for the petitioners, told the court if the HC order was stayed madrassa students would not be able to apply for admission in the current session. The HC on Jan 20 declared illegal the criteria that students must have taken HSC or equivalent exams of 200 marks each in English and Bangla to be eligible for admission to seven departments. A group of six madrassah students with Alim degrees lodged a petition with the HC in Oct 2008, challenging the legality of the admissions criteria. The HC on Dec 2 halted the admission process of the seven departments in the 2008-09 session, pending a verdict. The seven departments are: Bangla, English, Economics, Journalism and Mass Communication, International Relations, Linguistics and Gender and Women's Studies. b
