<TITLE> Academy boss wants more book fair space </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com) The head of Bangla Academy wants more space for the institution and its annual book fair that marks the anniversary of the great Language Movement in 1952. Dr. Syed Mohammad Shahed, the director general, suggests in an interview with bdnews24.com that the adjacent real estate that has for long housed the Atomic Energy Commission but will now be vacated be given away to the Academy. "More and more claimants are scrambling for Book Fair space every year," Dr. Shahed argued. "A new building inside the academy premises has eaten up some of the much-needed space." The month-long Ekushey Book Fair begins this Sunday. "All other institutions such as the National Library, the Department of Archaeology, the National Museum have been allowed to expand in space," the director general said. "But the Academy hasn't been considered for such an expansion for the last 40 years," he said. The Academy chief executive also feels allocating stalls should not be his business. "Let our work be limited to arranging the fair, but the job of distributing stalls could go to departments like National Book Centre," he said. "For the past 15 days, we have been busy distributing stalls. And we have failed to do more important tasks." Dr Shahed said he would like to see the government help the Academy in building permanent structures for the fair. The DG said this year's fair will see 50 more stalls.
