<TITLE> Serena storms into fourth Australian Open final </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams continued her love affair with Melbourne by easing to an emphatic 6-3 6-4 victory over an in-form Elena Dementieva on Thursday to reach her fourth Australian Open final. Williams's victory under the closed roof of Rod Laver Arena ended the fourth seeded Russian's 15-game unbeaten streak in 2009 after Dementieva had earlier won titles at Auckland and Sydney. The second seeded American, who had to battle back from a 0-3 deficit in the second set after comfortably taking the first, will be hoping to continue her flawless record in Australian Open finals following her three wins from as many appearances. "I'm excited that I'm playing really consistently at least making it to the finals of grand slams," Williams told reporters. The victory was Williams's first in her last four encounters against Dementieva, who beat her American opponent on the way to the Beijing Olympic gold medal. "I definitely served better," said Williams of the difference on Thursday from her past performances against the Russian. "It's so important to serve well against her. "She's a really good returner. I moved better and I was definitely more consistent and I kept my cool." The 27-year-old Williams will meet another Russian in the title match, taking on third seed Dinara Safina. "Safina's playing well," Williams said. "She seems to never die. She's going to be a tough opponent. "She obviously wants to win. She's playing amazing and she wants to win a grand slam and go for the glory." CLOSED ROOF With Melbourne in the middle of a once-in-a-century heatwave and the air temperature above 40 degrees Celsius for a second successive day, organisers invoked the extreme heat policy at 1100 (0000 GMT) and the match began under the closed roof. The opening two games lasted eight minutes apiece with both players earning and squandering break points as they slugged it out from the baseline. Despite the nervous start, Williams had to wait until the eighth game to assert her authority, breaking Dementieva to give herself an opportunity to serve for the first set. The nine-times grand slam champion rattled through the game and sealed the first set in 44 minutes when Dementieva's audacious backhand drop shot landed narrowly wide. The start of the second set was as tense as the opener, with the first game lasting a staggering 14 minutes as Williams fashioned a string of break points only for Dementieva to snatch the advantage back and eventually hold after six deuces. The Russian then broke Williams and jumped out to a 3-0 lead before the world number two began another of her characteristic fightbacks. She held to love, then broke Dementieva in the fifth game, despite suffering a heavy fall when she was wrong-footed by a forehand drive from the Russian, though Williams said it would not be a problem for Saturday. "I usually don't feel tumbles until like four days later because of the adrenaline. I'll be home on Tuesday, I'll be like, 'oh, my God, my leg hurts'. I'll realise, 'oh, that's why'." Williams then held to level it at 3-3 before neither could hold serve, with Dementieva breaking once while Williams broke twice to give her the opportunity to serve for the match. She managed two massive aces, the second of which prompted a frustrated squeal from Dementieva and set up match point, then sealed victory after she ran the Russian around and smashed an overhand into the open court
