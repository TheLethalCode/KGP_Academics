<TEXT>
 Dhaka, January 29 (bdnews24.com)  A panel has been formed for the rehabilitation and compensation process in the Barapukurai coal mining area, said the prime minister's adviser Toufique-e-Elahi Chowdhury on Thursday. "We have no specific plan. A committee has been formed, we will consider the technical aspects," he said in a press conference. Environment and forest state minister Mustafizur Rahman said, "We have discussed rehabilitation and compensation with local people faced with land subsidence. They will get the proper compensation." "We want to extract coal, but also want to uphold people's rights. We will continue discussion and negotiations with the local people," said state minister for power, energy and mineral resources Shamsul Haq Tuku. The Barapukuria deposits, discovered in the 1980s in the northern district of Dinajpur, are estimated to hold around 390 million tonnes of coal, of which just 64 million tonnes are recoverable. Some 1.5 million tonnes coal has so far been extracted since mining began in the 1990s. The coal extraction feeds two nearby coal-based plants producing 250 MW power. But land has been subsiding in recent years in and around the mining area, and locals have faced environmental problems with land, crops and water supply due to coal extraction and the volume of water diverted by the power plants. The 20- to 30-member committee will make a proposal to the government on how they should be rehabilitated or compensated, said Mustafizur Rahman. "Coal mining is continuing, the people will not bar the mining" he added. bdn
