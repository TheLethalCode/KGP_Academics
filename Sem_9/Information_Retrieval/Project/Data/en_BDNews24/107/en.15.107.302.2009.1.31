 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was met with requests by local BNP leaders on Saturday for elder son Tarique Rahman to contest the by-elections in her vacated parliamentary seats in Bogra. "Tarique is now ill," Khaleda said of her son who 'retired from politics' before flying to the UK for medical treatment on bail last year, facing a raft of graft cases. "Whether he can contest for the seat or not, I can only tell you following the advice of his doctor," she told local stalwarts who demanded Tarique be fielded as a BNP candidate in the Bogra-6 and -7 by-elections. She sought their prayers for her son's recovery. "Pray for him so that he can stand by you after getting well again," said the former prime minister. "Tarique always stood by you in the past." Khaleda was speaking at a rally at Shaheed Zia College field in Bagbari, the village home of her late husband, BNP founder and ex-president Ziaur Rahman. The BNP chairperson arrived at Bagbari Saturday afternoon, by road from the capital, to take part in Zia's 73rd birth anniversary programme at the village. She addressed the crowd, after lunching at her father in law's house. Earlier in the day, en route to Bogra, the BNP chairperson in her first public comment on the issue said that the present government's failure to offer the post of deputy speaker to the opposition party was "a shift away from the pledges" made by. "They do not keep to their promises. They have started doing what they promised not to do," said the former prime minister. "They have shifted away from their promises." Khaleda called upon the government to create a congenial atmosphere through fulfilling its pre-election pledges. The leader of the opposition also criticised the Jatiya Sangsad seating order as rearranged by speaker of the House Abdul Hamid. "The government has snatched the opposition party's seats," said Khaleda. "We will protest if the treasury bench acts in such a way. We will even resort to action in the street if necessary," said the two-time former prime minister. Khaleda started for Bogra with a motorcade from her Dhaka cantonment residence Saturday morning. bdnes24.com/s
