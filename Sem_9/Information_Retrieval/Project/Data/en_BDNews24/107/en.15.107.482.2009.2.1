 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Reigning B. League champions Abahani Limited are likely to host Group C matches of the AFC President's Cup in May, said a Bangladesh Football Federation official. Abahani were drawn in Group C along with Turkmenistan's Ashgabat and Sri Lanka Army in the AFC President's Cup, an international competition for clubs whose countries belong to the third tier in the Asian rankings. The Dhaka giants had earlier rejected AFC's proposal to host the matches, but the club changed their stand following discussion between BFF president Kazi Salahuddin and Abahani director Salman F Rahman. "Abahani now want to host their Group C matches and I let AFC know about Abahani's wishes as soon as possible. Besides, one of our colleagues (Anwarul Haq Helal) is now staying in the AFC headquarters and he will discuss this matter with the AFC officials" Salahuddin told reporters on Sunday. The matches are scheduled to be held on May 6-16. Nepal Police Club will also host their matches of Group A, which includes defending champions Regar TadAZ of Tajikistan, Taiwan Power Company of Chinese Taipei and Pakistan's Wapda. Kyrgyzstan's Dordoi-Dynamo, who won two straight President's Cup titles before Regar-TadAZ dethroned them last year, are in Group C with Kanbawza FC, of Myanmar, Cambodia's Phnom Penh Crown and Yeezdin FC of Bhutan. Three top teams from each group will advance into the knock-out stage. These three teams will be joined with the last four by the best runners-up from the group stage. bd
