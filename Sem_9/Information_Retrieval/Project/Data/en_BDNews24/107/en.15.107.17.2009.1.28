 MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An angry Svetlana Kuznetsova questioned the enforcement of the extreme heat policy at the Australian Open on Wednesday after she wasted an opportunity to defeat an out-of-sorts Serena Williams in the quarter-finals. Kuznetsova had taken the first set as a visibly distressed Williams wilted under the sun on Rod Laver Arena, where air temperatures reached in excess of 43 degrees Celsius. They were then forced off to allow the roof to be closed. The eighth seeded Russian also served for the match in the second set, only for the 27-year-old American to break back, seize the momentum and seal a semi-final showdown against Elena Dementieva with a 5-7 7-5 6-1 victory. Organisers use a complicated formula that combines the air temperature, wind, solar radiation and humidity before deciding when to invoke the extreme heat policy. "Yeah, definitely angry. Why should I not be," Kuznetsova told reporters. "Game going my way. I'm fine playing with the roof (open). "I think the guys yesterday, it was the same weather. Everybody was playing with the roof (open). Why today they had to close it? I didn't get it. That was why I was angry." Kuznetsova agreed that closing the roof had changed the match, though she also felt she should have sealed it when leading in the second set. "Definitely it was a big change (closing the roof). I was very comfortable playing outside. "I saw it's tough for her. It was not very easy for me, but I managed to move pretty well. I was fine. "I guess it's two different games. One you play inside; one outside. "It doesn't matter. I still had my chance. Even with roof closed, I was 5-3 up, 5-4, serving for the match. I just didn't do that.
