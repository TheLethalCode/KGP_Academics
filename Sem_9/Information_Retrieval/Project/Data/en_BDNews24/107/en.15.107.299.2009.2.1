 NEW DELHI, Sun Feb 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned home on Sunday after undergoing heart bypass surgery at a New Delhi hospital, officials said. "He has recovered very well and is resting at home," K.S. Reddy, his personal physician, told Reuters. Singh's illness came as his Congress party prepares its campaign for a month-long general election likely to begin in early April. Doctors operated on the 76-year-old leader on Jan. 24 after they found blockages in his arteries during a health check up. "It's going to take him about two-three weeks to come to office and work. In fact in a week's time he is going to start working from home," Union Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss said. "He was very cheerful, in fact he was walking." Singh had a heart bypass surgery in 1990 in the United Kingdom. He also had a wrist operation in 2006, a prostate gland surgery and a cataract removal procedure last year, officials said. The main battle in the coming election is between the ruling Congress-led government and a coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party
