 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Abahani Limited topped Group A with an emphatic eight-wicket win over archrivals Mohammedan Sporting Club in the Premier Division Twenty20 League at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Wednesday. Shahagir Hossain struck an unbeaten 41 off 34 balls as Abahani raced to 119 for two with 15 balls to go after Mohammedan had made a paltry 115 for seven in the stipulated 20 overs. Put in to bat first, holders Mohammedan's batsmen fell in trouble in the face of disciplined bowling from Abahani and set their archrivals to chase a poor target. Shamsur Rahman and Nasiruddin gave Mohammedan a fine start, putting on 35 runs for the opening stand before first-change paceman Ziaur Rahman drew the first blood to dismiss the latter playing a 16-ball 10. Left-arm spinner Arafat Sunny then trapped opener Shamsur leg before for 36 and skipper Mashrafee Bin Mortaza bowled Faisal Hossain for five to reduce Mohammedan to 79 for three in 14.4 overs. Later, Marshal Ayub played a 20-ball 21 as Mohammedan passed the 100-run mark. Ziaur took three wickets for 25 while Mashrafee and Arafat chipped in with two wickets each for 18 and 22. In reply, Abahani openers Rony Talukdar and Imran Ahmed gave their side a solid start putting on 46 runs before Rony fell to Suhrawardi Shuvo for 18. Imran made a 38-ball 36 studded with three fours and one six while Shahagir and Nasir Hossain remained unbeaten on 41 and 11 to steer Abahani easily home. In the day's other matches of Group A, Young Pegasus (121/7) thrashed Victoria Sporting Club (116/8) by five runs to join Mohammedan Sporting Club, who have four points from three matches. Partex Sporting Club tasted the first win in three matches when they handed a six-wicket defeat to Old DOHS, who lost to Abahani in the previous round.
