 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com telcoms correspondent Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd efforts to provide commercial broadband Internet connections may be delayed as only one organisation submitted a tender for the process, said a senior BTCL official on Saturday. "BTCL is evaluating if it would be appropriate to take into consideration the tender of only one company," evaluation committee head of BTCL Habibur Rahman told bdnews24.com. The company asked for tenders on Dec 12, with last date of submission on Jan 11. "A full evaluation of the tender will be completed in the next week," said Habibur. BTCL managing director Ashraful Alim told bdnews24.com: "Efforts are underway to provide commercial broadband connections as soon as possible." The conditions of the tender barred Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from applying. They also state that the tender winner would offer Internet services to subscribers on behalf of BTCL. MM Systems was the lone company to submit a tender, said BTCL officials. They added that if the sole tender is not picked then the process will be delayed. BTCL says its broadband Internet connections would be provided in Dhaka, Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Bogra and other district towns. Connections will use ADCL technology, which allows the subscriber to operate both telephone and Internet using the same line, and a modem costing Tk4-5,000. BTCL currently provides dial-up Internet connections for public, without a connection fee and charging Tk0.10 (off-peak) and Tk0.15 (peak) per minute, or an hourly payment of Tk6 and Tk9. BTCL also provides broadband Internet connections and digital data network to selected areas and organisations. At present there are about 800,000 Internet connections throughout the country, with the number of ISP subscribers standing at more than 100,000. BTCL has 30,000 subscribers and mobile and PSTN operators are providing services to 500,000 subscribers using EDGE and GPRS technology. 170 organisations have been given licenses to provide Internet connections in the private sector. bdnew
