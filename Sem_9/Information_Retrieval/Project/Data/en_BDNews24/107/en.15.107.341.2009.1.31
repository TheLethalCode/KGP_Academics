 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia, in her first public comment on the issue, said Saturday that the government's failure to offer the post of deputy speaker to the opposition party was "a shift away from the pledges" made by. "They do not keep to their promises. They have started doing what they promised not to do," said the former prime minister. "They have shifted away from their promises." Khaleda called upon the government to create a congenial atmosphere by fulfilling its pre-election pledges. The opposition leader also criticised the Jatiya Sangsad seating order as rearranged by speaker of the House Abdul Hamid. "The government has snatched the opposition party's seats," said Khaleda. She warned the government of the danger of "making anti-state steps in parliament". "We will protest if the treasury bench acts in such a way. We will even resort to action in the street if necessary," said the two-time former prime minister. Khaleda was addressing a street rally in Sirajganj en route to Bogra, to take part in a ceremony to mark the 73rd birthday of her late husband and former president Ziaur Rahman at his village of Baghbari. bdne
