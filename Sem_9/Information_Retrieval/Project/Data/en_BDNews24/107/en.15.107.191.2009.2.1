 Chittagong, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)An Awami League MP caused a stir in Chittagong after showing up at a social event along with an alleged war criminal, who is also a local Jamaat-e-Islami figure. The Chittagong-10 MP, Abdul Latif, also president of the Chittagong Chamber, later said he had no knowledge about the background of Moulana Shamsuddin, president of the Islami Social Welfare Council. "I learnt after attending the programme that Moulana Shamsuddin is a 'war criminal'," Latif told bdnews24.com. Speaking to bdnews24.com, a local commander of the Bengal Liberation Force (BLF) during the 1971 war, Kazi Inamul Huq Danu, and liberation war historian Dr Mahfuzur Rahman gave details about Shamsuddin's role. "The Moulana was one of those who controlled the city's notorious torture cell at the Dalim Hotel," said Dr Rahman. Danu confirmed the historian's version. The MP was chief guest and the Moulana special guest at the ceremony, hosted by the local Chashi Kalyan Samity, a Jamaat-e-Islami outfit, at the Rajmukut Community Centre at Boropul in the city. "I joined a social event, where 17 couples wed without any involvement of dowry. My son was among those who got married," Latif told bdnews24.com. The deputy head of Jamaat in Chittagong, Afsar Uddin Chowdhury, and Muktijddha Sangsad commander Mozaffar Ahmed were also present at the event. "Shamsuddin is a war criminal," said freedom fighter Danu, also general secretary of the AL city committee. "I am not sure whether the MP knew what he was doing. If he did it knowingly, he has done wrong." bdnews24.co
