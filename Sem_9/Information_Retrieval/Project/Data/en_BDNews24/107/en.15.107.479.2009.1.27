 Chittagong, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The pile-up of imported cars at Chittagong port has grown to near double the port's capacity, reaching over 5,000 vehicles with numbers rising everyday, the port authority chairman said on Tuesday. "The importers' lethergy in releasing the vehicles has doubled the number of cars awaiting release," commodore RU Ahmed told a meeting of newly elected BARVIDA officials. "At this moment, there are 5,322 vehicles piled up in the port against a capacity of only 2,800, seriously hindering regular port activities," he said. The port authority has announced penalty rental charges effective from Jan. 31 to help ease the car clot, officials said. The Bangladesh Reconditioned Vehicles Importers and Dealers Association has asked the port authority to increase car housing space and not impose fees without consultation. "We have decided to construct multi-storied sheds to accommodate the vehicles," the CPA chairman said. "The size of the penalty charges will be fixed after talks with BARVIDA members," he added. "The penalty does not aim to make profit but give message to importers that the port's capacity is seriously overstretched," said Ahmed. BARVIDA president Habibullah said: "With the penalty fees, importers will face additional expenses from Tk 40,000 to Tk 1 lakh since buyers will not pay the extra." He claimed the delay in releasing cars was due to the parliamentary and Upazila elections. "The situation will improve soon," he said. bdnews24.
