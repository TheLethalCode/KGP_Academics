 MELBOURNE, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - If Dinara Safina wins Saturday's Australian Open final, don't expect any wild parties or crazy celebrations from her. The 22-year-old is on the verge of winning her maiden grand slam title after advancing to Saturday's final against American Serena Williams. There is also the added bonus for the winner as the number one ranking is also up for grabs. But neither of these prizes has tempted Safina to let her hair down. Unlike her older brother Marat Safin, whose post-match celebrations were just as famous as some of his on-court performances, Safina does not go to nightclubs and rarely touches alcohol.

Safina has spent most of her tennis career living in the shadow of her more famous sibling but has now grabbed the spotlight herself. While Safin has struggled with injuries and slipped down the rankings in the last few seasons, Safina's career is on the ascendency. She won four titles last year, made her first grand slam final at the French Open and won a silver medal at the Beijing Olympics. Her brother was knocked out in the third round at Melbourne Park this year by Roger Federer and has since returned home to Moscow where he will be watching Saturday's final on television with the rest of their family. "It would be amazing to have the same trophy as my brother. It'll be a dream come true," she said. "It was his birthday two days ago, maybe I have earned some money to buy him a gift
