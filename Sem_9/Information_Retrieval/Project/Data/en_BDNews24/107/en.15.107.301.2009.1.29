 MUMBAI, Thu Jan 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country's largest car maker, missed forecasts with a 54.3 percent fall in quarterly profit as high material costs and adverse currency changes in a sluggish market squeezed margins. Vehicle makers in India face daunting task as a slowing economy crimps consumer spending, although a drop in commodity prices such as steel should help Maruti bring down costs in the coming quarters. Maruti's shares rebounded more than 6 percent after falling initially as the sharper drop in earnings was partly caused by higher depreciation, while a cut in state-set fuel prices on Wednesday could help demand, analysts said. "On the operating front the results were not bad. If you take the additional provisioning and add that, the results will be in line with expectations," said Surjit Arora, analyst with Prabhudas Lilladher. "There are also other factors such as the fuel price cuts and the effect of commodity prices coming down all of which are creating an optimism," he said. New Delhi-based Maruti, which holds almost half the Indian car market with models such as the best-selling Alto and Swift hatchbacks, raised the prices of some models on Tuesday to cover increased input costs and foreign currency changes. [ID:nBMB004385] Japan's Toyota Motor Corp Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co have all said they would delay expanding capacity in India, partly to conserve cash in a declining global car market. Toyota said last month it would shrink planned output capacity at its next factory in India due to start production in 2010. Maruti, 54.2 percent owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp also faces competition from the Indian unit of Hyundai Motors with its i10 and recently launched i20 hatchback. Net profit fell to 2.14 billion rupees ($43.8 million) in its fiscal third quarter ended December from 4.67 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier. Net sales fell to 46.26 billion rupees from 46.74 billion rupees. That compared with a net profit forecast of 2.48 billion rupees on net sales of 43.22 billion in a Reuters poll. Vehicle sales fell to 173,494 units in the December quarter, down 14 percent from a year earlier. Maruti has been trying to shift consumers to premium models such as the DZire and SX4 sedans. Maruti has so far resisted production cuts even as other vehicle makers reduced output to prevent inventory build-up. Shares in Maruti, valued at $3.2 billion, were trading up 3.2 percent at 537.35 rupees by 2.56 p.m. (0926 GMT) in a Mumbai market that was down 0.6 percent. The stock fell 24.3 percent in the December quarter in line with main index that lost a quarter. ($1 = 48.9 rupees
