<TITLE> Politicians fail to grasp trade potential: Faruq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)Politicians in Bangladesh have too often failed to understand the potential of trade for development, commerce minister Faruq Khan said Sunday at a regional trade conference in the capital. "To politicians, trade is something that is dealt with only by businesses and economists," he said at the inaugural session of the talks attended by economists and policymakers from across the region. The minister came down hard on the failure by politicians, saying parliament rarely hears any focused discussions on trade "Governments use trade as a tool of politics rather than development". He also said that politicians have been unsuccessful in understanding the people's requirements. Faruq said the main challenge for progress in the sector was the failure to realise its contribution towards development. "Other challenges, such as infrastructural support, could be solved if there is political will," he added. As guest speaker, economist Rehman Sobhan stressed carving trade policies in a manner where all participants can be benefited. "Trade is not only about the owners and policymakers; policies should also look into matters like benefits to workers." He said industrial actions are also social actions as livelihoods depend on it. The conference, 'Mainstreaming International Trade into National Development: Some Perspectives from South Asia', was organised by South Asian Network and Economic Model (SANEM) and CUTS International, with the inaugural session being held. Sunday's session, at the Dhaka Sheraton, also heard from SANEM executive director Selim Raihan and research director of CUTS International Siddhartha Mitra. bdn
