<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Jan 31(bdnews24.com)Centenarian 'Biplobi' Binod Behari Chowdhury took to the street on Saturday to protect two of Chittagong's most noted girls' schools, Aparnacharan and Krishna Kumari Schools, in a move reminiscent of Chittagong's heroic daughter Pritilata Waddedar. Chittagong City Corporation have taken steps to demolish the two historic schools to build multi-storeyed commercial buildings. Binod began a token hunger strike in front of the schools on Saturday, with leading citizens of the city and workers of different organisations joining the protest in response to his call. The elderly activist sought the intervention of the prime minister and education minister to save the two schools. "We will hope the government will resist the move to build commercial buildings at the cost of schools," he said. Chittagong Mayor Mohiuddin Chowdhury has placed an advertisement in a local daily defending the move, saying that "an education-friendly multi-storeyed building and complex is being built for Aparnacharan and Krishna Kumari schools". "Those who look to this great initiative in any other way than the development of an education-friendly modern complex for these two historic schools have taken a condemnable role to tarnish the successes of the Chittagong City Corporation," said the advertisement. "This role is not desirable from any quarters interested in education. So I want to let you know with firmness that the proposed education-friendly complex will be built." Binod said on Saturday: "The mayor has taken a unilateral move to demolish the schools." He lashed out at those who are taking the initiative to construct "commercial buildings" by demolishing the schools. "They acted like madmen by undertaking such a project," he said. Claiming that the mayor had taken up the initiative only for business interests, Binod Behari said: "Money is needed for development of the city, but the need for money can be met through other means." 'Biplobi' ('Revolutionary') Binod reminisced about Pritilata, his co-revolutionary in past times. "Chittagong's heroic daughter, a martyr in the anti-British movement, was the first headmistress of Aparnacharan School." He announced that the people of Chittagong would resist the move to build commercial buildings on the site. Members of Samajtantric Chhatra Front, Chhatra Federation, Charan Cultural Centre and other organisations also spoke in support of the cause. Samajtantric Chhatra Front also held a rally in the city. Speakers said trade and education cannot co-exist, and their movement would continue unless the city corporation stopped the project. bdnews24.co
