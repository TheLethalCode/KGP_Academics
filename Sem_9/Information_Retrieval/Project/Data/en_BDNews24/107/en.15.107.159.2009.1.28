 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)Speaker Abdul Hamid has reshuffled the seating order of the House giving four instead of nine front row seats to the main opposition BNP. "I had to take a middle position by giving four front seats to the BNP as the ruling party was tough on sacrificing. They were not interested at all in giving them more than three seats according to their party strength," Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com Wednesday afternoon. "The BNP was also firm on keeping the nine front row seats they got from the outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar," said Hamid. Two ministers and three senior MPs of the ruling coalition were given BNP's five other seats on the front row, he said. He added that Oli Ahmed of the Liberal Democratic Party has kept his previous seat in the front row to the left of the speaker. "I have put Mujibur Rahman, Hasanul Huq Inu, Rashed Khan Menon, GM Quader and Dilip Barua in the front row by placing five BNP MPs in the back benches to the left," Hamid said. bdn
