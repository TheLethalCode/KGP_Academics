<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Fri Jan 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Mumbai attacks were not planned from Pakistan, the country's high commissioner to Britain told an Indian television news channel on Friday. "Pakistani territory was not used so far as the investigators have made their conclusions," Wajid Shamsul Hassan, Pakistan's high commissioner in Britain, told NDTV channel in an interview. This is the first time a Pakistani top official has commented on the dossier of evidence which India handed over to them. "They categorically informed me that UK was not involved. Pak was not involved. Its territories were not used for planning this operation," Hassan said on Friday. India and Pakistan have been exchanging heated rhetoric since the Mumbai attacks that killed 179 people in November. India says they were carried out by Pakistani nationals and must have had support from Pakistani state agencies, but Pakistan denies that and says it will cooperate with Indian authorities
