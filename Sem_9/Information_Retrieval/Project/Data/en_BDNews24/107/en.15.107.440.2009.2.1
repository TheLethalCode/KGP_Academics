<TITLE> Abahani look step closer to B. League title </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)  Abahani Limited look one-step closer to the professional football league title as the leaders take on Brothers Union in the crucial B. League encounter on Monday at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Reigning champions Abahani need only four points in their remaining three matches to retain the most prestigious crown as the sky blue outfit lead the points table with a six-point cushion over archrivals Mohammedan SC and Sheikh Russel KC. Mohammedan SC and Sheikh Russel are on an equal 35 points from 17 outings while Abahani stay atop with 41 points also from 17 matches. Abahani, however, have to cross the hurdles of Brothers Union, Sheikh Russel and giant-killer Rahmatganj MFS, who stunned the Dhanmondi-based outfit 2-1 in the league opener. The sky blues are flying high after ousting their old foes Mohammedan 2-1 in the second-leg match and have six consecutive wins under their belt. But, they looked a bit shaky against Muktijoddha Sangsad in the previous match. "We want to maintain the gap with Mohammedan and Sheikh Russel and there is no room for relaxation," Abahani manager Sattyajit Das Rupu. "We are looking forward to winning the match against Brothers, who defeated us in the first-leg match," said Rupu adding that they had only problem with midfielder Arif Khan Joy. He added that Joy would take field if he was fit. On the other hand, Brothers Union, who already slipped out of the title race, have been passing a bad patch to have failed to secure a single triumph in their last four outings, even against lowly Arambagh KS and Muktijoddha Sangsad. The Gopibagh-based outfit, Brothers Union, stay at number four position with 28 points from 16 matches. "It is truth that we have no chance to win the title, but we are still hopeful to finish second, winning all our four remaining matches," said Brothers manager Amer Khan. The return of Motiur Munna will certainly strengthen Brothers' midfield as the playmaker missed the previous match against Muktijoddha Sangsad, who held the all-oranges to a goalless draw. bd
