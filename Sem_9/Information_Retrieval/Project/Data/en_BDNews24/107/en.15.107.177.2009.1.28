 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said she is not in favour of banning student politics, in talks with visiting German foreign secretary Reinhard Silberberg on Wednesday. "I find nothing wrong with students doing politics. But their approach should be positive and constructive," a statement from the PM's office quoted her as saying. Hasina emphasised motivating students in socio-cultural and nation building activities. "We have committed to making education free of cost up to graduate level as we believe that without an educated population, a country can't be developed," the prime minister said. Hasina and Silberberg discussed more German investment in Bangladesh, increase in trade and commerce between the two countries as well as a possible joint venture to develop skilled manpower in Bangladesh. She also requested Germany to receive more skilled manpower from Bangladesh. Silberberg said Germany has pledged to increase assistance in the development of Bangladesh's energy sector, particularly renewable solar power. Hasina told the foreign secretary: "Bangladesh has made good progress in solar power. As a global leader of solar power Germany can cooperate more in advancing Bangladesh's effort in expanding the sector." She also informed the German secretary that her government would arrange trial of the war criminals with the help of the United Nations. On picking up deputy speaker from the main opposition the prime minister said they had waited till the last minute for a nomination from the opposition prior to election of the speaker and the deputy speaker but they did not come up with any proposal. bd
