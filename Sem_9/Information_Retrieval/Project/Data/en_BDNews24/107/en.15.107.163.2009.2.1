<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina ssays books sustained her during the "lonely" days of her detention between 2007 and 2008. "Books were my only companions in my lonely life in prison," said the PM on Sunday as she opened the month-long Amar Ekushey Boi Mela at the Bangla Academy. "My time in jail was a great opportunity for me to read, and I realised once again the importance of books," Hasina said of the 11 months she spent in special jail, from July 2007 to June 2008, facing graft charges. The habit of reading books can be useful in everyone's daily life, she said. The prime minister advised the younger generation to read more books as, she said, a nation cannot develop without a well-educated people. "A change in the thinking of the young generation must be brought through books." "Educational institutions must be free from criminal activities and session jam to establish a favourable educational environment there," she said. In her speech, Sheikh Hasina also mulled reviving the International Mother Language Research Institute, which was conceived during her previous Awami League government. "The then-UN secretary general Kofi Annan had inaugurated the Institute's building in the city. But it's a pity that the next government coming into power in 2001 suspended the project," she said. "If the institute can be revived, then research on some 4,000 languages worldwide is possible, as it has now become our duty to protect endangered languages across the world." The 'Amar Ekushey' Boi Mela or "Immortal (February) 21st" Book Fair commemorates the 1952 Language Movement. Feb 21, has been observed worldwide as International Mother Language Day since UNESCO declared the day in 1999. The PM assured her government's full-fledged cooperation including allotting money to the Bangla Academy in researching language. She said her government would also take necessary initiatives in protecting cultural heritage. Hasina said the Academy needed a stronger cell for translation. "There are many valuable and worthy books in Bangla language, but they are not getting proper international attraction due to the lack of good translations into other languages," she said. "On the other hand, many valuable books from around the world are not being translated into Bangla." No Bangla writer since Rabindranath Tagore has been awarded the Nobel for literature, she said. The PM, arriving at the Boi Mela at 4pm, was welcomed by director general of the Bangla Academy Syed Mohammad Shahed. As visiting Indian activist and writer Mahasweta Devi arrived at the venue, the prime minister asked for her to be brought to the dais. Devi, seated beside Hasina, thanked her. Academy head Shahed, head of UPL Mohiuddin Ahmed, national professor Kabir Chowdhury and state minister for culture Abul Kalam Azad also spoke at the inaugural ceremony. The annual book fair, showcasing a significant chunk of the country's publications and celebrating the mother tongue, was opened to the public from 5pm Sunday. The number of participating organisations has risen this year to 297 from last year's 236, with a total of 436 stalls, a significant rise from last year's 362. . Stalls have been allotted on both sides of the road at Bangla Academy for the first time this year. The book fair remains open to the public everyday from 3pm till 9pm and on weekends from 11am till 9pm through the month of February. bdnew
