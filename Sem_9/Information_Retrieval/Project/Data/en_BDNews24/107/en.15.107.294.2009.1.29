 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)The government will review the approval of 41 private medical colleges operating in Bangladesh, health minister AFM Ruhul Haq told parliament on Thursday. "I think the approval of the 41 private medical colleges throughout the country should be reviewed," Haq said in reply to a question by Awami League MP Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin. Mohiuddin alleged that the private colleges have been operating without proper facilities or government guidelines. In reply to a separate question, the health minister said the government would formulate an up-to-date medicine policy with a view to upgrading the standard of pharmaceutical drugs and making the country self-reliant. He said the government would also reintroduce the 'community clinics' initiated by the previous Awami League government. "The government will provide all medicine and necessary logistics to the clinics for providing basic primary health care," he said. bdn
