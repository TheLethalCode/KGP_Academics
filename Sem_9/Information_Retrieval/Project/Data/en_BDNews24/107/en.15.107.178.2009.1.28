 DAMBULLA, Sri Lanka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni hit an unbeaten 61 in 65 balls to lead India to a six-wicket victory in the opening one-dayer against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. Set 247 to win after Sanath Jayasuriya had scored 107 for the home side, opener Gautam Gambhir laid the foundations with 62 and added 113 for the second wicket with Suresh Raina (54). Earlier, the 39-year-old Jayasuriya became the oldest centurion in one-day internationals and went past the 13,000-run mark after cracking 10 fours and one six. All-rounder Farveez Maharoof, promoted up the order, also chipped in with 35. Dhoni had won the toss and chose to bowl first in the hope of exploiting early seam movement. Tillakaratne Dilshan was run out for a duck in the first over but Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara negotiated the initial threat of the new ball with intelligent batting. Jayasuriya put on 118 for the second wicket with fellow left-hander Sangakkara (44). LATTER STAGES Sri Lanka looked poised for a large total but India pegged them back in the latter stages of the innings. Thilina Kandamby (17) spooned a catch to mid off and Jayasuriya skied another catch to mid off, reducing the hosts to 171 for four. Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene's low-scoring run continued as he top-edged a sweep and was out for 11. Paceman Ishant Sharma was the most successful of the Indian bowlers, claiming three for 52. India's reply started badly when Sachin Tendulkar (5) was unfortunate to be judged lbw to an inswinger from Thilina Thushara that pitched outside leg-stump. That was counter-balanced by a reprieve for Gambhir who was lucky to get the benefit of the doubt after a caught and bowled decision was referred to the TV umpire. Sri Lanka were also guilty of poor fielding as Dilshan grassed a simple chance at backward point when Raina had made six. The home side clawed their way back into the game when Gambhir was caught in the deep and Raina was run out, leaving India 137 for three. Dhoni, however, took command by adding 44 with Yuvraj Singh (23) and an unbroken 66-run stand with Rohit Sharma (25 not out). The second game in the five-match series is in Colombo on Saturday
