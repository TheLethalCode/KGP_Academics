 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina announced the adoption of sign language at state level on Sunday. "Based on long time demands, I am formally making the announcement today," she said as she launched the month-long Ekushey Boi Mela at the Bangla Academy. "This mode of communication will begin in BTV news and certain other programmes and, gradually, sign language will be adopted by the other media outlets," said the PM. She hoped that private TV channels would welcome the move and come forward in its support. Hasina, arriving at the Boi Mela at 4pm, was welcomed by director general of the Bangla Academy Syed Mohammad Shahed. As visiting Indian activist and writer Mahasweta Devi arrived at the venue at 4pm, the prime minister asked for her to be brought to the dias. Devi, seated by the prime minister, thanked the latter. Academy head Shahed, head of UPL Mohiuddin Ahmed, national professor Kabir Chowdhury and state minister for culture Abul Kalam Azad also spoke at the inaugural ceremony. The annual book fair, showcasing a significant chunk of the country's publications and celebrating the mother tongue, was opened to public from 5pm. The number of participating organisations has risen this year to 297 from last year's 236, with a total of 436 stalls, a significant rise from last year's 362. . Stalls have been allotted on both sides of the road at Bangla Academy for the first time, so the main gate has been built on the road in front of the Atomic Energy Commission on the Dhaka University campus. Children's hour at this year's Mela will be between 11am and 3pm on Feb 6, 7 and 27. Only adults accompanying children will be allowed to enter the fair during these hours.
