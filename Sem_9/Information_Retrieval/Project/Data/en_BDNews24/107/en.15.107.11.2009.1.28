 MILAN, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - David Beckham's bright start to his AC Milan career is good for the England team, national coach Fabio Capello said on Tuesday. The midfielder joined Milan on a two-month loan from Los Angeles Galaxy this month in a bid to stay in the England reckoning during the long U.S. close season. Capello, who will watch the midfielder in action at the San Siro against Genoa on Wednesday, gave his strongest hint yet that the 33-year-old would be in his squad for the friendly in Spain on Feb. 11. "I'm happy for Milan and I'm happy for the national team," Capello told reporters at the recording of a Mediaset television show in Milan. "He is a serious, well-prepared lad and is a great example for the youngsters. Beckham is the perfect professional and above all a humble man." The former Manchester United and Real Madrid winger, who needs two more caps to beat Bobby Moore's record of 108 England appearances, has played three games for Milan and scored one goal. The Rossoneri have been so impressed they are seeking ways of making his move permanent should Beckham and Galaxy agree. He has been playing as part of a midfield three and has dropped very deep at times to help with defensive duties. "Probably the role he is playing suits him as he hasn't got the pace now to go one-on-one with players. He is tactically very intelligent and can make good passes," Capello said
