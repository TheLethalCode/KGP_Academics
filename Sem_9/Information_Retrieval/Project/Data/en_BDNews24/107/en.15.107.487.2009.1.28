 Dhaka, Jan 25 (bdnews24.com)Germany will continue to provide development assistance to Bangladesh despite the spread of financial crisis in Europe, said visiting German foreign secretary Reinhard Silberberg on Wednesday. "There is a strong commitment of our government that the countries we are working with should not suffer from the international financial crisis," Silbeberg, who arrived in Dhaka Tuesday evening, told reporters at a state guest house. "My government has said very clearly, we will keep our high level of assistance and we will increase it step by step as part of our promise for the millennium development goals policy," said Silbeberg, who is heading his delegation in Bangladesh-Germany foreign secretary level talks. According to its embassy in Dhaka, Germany has provided  4.4 billion as direct assistance or indirect multilateral aid over the past 37 years since Bangladesh's independence. Germany is also the second largest destination for Bangladeshi exports. Bangladesh foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told newsmen: "We had extremely free and frank discussion on all areas of cooperation between our two countries. The areas include trade, aid, investment and of course cooperation in international organisations." On the trade side, Silberberg said, "We favour Bangladesh exports and I said to my colleague that we are very much in favour of a German trade deficit with your country". An increasing annual trade volume between the two countries is set to reach about 2 billion, with Bangladesh enjoying an annual trade surplus of more than 1.3 billion. Silberberg, who earlier served as a diplomat in Dhaka from 1980-84, also called on prime minister Sheikh Hasina at her office in the morning. He visited foreign minister Dipu Moni later in the day. bdn
