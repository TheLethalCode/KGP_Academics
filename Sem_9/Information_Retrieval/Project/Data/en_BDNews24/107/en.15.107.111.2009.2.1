 DAVOS, Switzerland, Sun Feb 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United States is working to ensure that any stimulus package for the economy is in line with international trade rules, acting US Trade Representative Peter Allgeier said on Saturday. Trade ministers meeting in the Swiss ski resort of Davos on had expressed concern that "Buy America" provisions in the $825 billion stimulus bill passed by the House of Representatives could shut imports of other countries out of the US market and fuel protectionism. "We are certainly working with the Congress, with the White House, to make sure whatever we do in response to the economic crisis is consistent with our obligations," Allgeier told Reuters after the meeting. Allgeier also said the administration hopes that the Senate will schedule confirmation hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee as US Trade Representative, Ron Kirk, in the next couple of weeks
