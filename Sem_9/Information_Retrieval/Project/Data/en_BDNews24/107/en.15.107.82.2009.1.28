<TITLE> Federer and Roddick call for review of timeout rule </TITLE>

 MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Roger Federer and Andy Roddick have called for a review of the rule allowing players to take medical timeouts for cramping to stop it being abused. The issue came to a head at the Australian Open on Tuesday when defending champion Novak Djokovic called for a break during his quarter-final against Roddick. The Serbian was complaining of cramping and "general soreness" and asked a trainer to massage his legs, neck and shoulders. He returned to the court but gave up shortly after while trailing 6-7 6-4 6-2 2-1. Roddick said he was satisfied that Djokovic was genuinely injured and had acted within the rules but said he still did not like the rule, which allows up to 10 minutes for a break. "Let me preface this so no one twists it everything Novak did today was well within his rights and the rules. It's simply about my opinion of a rule," Roddick told a news conference. "If you want to get something on a switchover for cramping, I think that would be okay. "As for physical condition, it's very easy to say, it's one injury, but you can get rubbed for a cramp. "I looked over and I was confused, because I thought it was one injury per timeout, and I saw a calf, a neck, and an arm but I guess cramping is one condition. "There's obviously a little bit of grey area there. Hopefully we'll be able to do something about it." Federer, who serves as the president of the ATP Players Council, was also concerned about the rule. "It's a fine line, isn't it?," he said. "I really felt when I was coming up the young players abused it, especially against a player like me. "I'm almost in favour of saying, you know what, if you're not fit enough, just get out of here. TOUGH CALL "But if something really bad happens, okay, it is just unfortunate, I guess. "It's a tough call. I guess we'll speak about it and see what happens." Federer also had mixed feelings about Djokovic's complaint that he was hard done because he played his fourth-round match late on Sunday night then his quarter-final on Tuesday afternoon. Djokovic had asked to play his quarter-final during Tuesday's evening session when the weather was cooler but organisers put Federer on instead. "At the beginning of the tournament you have a hundred players requesting something. You can't always give the players everything they want," Federer said. "I was the lucky guy who played tonight but I would have been ready to play in the heat as well. I like playing in the heat. "Novak had a day off. It's not like he had to play the next day at 11:00 in the morning. He still had a day and a half off. "I don't think it's the end of the world." Roddick agreed with Djokovic that switching from night matches to day was hard and suggested organisers should consider changing their night programmes. There are normally two matches played on the Australian Open centre court each night, a women's match followed by a men's, but if the women's match goes three sets, the men often have to play well past midnight. "To be fair, it's very hard and I've had to do it at the U.S. Open probably more than anybody," Roddick said. "My only suggestion would be, and hopefully this will be well received, if everything is equal all across the way, I feel like maybe the men should get the first match every once in a while during the first week of a slam. "If all things are equal, then I feel like the scheduling should be the same.
