 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  Government purchases will go online to prevent corruption and bring transparency in procurement, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith has said. "Online purchases will also remove red tape," said Muhith at the launch of the five-day BASIS SoftExpo 2009 on Tuesday. "The whole of government administration will eventually be computerised, in line with Awami League's vision of a 'Digital Bangladesh' by 2011," said the minister. The government, in consultation with Bangladesh Computer Samity, BASIS and other experts, will draw up a roadmap for the 2011 goal, he said. "I love to dream and I want to see that by 2021, the IT sector in Bangladesh will be the second largest export sector after the garment industry," said Muhith "To achieve this goal, the government will give all out support." Commerce minister Faruq Khan echoed Muhith. Mentioning development of the IT sector was one of AL's electoral pledges, he said, "To fulfil that pledge, everything possible will be done." Bangladesh's biggest ICT event, the BASIS SoftExpo, running from Jan. 27-31 at the Bangladesh China Friendship Centre, showcases local skills and strengths, say its organisers. The exposition will display the reservoir of ICT resources and skills in Bangladesh, says the Bangladesh Association of Software & Information Services president Habibullah N Karim. Organisers hope to attract local and foreign investors to expand outsourcing for the Bangladeshi ICT sector, and thus create an opportunity for thousands of skills jobs. State minister for science, technology and communication Yafes Osman, BASIS president Karim and chief executive officer of Grameen Phone Oddvar Hefzedal also spoke at Tuesday's launch. bdnews24.
