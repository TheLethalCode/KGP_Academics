<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)BNP staged a walkout as soon as parliament resumed on Wednesday, protesting a new seating layout by speaker of the House Abdul Hamid that gives the main opposition party just four front row seats. The opposition MPs walked out of the session after a senior BNP lawmaker failed to draw the speaker's attention, seeking the floor on the House's new seating plan as the session began shortly before 5pm. The speaker had requested them to wait until after the prime minister's question and answer session. Instead, the BNP MPs walked out en masse. Shortly after their walkout, BNP held a press conference at the opposition leader's conference room. "The government has reset the seats in the parliament as they cannot bear the opposition party being there," senior BNP lawmaker MK Anwar told reporters. "This is against the usual practice of parliament. The speaker has behaved with us like a 'step-mother'," said Anwar. "We will be back in parliament only after holding talks," he said. But, the MP stressed, they would not return to the House "before resolving the issue". "We are afraid of the way the Speaker sides with the treasury bench but we want to play a constructive role in parliament." "We want to cooperate with the government and ask that we should not be looked at in terms of just numbers." "But all their activities are partisan," said Anwar. "The opposition party sits to the left of the speaker in parliament accorsing to the norm," he said. "The government party has created a new precedent, restructuring the seating." Referring to 2001's seating in parliament, he said although Awami League won only 58 seats, the opposition party was given eight front row seats including Hasina's. Another two seats went to Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Anwar Hossain Manju, he said. "They were also on the opposition then, he added. The opposition's chief whip Joynal Abedin Faruk, Barkat Ullah Bulu MP and others were present during the press conference. Hamid had told bdnews24.com on Wednesday morning that his reshuffle would reduce BNP's nine front row seats to fourNP. "I had to take a middle position by giving four front seats to the BNP as the ruling party was tough on sacrificing. They were not interested at all in giving them more than three seats according to their party strength," he said. "The BNP was also firm on keeping the nine front row seats they got from the outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar," said the speaker. Two ministers and three senior MPs of the ruling coalition were given BNP's five other seats on the front row, he said. He added that Oli Ahmed of the Liberal Democratic Party has kept his previous seat in the front row to the left of the speaker. "I have put Mujibur Rahman, Hasanul Huq Inu, Rashed Khan Menon, GM Quader and Dilip Barua in the front row by placing five BNP MPs in the back benches to the left," Hamid said. bdn
