<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Upazila polls were fair in 90 percent of constituencies, said a top election official on Wednesday, adding that the results would be published in three days. "Irregularities to some extent could have happened but 90 percent of the polls was fair. The Commission is probing the allegations of irregularities," said election commissioner Sohul Hossain. "The aggrieved can now go to the relevant Election Tribunals within 30 days from the date of gazette publication." "But generalised complaints will not be entertained any more," he added. The EC postponed the results of seven Upazilas on Jan 22 on allegations of misconduct. Since then, complaints started pouring into the Commission's complaint box in huge volume, he said. The commissioner advised the complainants to take legal help in regard to their complaints. "The Election Tribunals have already been constituted. The aggrieved can go there in 30 days from the gazette publication and the Tribunals will settle the cases in 180 days," he said. "An appeal is allowed within 30 days from the date of the verdict." "Some 70 percent voters turned out in the Upazila polls," said the commissioner. "The Commission did not get as much help from the administration in the Upazila elections as it did during the national polls," he said. On the High court dispute over the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, Sohul said, "Since the case is pending with the court, the Commission will explain the issue in court." The schedule for election of the next president will be finalised after consultation with the Speaker, he said. bdnews
