 Letter from Washington By Arshad Mahmud in Washington Jan 29 (bdnews24.com)Just in case you haven't noticed, the atmosphere at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the world's most famous address, has undergone a change since the new tenant and his small family moved in on Jan 20. You might call it "The White HouseObama style". Things are more relaxed and easy-going under the new president, who often shows up in Oval office meetings without his suit jacketsomething unthinkable during his predecessor's time. To be sure, he's enjoying every bit of it despite the tough economic challenges he and his administration are facing. That is largely because for the first time since he became a U.S. Senator in 2005 he can now live in the same house as his wife Michelle and two daughters Malia, 10, and sasha, 7. On the campaign trail, recalls senior adviser David Axelrod, "the number one complaint I would hear from Obama was that he was spending too much time away from his children." So even with the weight of two wars and a frightening economic crisis, the president "seems happier than I've seen in a long time," Axelrod said. According to the ABC News, change has also come in the White House pantry. Before leaving the White House, President George W. Bush gave his successor a heads-up: Presidents pay their own grocery bills, he warned President Obama, and the first family's pantry stays fully stocked at all times. "You'll be surprised by that first grocery bill," Bush told Obama. The pantries and refrigerators are now packed with Obama's favorite snacksherbal iced tea, trail mix, Dentyne peppermint gum, salsa and guacamoleas he and the first family settle into a routine. An avid lover of sport, who perhaps never missed his rigorous morning workouts, his new home provides all he needs to stay fit. On the 18-acre estate of the White House, the president has his own gym, tennis courts, indoor bowling alley and personal chef. The Chicago native is fully enjoying all the amenities while trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy in his routine, like having dinner with his family and exercising. The president begins his day at 6:45 a.m. with a workout at his own private gym. With Jay-Z and Li'l Wayne pumping into his ears via his iPod, the president alternates his workouts between free weights and a treadmill. "Most of my workouts have to come before my day starts," the avid basketball player told Men's Health magazine in October. "There's always a trade-off between sleep and working out. Usually, I get in about 45 minutes, six days a week. I'll lift [weights] one day, do cardio the next. I wish I was getting a 90-minute workout." Although he's clearly enjoying his new house, President Obama at times is also having trouble navigating his way around in the White House with countless rooms and alleys. "At the end of the first night, he had to ask somebody where he was supposed to go next," Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters. "It's a pretty big house." The private tour the Obamas got last Saturday likely helped, but the president still wanders through the halls trying to figure out where his aides sit, a rather unconventional move for a president. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush would regularly summon aides to the Oval Office. Obama recently shocked Gibbs when he walked into his office unexpectedly and caught the press secretary with his feet on the table. "It was a little bit of a startling moment. My door is generally open in the press office for reporters to walk in and out, but I didn't expect to see the president of the United States walk in while I had my feet up," Gibbs said. "'Wow, Gibbs', the president said", Gibbs recalled. "You just got here and your feet are up already." The feet came down promptly and Gibbs stood up. The new president is still getting used to the notion that people rise when he enters a room. Another Obama aide, National Economic Council Director Larry Summers, also took a little heat, but it wasn't from the president. Rather, the first Hawaiian-born U.S. president keeps the temperature in the Oval Office high, which has led the economist to break out in occasional sweats during their daily economic briefing. It may take some time for the Obamas to get used to the luxuries of the most prized residence in the country. And like any people living in a new home, the first couple is extra careful about the house. "I told guestsfeel free to walk around, touch some stuffjust don't break anything," Michelle Obama said Thursday. "That's what I try to tell my kids."
