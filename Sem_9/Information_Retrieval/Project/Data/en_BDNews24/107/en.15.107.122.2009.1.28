 MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spain's Fernando Verdasco advanced to his first grand slam semi-final after beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France 7-6 3-6 6-3 6-2 at the Australian Open on Wednesday. The 14th seed showed no ill-effects from the gruelling five-set victory over Britain's Andy Murray in his previous match as he overwhelmed Tsonga in a little under three hours with the roof closed on the Rod Laver centre court. Tsonga made the final at last year's Australian Open but failed to take his opportunities against Verdasco, converting just two of 13 break points in the match, while his opponent cashed in on each of his four break points. Verdasco's semi-final opponent will be either his fellow Spanish lefthander Rafa Nadal or another Frenchman, Gilles Simon
