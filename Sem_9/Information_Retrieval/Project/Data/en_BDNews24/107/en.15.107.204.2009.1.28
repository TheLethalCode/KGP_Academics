 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited went one step close to the title of the Citycell B. League when the leaders handed a lone-goal defeat to struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad in the second-leg encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Wednesday. Ghanaian midfielder Awudu Ibrahim struck the decider in the 10th minute as Abahani raised their point tally to 41 from 17 outings and need only four points in next three matches to retain the B. League title. Second-placed Sheikh Russel KC have 35 points also from 17 outings while last year's runners-up Mohammedan Sporting Club are in the third position with 32 points from 16 outings. The sky blues went close to a lead in the very first minute when Wali Faisal whipped a cross from the left for Emeka Christina, who saw his shot rebounded off the Muktijoddha sidebar. This time Emeka fed the ball for Ibrahim, who placed the ball past goalkeeper Himel and it was enough for the Dhanmodi-based outfit to see off the All Reds. After the break, Abahani striker Shahajuddin Tipu and Jahed Parvez Chowdhry came close to doubling the lead, but goalkeeper Himel denied both in the 67th and 76th minutes. bd
