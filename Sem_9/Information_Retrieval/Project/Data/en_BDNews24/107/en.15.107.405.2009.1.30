<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP will back trial of war criminals if it is properly done and not politically motivated, the party's secretary general said on Friday. "The demand for trial of war criminals has our moral support," Khandaker Delwar Hossain said in response to reporters' queries at his Armanitola home in Old Dhaka. "None should have any objection to the issue." His comment came after parliament on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution on "immediate" trial of war crimes suspects. "The trial for war crimes is an old issue that should have been settled a long time ago," he said. "Those who took the reins of power in the country after the independence war in 1971 were expected to try the war offenders." Referring to the Awami League assuming office in 1996, he said, "(I don't understand) why they (the AL government) did not try the war criminals." But he warned the government of dangers of a non-transparent process. The former chief whip urged the speaker, deputy speaker and the leader of the House to be more magnanimous and try to bring back the opposition MPs to the parliament.
