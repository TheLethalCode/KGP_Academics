 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)The main opposition BNP is yet to decide whether its MPs will end their boycott of parliament over the seat dispute, said the opposition chief whip. "Our MPs will hold a meeting at 4 pm to decide whether we will rejoin the House today (Sunday)," Joynal Abdin Faruk told bdnews24.com. Speaker Abdul Hamid told bdnews24.com that he had spoken with Faruk and assured him that BNP's demands would be "taken care of" in consultation with the treasury bench. "I have talked to the chief whip of the opposition regarding BNP's return to the House," Hamid said Sunday at his office. "I have assured them that I will look into their demands in consultation with the ruling party." Hamid on Sunday morning also had talks with chief whip of the ruling party Abdus Shahid on bringing the BNP back to parliament. "I have not had any conversation with the chief whip of opposition. But the speaker called me to his office regarding BNP's demand for three more front row seats in the House," Shahid said at speaker's office on Sunday. "I do not know whether they are joining the House today". BNP and its allies boycotted parliament from Wednesday protesting the speaker's decision to reduce their front row seats to four from the previous nine. The party's lawmakers met with speaker Hamid on Thursday and demanded three more front row seats in the House as a condition for returning to parliament. The main opposition also said they would not return to parliament without getting a response from the speaker. The ruling Awami League is firm against giving any more front row seats to the 30-seated BNP. The treasury bench said the BNP would get three out of 29 front row seats in proportion to the party's 30 in the 300-seated unicameral legislature. BNP has argued the left-side front bench is for the opposition and its MPs should get at least seven seats. Outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar gave his BNP party nine front row seats. Incoming speaker Hamid in the face of strong pressure from the treasury bench rearranged the seating order. According to the rules of procedure, the speaker is the authority on seating arrangements and MPs must accept the same. bdn
