<TITLE> Pakistan to release Mumbai attacks findings soon </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 DAVOS, Switzerland (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will release details of an investigation into the Mumbai attacks "very soon", Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said on Wednesday. "If there is anything substantive we will certainly share (it) with the world," he told Reuters in an interview in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, where business and political leaders are attending the four-day World Economic Forum. "Very soon, whatever the findings, we will come to the world," he said, adding that he first hoped for more cooperation from India. India and Pakistan have been exchanging heated rhetoric since the Mumbai attacks that killed 179 people in November. India says they were carried out by Pakistani nationals and must have had support from Pakistani state agencies. Gilani said relations had been improving with India before the attacks and he hoped for progress again. "This incident has upset the situation. We should move forward ... we are resolved to fight terrorism and extremism," he said. Pakistan has said that if any attackers were arrested, it would not send them to India for prosecution, even though this is what India would prefer. Gilani also voiced Pakistan's support for U.S. President Barack Obama's plans to send more troops to Afghanistan. "We are fighting with them. When they are sending more troops they will be supported," he said. Obama has ordered a review of the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. He promised during the U.S. presidential election campaign to bolster troop levels there to battle growing violence and a resurgent Taliban and al Qaeda. EXIT STRATEGY? Gilani said the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan had not worked for the last 5-1/2 years. Pakistan had lost more soldiers and police than NATO forces, and drug money from Afghan poppy fields was destabilising his country, he said. "We want to have a peace in the region," he said. "It is (in) our interest ...(to have) a stable Afghanistan because we are looking after 3.5 million refugees." Although he supported Obama's move to increase troop numbers in Afghanistan, he said more police were needed long-term to improve security and boost economic development. "Military action is not the solution ... for the exit policy ... law enforcement agencies should be strengthened," he said. "We have to go into the root cause of the problems and that is poverty ... access to the market. We don't want only aid, we want trade and market access," he said. "That is what we are demanding from the United States." Pakistan signed a $7.6 billion loan with the International Monetary Fund in November to stave off a balance of payments crisis. An official said this week Pakistan had received $101 million from the United States for logistical support in the campaign against militancy. With the next IMF review scheduled from Feb. 16 to Feb. 24, Gilani said the country had achieved the targets the IMF had set for it even though it was hard for a newly elected government to be tough on the people. But he acknowledged more should be done. "We have to diversify our economy too and we are giving more importance to agriculture," he said.
