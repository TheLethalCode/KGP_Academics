<TEXT>
 Barisal, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty spoke of the changing role of diplomats in the 21st century on Tuesday, smilingly terming a friendly cricket match in Barisal "the beginning of a new 'Cricket Diplomacy'." "Diplomats no longer spend all of their time in capital cities, meeting with other diplomats and foreign officials, delivering demarches and writing reports," he told a crowd at Bell's Park, as part of an America Week programme being held in the district. "Instead, the diplomats interact with citizens of their host countries at all levels. They get involved with programmes designed to advance shared goals, such as building democracy, promoting development, or terrorism," said Moriarty. "In the United States Foreign Service, we refer to this as transitional diplomacy." Sponsored by the US Embassy in Dhaka, America Week aims to strengthen the ties between the people of Bangladesh and the US by taking embassy activities to the people outside the capital. Earlier in the day, Moriarty had met with young students and local religious leaders as part of the same programme. The ambassador met with local imams who have taken training under a US-supported Leaders of Influence programme at the Imam Training Academy Barisal. The imams questioned the ambassador on various issues ranging from possible changes in the US foreign policy under the Obama administration to roles of religious leaders in the US. The ambassador in turn was interested to know what the imams had gained from the training programme. The ambassador also met with students of Bagomahon College in Barisal, assuring them and other Bangladeshi students of all cooperation for higher studies in the United States. "There are already many students going to the US for higher studies from Bangladesh," he told them. "But if you want to go to US for higher studies, you will have to get very good grades and will have to be capable in speaking and listening in English," he advised them. Moriarty also inaugurated US-funded SMC's 'floating centre' for tuberculosis awareness, named 'We anchor from port to port' at Kirtankhola River jetty in the town. Under the programme, a boat converted into an education centre, informs those living by the river banks and river islands of Barisal, Khulna and Raridpur about TB diagnostic and treatment services. The three-day 'America Week' programme in Barisal features presentations, site visits showcasing US government-funded programmes in Barisal, and provides visitors with the opportunity to learn how to apply for study at a US university, apply for a US visa or participate in a US government development project. Annual America Week programmes have been held in Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Sylhet since 2002, with the first one held in Chittagong. The event will come to an end on Wednesday. bdn
