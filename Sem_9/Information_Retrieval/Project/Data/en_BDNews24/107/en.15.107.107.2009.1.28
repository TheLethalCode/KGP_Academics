<TITLE> US envoy tries to shore up Gaza ceasefire </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President Barack Obama's Middle East envoy called on Wednesday for a Gaza ceasefire to be strengthened and extended, and promised after talks in Israel and Egypt that Washington would pursue Middle East peace vigorously. A surge of violence has threatened the fragile separate truces that Israel and the Gaza Strip's Hamas rulers put into effect on January 18 after a 22-day Israeli offensive. Israeli aircraft bombed smuggling tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border in a response to the killing on Tuesday of an Israeli soldier on patrol along Israel's frontier with the coastal enclave. Former Senator George Mitchell, Obama's envoy, said in Cairo after talks with President Hosni Mubarak it was "of critical importance that the ceasefire be extended and consolidated, and we support Egypt's continuing efforts in that regard." After meeting Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, Mitchell said a broader ceasefire should include an end to smuggling into the Gaza Strip and the reopening of border crossings under a 2005 agreement that calls for forces loyal to Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to be deployed there. Mitchell, who helped resolve the Northern Ireland conflict and headed a commission that made Israeli-Palestinian peace recommendations in 2001, said Washington was "committed to vigorously pursuing lasting peace and stability in the region." Western diplomats said Mitchell, who planned to see Abbas on Thursday, would not meet officials of Hamas, which wants Israel to open border crossings and lift a Gaza blockade in exchange for militants halting rocket fire. Egypt has been the main mediator in efforts to reach a long-term truce. Hamas is shunned by Israel and the West over its refusal to recognize the Jewish state, renounce violence and accept existing interim peace deals. Israeli leaders, running in a February 10 national election, fear Hamas could rebuild tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border to replenish an arsenal of rockets used in attacks on its southern communities before and during the Gaza war. Some 1,300 Palestinians, including at least 700 civilians, were killed in the offensive, the Hamas-run Health Ministry in the Gaza Strip said. Israel, which said it launched its assaults to stop rocket salvoes, put its death toll in the war at 10 soldiers and three civilians. AID Mitchell's week-long mission follows a call by Obama for a return to Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The new U.S. leader has made clear the Middle East conflict will be a high priority as he tries to repair a U.S. image battered by the war in Iraq. "President Obama has said the United States is committed to Israel's security and to its right to defend itself against legitimate threats," Mitchell said in Jerusalem. "The president has also said the United States will sustain an active commitment toward reaching the goal of two states living side by side in peace and security," he added. Javier Solana, the European Union's foreign policy chief, said in Israel the EU wanted Israeli authorities to increase the number of truckloads of aid entering the Gaza Strip from the current 130 a day to 400. In a report that coincided with the U.S. envoy's mission, Israel's Peace Now group said construction in Jewish settlements -- which the Mitchell report eight years ago recommended should be halted -- was stepped up last year. According to Peace Now, 1,257 new structures were built in West Bank settlements in 2008, a 57 percent increase over 2007. "This is the virus of peace," Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat said, calling on the Obama administration to press Israel to halt the expansion. In defiance of the Mitchell recommendations and a 2003 peace "road map" that serves as the basis for Palestinian statehood talks, Israel has said it would continue to build in existing settlements to meet the "natural growth" of their populations. While Israeli leaders weighed more military action, Palestinian work crews used giant yellow bulldozers and backhoes to repair tunnels damaged by bombing during the Gaza war and in the latest attack. Palestinians have relied on the tunnels as an economic lifeline, smuggling in commercial goods that Israel has not allowed past the blockade it tightened on the Gaza Strip after Hamas seized the territory in internal fighting in 2007. In the Gaza Strip, a little-known Islamist group claimed responsibility for Tuesday's bomb attack on the Israeli patrol. Hamas and other militant groups defended the strike as a response to what they said were ceasefire violations by Israel in which two Palestinians were killed last week. After the explosion, Israeli fire killed a Palestinian, identified by Gaza medical workers as a farmer. An Israeli air strike seriously wounded a militant on a motorcycle who the military said was involved in the bombing attack.
