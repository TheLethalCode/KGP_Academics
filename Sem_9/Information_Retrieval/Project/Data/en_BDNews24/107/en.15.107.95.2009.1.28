 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday granted former communications minister three months' bail in a bribery case. Huda's lawyers said the ruling, granting bail in the last of 20 cases against Huda, cleared all legal barriers to his release from jail. The case was filed with Motijheel Police Station on June 18 last year on charges of taking Tk 6 lakh in bribes for advertisements in Huda's magazine titled Khoborer Ontorale. The former minister at one point faced a total of 22 cases against him, of which he has secured bail in 20 so far, his wife Sigma Huda told reporters. Of the other two, he was acquitted in one and another case was withdrawn. Joint forces arrested Huda on Feb 3 last year. A special court has sentenced him to a total of 26 years in two extortion cases and one for amassing wealth beyond known sources of income. bdnew
