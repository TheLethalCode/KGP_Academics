<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)  A long-standing concept of creating a regional energy ring was approved at the SAARC energy ministers meeting in Colombo, said the energy secretary on Sunday. "The energy ministers approved a specific proposal for the energy ring for the first time," Mohammad Mohsin, just returned from Colombo, told bdnews24.com. Energy ministry officials say the proposal recommends "a regional grid of gas and power lines" between all SAARC members except the island nation of Maldives. A gas pipeline from central Asia or Myanmar could also 'feed into' the South Asian energy ring, they said. Strengthening cooperation and energy conservation between member countries were also discussed in the meeting that took place on Jan 28 to 29. India in recent years has proposed a tripartite gas pipeline from Myanmar through Bangladesh. India discussed the proposal with Myanmar, but negotiations came to a halt. Dhaka has also approached Myanmar over gas imports, but the latter has said it would prioritise exports to China and India before considering Bangladesh. Another proposal, also coming from India was for Bangladesh to import power from Tripura. "But it is not economically viable for Bangladesh," a government official told bdnews24.com. The seven SAARC nations are: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. bdne
