 Dhaka, Jan 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said development-deprived areas will be given priority during the tenure of her government. "We want balanced development in all areas of the country. So we will bring the balance working first in development-deprived areas," Hasina said Saturday at Awami League's Dhanmondi office. "We want to educate the people in our country to hold our heads high in the world community," the two-time prime minister added. Hasina was exchanging greetings with Gopalganj's new Kotalipara Upazila chairman and party workers. The prime minister said the past BNP-led government had made no development progress in many areas of the country, including Gopalganj. Kotalipara in Gopalganj is Hasina's family home. She indicated that development projects initiated during the past Awami League government were stopped under the incoming BNP government. Hasina stressed to the local AL leaders the need to maintain the people's confidence. "The people gave a massive win, voting for us as they placed great confidence in us." Attaching importance to ensuring people's security, she said, "We do not believe in vindictive politics. But we will relieve the people from the misdeeds under which they have suffered. We will also take steps against false cases." "Our responsibilities have been multiplied with a landslide victory in the elections. Awami League must move forward with that big sense of responsibility. We must forge ahead through many difficulties." "It does not matter what we gain. It matters how much we are able to give. We will build up a poverty and illiteracy-free Bangladesh and we will deliver healthcare to all the people's doorsteps," said the prime minister. bdnews
