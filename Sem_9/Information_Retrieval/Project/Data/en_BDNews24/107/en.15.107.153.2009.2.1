<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com)The 45th Bishwa Ijtema, the second largest annual congregation of Muslims worldwide after the Hajj, drew to a close Sunday with hundreds of thousands offering Akheri Munajat (closing prayers) in the early afternoon in unseasonably fine weather. The size of the closing congregation was estimated to be nearly 2 million, said organsiers, with 1.5 million devotees already flocking to the Ijtema venue by the river Turag in Tongi since Friday. Maulana Zobayrul Hasan from India was leading the Akheri Munajat, shortly after 1pm, with presdient Iajuddin Ahmed, prime minister Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia among the VIPs in attendance. A record figure of 10,500 foreigners joined the Ijtema this year, enjoying unusually warm weather. Last year's congress was cut short after just one day due to inclement weather. Special security measures were taken to ensure the safety of the assembled devotees from home and abroad for the three-day event, first launched in 1946. Despite tight security, heavy presence of law enforcers and hundreds of CCTVs, Tongi police said thousands of mobile phones among other valuables had been reported stolen. They also detained scores of pickpockets. One elderly devotee died of cardiac arrest on the Ijtema premises this year, identified as 70 year-old Mohammad Aziz of Sarishabari in Jamalpur. Another, Parvin Akhtar, 45, died at Kamar Para, adjacent to the Ijtema premises. Their Namaz e Janaza took place on the Ijtema grounds. Over 100 patients were admitted to Tongi General Hospital on the first day. Of them, 45 were described to be in a critical condition. Most of them were suffering old-age complications. Some complained of asthma.
