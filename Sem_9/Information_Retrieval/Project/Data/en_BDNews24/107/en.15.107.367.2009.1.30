 Dhaka, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka University on Friday paid tribute to the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi by organising a memorial lecture on his 61st death anniversary, said a press release. Vice chancellor Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique was chief guest, while deputy high commissioner of India Mukta D Tomar presided over the function, the release said. Tomar, speaking on the occasion, highlighted the relevance of ideals and values of Gandhi in today's world. "Gandhi's moral values continue to be relevant in the context of menace of terrorism that the world faces today," the release quoted the Indian diplomat as saying. "No cause and no religion either justifies or sanctifies recourse to acts of terror," she said. The department of peace and conflict studies of the university organised the lecture, which has been hosting it since 2007 to mark the death anniversary of India's independence leader on Jan 30. Gandhi was shot dead on Jan. 30, by Nathuram Godse, a pioneer of Satyagraha - resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience. Gandhi's policy was firmly founded upon ahimsa (non-violence), which eventually led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
