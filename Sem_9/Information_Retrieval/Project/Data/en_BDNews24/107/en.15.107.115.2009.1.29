<TITLE> US Navy searches cargo vessel for Iranian weapons </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Washington, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The U.S. Navy boarded a cargo vessel traveling from Iran to Syria and found a weapons shipment on board but did not confiscate the cargo, U.S. military officials said on Wednesday. A team from the USS San Antonio discovered the weapons on the Cypriot-flagged Monchegorsk early last week. But officials said the arms could not be shown to violate U.N. weapons sanctions against Iran. The vessel was allowed to continue on to Syria where it was expected to arrive as early as Wednesday, officials said. "We did as much as we could do legally. But there are limitations," one military official said. Officials said the search was conducted as part of the Navy's normal maritime security role in regional waters that stretch from the Arabian Sea to the Mediterranean. The incident came to light amid media reports that the U.S. Navy has been ordered to intercept suspected Iranian shipments to rearm Hamas following Israel's 22-day Gaza offensive against the Palestinian militant group. The officials declined to say what kind of weapons were found or how many. They also would not be specific about where or when the incident occurred.
