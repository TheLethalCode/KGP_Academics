 MEXICO CITY, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former Mexico coach Ricardo La Volpe has returned for a second-stint in charge of Guadalajara-based club Atlas. La Volpe, who led Mexico to the last 16 at the 2006 World Cup and is one of Latin America's most outspoken coaches, was appointed three weeks after leaving Monterrey over financial differences. "The deal for Ricardo La Volpe to take over as coach of Atlas has been concluded," the club said in a statement. La Volpe, who stands out on the touchline by wearing brightly-coloured ties featuring Chinese dragons, was third-choice goalkeeper in Argentina's 1978 World Cup winning squad. He has spent most of his coaching career in Mexico, also working at America, Atlante, Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and Toluca. La Volpe was previously at Atlas from 1997-2001 and he replaces Dario Franco, who quit after the side lost their first two games in the Clausura championship
