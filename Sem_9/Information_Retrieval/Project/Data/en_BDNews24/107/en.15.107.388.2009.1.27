<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  The government is moving to put an end to the dispute created over the appointment of Baitul Mukarram Khatib Muhammed Salahuddin. "The government has already held one round of discussion with leaders of those who oppose the appointment," state minister for religious affairs Shahjahan Miah told bdnews24.com on Tuesday. A decision will come by Friday, after another round of discussion, he said. "The government will not accept any chaotic situation after that," he warned. "There appears to be a political motive behind the dispute following the appointment of the new Khatib." "The government will not tolerate any attempt to politicise matters of our national mosque," Shahjahan told bdnews24.com and a private TV channel. "The government has not appointed the new Khatib, the caretaker government made the appointment. We were not partial on the matter," he said "Thousands of people have offered their prayers led by the new Khatib. If they do not have any problem why should these demonstrators?" "There must have some political motive behind it. But the government wants to resolve the problem through discussion," the minister said. Devotees have clashed in the national mosque during Jumma prayers for three consecutive Fridays since the newly-appointed Khatib took charge in early January. bdnew
