 MADRID, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona and Sevilla claimed the final two places in the King's Cup semi-finals on Thursday, Barca knocking out city rivals Espanyol 3-2 and Sevilla coming through on away goals against holders Valencia. Sevilla, the 2007 winners, will play Athletic Bilbao for a place in May's final in Valencia, while Barca take on Real Mallorca.

Valencia looked to be cruising when a header from captain Carlos Marchena put them in front but Frederic Kanoute equalised with a header before the break.
