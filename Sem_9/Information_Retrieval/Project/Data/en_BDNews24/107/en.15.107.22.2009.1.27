<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com)  BNP secretary general Delwar Hossain accused the government on Tuesday of trying to bar the opposition party from parliament, restructuring the House's seat plan in what he termed a dishonest move. "There is an ill motive behind changing the seating arrangement in the House after the outgoing speaker fixed it, according to usual parliamentary practice," he told a press briefing at the BNP chairperson's political office. "[The Awami League-led government] wants the opposition party not to go to parliament or want to create such an uncongenial atmosphere that the opposition cannot walk into the House." Referring to AL winning just 39 seats in the 2nd parliamentary elections, he said, "We will ask the government to make up the seat order as was done then." Speaker Abdul Hamid on Tuesday said MPs would be seated in the House at its next sitting on Wednesday, according to a new plan. Hamid called a meeting with the two chief whips of the ruling and opposition parties earlier Tuesday, in a bid to put an end to the dispute over the seating plan made by outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar. According to Sircar's arrangement, the main opposition BNP and three other parties were granted two front rows to the left of the speaker. The ruling party Awami League has opposed the arrangement, saying it was disproportionate to the mere 30 seats won by BNP. On the Election Commission deferment of publication of Upazila poll results, Delwar said: "It has proved our allegations of misconduct by the ruling party." Delwar repeated BNP's claims that AL supporters had grabbed voting centers, chasing BNP agents out. Saying that the deputy speaker's post was not acceptable to BNP at this stage, he claimed the government had broken its promise. "Did we seek the post from them? It is they who promised to give us the post. They are now vacillating on the issue. They said it to the nation whimsically then, and so they did not give us the post." He advised the government to show a democratic and cooperative attitude. On BNP 'reconstitution', he said Khaleda had already started the process. He also said they the issue would be on the agenda of a Feb 1standing committee meeting. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan and office secretary Rizvi Ahmed were present during the press briefing. bdnew
