<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams achieved the first part of a 2009 Australian Open grand slam double when she teamed up with older sister Venus to win their third women's doubles title at Melbourne Park on Friday. Serena is to play the singles final against Russia's Dinara Safina on Rod Laver Arena on Saturday. The 10th seeds, who also won the title at Melbourne Park in 2001 and 2003, beat Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova and Ai Sugiyama of Japan 6-3 6-3 to claim their eighth grand slam doubles title. They are now tied for third on the all-time list for grand slam doubles titles, behind the pairings of Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver (21) and Gigi Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva (14). Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suarez also won eight titles but Venus said she and her sibling would have won more if they had played more doubles.

"Obviously, we have to play well (on Friday). We played a great team today. They were very tough." With the air temperature over 40 degrees Celsius for the third successive day, organisers again closed the roof on Rod Laver Arena and the American duo hardly looked flustered, winning the first set in 38 minutes. They continuously attacked the serve of the Slovak and Japanese, breaking on six of the eight opportunities they had, though they did not have it all their own way with their own service, being broken three times. Their superior groundstroke power and court coverage however proved to be the difference and they hugged each other when Sugiyama's backhand volley dropped into the net. "Sometimes we stay at the baseline because we have such great groundstrokes," said Serena. "We lose sight that we need to come in. Once we come in, I think it's even more dangerous. "I have a great partner. I don't have to work too hard out there. Just hit some big serves. "Venus hits some big serves. We put the ball away
