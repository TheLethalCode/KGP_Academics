 MOSCOW, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven people died and at least 16 were missing after fire gutted a remote, wooden care home in the northwestern Russian republic of Komi on Saturday, a spokeswoman for the local branch of the Emergencies Ministry said. President Dmitry Medvedev dispatched the Kremlin's envoy in northwest Russia to investigate the fire, which was close to being extinguished five hours after it started in the village of Podyelsk, 120 km from the regional capital Syktyvkar. "Seven bodies have been pulled out of the building. Firefighters have entered the building and are searching for the missing residents," Lyubov Terenteva, head of the press service for the Emergencies Ministry in Komi, told Reuters. Fire broke out at the care home, which houses 26 residents, mostly elderly, in the early evening. Three women were rescued before firefighters arrived at the single-storey building and a night watchman escaped unharmed, Terenteva said. In addition to the residents, two staff members, including a nurse, were unaccounted for, she said. It was not clear if they were inside the building at the time. "The fire is close to being extinguished," she said by telephone from Syktyvkar, about 1,000 km northeast of Moscow. The blaze once again raises concerns over lax fire safety in Russia. Slow evacuation procedures have been blamed for previous deaths, while fire escapes in Soviet-era buildings can be blocked or locked for security. Care homes have been particularly vulnerable: 62 patients and staff died in a March 2007 fire in an old people's home in the southern region of Krasnodar, while 32 died in November 2007 near the city of Tula, 200 km south of Moscow. The cause of the latest fire was unknown. State-run television channel Vesti 24 quoted Konstantin Bobrov, head of the press service of the regional government, as saying an unextinguished cigarette could have been to blame. The Komi republic, whose northern extremities reach into the Arctic Circle, is sparsely populated and covered mostly by forests and swamps. It holds significant reserves of oil, coal diamonds and bauxite. Vladimir Torlopov, the 59-year-old head of the Komi republic, said an investigation would begin immediately. "I have ordered the most thorough investigation into the reasons for this tragedy. Now, the most important thing is to provide the injured with everything they need," Torlopov said in a statement on his administration's Web site, www.rkomi.ru
