<TITLE> Manna death probe: Doctors face arrest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court issued arrest warrants Wednesday against six United Hospital doctors accused of negligence in the death of film star Manna. Chief metropolitan magistrate AKM Enamul Haque issued the warrants after a judicial probe stated the film star's death was due to negligence and charged the doctors with 'destroying evidence'. The actor was admitted to Gulshan's United Hospital with chest pain on Feb 17 last year. Manna's family claimed doctors neglected to see him immediately, delaying treatment after he was admitted. He died before they arrived. Brother-in-law Reza Quader filed a murder case seven months later with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court. The six doctors facing arrest are Enayet Hossain, Jahiruddin Mahmud Ilias, Momenuzzaman, Khandaker Mahbub Sohail, Fatema and Mainul Islam Majumder. bdnew
