 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Football Federation plans to revive the national football league under the name of the national club championship. "We are thinking of revival of the national football league. But it may take the new name, national club championship, in a bid to inspire the local clubs at the district level," BFF vice president Shawkat Ali Khan Jahanghir told bdnews24.com after an unofficial meeting with BFF highups. "We have two formulas to restart the league or championship. One is to follow the previous format of the national football league where six divisional champions will join six Dhaka clubs. "The other one is to organise it along with the district champions keeping all Dhaka clubs out of the championship," said Jahangir, also chairman of the National Football League Committee. "However, nothing has yet been finalised as we need sometime to discuss it in detail," he added. The national football league embarked its journey in 2000 and had five meets held with Nitol Tata sponsoring all five editions. The national league had a wide popularity across the country due to holding its matches in the different parts of the country and Dhaka giants Abahani Limited, Mohammedan SC, Brothers Union, Muktijoddha Sangsad and Sheikh Russel also took part in the league. But, the then executive committee, led by SA Sultan, scrapped the national football league from the annual calendar in the start of the 2006 season because of new installation of the professional football league -- B. League. Jahangir said that they had also discussed some things likes the BFF annual calendar, Bangladesh's participation in the Prime Minister Gold Cup in Nepal, AFC Challenge Cup and Super Cup. "We want to keep football in field for 10 months in a year and we discussed how to harmonise the local and international schedules," said the renowned organiser. bd
