 COLOMBO, Thu Jan 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A UN convoy carrying hundreds of people wounded in shelling between Tamil Tiger rebels and the Sri Lankan military left the war zone on Thursday after being held back two days ago, the United Nations said. "The convoy just crossed the frontline with hundreds of the civilians wounded by the fighting, including 50 critically wounded children, who are being moved to a Ministry of Health hospital," UN spokesman Gordon Weiss said. Sri Lankan troops energized by a series of major victories have cornered the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in a shrinking piece of jungle and are fighting to finish one of Asia's longest-running wars. But humanitarian agencies say about 250,000 civilians are trapped in the remaining 300 square km (115 sq miles) of LTTE territory in northeastern Sri Lanka. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) says hundreds have been killed or wounded in the last week. Many were stranded without adequate treatment in poorly equipped hospitals and the ICRC and United Nations arranged a convoy to carry them to a government hospital in Vavuniya, outside the war zone in the Indian Ocean island's north. The LTTE on Tuesday denied the convoy permission to leave, saying it was not safe to go, after the army stopped firing for a brief period, the United Nations has said. Late on Wednesday, the pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com said the LTTE had denied blocking the convoy, quoting the director of the LTTE Peace Secretariat, S. Puleedevan. "The LTTE has been repeatedly urging the ICRC to facilitate unhindered transportation of injured civilians who need urgent attention and also for the provision of medical facilities locally," TamilNet quoted him as saying. TRADING ACCUSATIONS Both sides have traded blame for the casualties, with the Tigers saying the army is shelling a no-fire zone it set up last week for civilians. TamilNet on Wednesday said 23 civilians were killed and 121 wounded, quoting unidentified medical sources. The military denies firing into the no-fire zone and accuses the Tigers of moving its artillery into populated areas and trying to use the plight of civilians to win support for a ceasefire when it is losing militarily, as it has in the past. The government says the reported casualty figures are too high and may include wounded Tigers, but says it has no exact count. Human rights watchdogs and the government accuse the LTTE -- designated a terrorist group by India, the United States and the European Union -- of keeping civilians in its territory to use them as fighters, battlefield laborers or human shields. It is nearly impossible to verify accounts from the battlefield, since journalists are rarely allowed in except on carefully guided tours. Both sides routinely have distorted accounts in the past to their advantage. The military said troops clashed repeatedly with the rebels and rescued nine civilians on Wednesday. Soldiers captured an LTTE camp near Vishwamadu, on the southwestern edge of the frontline, and recovered a 10-meter (35 foot) submarine, an attack boat and several partially completed midget submarines, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said
