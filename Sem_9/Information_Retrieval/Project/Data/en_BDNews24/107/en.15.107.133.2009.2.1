<TITLE> UK's Brown condemns strikes over foreign workers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Sun Feb 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Sunday condemned nationwide wildcat strikes over the use of foreign workers at a time of soaring unemployment, as unions warned more staff may down tools this week. Industrial unrest is spreading across Europe, fuelled by a worsening economic downturn. Last week, French workers protested for more pay and job security while Greek farmers set up roadblocks, demanding compensation for low prices. In Britain, mounting tension between the ruling Labour Party and unions that provide much of its funds and support is also a taste of what may lie ahead for Brown's out-of-favour government as the recession bites, with an election due by May 2010. "That's not the right thing to do," Brown told BBC television when asked about last week's walkouts at energy plants across Britain. "It's not defensible." The government has asked an independent mediator to look at whether skilled British workers were unfairly debarred from contract work at a refinery in eastern England owned by France's Total. Thousands across Britain protested against the use of Portuguese and Italian workers at the site. "Whether you call it indefensible or not, a lot of people find it understandable in the circumstances," said Derek Simpson, joint chief of Britain's biggest union Unite. Unions have warned the strikes will continue next week and may even escalate as more workers across Britain discuss whether to join the action. Brown's 2007 pledge to safeguard 'British jobs for British workers' has come back to haunt him at time when he is urging the world to avoid a retrenchment into protectionism. Unemployment is rising sharply in Britain, up by 131,000 in the three months to November to 1.923 million. The rate of joblessness hit 6.1 percent -- the highest since 1999 -- and more big rises are expected as the downturn gathers pace. RISING RESENTMENT That is fuelling resentment against companies using European workers who, under EU law, are free to work across much of the continent and often accept lower pay than British staff. Mainstream politicians fear far-right groups such as the British National Party will turn the protests to their advantage. The government has been accused of being more lax than other European countries in the number of migrant workers it allows, but many analysts say it has been good for the economy. "These strikes are not about racism, they are about standing up to these big corporations who are using cheaper migrant labour to jack up profits," Labour member of parliament Jon Cruddas wrote in the Sunday Mirror newspaper. Government relations with the unions have deteriorated markedly after an initial honeymoon period when Brown took over from Tony Blair in June 2007. Last year the government faced industrial action by hundreds of thousands of public sector workers over pay. Opinion polls indicate Labour faces defeat by the Conservatives at the next election. It scored an initial boost in popularity at the height of the credit crisis last year, as voters saw Brown as the politician best qualified to weather the storm. But that has faded fast as what was once a distant financial market scare story hits families and businesses. The International Monetary Fund believes the British economy will shrink by 2.8 percent this year, making it the worst-hit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations and contradicting Brown's claims that Britain is well prepared for the downturn
