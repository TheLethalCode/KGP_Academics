 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Feb 01 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League will not go ahead with the creation of another deputy speaker post if the opposition BNP rejects the offer, Syed Ashraful Islam said on Sunday. "What is the necessity of amending the constitution if BNP refuses to accept the post offered," said the local government minister. "But we are ready to amend the constitution for creation of the post if the BNP wants," Ashraful told bdnews24.com in parliament. Awami League at its parliamentary party meeting on Jan 25 decided that the government would amend the constitution to create another deputy speaker post for the main opposition BNP. But BNP, saying AL has broken its pledge to offer the position of deputy speaker to the opposition, has made it clear it will not accept the post of an 'extra' deputy speaker. It will only accept the post of deputy speaker within the present constitutional arrangement. According to the present constitutional framework, a new parliament elects the speaker and deputy speaker of the House at its maiden sitting. Awami League lawmakers Abdul Hamid and Col Shawkat Ali were elected to the posts on Jan. 25. If the government wants to create another post of deputy speaker, it will have to amend the constitution by a two-third majority vote in parliament. bdn
