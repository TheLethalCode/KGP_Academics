 Dhaka, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com)  A dead body was recovered on Wednesday morning in the aftermath of a slum fire the previous night in the city's Shyampur area, said police. "The body was identified as Lalu Miah, 70 years old, who was reportedly suffering from paralysis," Shyampur police sub-inspector Mozammel Hossain told bdnews24.com. "The fire broke out in a kitchen room of 'Afajuddin Slum' in North Jurain at around 8.45pm Tuesday night." The slum has built up in the middle of a swampy area, said Mozammel. Fire fighters took about one and a half hours to extinguish the fire, said the police officer. No casualties were reported Tuesday night after the fire was doused. "But the old man was missing since then. Firemen retrieved the body, which was totally burnt, the following day." The body was interred without any autopsy on request of his relatives. bdnew
