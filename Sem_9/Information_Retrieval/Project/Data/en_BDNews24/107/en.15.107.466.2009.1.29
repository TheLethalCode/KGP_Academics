 Dhaka, Jan 29 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Football Federation on Thursday decided not to send the national football team in Nepal's Prime Minister Cup ahead of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifying round in Bangladesh. The Prime Minister Cup is scheduled for March 5-15 with the participations of hosts Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Thailand. Bangladesh will host Group A matches of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifying round from April 4 to 14 at Bangabandhu National Stadium. "The coach (Edson Silva Dido) does not want to take part in Nepal's Prime Minister Cup with a week's preparation as the players will be available after the completion of the ongoing B. League in the middle of February and he wants to concentrate on the AFC Challenge Cup at home," BFF vice president Badal Roy told reporters emerging from a meeting. Roy had a meeting with coach Dido, assistant coach Shafiqul Islam Manik and technical director Shahidur Rahman Shantu at the BFF House. "We are thinking of sending a second string Bangladesh team if All Nepal Football Federation agrees," said Roy, also chairman of the national team management committee. Bangladesh were drawn in Group A of the AFC Challenge Cup qualifiers along with Myanmar, Cambodia and the winners between Macau and Mongolia. Dido arrived here on January 24 and has already watched five B. League matches. The Brazilian's observation on the players is that they are 'skilled and technically sound but not good enough physically and mentally.' "I want to focus on this two areas," Dido was quoted by Roy as saying. Physio Ariel Colman is scheduled to arrive Dhaka in the second week of February, said the BFF vice president. Roy ensured the coaching staffs that the BFF would provide all necessary supports to them during the camp, which may take place in Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan or in Dinajpur. Dido wanted to pick at least 30 players and conduct the camp with 25 players. He has already chosen 18 to 20 players, said Roy. Bd
