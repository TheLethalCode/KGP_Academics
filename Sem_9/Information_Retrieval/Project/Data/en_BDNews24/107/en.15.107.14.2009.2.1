<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dinara Safina cursed a bad service performance after she was blasted off court by a rampant Serena Williams in the final of the Australian Open on Saturday. Safina served five double faults, three in her first service game, and won just 52 percent of her points on her first serve in the 6-0 6-3 loss to Williams. It was Williams's 10th career grand slam title and fourth in Australia. The match lasted just 59 minutes. "I think the whole tournament I was struggling with my serve," a shell-shocked Safina told reporters. "Each match I was serving a little bit harder (but) my serve was letting me down. "Normally my serve is my weapon, so playing without all my weapons, it's tough against her." Williams was ultra-aggressive throughout the match, pressuring the Russian not only on her serve but blasting winners from all corners and running Safina around the court. The Russian third seed, who was seeking to emulate elder brother Marat as champion at Melbourne Park, made 21 unforced errors and failed to exert any pressure on Williams's serve. The 27-year-old American won 20 of her 21 first serve points. "She puts pressure (on you), because she's aggressive," Safina added. "She pushes you to go a little bit for more because you don't want to give her any easy ball because you know that she will go for it. "Either she makes it or misses, but most of the time she makes it." The 22-year-old Russian was also a beaten finalist at Roland Garros last year and said nerves at not played a part in Saturday's match. "I was not nervous, not even close like before the French Open final. I couldn't even sleep the night," she said of last year's French Open final against Ana Ivanovic. "Today I slept good and everything was fine. I would say she was much more experienced than I was today stepping on the court." Despite the crushing loss, Safina said she would not dwell on it, having made it to the final and won A$1 million (US$638,600). "If I would lose the first round, of course I would sit here and I would start to think. But I lost in the final, I made all the way," she said. "There is much more positive than negative. So I lost the match, and now it's back to training. "I don't see any reason to panic or to make thousand thoughts in my mind.
