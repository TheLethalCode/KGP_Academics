 JOHANNESBURG, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's triumphant squad returned home to a terrific reception on Saturday and coach Mickey Arthur said the pressure would be on his players when Australia visit for a return series next month. "Australia will be here in three weeks and we're under no illusions they are really hurting and are going to be far angrier," Arthur told a news conference at Johannesburg International Airport. "For the first time ever we will go into a series against them as favourites and it will be interesting to see how we handle that. "With success comes expectations and we'll be playing in front of our home crowds so that will be a lot more difficult. But I'm confident the players have it in them to repeat their success (in Australia)," added Arthur. South Africa won their first test series in Australia, becoming the first team to win there in 16 years, before grabbing a 4-1 victory in the one-day series against the world champions. Arthur said he and the team were overwhelmed by their reception on Saturday, with over a thousand fans at the airport to welcome them home. "When we arrived back here after losing in the semi-finals of the World Cup we had to leave via the back door," he said. "But this has been a helluva reception and a very humbling experience. "We left Perth this morning as a very proud team and now we are even prouder, the magnitude of what we have done has really hit us after this fantastic reception." Cricket South Africa vice-president Ray Mali, former head of the International Cricket Council, also paid tribute to the team. SONS OF SOIL "These sons of the soil are people who have done us proud, they are heroes who have done something special. Even the residents of small villages in the Eastern Cape, where I come from, have been asking for the scores," Mali said. Arthur said the most memorable aspect of the tour was the way his team won over the Australian public. "To see (captain) Graeme Smith walking in front of the Noble Stand in Sydney, which gave us all sorts of abuse the last time we were there, and get a standing ovation was phenomenal," said the coach. "I think we won them over through our humility, we were extremely humble when we won. How you handle winning and losing is very important and the team were superb on and off the field. "We showed a lot of respect for Australia and I think they recognised that," added Arthur. The coach praised South Africa's high workrate Down Under. "Our success was down to the leadership of both captains (Smith in the tests and Johan Botha in the one-dayers) but it also calls for an incredible work ethic, courage and commitment from the team and they left Australia as heroes," said Arthur. The first test in Johannesburg starts on Feb. 26
