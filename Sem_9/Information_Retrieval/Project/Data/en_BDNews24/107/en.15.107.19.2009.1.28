 LONDON, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil forward Robinho will be fined for leaving Manchester City's training camp in Tenerife last week, team manager Mark Hughes said on Tuesday. The club's 32 million pounds ($44.95 million) British record signing left the camp without permission to visit Brazil and Hughes refuted media speculation he would avoid punishment. "If you read some of the tabloids this morning, nothing could be further from the truth in their depiction of what went on," Hughes told Sky Sports News. "Robi was told my feelings about the situation and the intention is to fine Robi. "There is a disciplinary procedure to go through and when that has run its course he will have to face some disciplinary measures but the level of those measures will be kept private. "I've touched on what I expect to happen. We've moved on, drawn a line under it." "Robinho will be treated in the same way as any other player at Manchester City, there is no special case here. "Some of the reporting on the situation was incorrect and has been for a number of months. Hughes, whose team host Newcastle United in the Premier League on Wednesday, said aside from Robinho's unexpected absence the training camp had gone well.
