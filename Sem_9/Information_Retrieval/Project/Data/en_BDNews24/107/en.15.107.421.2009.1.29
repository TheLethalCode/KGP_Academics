 GENEVA Thu Jan 29, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay accused Sri Lankan troops and Tamil Tiger rebels on Thursday of committing grave violations and decried the mounting number of civilian casualties in the conflict. Pillay also voiced concern at the "highly-restricted access" to the Vanni region in the northeastern part of the island where an estimated 250,000 civilians are trapped by fighting. "The lack of access for independent monitors, humanitarian workers and the media only adds to concerns that the situation may be even worse than we realise," she said in a statement. Pillay cited reports from aid agencies on the ground that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had resorted to forced recruitment, including of children, "as well as the use of civilians as human shields." She also condemned "the fact that safe zones promised by the government have subsequently been subjected to bombardment, leading to civilian casualties. "While the government has made military gains on one hand, the rule of law has been undermined on the other," she said. Sri Lankan troops energised by a series of major victories have cornered the LTTE in a shrinking piece of jungle and are fighting to finish one of Asia's longest-running wars. But humanitarian agencies say about 250,000 civilians are trapped in the remaining 300 square km (115 sq miles) of LTTE territory in northeastern Sri Lanka. "People trying to flee the conflict areas are reported to have either been prevented from doing so, or to have been arbitrarily detained in special centres," Pillay said. "It seems there may have been very grave breaches of human rights by both sides in the conflict and it is imperative that we find out more about what exactly has been going on." Pillay said there had not been any successful investigations or prosecutions of political killings, disappearances and other violations committed in recent years in Sri Lanka. It is the government's duty to provide safety to all Sri Lankan citizens, whatever their ethnic origin or political views, she said
