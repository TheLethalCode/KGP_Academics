<TITLE> Heatwave causes havoc at Australian Open </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A once in a century heatwave caused havoc at the Australian Open on Wednesday, forcing tournament organisers to cancel matches and invoke their new Extreme Heat Policy for the first time. The tournament match referee Wayne McKewen ordered the roof on the Rod Laver centre court be shut and all matches were suspended on the outside courts as the temperature soared past a stifling 43 degrees Celsius. The players were left soaked in sweat and gasping for air in the sweltering heat while spectators abandoned the stands to watch matches on television sets in shaded bars at Melbourne Park. The brutal conditions proved too much for the swarms of bogong moths that flutter around the stadium's bright lights, with dozens dropping dead on to the main court. The Australian Open has always been played in severe conditions but organisers are on high alert this year after the Bureau of Meteorology forecast six consecutive days of 40 degrees temperatures in Melbourne. Suburban train tracks reportedly began to buckle, race meetings were cancelled and ambulance crews were run off their feet treating people suffering heat stress. HELD UP The defending men's champion Novak Djokovic quit his fourth-round match against Andy Roddick on Tuesday after wilting in the heat and Victoria Azarenka almost fainted from exhaustion in her fourth-round match. Wednesday's quarter-final between Serena Williams and Svetlana Kuznetsova was held up for almost 45 minutes between the first and second sets while the centre court roof was closed. "It was really an out of body experience. I felt I was watching someone play in a blue dress and it wasn't me," Williams told reporters. "I kept trying to tell myself that it's not hot but it got hotter. "It was so hot that my rackets lost all tension. I had to string them way tighter than normal for my ball to stay in the court." Russia's Elena Dementieva was less fortunate, made to play her quarter-final against Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain with the roof still open. The temperature at that stage was just approaching 40 degrees and although Dementieva won 6-2 6-2, she said the roof should have already been shut. "I'm really surprised because when you see the forecast, it was going to be 41 today," she said. "I think if you have a roof, why not use it? Not only for the players, but for the spectators as well." EVOLVING POLICY Rod Laver himself agreed: "They say we're going to have this sort of heat for the next three days, why not just close it right now and leave it closed?" he told reporters. Organisers use a complicated formula that combines air temperature, wind, solar radiation and humidity before deciding whether to invoke the extreme heat policy. There are three phases of the policy; the first allows players to use ice vests, the second allows women and juniors to take extended breaks between sets and the final phase allows the referee to close the roof and cancel outdoor matches. Tournament director Craig said closing the roof was always a last resort and was based on scientific data rather than instincts. "We're an outdoor championship. We take this very seriously," he told a news conference. "We don't make the decisions based on a forecast, we make the decisions based on what is actually happening. The policy has evolved since it was first introduced in 2003 and is largely based around feedback. Until two years ago the roof was only closed between matches but after Maria Sharapova complained about the heat in 2007 the current policy, which allows matches to be stopped between sets so the roof can be closed, was put in place. "It's also important to remember the feedback from the players," Tiley said. "There's some players that say, 'absolutely, we've trained for these conditions, been in the heat for five or six weeks before coming to Australia, we want to play in those conditions.' "Other players say, 'no, actually we don't want to play in those conditions', because they may not have gone through the same training procedure. "These are all factors to be considered but to be fair to all the players, we set a standard and we will adhere to that.
