 MIAMI, Jan 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff flew to Jamaica on Monday for a scan after picking up a side strain in England's opening warm-up game against an invitational team from St Kitts & Nevis. Flintoff pulled out of the match on Sunday and was replaced by Stuart Broad. Spinner Monty Panesar took four wickets as the hosts were bowled out for 251 in reply to England's 424 for eight declared. England openers Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook took their side to 118 for no wicket in their second innings at the close of play with both batsmen reaching 50. A statement on the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) website said the results of Flintoff's scan would be known on Tuesday. Batsman Owais Shah, who hit an unbeaten 125 in England's innings, has also been ruled out for the rest of the game with a scratched cornea. "Shah was unable to take the field at the start of the second day however due to his blurred vision," the ECB said, adding that he would be monitored over the next few days. Kevin Pietersen struck a century on Sunday in his first appearance for England since resigning the captaincy this month
