 CHANDIGARH, India, Feb 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An accidental fire in an incubator killed five newborns and injured another at a state-run hospital in Punjab on Saturday, officials said. The accident occurred at Rajendra hospital in Patiala where the babies were being treated for jaundice in a special phototherapy machine using special lights. Police and hospital authorities said a short-circuit could have sparked the fire. "Five infants were killed before help could arrive," Surinder Kumar, the hospital's superintendent, said. The babies were all less than a week old and had been fed by their mothers barely 20 minutes before the accident. The local government has ordered an investigation. The families are being given about $2,050 each as compensation
