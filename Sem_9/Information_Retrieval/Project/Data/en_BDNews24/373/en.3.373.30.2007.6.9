<TITLE> Kuwait deputies to question oil minister </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUWAIT, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Several Kuwaiti parliamentarians said on Saturday they would go ahead with plans to question the Gulf Arab state's oil minister even though he had expressed regret over controversial remarks about a predecessor. Parliament has ignored calls by the government of the major OPEC producer for a fresh start just three months after another row led to the resignation of the previous cabinet. The country's ruler, Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, has urged parliament to end the row and give the new government a chance. Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah, a member of the ruling family, came under attack after a newspaper quoted him as saying he would seek advice on oil issues from Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, a relative who was investigated over the alleged embezzlement of $130 million at Kuwait Oil Tanker Co. Sheikh Khalifa has denied any wrongdoing and a ministers' court dropped the case against him on a technicality in 2001. The oil minister has expressed regrets over his remarks. "We will present the questioning request tomorrow. It has the support of several lawmakers," Musallam al-Barrak, a key member of the opposition liberal Popular Bloc, told reporters. Barrak, who wants the oil minister to quit, said his group would not accept the government moving the oil minister to another portfolio to avoid questions as was reported by some newspapers. Newspapers said the cabinet would discuss the matter on Sunday, its first meeting after Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah returned from a two-week trip to Asia. A public questioning is parliament's sharpest weapon as it could lead to a no-confidence motion. Deputies often threaten to quiz ministers to force them to resign. The emir has the last say in politics but tends only to enter the fray to resolve major issues. Kuwait's rulers have dissolved parliament several times since it was set up in 1963
