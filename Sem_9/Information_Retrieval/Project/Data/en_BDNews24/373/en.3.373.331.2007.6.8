 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government has asked deputy commissioners to keep a close eye on the market to rein in soaring prices of daily essentials, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said Friday. The instructions came at the final session of the district administrators' conference held at the secretariat. After the conference, Ali Imam Majumder told reporters: "Directives are in force to watch if there is any obstacle to a smooth supply of goods. DCs were asked to speed up anticorruption drives and remain alert about extortionists. On the DCs' views over separation of the judiciary from the executive, he said: "Anxiety rises while something is in progress. If any problem arises, we will see to it." DCs were also asked to help fast-track the government's reform efforts in the interest of people, the secretary said. "They (deputy commissioners) have been told to act impartially," he added. After the conference, Gazipur DC Syed Mizanur Rahman said, "We had talks on keeping prices of daily essentials at a tolerable level. We welcome the decision to separate the judiciary."
