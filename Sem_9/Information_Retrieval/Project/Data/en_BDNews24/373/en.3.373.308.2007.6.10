 LOS ANGELES, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - `Grey's Anatomy' star Isaiah Washington, fiercely criticized for an anti-gay slur he reportedly made last year, said on Friday he was `mad as hell' at being fired from the hit US television hospital drama.

It is one of the most-watched television dramas in the United States, averaging more than 18 million viewers a week. In this past season's final episode, Burke was supposed to have married another doctor. But he abruptly left minutes before the wedding was set to begin.
