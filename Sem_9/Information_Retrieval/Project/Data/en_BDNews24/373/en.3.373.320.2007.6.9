<TITLE> Malaysia to set up copyright court </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Malaysia will set up a copyright court by the end of the year as part of efforts to stamp out music and movie piracy, a newspaper reported on Saturday. The court, which will initially operate in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and its surrounding areas, would speed up copyright infringement trials and curb movie piracy, Domestic Trade Minister Shafie Apdal was quoted as saying by New Straits Times. The court would be set up later in other major towns, he added. Malaysia, which figures on a US watchlist on piracy, has stepped up efforts to rein in copyright pirates as it negotiates a free-trade pact with the United States. The government this year deployed two sniffer dogs to detect optical disks in hidden compartments or shipments, becoming the first country in the world to use the animals to hunt for disks of illegal recordings hidden in cargo.
