<TITLE> Bush visits Pope and Prodi; Rome braced for protest </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush met Italy's president on Saturday, and was due to see Pope Benedict for the first time for talks expected to centre on their differences on Iraq and their common stand against abortion. But Bush's meeting at the Vatican may be overshadowed by the large protests expected during his one-day visit to Rome, which has set off a political row over whether the government has prepared adequate security measures. As Bush began a day of meetings with a visit to President Giorgio Napolitano -- an 81-year-old former Communist, in a country now ruled by a centre-left coalition critical of US foreign policy -- about 10,000 police secured central Rome. Leftist and pacifists opposed to the war in Iraq and to the expansion of a US military base in northern Italy took trains to Rome for protests that will echo those in Germany at the Group of Eight summit. Many who elected Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, as well as some of Prodi's own members of parliament, may join the rallies -- which the organisers promised would be peaceful. "Bush is the biggest international terrorist. It's a disgrace the Italian government elected by the votes of pacifists should invite him to this country," said Elio Luppoli, arriving in Rome with about 70 protesters from Milan. But fears the protest might turn violent were highlighted by the cancellation of Bush's planned visit to Rome's colourful Trastevere quarter, where he was to have met leaders of the Sant'Egidio Roman Catholic community. One of Rome's oldest neighbourhoods, its narrow, cobbled alleys would have been difficult for the presidential motorcade. The group, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize because of its work brokering peace and fighting AIDS in Africa, will instead meet Bush at the US embassy after he sees the Pope. Bush and the 80-year-old Pontiff are expected to speak privately for about 30 minutes in Benedict's study in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace. The pair see eye-to-eye on ethical issues such as abortion and euthanasia but are divided over the war in Iraq, which Benedict's predecessor, John Paul, tried hard to avert. "The United States is a great country and the president has particularly distinguished himself for several positive initiatives in favour of the defence of life from conception," Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, told an Italian newspaper earlier this month. But he cited Iraq as among the "problems that remain" and suggested the Pope and Bush will also discuss the plight of the minority Christian population there. Bush told an Italian newspaper on June 1 that his intention was "mainly to listen" to the Pope. Bush also said he would be eager to discuss changes in China and the future of post-Castro Cuba if the Pope wanted. Bush has also made time in his schedule for talks with the leader of Italy's centre-right opposition, former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. He has criticised Prodi's leftist allies for preparing what they say is a lukewarm welcome for Bush at best. He turned the cancellation of Bush's Trastevere visit into a political issue, accusing the government of not being able to guarantee adequate security for the US president. "This is shameful," said Berlusconi, who made Italy a staunch US ally during his time in power
