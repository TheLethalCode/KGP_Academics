 WASHINGTON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia has stepped in to try to help with the transfer of funds from a Macau bank to North Korea, said US officials on Monday, who hope an end to the deadlock will quickly revive a stalled disarmament effort. The issue of roughly $25 million frozen in a Macau-based Banco Delta Asia account has held up implementation of a February 13 disarmament deal with Pyongyang, which has refused to shut down its Yongbyon nuclear complex until it has the money. But international banks have refused so far to touch the funds or be involved in the transfer for fear that strict US financial laws will taint them. The $25 million at Banco Delta Asia was blocked after the United States blacklisted the bank, accusing it of laundering illicit funds for North Korea. US officials said Russia had offered its help but declined to provide further details. "The United States is working with the Russians and the Macanese to facilitate the transfer," said US Treasury Department spokeswoman Molly Millerwise. "We appreciate the willingness of the Russian government to facilitate the transaction and the good cooperation of the Macanese authorities," she added. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that a transaction allowing the funds to be transferred to a Russian bank was expected to be completed this week, but Millerwise declined comment on the report as did the State Department. The Journal said the private Russian Bank likely to receive the funds was the Far East Commercial Bank, where Pyongyang has a dormant account. There is a banking holiday in Russia both on Monday and Tuesday and the earliest any money could be transferred would likely be on Wednesday. There has been growing optimism in recent days that a deal could be near over the blocked funds and US Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill said he was hopeful. "I think we will find a solution to this problem of getting them back their money. So, I'm not too worried about this in the long run," Hill said in an interview with C-SPAN that aired on Sunday. US-SOUTH KOREA MEETING Hill met his South Korean counterpart to the six-party talks, Chun Yung-Woo, in Washington later on Monday for about an hour and the two discussed efforts to resolve the BDA matter, said US State Department spokesman Tom Casey. "We'd all like to see this behind us so we can get back down to the real business of the six-party talks, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," State Department spokesman Sean McCormack earlier told reporters. The six-party talks bring together the two Koreas, Russia, China, Japan and the United States, and McCormack said the United States wanted Pyongyang to follow through on its commitments from the February 13 agreement. Under that deal, North Korea is slated to get 50,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil, or its equivalent, once it completes initial steps including shutting down Yongbyon. During the next phase of the agreement, which includes making a complete declaration of all its nuclear programs and disabling all its nuclear facilities, North Korea will get economic, energy and humanitarian aid up to the equivalent of a further 950,000 metric tons of heavy fuel oil.
