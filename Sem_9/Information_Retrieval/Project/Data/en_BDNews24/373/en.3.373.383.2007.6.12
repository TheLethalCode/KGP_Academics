<TITLE> Abortion numbers threaten to intensify debate </TITLE>

 LONDON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An increasingly bitter debate as the Abortion Act marks its 40th year looks set to be reignited on Tuesday when the government publishes annual figures for the number of terminations. Last month, Scotland's most senior Roman Catholic, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, launched a fierce attack on pro-abortion Catholic politicians, saying they should consider their stance on receiving Communion. Urging them to renounce what he called an unspeakable crime, he said the abortion rate in Scotland was the equivalent of two Dunblane school massacres a day. Then, last week, MPs at Westminster voted down a proposal by Conservative Ann Winterton that women seeking an abortion be required to have counselling first. Winterton said the suicide rate among women who had had abortions was six times higher than among women who gave birth the previous year, citing a 2005 Finnish study. "An increasing number of doctors are becoming seriously concerned about the possible effects of abortion on women involved in this destructive form of medicine," she said. Anne Quesney, director of pro-choice group Abortion Rights, said Winterton's bill was "part of a concerted campaign in Parliament to misrepresent the abortion issue with the aim of winning successive restrictions in women's rights and ultimately a complete ban." Winterton's bill was the third attempt since October by pro-life backbenchers to add restrictions to the availability of abortion. Both the other proposals were also defeated, one to reduce the abortion time limit to 21 weeks from 24, and another to force doctors to inform parents of girls under 16 seeking abortion. The debate is likely to return to parliament during the passage of the government's Human Tissue and Embryos Bill, which is expected to attract abortion amendments from pro-life backbenchers. The number of women in England and Wales choosing to end their pregnancy has been rising steadily since abortion was legalised in 1967, with 186,416 terminations conducted in 2005. Later this month, doctors will debate recommendations to radically ease restrictions on abortions at the British Medical Association's annual conference in Torquay. The BMA's medical ethics committee says it should be much simpler for women to have abortions within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy -- which account for 9 out of 10 terminations. It said women should be able to decide for themselves whether to have a termination in the first three months, with no need for medical permission, as is the case in many other countries. It says that the current legislation already in effect amounts to abortion on demand for pregnancies of less than 13 weeks. That is because doctors -- unless they object on grounds of conscience -- will always certify that the risk to the life, physical and mental health of a woman of continuing the pregnancy is greater than that of having an abortion. However, as many as one in four GPs refuse to sign abortion consent forms, according to a survey last month by medical weekly Pulse. Nottingham University Lecturer Dr Robbie Foy, who has conducted research on abortion, told Pulse that access to abortion was "a lottery for women". The BMA committee also recommended allowing nurses and midwives to carry out abortions, and permitting terminations to be conducted outside licensed clinics, such as in GP surgeries or at the patient's home. The government says it has no plans to introduce any changes to the 1967 Abortion Act. Parliamentary practice on the controversial issue is for backbenchers to make proposals for changes to the law, with bills decided on a free vote.
