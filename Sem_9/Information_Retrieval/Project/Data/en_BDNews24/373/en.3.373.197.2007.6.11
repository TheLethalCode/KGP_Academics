 CAIRO, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert may attend a meeting of the Quartet of Middle East mediators in Egypt this month, Egypt's foreign minister said on Sunday. Ahmed Aboul Gheit told a news conference after talks with his Dutch counterpart that some members of the Quartet had suggested Abbas and Olmert could attend the talks, scheduled for June 26 in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Western diplomats had said Olmert and Abbas could resume bilateral talks later this month at the Quartet meeting. But Olmert's office said on Thursday he had not yet received an invitation. The Quartet comprises the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia. Abbas postponed a meeting with Olmert on Wednesday, seeking commitments Israel would take confidence-building steps such as releasing frozen Palestinian funds. The summit had been due to take place in Jericho on Thursday. Egypt said last week it had agreed with the Quartet to hold a meeting "to examine specific measures to end the violence between the Israelis and Palestinians and reach a comprehensive calm that will open the way to a resumption of the peace process". Tension between the Palestinians and Israelis has risen in recent weeks. Violence between Palestinian factions in the Gaza Strip has been accompanied by a rise in rocket attacks from Gaza on Israel. Israel has responded by bombing targets in Gaza, killing Palestinian militants and arresting Palestinian lawmakers
