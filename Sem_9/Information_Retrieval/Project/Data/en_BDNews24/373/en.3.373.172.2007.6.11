 SOFIA, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush said on Monday said he hoped that a plan for US and Russian experts to analyse each other's proposal for a missile defence shield would be beneficial. "There's a process where we can collaborate, share information in a very transparent way which I think will be beneficial," for hopefully designing systems that "protect us all", Bush said. Bush reiterated that he had told Russian President Vladimir Putin in talks at the Group of Eight summit in Germany last week that: "I simply do not view Russia as an enemy." He said he discussed with Putin having US experts analyse the Russian proposal for a missile defence system that would include a Russian-controlled radar in Azerbaijan and suggested the Russian leader assign his experts to analyse the US proposal. "And that's where we left it in Germany," he said. "So we're going to have a group of people come together ... to discuss how to deal with the true threats of the 21st century," Bush said
