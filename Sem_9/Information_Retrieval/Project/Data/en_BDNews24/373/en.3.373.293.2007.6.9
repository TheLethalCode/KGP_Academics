 ISLAMABAD, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan announced a pro-growth annual budget on Saturday with an eye on a general election due around the end of the year. "This is a record budget in the history of Pakistan, especially in terms of expenditure on the welfare of the people," Minister of State for Finance Omar Ayub Khan told the National Assembly in his budget speech. The 2007/08 (July-June) budget, with a total size of 1,874 billion rupees, was 42.5 percent larger than the outlay for 2006/07. Development spending was targeted at a record 520 billion rupees, up almost 32 percent on the revised development spending allocation for 2006/07. Defence spending increased 9 percent to 275 billion rupees. Although President Pervez Musharraf is going through the most severe challenge to his authority since he came to power in a military coup eight years ago, the Karachi Stock Exchange top-100 index made life highs last week. Musharraf, who controversially aims to be re-elected by the current assemblies before they are dissolved in November for a general election, plunged Pakistan into a political crisis three months ago by suspending the country's top judge. The KSE index notched a record close of 13,274.87 on Friday, having set an intra-day life high of 13,332.24 points on Wednesday. The index has gained 32 percent since the beginning of 2007. Investors have stuck by Pakistan, despite opposition to Musharraf from the judiciary, media and mainstream political parties of former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, who say they will end their exile this year. The killing of about 40 people in Karachi on May 12-13 was the worst outbreak of political violence in decades, but even that failed to dampen the market's bullishness for long. The government on Friday announced record foreign investment of $6 billion in 2006/07, while foreign portfolio investment totalled $1.819 billion in the July-April period. The economy is expected to have grown by 7.02 percent in 2006/07, and the target for the next fiscal year is 7.20 percent. Pakistan has been among the world's fastest growing economies in recent years, but it has been accompanied by acute economic hardship for some segments of society, and a deterioration in law and order, analysts say
