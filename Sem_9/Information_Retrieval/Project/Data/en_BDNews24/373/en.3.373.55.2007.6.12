<TITLE> UK govt defeats opposition call for Iraq inquiry </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labour government defeated an opposition call for an inquiry into the Iraq war on Monday, sparing Blair and his successor-in-waiting Gordon Brown embarrassment. Parliament voted 288 to 253 against a motion by the opposition Conservatives which called for a special inquiry into the run-up to the 2003 war and its consequences. While the vote saw the Labour government's majority cut, the margin of victory was greater than a previous vote on a similar motion last year. The vote came on the day that Brown, who is due to take over as prime minister in two weeks' time, visited Iraq to find out more about the situation on the ground. During his six-hour visit, Brown said that mistakes had been made in Iraq, but refused to be drawn into media speculation that he may speed up the withdrawal of British troops to assuage public anger over the war. Britain has about 5,500 troops serving in Iraq, but is scheduled to reduce the force by about 1,500. Brown has said he will reduce troop numbers as and when possible, but aides say he is unlikely to make any sudden shifts in policy as the British militayr is already planning further cutbacks
