 COLOMBO, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka's government said on Sunday it regretted evicting of hundreds of minority ethnic Tamils from the capital this week on security grounds and promised it would not happen again. Police on Thursday swept boarding houses in Colombo and deported 376 Tamils deemed to be without valid reason to stay in the capital to the war-torn north, but returned many of them on Saturday after the Supreme Court issued an order blocking such evictions. Civil rights groups said the evictions were disgrace to humanity, adding they could stoke ethnic tensions at a time when the civil war that has killed nearly 70,000 people since 1983 is deepening. "I express regret regarding the shifting of people from here to various other places. That should never have been done," Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake told a news conference. "Hereafter that won't happen." "We take full responsibility for all done by the officials." After the court order was issued on Friday and after his government had insisted for two days the Tamils had left the capital voluntarily, President Mahinda Rajapaksa's office said he had launched an inquiry into the police operation, and any wrongdoers would be disciplined. Authorities had wanted those deported to cross into rebel-held territory and return to their native villages at a time when the military and Tamil Tigers are fighting artillery duels. Police had justified the evictions as a security measure following attacks blamed on the rebels in and around the capital in recent months, saying it was also an effort to eject any potential Tiger infiltrators from Colombo. However in a U-turn, police on Saturday transported dozens of the deportees back to Colom
