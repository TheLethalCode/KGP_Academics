 MUMBAI, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares rose more than 1 percent in morning trade on Monday, tracking a rebound in Asian markets after last week's sell-off and with sentiment upbeat as the country's biggest initial public offering ever got under way. Indian property developer DLF Ltd said the institutional portion of its $2.4 billion IPO, which runs until Thursday, had been fully subscribed within an hour of its opening on Monday. Index heavyweights Infosys Technologies and Reliance Industries led the gains and by 11:50 am (0620 GMT) the 30-share BSE index was up 1.09 percent, or 152.88 points, at 14,216.69, with 24 of the components rising. The index fell 3.5 percent last week, after failing to top its February record high. "I think the markets would take some time, but they are decently poised for strong gains," said Sumeet Rohra, an analyst with Tricolor India Fund. "If you look at the response to DLF initial public offering ... the appetite for Indian equity is quite strong and the excesses have been corrected last week." Shares in top private firm Reliance Industries rose 1.3 percent to 1,681.90 rupees. The stock lost almost 5 percent in the past three sessions after rising 27.5 percent since the end of March. Shares in software services firms, which earn a majority of their revenue outside India, attracted investors on expectations that the rupee would not rise much further against the dollar. "Clearly there is (earnings) visibility in the sector," Rohra said. "Even if a rising rupee hurts, the upside is still much more than the downside." Second-ranked software exporter Infosys Technologies rose 2 percent to 1,989 rupees, while sector leader Tata Consultancy Services gained nearly 1 percent. The BSE sector index was up 1.7 percent. Banking stocks also gained after a fall in inflation eased concerns of further monetary tightening by the central bank. Private sector lender HDFC Bank was up 2.3 percent at 1,116 rupees, while the BSE bank index gained 0.6 percent. In the broader market, 1,501 gainers were ahead of 748 losers on volume of 77.5 million shares. The 50-share NSE index rose 0.88 percent to 4,181.65. Elsewhere in the region, Colombo's All-Share index was up 0.16 percent at 2,559.53, while Karachi's 100-share index opened at a life high of 13,382.66 after the budget and was trading 0.5 percent up at 13,341.13. STOCKS ON THE MOVE Shares in Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd were up 3.5 percent at 699 rupees after the drug maker said its board had approved splitting each of its shares into two. MSK Projects India Ltd jumped 7.8 percent after the construction firm won an order worth 348.8 million rupees from Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd. Carborundum Universal Ltd rose 4.2 percent after the abrasives maker said it had signed a deal to acquire 84.14 percent of Russia's Volzhsky Abrasives Works for an undisclosed sum.
