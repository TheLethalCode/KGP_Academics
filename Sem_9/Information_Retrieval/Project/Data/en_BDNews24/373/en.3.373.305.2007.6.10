 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  A convict in an arms case attempted suicide before a judge in a special court Sunday. Suman, also known as Selim, convicted of possessing arms under the Speedy Trial Act, gulped down a packet of pesticide in front of judge AKM Enamul Haque of a metropolitan special court. A court official preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com that Selim had earlier told the court he would take pesticide if he was not transferred to Dhaka Central Jail from Kashimpur jail. Selim claimed he was having trouble in Kashimpur jail and would be better off dead. "The central jail authorities illegally sent me to Kashimpur jail because I informed others that Amanullah Aman (former BNP state minister) talked to people on the cellphone," Selim said. "I'll die if I'm sent back to Kashimpur jail." "I may as well kill myself," Selim shouted in court shortly before he made the attempt on his own life. Police at once swooped on him, took the packet of pesticide away and dragged him out of the court. Jail authorities could not say how he had managed to obtain the packet. Sub-inspector Mostafa Noor Rahim, in charge of security at the judge court, only said: "Constables Md Majibar and Md Quader were assigned to guard him in court." The constables could not be contacted. Selim was taken to hospital. He recovered fully and was later able to confirm that he was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where doctors induced vomiting. Selim told bdnews24.com that narcotics including heroin and Phensidyl are traded in Kashimpur jail. He also said he was tortured in jail although he did not say by whom. Despite several appeals, he was not sent to the central jail as the jail authorities were angry with him, he claimed. Major Shamsul Haider Siddiqui, deputy inspector general (prisons), told bdnews24.com that jail authorities would investigate the matter. Judge's stenographer Md Tariqul Islam said Selim had created a disturbance in court several times. bdnews
