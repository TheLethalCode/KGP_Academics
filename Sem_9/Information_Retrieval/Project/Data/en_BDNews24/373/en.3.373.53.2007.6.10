 PARIS, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France votes in the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday with President Nicolas Sarkozy's party expected to strengthen its hold on power, clearing the way for him to push ahead with reforms. Sarkozy was elected on a promise to break with the past and plans sweeping changes to labour laws, the justice and education systems and fiscal steps to make the economy more dynamic. He will need to retain his UMP party's wide parliamentary majority if he is to push these measures through -- some of them in a special summer session of parliament after the second round of the election on June 17. His popularity has surged since he beat Socialist Segolene Royal in the May 6 presidential election and opinion polls are predicting the UMP will increase the number of seats in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. The latest survey for the pollster BVA said the UMP will have at least 366-419 deputies, a larger majority than the 359 seats they hold now in the 577-seat National Assembly, against 120-173 for the Socialists who have 149 seats at present. Smaller groups like the Communists or Greens are expected to win just a handful of seats while the far-right National Front party is not expected to pick up any seats at all. Polls will open at 8 am (0600 GMT) in mainland France. Some overseas voters cast their ballots on Saturday. Results are expected after voting ends at 8.00 pm (1800 GMT). BLUE WAVE French media have talked about a "blue wave" of gains for the conservative party, washing away rivals. It will be the third time French voters cast their ballots in less than 2 months. The Socialists have urged their supporters not to give way to election fatigue and disappointment and turn out in large numbers on Sunday to prevent an even larger majority for Sarkozy. The Socialists have not been helped by a round of infighting and finger-pointing after Royal's defeat last month which has distracted them from the legislative campaign. Royal has made it known that she would like to take over as head of the party. But Socialist leader Francois Hollande, her partner and father of their four children, is planning to hold on to the job until 2008. A party's showing in the legislative elections also dictates future public funding. Some smaller parties, such as the National Front, are expected to face financial difficulties if they do not gather enough votes. Eleven of Sarkozy's 15-member government are also up for election. They are all expected to win their positions but Prime Minister Francois Fillon, who is running himself, has told them they will have to leave the government if they lose. Candidates can win a seat in the first round with over half the votes cast by at least a quarter of registered voters but if no candidate does this a second round is held on June 17.
