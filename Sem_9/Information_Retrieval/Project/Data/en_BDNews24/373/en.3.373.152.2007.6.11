 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa's Graham Ford has turned down the post of India's new national cricket coach and decided to stay with Kent, his county club said on Monday. Ford was selected for the job by India's coaching committee after an interview in Chennai on Saturday, pipping fellow candidate and former England spinner John Emburey. Ford, who remains Kent's director of cricket, was due to have his appointment formally ratified by the Indian board's decision-making working committee on Tuesday.

Along with Ford and Emburey, the board had also considered Australian Dav Whatmore, the outgoing Bangladesh coach, before rejecting his bid on Wednesday.
