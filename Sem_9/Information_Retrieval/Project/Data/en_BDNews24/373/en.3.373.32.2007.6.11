 MAITLAND, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thousands of Australians started returning home on Monday after floods and storms in the wine-making Hunter Valley area eased, but residents downstream near the city of Newcastle braced for floodwaters, officials said. "It is like a ghost town. It's just a matter of waiting for people to return," Lee Bennett told local radio from the town of Maitland, which was evacuated on Sunday. A major storm that battered Australia's east coast for days, causing the worst flooding in the Hunter Valley for 30 years and beaching a coal ship on the coast, eased on Sunday. Nine people died in the storm, which cut off towns and left farms isolated like islands in the Hunter Valley. "As somebody who's visited this area on numerous occasions in my lifetime...it's unrecognisable in many ways from the air," said Prime Minister John Howard during a visit to the area. "It is an illustration to me...just how savage the storms have been and the tragedy of course is that there has been a loss of life," Howard said. Around 5,000 residents from Maitland were evacuated on Sunday fearing the swollen Hunter River would break levees overnight. It didn't and the river spared the town but surrounding farms were flooded. "We now have the all-clear," said New South Wales State Emergency Services (SES) spokesman Phil Campbell. "Those people behind the levees...may return to their businesses and homes." However, about 400 residents from flooded farms outside Maitland were unable to return home. The floodwaters moved downstream on Sunday towards Newcastle, one of Australia's major coal export ports, but were not expected to cause severe flooding. "At this stage the SES doesn't believe flooding will lead to forced evacuations," said an SES spokeswoman. Emergency officials warned people returning home to avoid floodwaters because of raw sewage overflows. "You can imagine the amount of rubbish that is coming out of drains and out of gutters. You wouldn't swim in a sewage farm and basically I can't understand people who play in floodwater," said SES spokesman Steve Delaney. About 50,000 homes are without power and electricity officials said some would remain without power for a week as power lines and poles had been destroyed. "Residents returning to their homes need to be safe and conscious that services may have become unstable due to the rain and flooding," police superintendent Des Organ told reporters. Despite the flooding rains, Sydney's main catchment area received very little rain, with just 40 mm falling in the city's main Warragamba Dam. The wild seas that beached the bulk carrier "Pasha Bulker" on Friday had eased and a salvage crew was examining whether to try to refloat the ship, said Newcastle port authorities. Authorities had feared a marine disaster if the giant ship broke up and spilt its 700 tonnes of fuel and oil. The salvage team had discovered a hole in the external hull of the ship, but believe a second internal hull had not been pierced. "It's understandable. It took a punch in the bottom as it was pushed across the reef," said Neil Patchett for NSW Maritime. All coal loading operations in Newcastle have been suspended until the seas calm, leaving more than 50 ships anchored offshore. ($1 = A$1.21
