 HONG KONG, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hong Kong blue chips rose on Monday, clawing back some of last session's sharp losses, helped by gains in mainland telco shares after telecoms network company Ericsson signed a deal with the parent of China Mobile. Hong Kong-listed China plays gained 0.7 percent, boosted by surging coal shares. China Shenhua, the country's top coal producer, said on Monday it was acquiring equity interests in two power plants to raise capacity. But investors were cautious before a slew of economic data this week, among them China and US consumer price indexes, key gauges of inflation. The benchmark Hang Seng Index closed up 106.34 points to end at 20,615.49, having traded in a narrow range on shrinking turnover. Monday's mainboard volume totalled HK$55.9 billion (US$7.2 billion), near the low end of a recent range and down sharply from Friday's HK$69.1 billion. "We have a lot of data from US and China this week, so most investors prefer to stay sidelined, waiting for any big surprises in the data," said Andy Lam, director at Harris Fraser. Rising food inflation will spur investors to scrutinise China's May CPI, which is due on Tuesday. "Rising headline inflation could push the PBoC (People's Bank of China) to tighten macro policy faster than many investors expect," Merrill Lynch said in a report released after Friday's market close. The US's May CPI will also be closely watched after Treasury yields surged late last week. The China Enterprises index of H shares, or Hong Kong-listed shares in mainland companies, gained 75.35 points to finish at 10,903.99. Mainland telco plays rose after Ericsson on Sunday signed a framework deal to provide $1 billion worth of networking equipment to China Mobile's parent. Investors were looking for reasons to ramp up telecoms stocks and saw the deal as a sign that 3G licences could soon be issued, traders said. China Unicom, the country's number-two cellular carrier, vaulted 5.8 percent to HK$11.70. China Telecom, the country's top fixed-line operator, raced up 2.3 percent to HK$4.55 in heavy trade while rival China Netcom gained 2.8 percent to HK$20.45. China Mobile, in keeping with its recent underperforming streak, rose 0.8 percent to HK$72.90. Telecoms gear-maker ZTE Corp leapt 3.5 percent to HK$39.85. Among coal plays, China Shenhua gained 1.6 percent to HK$24.90. China Coal surged 6 percent to HK$10.66 and Yanzhou Coal jumped 6.1 percent to HK$10.74. China Communications Construction Co Ltd saw follow-through buying after a report last week quoted the company's chairman as saying the mainland port builder's profits rose 60 to 70 percent and revenue rose 30 percent in the first four months of this year. Its shares ended at HK$11.90, up 3.1 percent. New issue Tianneng Power International Ltd, a mainland battery producer, settled near the low-end of the day's range at HK$1.97, 2.6 percent higher than its IPO price of HK$1.92. Mobile handset maker Foxconn International Holdings fell for a seventh-straight session, dropping 0.9 percent to HK$21.25, amid continuing weakness at key customer Motorola. Micro-motor maker Johnson Electric tumbled 6.3 percent to HK$4.73 after saying its year net profit rose 17 percent to total US$110 million, lagging forecasts and spurring several broker downgrades.
