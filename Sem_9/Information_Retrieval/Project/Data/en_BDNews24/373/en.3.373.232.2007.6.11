 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A jump in British utility Centrica and bank Barclays on Monday helped UK stocks regain some of the ground they lost the previous week on the prospect of higher interest rates. At 0813 GMT, the FTSE was up 0.6 percent, having lost about 2.4 percent the previous week when the possibility of further monetary tightening drove benchmark US bond yields above 5.25 percent. Banks added 8.5 points to the index as Barclays climbed 2.2 percent on a newspaper report that said an activist fund has called on the bank to drop its agreed bid for Dutch bank ABN AMRO Utility Centrica was the top performer in the index after Gazprom's deputy chief executive, Alexander Medvedev, said on Sunday that the Russian gas giant was close to closing a deal to increase its market presence in Britain. "The market never goes up in a straight line and so some sort of correction was probably inevitable over the last couple of weeks," said Richard Hunter, head of UK equities at Hargreaves Lansdown. "The street bounced back on Friday which had a positive impact on us this morning and one would hope this is somewhere where we could consolidate from." At a time when investors are on alert over the interest rate outlook globally, the European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet's testimony at the European parliament will come in focus. GSK rose 0.6 percent after researchers said on Saturday the drugmaker's experimental platelet-boosting drug eltrombopag has produced further positive results in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). InterContinental Hotels Group rose 1.9 percent. Traders said the stock was still rallying from Friday's market talk that property and investment tycoons the Barclay brothers might bid for the world's biggest hotelier. Cadbury Schweppes also gained 1.3 percent. The Times reported the firm is planning a new range of low-sugar sweets and chocolates in a bid to meet the changing tastes of increasingly health-conscious consumers. Bucking the trend, Rexam fell 3.4 percent to become the biggest loser of the index, after the world's biggest can maker agreed to buy the plastic-packaging business of Owens-Illinois Inc for $1.83 billion in cash, as it moves to target the fast-growing market for packaging medicines. JJB Sports jumped 3 percent on bid speculation mounted after news that founder David Whelan has sold his 29.9 percent stake in the firm at 275 pence a share to a joint venture between Icelandic financial group Exista hf and sports retailer Chris Ronnie
