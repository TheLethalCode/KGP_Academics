<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  The deputy commissioners (DCs) have asked the government for powers to take legal action against corruption and irregularity by elected local government representatives. They have also suggested keeping members of parliament away from relief operations at the end of a three-day conference ending Friday with 156 proposals. The deputy commissioners favoured revival of the "Union Parishad and Municipal Ordinance 1983" where local public representatives are accountable to the office of the deputy commissioners. They said a revision of the ordinance saw the control shift to the Local Government Division and they were helpless despite receiving widespread accusations of irregularity. The Local Government Division, however, said municipal and union parishad chairmen and members should be accountable to the Division. Steps have been taken to ensure transparency and accountability of the representatives, it said. bdnews24.co
