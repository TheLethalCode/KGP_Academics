<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) - The central bank seeks full autonomy, as enjoyed by its counterparts in other countries. "Autonomy is necessary for proper functioning of the banking sector," Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told reporters Sunday. "The central bank is more or less guided by a ministry. It is often a lengthy process to get clearance from the government in order for the bank to take decisions," said Ahmed following a dialogue on 'Safe Migration and Remittances' at BRAC Centre Inn. Ahmed added that they often have to send proposals to more than one ministry before the bank can move on many issues of importance. The governor has sought autonomy for the bank in the presence of foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury. Ahmed said full autonomy would turn the central bank into a dynamic regulator and supervisor of the country's banks and financial institutions. Administrative reforms are required to make the central bank a full-fledged autonomous body, he added. Ahmed said: "Full autonomy does not mean lack of accountabilitythere must be a system to ensure accountability." Replying to a query, the central bank boss said negotiations have already begun with the government on implementing full autonomy. "We've proposed a new pay scale to the government for the Bangladesh Bank," he said. bdn
