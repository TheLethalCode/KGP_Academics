 LOS ANGELES, June 11(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Paris Hilton, sent back to jail for violating probation in a drunken-driving case, will finish her sentence at the medical ward where she ended up after a day of house arrest, the celebrity Web site TMZ.com reported on Sunday. TMZ, citing unnamed sources, also said the 26-year-old hotel heiress was eating again, still having trouble sleeping and had received visits from her sister, Nicky, and her sometime boyfriend, Greek shipping scion Stavros Niarchos.

"Being in jail is by far the hardest thing I have ever done," she said in a written statement issued by her attorney, Richard Hutton. "During the past several days, I have had a lot of time to think and I believe that I am learning and growing from this experience." She added that she was 'shocked' by the attention her case has received. "I would hope going forward that the public and the media will focus on more important things like the men and women serving our country in Iraq and other places around the world," she said. Hilton's early release to house arrest sparked national outrage and accusations of preferential treatment because of her celebrity status. She was sentenced to jail last month for violating probation in an alcohol-related reckless case by driving on a suspended licens
