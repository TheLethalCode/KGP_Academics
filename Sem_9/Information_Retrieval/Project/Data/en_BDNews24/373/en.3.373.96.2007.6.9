 Sreepur (Gazipur), June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Sreepur municipality of Gazipur district, the locale for the voter list pilot project that begins Sunday, has already donned a festive mood. Voters would also be provided with national IDs under the project, the upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) said. Jalaluddin Ahmed, the UNO of Sreepur, told bdnews24.com Saturday the upazila officials have met the locals several times at schools, colleges and madrasas to sensitise them about the project. Voters will be registered at 30 centres across the upazila where their photographs and finger-prints will be taken, he said. The success of the countrywide voter listing and national IDs preparation and distribution hinges largely on the pilot exercise. The officials will issue villagers national IDs with the help of 24 army units deployed to assist them, the UNO elaborated. The army is providing technical assistance along with laptop computers and other accessories for the pilot project, the UNO's office said. Sreepur municipal chairman Anisur Rahman said nine committees have been formed with the ward commissioners heading them to take the voter listing activities ahead smoothly. The EC officials started moving from door to door Saturday to distribute the forms for people to fill out, he said. The voters will deposit the filled-out forms at the 30 centres and receive their IDs as well. The centres have been strategically located so that the distance from one centre to another will not be more than half a kilometre, he said. The EC officials will fill out forms for those of those illiterate, Anis said. Local teachers and other workers numbering 145 have also been engaged to assist in the process, the chairman added. "We are telling people about the benefits, services and responsibilities of a listed voter and national ID holder. I expect all eligible persons will be listed as voters this time,"Anis said. bdnews24.co
