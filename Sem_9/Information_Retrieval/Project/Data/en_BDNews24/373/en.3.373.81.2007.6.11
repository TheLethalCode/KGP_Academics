 Sylhet, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The army chief, General Moeen U Ahmed, has asked the government to declare expatriate Bangladeshis "special citizens" if they keep a specified amount of fixed deposits in the country. The army chief made the request while attending the inauguration of Trust Bank's corporate office in Sylhet Monday. "Expatriates are making an important contribution to the economic development of this country by earning foreign exchange," he said. "We request the government to provide the expatriates with a special service. A special service for expatriates has already been introduced to Dhaka airport." He added that the expatriates should not only enjoy "special privilege" in airport but also get additional assistance with all administrative work. On the new voter ID card pilot project in Gazipur, Moeen said: "The ID cards will contain a lot of information and will help people in many ways, including passport application, bank loans and for different licences." The army chief said: "It's time to take the country to a higher level on the road to development, with combined efforts of all." "Let's all work together for the development of our country and enrich our foreign exchange reserve." bdnews24.com/c
