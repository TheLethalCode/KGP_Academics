 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Law adviser Mainul Hosein Sunday blamed the delay in holding elections on a lack of reforms in political parties. "Political parties will be responsible if lack of reforms delay the polls. But we believe the election will be held by 2008," the adviser told reporters in his office. Mainul said the country's politics were influenced by black money, which destroyed democracy in political parties. "We want honest and efficient people to come to politics to establish democracy," he said. "Political leaders themselves are talking about reforms. Some speak of reforms, excluding Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina. We created awareness among politicians." On Troika delegation's visit to Bangladesh, the adviser said: "The Troika delegation showed interest in what is happening in the country." "But the roadmap they have talked about is not what we want," he said. "We want a roadmap for democracy. We want to establish real democracy through the polls." Mainul however evaded a question on when the ban on indoor politics would go. He said the government has been monitoring political leaders on reforms. "We didn't bar them to speak on reforms," the adviser said. On a much-talked-about government-backed political party, Mainul said: "We have no plans to form a new political party." He said the government was not troubled by criticism. "But legal action will be taken against those who will conspire to topple the government or act against the interest of the country." bdnews
