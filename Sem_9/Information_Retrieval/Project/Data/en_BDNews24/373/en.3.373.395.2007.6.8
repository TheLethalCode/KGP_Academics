 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  BNP Friday welcomed the caretaker government's proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08 as balanced. The immediate-past ruling party described the budget proposals for human resource development, education, agriculture, power and social sectors as positive. It advised the government to reduce foreign dependence. In a reaction to the full-year budget at his Gulshan home, BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan told reporters: "There are a number of good sides to the budget." The last several budgets were designed in the light of Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which has influenced latest one as well, he said On the steps to control prices of essential commodities, Bhuiyan said: "I doubt how much government measures to cut commodity prices would succeed." "Only duty withdrawal would not bring down prices. The regulatory system must be tightened. In the present system, middlemen suck in all benefits." Bhuiyan asked the government to take initiative to increase people's buying capacity alongside curbing the prices. He said people would continue to suffer unless their buying capacity was increased. The BNP secretary general hailed the budgetary measures to reduce poverty, but he criticised it for not having any specific plan to create jobs. He also opposed the imposition of duty on the computer equipment. "An atmosphere for broader use of computer now exists in the country. We think the duty structure on computer equipments should be left unchanged." He supported the proposed duty cut on newsprint import. Bhuiyan welcomed the measures for human resource development, especially research in education sector, increase of stipend at primary level and appointment of new teachers. He said stipends for meritorious and poor students receiving higher education should be further increased. He hailed the allocation of funds for agriculture research as a good sign. The former LGRD minister advocated more allocation for strengthening the local government. "We will have to give the local government system an institutional shape at the grassroots level. Trainings should be arranged for this." He said the BNP-led government started population control activities and sanitation programme for which the interim government has allocated money. Bhuiyan also lauded budgetary proposal to arrange pure drinking water for all. He demanded increased allocation for the power sector to spur industrialisation and development as a whole. bdnew
