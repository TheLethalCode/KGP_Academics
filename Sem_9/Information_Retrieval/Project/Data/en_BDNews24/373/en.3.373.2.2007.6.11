<TITLE> Iran sees India, Pakistan gas talks to end in June </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Talks between India and Pakistan for a $7 billion pipeline to supply Iranian gas to the energy-hungry South Asian nations are on track to be completed by end-June, an official of an Iranian oil firm said on Monday. Iran has the world's second-largest gas reserves after Russia. But sanctions, politics and construction delays have slowed its gas development and analysts say it is unlikely to become a major exporter for a decade. India, Iran and Pakistan agreed over the price formula for the pipeline, known as the "peace pipeline", in January, Hojjatollah Ghanimifard, international affairs director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) said. "We hope the remaining part, which is just some clauses of the sale and purchase agreement of the gas, will be concluded hopefully by the end of June," he told reporters at the Asia Oil and Gas Conference, an energy meeting in the Malaysian capital. The plan provides for 60 million cubic metres (2.2 billion cu ft) of gas to be exported daily to Pakistan and India, half for each country, Ghanimifard said. "The delivery point would be at the Iran-Pakistan border, so the Indians have to finalise the contract for the transportation costs and the transit fee with Pakistan," he added. "As soon as they finish this contract -- they have discussed it for some months now -- we can have everything done." Iran Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh earlier told CNBC that the Iran section of the pipeline is nearly half complete. "I think negotiations for the final stage is underway. Hopefully there will be a result soon," he said. "As far as the project is concerned, for the Iranian section, work has already started. Maybe close to 50 percent is complete and it is continuing." Last week, Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he hoped the deal would be finalised within the year, though Iranian officials had said they hoped to sign a deal in Islamabad on June 30. The pipline, which Ghanimifard said had been under discussion for nearly 15 years, has made slow progress because of political tension between India and Pakistan and difference between New Delhi and Tehran over Iran's nuclear programme
