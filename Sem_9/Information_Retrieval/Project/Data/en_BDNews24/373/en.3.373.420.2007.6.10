 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) - A Dhaka court Sunday sent former BNP lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu into three-day remand in a relief scam case. He was accused of misappropriating government relief such as tin sheets, blankets and rice. Falu was in the dock while Dhaka metropolitan magistrate Jagannath Das Khokan issued the order at 1.15pm. Anticorruption Commission assistant director Sheikh Abdus Salam prayed for seven days to interrogate Falu in the case filed with Tejgaon Police Station on June 6. Falu's lawyer Sanaullah Miah opposed the prayer, saying the so-called relief materials had been recovered when Falu was in jail. On March 2, joint forces recovered 600 pieces of relief CI sheets, 60 blankets and 15 kilogrammes of rotten rice from Tejgaon ward No. 37 commissioner's office that falls under Falu's constituency. Later a case was filed against six people, including Ward No. 37 commissioner Ruhul Amin Bhuiyan, four employees of the ward commissioner's office and Falu. The case was sent to the ACC on April 21 for investigation. Four people accused in the case are at large. bdnew
