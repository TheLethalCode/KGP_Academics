 ISLAMABAD, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday reversed a much-criticised decision to place curbs on television networks after they agreed to draft a code of conduct to ensure respect for the army and judiciary. Unhappy with media coverage of his decision in March to suspend Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, Musharraf issued a decree on Monday giving the state broadcasting authority more powers to shut down television stations. Three days later he suspended the order after scathing criticism in Pakistan and abroad, and on Saturday he withdrew it altogether. Information Minister Mohammad Ali Durrani said Musharraf agreed to rescind the decree after meeting a delegation of broadcasters. "Pakistan Broadcasters Association will prepare a code of conduct in the next three days that will ensure decency in coverage and respect for national institutions like the armed forces and judiciary," Durrani told Reuters. "In return, the President instructed that the government will withdraw the ordinance." Chaudhry's suspension on March 9 touched off protests from lawyers and the opposition which have snowballed into the most serious challenge to the authority of Musharraf since he seized power in 1999. The media decree had empowered the state-run Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) to revoke a broadcaster's licence without referring its case to a complaints council, and to confiscate transmission equipment and seal its offices. Musharraf has projected himself as a champion of the media, as the number of independent broadcasters has multiplied since he came to power in a military coup. But he says some television news channels' reporting of the judicial crisis has been unbalanced. The government has also objected to coverage of opposition rallies in which Chaudhry's supporters criticised the army, and last week effectively banned live broadcasts
