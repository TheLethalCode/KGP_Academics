<TITLE> Hanoi restaurant turns poor kids into gourmet chefs </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 HANOI, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)- In old Hanoi, there is a small restaurant where your dinner could mean the beginning of a great culinary career for some of Vietnam's poorest children. Street children and other disadvantaged kids learn to cook delicious Vietnamese and Western dishes, tend bar, wait tables and speak 'hospitality English' at Koto before they go on to work at some of the finest hotels and restaurants in Vietnam. "I want to be a famous chef and I want to have my own restaurant to help other kids like myself," said Tran Ngoc Lam, 21, standing in his white chef's hat and grey apron as the sounds and smells of lunch cooking swirled in the hot kitchen. Lam's father died when he was very young and he said he had to give up his studies to help support his family. Koto, which stands for 'Know One, Teach One', is on Van Mieu street opposite one of the capital's oldest and most famous landmarks, the Temple of Literature. Foreign tourists and residents of Hanoi often choose to eat at the restaurant after walking around the gardens of the site, which was built in the 11th century as a Confucian pagoda housing Vietnam's first imperial university. ENGLISH LESSONS AND A BICYCLE Diners are served meals in a cool, well-lit room on the first floor by trainees of the non-profit program, which provides English classes, accommodation, food, medical insurance and a bicycle to each student. They earn 600,000 dong ($37) a month and make an average of 150,000 dong ($9) in tips. Vietnam's economy is growing at 8 percent a year, but it is still a poor country with average annual per capita of about $780. Restaurant revenues go back into the training, said Daragh Halpin, the Irish-Australian CEO of Koto, which has an international charity arm in Australia. Founder and director Jimmy Pham began the program in 1999. Bill Clinton was photographed in the restaurant in 2000 when he became the first post-war US president to visit Vietnam. Halpin has been CEO for less than a year but already he describes as 'fantastic' the changes he sees in young people. More than 200 students have graduated from Koto so far. "For them it is the discovery that they can achieve their potential, that they are valued, that they are loved, that they are cared for," Halpin said. "They grow in confidence and self-belief, something they didn't have when they came." Many of their smiling faces can be seen in framed photographs on the third floor, showing the students at work in five-star hotels such as Hanoi Opera Hilton and Sofitel Metropole. Some return to work at Koto to help teach classes. In addition to the main dining room, drinks and meals are also served in the cozy, cushion-seated Temple Bar and a rooftop terrace hosts romantic dinners on Friday and Saturday nights. Specialties include traditional nem tom -- fresh prawn and herbs wrapped in rice paper served with tamarind sauce -- and banh goi -- pastries stuffed with pork and local mushrooms served with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Western lunch menu items with a Hanoian touch include Red River fish and chips and the dinner menu offers everything from Da Nang-style seafood curry to grilled beef medallions. ($1=16,113 do
