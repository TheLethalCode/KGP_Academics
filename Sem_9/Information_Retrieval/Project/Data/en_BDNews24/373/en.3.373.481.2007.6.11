 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh's new captain Mohammad Ashraful saw a drastic change in the national team's practice in term of system under the new coaching staff, compared with former coach Dav Whatmore. "It has changed 70 to 80 percent in the practice with regard to the system and we all enjoyed the practice, but I am not complaining about the system of our former coach, " said Ashraful after the net session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium Monday. "This time the practice system is different from Whatmore's as the batsmen split into three groups are spending more time (almost one hour) in net, which has been divided into three steps," said Ashraful. The players Monday experienced batting on the central wicket and the indoor wicket as well as faced the bowling machine in a row and took part in the fielding session followed by the video session. "After completing the three- phase batting session, a player goes to the fielding session and then he takes part in the video session," the 22-year- old captain said, "It is totally a new system with us as we all enjoyed the system." "Earlier, a batsman hardly got 20 minutes to have net, but this time we are getting almost one hour, Ashraful said adding, "It is also helping us stick to the wicket for long." The Tigers, under the supervision of interim coaches Shaun Williams and Sarwar Imran, are being prepared for their five-week tour of Sri Lanka where they will play three-match Tests series and as many one-day internationals. The new coaching staff emphasised the importance of batting during the practice session with allocation of more time in net. Shaun Williams said, "I have come to assist the players and am trying to make them understand to pick the right ball to hit." "I see no problem with the game, but they (the batsmen) like to play stroke and I have been trying to make them understand to pick the right ball," said Williams adding that they should be more selective to choose the ball. "Generally, our batsmen get little time to bat off the game. If a batsman gets more time to bat in net, he can rectify his mistakes playing repeatedly and we are working in this regard," said Sarwar Imran. It was seen that the coaching staff were rectifying the batsmen when the players made any mistake during the batting session. The batmen also faced a group of new fast bowlers, who were picked from the pacer hunt programme and Ashraful termed them quality bowlers. "It is good for us to have faced such quality bowlers in net before playing against pacers Lasith Malinga, Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando in Sri Lanka," said the youngest Test centurion.
