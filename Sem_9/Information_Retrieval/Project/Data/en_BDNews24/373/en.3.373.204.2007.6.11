 JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Beatings and other abuses inflicted on lawyers are damaging the legal system in Zimbabwe, a group of international judges said on Monday. Following a fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe last week, the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) said it was "shocked" by the extent of government abuse of the legal and judicial system. "We were shocked. The beatings of lawyers, beatings of people and in particular the refusal by the police to carry out court orders, was shocking," head of mission Justice Claire L'Heureux-Dube said. The ICJ was in Zimbabwe on a five-day mission to investigate recent arrests, detention and beatings of lawyers, which it said were "clearly an escalation in the harassment and intimidation of the legal profession."

Police detained the lawyers after they attempted to take part in a march in Harare. They have since been released. International human rights bodies and Western governments have criticised Mugabe's government for Zimbabwe's worsening human rights record, characterised by repression and beatings of opposition members and journalists. Earlier on Monday, pressure group Women of Zimbabwe Arise said more than 100 of its members were arrested in the southern town of Filabusi while gathering to launch a "People's Charter" on social justice in Zimbabwe. The ICJ urged the Zimbabwe government to be tougher on police, whose actions it said "required swift action from the judiciary and the government itself". Mugabe's government accuses the MDC of mounting a "terror" campaign of pipe bombings and other attacks aimed at destabilising him, a charge the opposition deni
