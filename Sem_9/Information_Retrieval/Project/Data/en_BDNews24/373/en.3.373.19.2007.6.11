<TITLE> Hard work begins for Belgium's likely premier </TITLE>

 BRUSSELS, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - With the electoral battle won, Belgium's likely Christian Democratic next prime minister faces hard work to form a stable government, particularly if he wants to push through the reform of the state he has promised. Outgoing Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt was due to tender his resignation to King Albert on Monday after his Flemish liberals and their socialist coalition partners were drubbed in Sunday's general election. Flanders premier Yves Leterme's Christian Democrats emerged as clear victors, securing 30 seats in the 150-seat lower house with almost 30 percent in the Dutch-speaking northern region, where 60 percent of Belgians live. However, no party ever wins a Belgian election outright. Consensus is key and the Flemish Christian Democrats, along with their francophone sister party, must forge a sustainable coalition with at least one other group. "His victory was bigger than expected, but now the problems start," said Carl Devos, politics professor at Ghent University. While many new leaders enact their key reforms in their first 100 days in office, Leterme is likely to spend at least 100 days just building a coalition. "It will be a long and difficult process," said Devos. The Christian Democrats could build a simple centre-right majority by allying with Verhofstadt's Flemish liberals and their francophone sister party, the Reform Movement (MR) of outgoing Finance Minister Didiers Reynders. Reynders was in celebratory mood after his free-marketeering party displaced the Socialists as the biggest force in French-speaking Wallonia. The Flemish liberals, who dropped to third place in the region, were more downbeat, Verhofstadt conceding defeat and accepting responsibility for the result. The liberals' losses may complicate Leterme's bid to woo them. A number in the party sensed they had been in power too long and will need good reasons to stay in government. "He (Leterme) must now try to negotiate with people who suffered heavy trauma on Sunday night," concluded the Gazet van Antwerpen newspaper. Yet Leterme, 46, won partly due to a pledge to devolve more powers from the federal level to the regions, notably Flanders. Economic and foreign policy, including strong support for European integration, are likely to be little changed, but there will be rows over further devolution opposed by French-speakers. Leterme wants the regions, already responsible for public works, transport, agriculture and the environment, to have more control over labour policy, justice and health. Such constitutional change requires a two-thirds majority. That may mean the even harder task of bringing on board the defeated Socialists, punished for local corruption scandals. The scale of their losses prompted daily Le Soir to call Sunday's result "The Socialists' Waterloo." Leterme may begin talking to other party chiefs on Monday. The king will also be seeking advice before appointing a senior politician as "informateur", to sound out potential coalitions. "The winner faces a really tall order. There were Flemish flags in abundance at the celebrations, but now there's the practical challenge of carrying out the far-reaching reform of the state," wrote left-wing De Morgen in an editorial. "On the other side of the linguistic divide.. they will find little enthusiasm for such a project.
