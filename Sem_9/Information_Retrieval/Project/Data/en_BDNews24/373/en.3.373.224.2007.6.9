<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina Saturday questioned the legality of the budget proposed for 2007-2008 fiscal on the ground that it was not presented in an elected parliament. She argued that only elected people's representatives can levy tax on the public, but the interim government that fashioned the annual outlay does not have people's mandate. "Let's now see how the caretaker government gets to see its proposed budget validated and by who," said Hasina to waiting reporters at Shikdar Medical College in Gulshan after visiting her ailing aunt Asia Khatun. People's representatives will have to sit in the national parliament and vet the proposed budget., the Awami League chief said. Otherwise, the crucial instrument will just continue to be labelled as 'illegal' since it was not presented in the lawmakers' assembly. She cited Article 93 of the constitution to point out that the president has the authority to promulgate an ordinance for a brief period, but that too has to be vetted the parliament. She said there is nothing unique about the proposed budget and there is no provision to spiral back the sprinting prices of essential commodities and generate jobs. The AL chief said the budget has not considered any measure for checking the soaring inflation, nor does it cater to meeting the unmet needs of the grassroots. bdnews24.c
