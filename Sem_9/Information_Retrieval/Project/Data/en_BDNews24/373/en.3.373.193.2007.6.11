 PARIS, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's battered Socialists, facing a crushing election loss in parliament, called on voters on Monday to prevent a landslide victory for President Nicolas Sarkozy in next week's second round ballot. Following Sarkozy's victory in the May presidential vote, his centre-right bloc won overwhelming backing in Sunday's legislative ballot and are on course to win virtually unchallenged control of parliament. Pollsters predict that Sarkozy's UMP party will take more than 400 seats in the 577-seat National Assembly after the June 17 second round -- the first time since 1978 that a ruling French party has secured re-election. "The success of the UMP is without precedent in the Fifth Republic," said the conservative daily Le Figaro, whose front page headline on Monday ran: "The Sarkozy Dynamic." The scale of the centre-right victory prompted Socialists to claim that Sarkozy had won too much power and party leaders called on supporters to turn out in strength on Sunday. "For the second round, I call on all voters of the left -- and even voters who are not of the left but who are republican -- to back the candidates, especially Socialists," party leader Francois Hollande told France Inter radio. But Prime Minister Francois Fillon said the result confirmed voters' desires to "set a course for France" and he pledged to continue with planned reforms. Sarkozy's government has already begun work on an ambitious programme of changes to tax and labour laws designed to give new impetus to the euro zone's second largest economy and the result was welcomed by financial markets. "Overall, I take the outcome of the first round as favourable for the process of reforms and the potential growth of the French economy," wrote Morgan Stanley economist Eric Chaney in a research note. Sarkozy had told voters before the election that he needed a strong majority in parliament to back his plans to restore France's economic dynamism. The government has already unveiled plans to cut tax on overtime and mortgage payments and give more independence to universities. He has also begun talks with unions aimed at guaranteeing a minimum service during public transport strikes. With the parliamentary opposition likely to be weak, some commentators said that Sarkozy's biggest trouble could come from other quarters. "When parliament is silent, the street does not take long to speak," wrote an editorialist in business daily La Tribune. Memories remain vivid of the violent protests that greeted the last government's attempt to introduce a new youth jobs law, passed without reference to parliament in 2005. In a sign that he wanted to avoid immediate conflict with the unions ahead of his main reformist drive, Sarkozy on Monday agreed to their demands that he overturn a previous government initiative that made teachers work longer hou
