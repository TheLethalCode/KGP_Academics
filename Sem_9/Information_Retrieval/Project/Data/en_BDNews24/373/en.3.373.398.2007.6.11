 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks clawed back some of last week's hefty losses on Monday as investors expressed confidence in equity valuations and economic growth prospects despite the surge in bond yields, which held near multi-year highs. Currency carry trades were in focus, with the New Zealand dollar weak after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand intervened to topple it from levels described by Governor Alan Bollard as "exceptional and unjustified in terms of economic fundamentals". However, low-yielding funding currencies such as the yen were little moved as markets saw limited falls in risk appetite. "Maybe the market is not convinced that the whole carry trade story is unravelling," said Martin McMahon, FX strategist at Credit Suisse in Zurich. "It will take more than one temporary one-off intervention for investors to realise that carry trades are no longer a one way street." U.S. stock futures were pointing to a largely steady start on Wall Street and markets in both Europe and Asia were higher. The FTSEurofirst 300 was up 0.6 percent at 1,577.5 points, ending a five-day losing streak last week when it fell 3.6 percent. Long-term investors said the jump in government bond yields in recent weeks had diminished the valuation appeal of equities versus bonds but it was not yet clear that critical levels had been reached. "Earnings are holding up well and are continuing to be revised higher ... and given the way the cycle seems to be playing out with longer lead times for everything, it would probably be precipitous to undertake a wholesale shift from equities to bonds just yet," said Frances Hudson, a strategist at Standard Life Investments. BONDS STEADY Bond yields remained at elevated levels on Monday, with U.S. benchmark 10-year notes yielding around 5.12 percent and their euro zone equivalents about 4.55 percent. Lehman Brothers' Aggregate Global Treasury index showed the yield on a global basket of government bonds hit 3.92 percent as of the close on Friday, a level not seen since 2001. "For now, the sell-off has abated. People are taking a shot at (getting) long," said Michael Pond, Treasury strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. However, investors were reluctant to take big positions before key inflation data on both sides of the Atlantic due later this week. Secondary currencies took centre stage in the foreign exchange market, with the New Zealand dollar down more than 1.5 percent against the dollar after the RBNZ selling aimed at pulling the kiwi from a 22-year high. It was the first time the central bank had intervened in the market since the currency was floated in 1985. Elsewhere on currency markets, the euro was steady around $1.3355, not far from a two-month low around $1.3320 touched on Friday. The dollar was flat against the yen at 121.65 yen. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei stocks average rose 0.31 percent or 55.39 points to 17,834.48 and the broader TOPIX index rose 0.28 percent to 1,761.15. Data showed Japan's economy again outperformed both the United States and the euro zone in the first quarter, reinforcing expectations that the Bank of Japan will raise interest rates in August. Oil prices edged towards $69 a barrel, buoyed by news that leading exporter Saudi Arabia will keep OPEC supply curbs in place until July. London Brent crude rose 21 cents to $68.81, having shed $2 at the end of last week amid a slump in commodity prices on fears of slower economic grow
