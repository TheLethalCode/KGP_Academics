 CHENNAI, India, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahendra Dhoni and skipper Mahela Jayawardene struck superb hundreds and shared a record partnership to power Asia XI to 331 for eight against Africa XI in the third and final Afro-Asia Cup game on Sunday. The pair added 218 runs from 178 balls, the highest one-day partnership for the sixth wicket, bettering the previous mark of 165 jointly held by Australia's Brad Haddin and Mike Hussey and New Zealand batsmen Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum. Dhoni hammered 139 not out from 97 balls with 15 fours and five sixes in a late flurry with Jayawardene (107) after Kenya paceman Peter Ongondo grabbed three quick wickets to reduce the innings to 72 for five. Ongondo returned three for 35 from his 10 overs and South African paceman Morne Morkel took three for 50 but the rest of bowlers faded away as the two batsmen imposed themselves in sapping humidity. Jayawardene's 106-ball knock included nine fours and two sixes. Asia XI hold an unassailable 2-0 lead in the serie
