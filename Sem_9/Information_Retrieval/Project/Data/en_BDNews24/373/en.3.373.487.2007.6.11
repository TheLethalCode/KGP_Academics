 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) At least 85 people were killed and a hundred plus were injured after landslides triggered by heavy rains buried hillside homes in the port city of Chittagong Monday, police and witnesses said. The dead include 10 of two families while 11 lost their lives when walls of their homes caved in. A man was electrocuted. The injured were admitted to Chittagong Combined Military Hospital and Chittagong Medical College Hospital. Chittagong CMH has been kept open to the injured for emergency treatment. The Chittagong office of bdnews24.com reports: As many as 19 people died in Hathazari, 10 of two families in Chittagong University and Bayezid Bostami areas, seven in Sekandarpara in Bhatiari, two in Moti Jharna area and three in Dhebarpar area. Chittagong divisional commissioner Mokhlesur Rahman confirmed the deaths of 85. He said the army, police and local people ratcheted up rescue efforts. The rescuers issued alerts by loudspeaker, asking local people to move to safety from under the hills. "Traffic in the city came to a halt," Moinuddin Ahmed, who works for a private organisation, told bdnews24.com from Chittagong by phone. Ahmed went out in his car but got stuck in heavy traffic. Later he drove back home. Some bodies were still trapped under tonnes of rubble and police and volunteers were struggling to retrieve them. Most shops were closed and residents stranded by waist-high water in some areas. Port secretary Syed Farhad Uddin said loading and unloading of cargo at the port ground to a halt at 7.30am. However, the movement of ships and loading and unloading of goods returned to normal at 11.30am. Shah Amanat Airport manager Sajjad Hossain said seven flights from Dhaka and Kolkata were scheduled to land but none of them could touch down because of bad weather. Weather officials said heavy rains at the onset of the annual monsoon season have paralysed much of Bangladesh since Sunday morning, and raised fears of flash floods in low-lying areas. Weather forecaster Sanaul Haque told bdnews24.com that Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and Mongla seaports would continue to hoist local cautionary signal No. 3, as the areas were under the influence of southwestern monsoons. Southern river ports have to hoist cautionary signal No. 2, he said. Dhaka residents have not yet been able to tide over the acute sufferings caused by the rains starting early Sunday. Mirpur, Kazipara, Sheorapara, Taltala, Shantinagar, Malibagh and Paltan are still under knee-deep water. Dhaka skies remain overcast with dense clouds. The low-lying regions throughout the country still remain inundated. The weathermen said all districts should expect medium-to-heavy rains, accompanied by gusty to squally winds. The bdnews24.com Moulvibazar correspondent adds: Flash floods have gripped Kamalganj upazila in Moulvibazar due to heavy rains and runoffs from the upstream. The protection embankment on the Dhalai River broke down Monday. The floodwaters have reached Bhanugachh bazaar in Kamalganj Municipality through the breaches on the embankment. The roads inside the bazaar have gone underwater. The businessmen have been moving their goods to safe areas. The floods cut off a swathe of 10 low-lying villages in Adampur and Islampur of the upazila. bdnews24.com/al
