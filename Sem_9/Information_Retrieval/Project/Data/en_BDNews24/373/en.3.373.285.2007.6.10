 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) - The league committee shifted Sunday's scheduled B. League match between Arambagh KS and Farashganj SC at the Bangabandhu National Stadium to Tuesday due to inclement weather. "The match between Arambagh and Farashganj in Dhaka has been deferred by two days as heavy rains of Saturday night and Sunday made the ground unplayable. The ground will be prepared Monday and the league resumes Tuesday," said B. League manager Abu Nayeen Shohag. Other matches of the second leg will be shifted following the deferment of Sunday's match.
