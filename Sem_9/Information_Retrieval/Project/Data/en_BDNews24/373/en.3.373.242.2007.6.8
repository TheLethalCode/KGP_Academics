<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal moved closer to a rare French Open hat-trick by overpowering Serbia's Novak Djokovic 7-5 6-4 6-2 on Friday to set up a much-anticipated final against arch-rival Roger Federer. World number two Nadal, trying to become the first man with three successive Roland Garros titles since Bjorn Borg in 1980, wore down sixth seed Djokovic with relentless groundstrokes to extend his 100 percent record on the Paris clay. The 20-year-old Djokovic tried his best but was not tough enough and failed to emulate compatriot Ana Ivanovic, who will face Justine Henin in the women's final here on Saturday. In Sunday's men's title match, the 21-year-old Spaniard with the bulging biceps will take on world number one Federer, who lost to Nadal in last year's final and reached this year's with a tight 7-5 7-6 7-6 win over Russia's Nikolay Davydenko
