 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lloyd's of London said on Monday it had reached a settlement with UK reinsurance broker Benfield Plc and US broker Aon Corp over their role in a disputed insurance policy. The move ends the potential of a bitter 325 million pound ($642.3 million) legal battle between the world's oldest insurance market and the two brokers, which bring business accounting for about 16 percent of Lloyd's premiums. The net impact of the agreement on Benfield will be about 8 million pounds ($15.8 million), Benfield said. Aon and Benfield had been responsible for arranging insurers for a policy that Lloyd's bought in 1999 to help protect its central fund, which pays claims made against insurer members of the market that go bust. Lloyd's was left out of pocket when the policy's six insurers, including Swiss Re and Hannover Re, refused to pay up to 500 million pounds in claims that Lloyd's presented. It sued the brokers in February 2006. Lloyd's declined to say how much it had received from Aon, adding that the terms of the overall settlement will remain confidential. Aon could not be immediately reached for comment. Benfield shares were down 0.7 percent at 311 pence at 0751 GMT. Lloyd's settled with the insurers of the policy in March 2005, receiving a 152 million payment, but its 2004 profits took a 276 million pound hit after it wrote off the extra payments it had anticipated receiving under the policy
