 SOFIA, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hundreds of Bulgarians chanted anti-war slogans on Saturday and protested against the establishment of US military bases in their country a day before a visit by US President George W Bush. Some 200 protesters ranging from far-right nationalists to anti-fascist activists marched through downtown Sofia carrying banners saying "No to the Bases, Occupiers Out", "Stop Bush" and "Hands off Iraq". NATO newcomer Bulgaria, a staunch ally of the United States, has troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Later this year, some 2,500 US military will deploy at two Bulgarian airfields -- Graf Ignatievo and Bezmer -- and the Novo Selo firing range in southern Bulgaria. Bush arrives late on Sunday and meets Bulgarian officials the next day in Sofia, his final stop in an eight-day trip to Europe. The protesters demanded that Bulgaria cancel its agreement to host American bases, which they feared could be used for attacks against third countries. "We are protesting against the silent US occupation," said 39-year-old nationalist Vasil Ognianov. "Bush will drag us into wars against the Middle East and Russia." Bases in Bulgaria and Romania are part of a US plan to shift its military focus from Cold War era bases in Western Europe and Asia to smaller facilities closer to the Middle East. Bulgaria said it would discuss with Bush ways to reassure Moscow that neither these bases nor the anti-missile shield that is due to be sited in Poland and the Czech Republic were directed against Russia. Bulgaria will not be covered by the shield, intended to avert missile attacks from states such as Iran, but officials say it plans to ask NATO to include it in the defensive umbrella. Bulgaria will also ask Bush for help in securing the release of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya after being found guilty of deliberately infecting hundreds of Bulgarian children with the HIV virus
