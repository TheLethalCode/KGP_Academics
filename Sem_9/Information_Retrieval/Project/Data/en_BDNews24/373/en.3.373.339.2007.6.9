<TITLE> Ashraful aware his bat to hold sway over Tigers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Mohammad Ashraful is aware he must do well to lift the team's performance during their five-week tour of Sri Lanka. "When I will go out in the middle, my focus will be on batting rather than captaincy. I know very well that if I bat confidently, the team will benefit," said Ashraful during his first official press conference since becoming captain. The Tigers will play a three match Test series and a further three one-day games. "It is going to be just another tour for me. I do not feel that the pressure of my new captaincy will interrupt my natural game," said Ashraful. The 22-year old captain said they greatly gained immensely from Saturday's nets session, especially in terms of batting on varied surfaces. "It was a good net session where we batted on both fast and bouncy wickets as well as slow pitches." "We will start our tour with the Test series in Sri Lanka. I think this will really help us as we have been practising regularly with red balls. "Besides, we just finished the Test series against India." said the middle-order batsman. Ashraful emphasised improvement in Test cricket rather than one-day matches and believed the improvement is necessary in individual performances. "We have to improve all aspects of our game, rather than concentrating only on the fielding. Definitely, we will try harder to raise our fielding and I am confident that we will do better this time than we did in previous tours of Sri Lanka." Asked about his maiden Test century in Sri Lanka at the age of 17, Ashraful said, "That was a special knock. The cricketing world still knows me because of that century. So I am delighted to get the opportunity to start my captaincy career back in Sri Lanka." "They (Sri Lanka) are very strong mentally, physically and technically with a quality batting line-up and have a variety of bowling options. "But I believe we are not very far behind them and we are really positive about putting on a good show. "However, we understand this will be a tough tour." Said the youngest centurion in Test cricket. bdnew
