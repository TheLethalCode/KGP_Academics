<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - The executive chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) has said Monday that Global Oil and Energy's $2.9 billion investment proposal is better than that of another Indian giant, Tata. After Tata Group's $3 billion investment offer, it will be the second largest investment proposal from a UK-based Indian giant. Global Oil and Energy's proposal is also a multi-sector investment offer like Tata's. "But, Tata's proposal is a complex one," BoI executive chairman Nazrul Islam told reporters after signing a memorandum of understanding with Global Oil and Energy Ltd, UK, an offshore investment arm of India's Ispat Industries, owned by Mittal brothers. "Tata's investment proposal has a lot of complexities that Mittal's does not," he said. But Vinod Mittal, managing director of Global Oil and Energy Ltd, said: "I don't want to compare us with Tata...we've our own style." Nazrul Islam and Vinod Mittal have signed the MoU on behalf of their respective sides. FBCCI and DCCI presidents Mir Nasir Hossain and Hossain Khaled respectively were present at the signing ceremony. "We think the current situation in Bangladesh is investment-friendly and we want to go on with our investment plans worth US$ 2.9 billion," Vinod Mittal said. He said he has got encouraging response from the head of the Bangladesh government, Fakhruddin Ahmed. "We'll start a feasibility study by three months," Mittal pointed out. He said the initial focus of the proposal would be in natural gas exploration and coal mining. "Later, we'll invest in power plants, petrochemicals, LNG production and infrastructure," he said. Earlier, in 2004 Tata Group signed a MoU to invest $3 billion in power, steel and fertiliser plants in Bangladesh. But the offer has run into rough weather over different issues, especially with the pricing of gas. The Mittal Group is one of the largest business companies in India and the UK with $28 billion investments in 27 countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and America. Its chairman, ML Mittal, is the fifth richest man in the UK and the first in Asia. Vinod Mittal, the youngest son of the visionary international steel technocrat Mohan Lal (ML) Mittal, took the reins of the family-run business at the very early age of 20. An active member of the World Economic Forum, Vinod Mittal was voted as the 48th most powerful CEO in Corporate India, by a poll and analysis conducted on behalf of 'The Economic Times', the world's second largest circulated business daily after the Wall Street Journal last year. bd
