 SOFIA, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush said on Monday it was a high priority for the United States to secure the release of five Bulgarian nurses sentenced to death in Libya for infecting children with HIV. "We strongly support the release of the Bulgarian nurses in Libya," Bush told a news conference in Sofia where he was wrapping up his eight-day European tour. "It's a high priority for our country," Bush said. "Our hearts also go out to the children that have been infected by HIV and AIDS." The five nurses and a Palestinian doctor were convicted in December of deliberately infecting 426 children with HIV in a highly politicised trial that has hampered attempts by OPEC member Libya to restore full relations in the west. On Sunday Saif al-Islam, a prominent son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi indicated that efforts to free the six foreign medics -- jailed since 1999 -- may be nearing conclusion after a "positive" initiative from European Union officials. The medics say they are innocent and were tortured to make them confess. Bush's European trip was marked by underlying tensions between the United States and Russia over missile defence, Kosovo, and democracy. Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Group of Eight summit in Germany last week turned the tables on Bush by proposing the United States join in a Russian-controlled missile defence system. Putin has vehemently opposed US plans to base missile interceptors in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. Bush said on Monday that it would be "beneficial" if Russia and the United States shared information on the missile defence project in a way to create a system that would "protect us all". Bush, while continuing to call Putin a "friend," in a speech in Prague criticized Russia for backsliding on democracy. He also was forceful about the need for UN Security Council action to support supervised independence for Kosovo, which Russia opposes. Bush and Putin will meet next month in Bush's family retreat in Kennebunkport, Maine
