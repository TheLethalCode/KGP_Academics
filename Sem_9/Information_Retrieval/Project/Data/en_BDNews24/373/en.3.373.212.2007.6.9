 GAZA, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip infiltrated into Israel at a key border crossing on Saturday, igniting a fire fight in which one gunman was killed. The Israeli army said four to five militants entered Israeli territory near the Kissufim crossing in the first major cross-border raid since Palestinian militants captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit near the Gaza border a year ago. Saturday's daytime attack was carried out jointly by Islamic Jihad and a unit of al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, an offshoot of President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction. Militants riding in a jeep crashed into the crossing gate at Kissufim as mortar bombs and rocket-propelled grenades provided cover, said Abu Ali, a spokesman for the al-Aqsa unit. Islamic Jihad said most of the gunmen withdrew back into Gaza but one remained in Israeli territory, where he came under fire from Israeli ground forces and air craft. The army said the jeep used in the attack was emblazoned with the letters "TV" for television. Abu Ali said it was marked with the UN insignia. Gunfire and explosions could be heard during the nearly three-hour-long battle as unmanned aircraft and helicopters hovered overhead. "The attack comes as a natural reaction to the Zionist crimes and assassinations against fighters in Gaza and the West Bank," Abu Ali said. Israel stepped up its military operations in Gaza last month in response to a surge in cross-border rocket attacks against Israeli towns. Saturday's attack was the biggest since Palestinian militants tunnelled under the Gaza border and kidnapped Shalit on June 25, 2006. Shalit remains in captivity. Israeli defence officials had expected militants to try to capture more soldiers. Islamic Jihad identified the gunman who was killed as a 21-year-old from Gaza City. An Israeli army spokesman denied Islamic Jihad assertions that militants had killed one soldier during the operation, and said there were no reports of injuries on the Israeli side. The attack on the Kissufim crossing came after Israeli ground forces entered southern Gaza and exchanged fire with Palestinian militants near the town of Rafah. At least one Hamas gunman was injured. Local residents said the troops, backed by tanks, conducted house to house searches and questioned men between the ages of 18 and 40. An Israeli army spokesman said several local residents were taken into custody
