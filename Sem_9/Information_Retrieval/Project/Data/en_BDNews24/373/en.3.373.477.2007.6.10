 BRUSSELS, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The trade chiefs of the European Union and China meet on Tuesday to thrash out problems clouding their economic ties amid growing calls in Europe for more protection against the Asian export powerhouse. EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson, his eye on Europe's yawning trade deficit within China, will complain to Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai that Beijing is doing too little on intellectual property theft and limits on foreign investment. Mandelson will also raise concerns about China's fast-growing steel exports and the risk of a surge in textiles when quotas expire on Dec. 31, EU officials said. "We are short on results especially on intellectual property rights and market access and we need very concrete moves from the Chinese in both of those areas," one of the officials said. Mandelson has taken a softer approach to China than the United States which has taken more action at the World Trade Organisation against China. Punishing measures are also being considered in Congress. "Nothing has changed in (Mandelson's) conviction that the best way to get results is through dialogue. But to be credible, the dialogue must deliver results," the EU official said. Mandelson last month worried some EU countries by saying China was making some progress towards gaining the bloc's market economy status, which if granted would make it easier for Chinese exporters to fight off EU anti-dumping investigations. However, such a move is not expected any time soon. "The EU gives attention to dialogue and cooperation and we hope the EU will continue to do that," a Chinese diplomat said. But with the bloc's trade deficit with China having surged past 100 billion euros last year, Mandelson is under pressure to land major new opportunities for European business in China too. New French President Nicolas Sarkozy has said he will not allow the EU to be a "Trojan Horse for all the threats of a changing world" and Italy wants to make it easier for European companies to request anti-dumping duties. EU exports to China rose 21 percent in 2006 but it still exports less to China than to Switzerland. Chinese trade and investment barriers cost EU businesses 20 billion euros a year in lost opportunities, the European Commission says. The EU and China launched partnership talks in January, but the chances of quick progress on trade are limited by the approach of the five-yearly Communist Party Congress in the autumn with its jostling for top-level appointments. Experts say Brussels struggles to compete for China's attention with the United States with its geopolitical as well as commercial might. "A couple of years ago, China viewed the EU as a strategic actor in embryo and was willing to develop the economic aspects of the relationship with a view to cementing a broader political partnership," said Andrew Small, a China specialist at the German Marshall Fund thinktank. "Now, although they're concerned to maintain good access to European markets and technology, there are doubts about whether the relationship is going to have any broader strategic value." EU officials have suggested upgrading their contacts with China, possibly to mirror the US China Strategic Economic Dialogue which brings together US Treasury Secretaryenry Paulson and top Chinese officials for twice-yearly meetin
