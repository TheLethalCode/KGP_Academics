<TITLE> World Bank needs stronger Africa partnership: Zoellick </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PRETORIA, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The World Bank should strengthen its partnership with Africa and be sensitive to country-specific challenges in dealing with the continent, its presidential nominee Robert Zoellick said on Saturday. Zoellick met South Africa's Finance Minister Trevor Manuel on the last leg of an African tour as he garners support for his nomination by US President George W Bush to succeed Paul Wolfowitz as World Bank President. "I hope that the World Bank can develop a stronger partnership with the African countries to assist and support them in their strategies for development and growth," Zoellick told journalists after meeting Manuel. "In doing so, one needs to be sensitive to the specific challenges in each case while also looking across national borders to deal with some of the regional intergration issues." Manuel has been critical of how the World Bank and International Monetary Fund operate in developing countries, and he recently warned that such multilateral institutions were losing legitimacy because of their governance structures. Zoellick said during his meeting with Manuel and before that with officials from Ghana, Ethiopia and other African countries, there was "a sense of need to try and speed up time for action" by the institution. "Not surprisingly if you are dealing with governments, particularly those that have parliaments or elections, people want to try to see results so if you take 18 months or three years to approve a project loan it's a long time for people," he said. Africa's political and economic leaders also stressed the need for the continent's representation in international financial institutions and urged more support for regional economic integration efforts, he said. Zoellick, a former US Trade Representative is the only candidate so far to take over from Wolfowitz, who resigned last month amid an ethics scandal involving his girlfriend. His bid is unlikely to be contested despite a June 15 deadline for nominations and a push by some developing nations to open the post to non-Americans. Zoellick spoke a day after the Group of Eight ended a summit in Germany with a $60 billion pledge to fight AIDS and other diseases ravaging Africa. Development campaigners complained little fresh cash for the poor was offered. "I think it's very important that countries around the globe, particularly the G8, keep Africa very much in the forefront of their priorities," Zoellick said. He was due to leave South Africa later on Saturday after meeting representatives of some non-governmental organisations
