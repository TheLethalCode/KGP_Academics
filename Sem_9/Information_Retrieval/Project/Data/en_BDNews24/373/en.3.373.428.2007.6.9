 MANCHESTER, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spinner Monty Panesar said England turned the third test against West Indies on its head on Friday after agreeing at tea to be more aggressive. West Indies, after bowling the hosts out for 370 before lunch, slumped from 216 for four to 229 all out after tea. England then reached the close on 34 for one in their second innings. "They batted positively and during tea we as a group sat down and felt that after tea we should show more aggression and more intent as a bowling unit and as a team," left-armer Panesar told reporters after taking four for 50. "(Bowling coach) Allan Donald and (head coach) Peter Moores were very much saying that. It was then good to see that after tea we did that and it had an impact on their innings." The manner of the capitulation was a blow to West Indies after they had shown an improvement following their record defeat in the second test at Headingley. Their Australian coach David Moore said morale was not dented but added that they needed to improve their shot selection. "It was very disappointing," Moore said. "I thought that (Runako) Morton, Chanderpaul and (Devon) Smith had worked pretty hard and (Dwayne) Bravo chipped in to get us into a good position. "I thought there were some poor shots played. It led to a situation where we went from being in a very good position at tea to a very poor position. "We wanted to give our bowlers a rest but we didn't bat well enough to do that." England are 1-0 up in the four-match series
