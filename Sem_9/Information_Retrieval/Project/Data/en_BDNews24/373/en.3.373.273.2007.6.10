 NEW YORK, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Friday it is releasing software that can predict the spread of infectious diseases among countries. The software has been donated to scientists and public health officials to better plan responses to health crises like bird flu. Software developers can customize the program -- called the Spatiotemporal Epidemiological Modeler or STEM -- to suit particular diseases and populations. STEM is part of a global pandemic initiative formed by IBM and more than 20 public health institutions worldwide, IBM said.
