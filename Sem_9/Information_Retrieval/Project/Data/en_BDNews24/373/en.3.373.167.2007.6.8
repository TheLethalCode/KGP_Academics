 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  Struggling Rahmatganj MFS stunned title contenders Sheikh Russel KC 1-0 in the second-leg encounter of B. League at the Bangabandhu National Stadium Friday. Ashraful Awal Apu fired the ball in fiercely from the edge of the box after being set up by Nigerian striker Nche Franchis from the left in the 25th minute. Rahmatganj, boosted by five new players including two Nigerian recruits in the second leg matches, raised their point tally to eight from 12 matches. But they are still at the bottom of the 11-team first-ever professional football league. Sheikh Russel, who could have taken the pole position with a win, are second with 20 points, two points behind league leaders Dhaka Abahani Limited, Muktijoddha Sangsad and Mohammedan Sporting Club. On the rain-soaked field, both teams struggled to find their rhythm. However, Sheikh Russel enjoyed a superior ball possession throughout the game and missed half a dozen easy chances that cost them dear. Rahmatganj keeper Anwarul Islam denied Sheikh Russel's Moroccan striker Touati Youness and midfielder Ighir Mohammad several times, much to the frustration of the new football powerhouse. "You never turn around after squandering three to four scoring chances in the beginning and then allow the opponents to score," said Russel coach Wazed Gazi. "It was just bad luck," the veteran coach said. "Their goalie had a tremendous game to foil a lot of our chances." The former national footballer believes the loss has pushed them back in the title race. Rahmatganj manager Riazuddin praised his boys for sticking to the game plan. "We had planned to catch them on the break and the boys came out with the result. I am happy with the way we played today," he said. "The boys should have widened the margin as they got two good opportunities in the second half. But they could not covert them with only the goalkeeper to beat," Riazuddin said.
