<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) Adviser MA Matin Monday said Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina cannot shrug off their roles in the crores of taka scams, disclosed by detained politicians during interrogations. The chairman of the national coordination committee on curbing serious crimes told reporters: "I don't think the former heads of the government would be able to deny the burden of corruption cases." The caretaker government is not surprised or daunted by the colossal corruption cases, Matin said. The adviser said the government waited for many more crime stories to unfold. Asked how the government is handling the cases, he said the CG is conducting all-out investigations and verifications and examining the charges with professionals before taking appropriate legal measures against the suspects. He said the taskforces are busy collecting and collating information about the corrupt bigwigs. According to reports run by different newspapers, detained Awami League and BNP leaders told many stories on the suspected corruption links of Khaleda and Hasina. The reports were based on the interrogations of the politicians, especially Awami League general secretary Abdul Jalil, joint general secretary Obaidul Quader and BNP leader Lutfozzaman Babar, who served the BNP government as state minister for home. Joint forces arrested Jalil and Babar on May 28 and Obaidul Quader on March 9. bdnews24.co
