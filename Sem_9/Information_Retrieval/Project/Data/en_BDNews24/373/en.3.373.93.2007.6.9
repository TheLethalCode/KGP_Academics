<TITLE> Syria should stop disrupting Lebanon: Bush </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush said on Saturday Syria should stop disrupting the Lebanese government of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora. "It's very important that foreign influences like that of Syria not be continually disrupting the Siniora government," Bush said during a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi in Rome. Syria has been accused in the the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri in 2005. Damascus has denied any involvement and Lebanon's pro-Syrian opposition is opposed to a tribunal to try the killers, which was set up by a UN vote. "Now we just have to make sure the Siniora government survives. One of the best ways to do so is to insist that we proceed forward with the Hariri trial, to make sure that there are consequences for behaviour that may affect the stability of a democracy," said Bush. He added: "I don't want to prejudge the outcome of the trial but I do think it's an important measure for all of us to see the truth in that part of the world," he said
