 TOKYO, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A beaming Riyo Mori, Japan's first Miss Universe in nearly 50 years, savored her hard-earned triumph Monday and said she was sure she would win. With a confidence unusual in a nation where women have been encouraged to be demure, Mori -- wearing a black halter dress and her tiara -- told reporters she was sure victory would be hers because she had put so much effort into preparing for the event.

What comes after the crown? Mori said she wanted to open an international dance school in Tokyo. But for now, she's lapping up the attention that comes with her title.
