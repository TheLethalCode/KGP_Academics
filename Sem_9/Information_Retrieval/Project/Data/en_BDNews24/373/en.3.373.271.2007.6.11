 TEHRAN, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who wants more aid from the United States, called on Sunday for a new world order to replace "capitalism and imperialism", at the start of a trip to arch US foe Iran. His comments echoed some remarks by his Iranian counterpart who often attacks "imperialist" and "arrogant powers", although Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is a more vehement critic of Washington. Ortega has raised eyebrows in Washington, which broke diplomatic relations with Iran in 1980, for forging ties with the Islamic Republic. But the Nicaraguan president said he did not need permission about who to befriend. "We have chosen our friends by our own will and we haven't got permission from anyone," Ortega said shortly after arriving in Tehran, the official IRNA news agency reported. "In negotiation with America we have explained our personal and political positions towards imperialism ... Imperialism and capitalism should be removed and we should create a peaceful and friendly world," Ortega added. Ortega, a Cold War-era enemy of Washington, had earlier said he would travel to Iran on a jet loaned to him by Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi, a former US foe who has been developing better ties with Washington. The Nicaraguan president, like Ahmadinejad, is also an ally of US antagonist President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. The Iran trip will focus in part on getting Iranian investment in Nicaraguan factories that build tractors and other agricultural equipment, Ortega said before the visit. Business links were a topic when Ahmadinejad visited Managua in January. "In this trip (by Ortega), the agreements between the two countries which were agreed in Nicaragua will be finalised and put into effect," Ahmadinejad said, IRNA reported. State media also quoted Ahmadinejad saying Nicaragua had been wounded by "the lashes of colonialism". Ortega, a former Marxist guerrilla who fought US-backed Contra rebels during his 1980s government, later on Sunday met Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "Today America is the most hated government in the world," Khamenei told him, the ISNA news agency reported. Ortega said according to the same news agency: "Today America is isolated among other nations.
