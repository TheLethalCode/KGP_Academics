 CHENNAI, India, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahendra Dhoni and skipper Mahela Jayawardene struck superb hundreds and shared a record partnership to spur Asia XI to a 13-run win over Africa XI on Sunday, sweeping the Afro-Asia Cup series 3-0. Asia XI amassed 331 for eight after electing to bat first for the third time in the series, leaving Africa XI to attempt another spirited but futile chase before finishing on 318-7. India wicketkeeper Dhoni and Jayawardene added 218 runs from 178 balls, the highest one-day sixth wicket partnership. The previous mark of 165 was jointly held by Australia's Brad Haddin and Mike Hussey and New Zealand duo Craig McMillan and Brendon McCullum. Dhoni hammered 139 not out from 97 balls with 15 fours and five sixes in a late flurry with Jayawardene (107) after Kenya paceman Peter Ongondo's three quick wickets had made it 72-5. Sri Lanka skipper Jayawardene hit nine fours and two sixes to be declared player-of-the-series. Ongondo took three for 35 and South African paceman Morne Morkel three for 50 before the Asia pair imposed themselves. Bangladesh left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique then grabbed the first three wickets, including two off successive deliveries, to end a 119-run opening partnership between AB de Villiers (70) and Vusi Sibanda (45). He also bowled Africa skipper Justin Kemp for 86 to end his 122-run sixth wicket stand with Shaun Pollock (58 not out) and dash hopes for a consolation win. Rafique took four for 65 and Indian off spinner Harbhajan Singh 3-48, Dhoni making three stumping
