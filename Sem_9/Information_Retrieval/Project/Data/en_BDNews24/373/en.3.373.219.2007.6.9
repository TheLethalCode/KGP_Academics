<TEXT>
 ABUJA, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nigeria's former chief of police will face questioning over his alleged role in the attempted theft of 21 million naira ($164,680) in cash from the force headquarters, the police spokesman said on Saturday. Haz Iwendi said two policemen were caught carrying the cash out of the building in the middle of Thursday night. They said they were acting on instructions from a high-ranking policeman, commissioner in charge of budget John Obaniyi. All three men implicated are now under arrest, Iwendi said. During questioning, Obaniyi said former Inspector General Sunday Ehindero, who retired a week ago, had authorised the withdrawal. "We need to know if there's any truth in that. He (Ehindero) will definitely have to offer a statement," said Iwendi. "This was money that belonged to the force and it is clear that it was not being withdrawn in the proper way," he said. Ehindero was sent into retirement by new President Umaru Yar'Adua in one of the first decisions he took after his inauguration on May 29. Ehindero's replacement, Mike Okiro, has vowed to crack down on corruption in the police. Nigeria is considered one of the world's most corrupt countries by independent watchdog Transparency International, and many Nigerians see the police as the embodiment of that. Poorly-paid and ill-trained, Nigerian policemen are better known for mounting illegal roadblocks to extract bribes from motorists than for fighting crime. They are also infamous for accusing people who refuse to pay of armed robbery and locking them up in dirty, overcrowded police cells where torture is systemic, according to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture who visited Nigeria in March. While low-ranking policemen are derided for their efforts to obtain small bribes, corruption on a much grander scale has been uncovered among the top brass. Another former inspector general, Tafa Balogun, was convicted in November 2005 of laundering $150 million and sentenced to six months in jail. The sight of Balogun handcuffed in court when he was charged in April 2005 was a defining image of a much-hyped war on corruption by the government. However, anti-corruption campaigners said Balogun's jail term was so lenient it undermined the fight against graft
