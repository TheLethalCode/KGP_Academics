<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  A junior army officer Monday dragged a man out of his apartment in Dhaka and tortured him, the victim's wife alleged. Meher Afroz told bdnews24.com that her husband Mahbub Alam Liton, a businessman and a resident of 69 Green Road, was taken away by a man who identified himself as Captain Shibly of the Army Engineering Corps. The captain was accompanied by another plainclothes officer and six others in uniform when he knocked the door at 7am, she said. Liton, 35, was left with injuries at 8:30am at the gate of Concept Tower where Liton and his wife own an apartment, Meher Afroz alleged in a written complaint to the local army camp. Liton was taken to Samorita Hospital. bdnews24.com took pictures of Liton lying in hospital bed with clear red marks of the alleged torture. An attending doctor told bdnews24.com that he suffered chest and hip injures. Afroz tried, unsuccessfully, to lodge a complaint with Dhanmondi police. bdnews24.com obtained a copy of the letter of complaint that detailed the allegations. Meher Afroz said police had refused to register the complaint, an allegation Dhanmondi police chief denied. "It's not true we refused to register the allegations. It's just that Meher Afroz went to the army camp to file her complaints," police inspector Monwar Hossain said. Meher Afroz later took her complaint to the Science Lab army camp, but it was not clear whether the army officers logged the charges. An officer of the Science Laboratory military camp told bdnews24.com that an investigation opened into the incident. "It's inhuman. They (army officers) beat my husband and left him back with injuries," she told bdnews24.com by phone. In her written complaint, Meher Afroz identified Captain Shibly as son of Roksana Begum, owner of Flat 13D of the building. At least two flat owners reacted angrily and demanded justice. "What the military officer did was utterly inhuman and unfortunate. We demand justice," said owners' association president Akhtar Hossain. His general secretary Md Emdadul Huq echoed him. bdne
