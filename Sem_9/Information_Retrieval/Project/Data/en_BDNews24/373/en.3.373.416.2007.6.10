 MANCHESTER, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England claimed two West Indies wickets before lunch on the fourth morning of the third test at Old Trafford on Sunday to edge nearer to a series-clinching victory. West Indies, requiring a record 455 to win and level the four-match series, lost Chris Gayle and Devon Smith to reach lunch at 99 for three and are in danger of losing the match with more than a day to spare. Photo Left-hander Gayle was dismissed in the sixth over of the morning after receiving some uncomfortable deliveries from fast bowler Steve Harmison, including one that lifted off a length and struck him a painful blow on the hand. He was eventually caught by second slip Paul Collingwood off Harmison for 16 when he played a tentative forward push to another well-directed ball from the pace bowler. Smith and Runako Morton then demonstrated good patience in a stand of 53 from 116 balls as England gave few scoring opportunities. Smith's 85-ball innings was ended by left-arm spinner Monty Panesar after he lunged forward to a straight delivery only for the ball to flick his glove on the way to short-leg fielder Alastair Cook. He was out for 42. Morton was 21 not out at the break with Shivnarine Chanderpaul on five. Harmsion, after bowling a more disciplined line than his recent efforts, has figures of two for 19 from 12 overs. England scored 370 and 313, while West Indies made 229 in their first innings. They require the highest second-innings total ever to win a test match. The first test was drawn at Lord's while England won the second at Headingley by an innings and 283 run
