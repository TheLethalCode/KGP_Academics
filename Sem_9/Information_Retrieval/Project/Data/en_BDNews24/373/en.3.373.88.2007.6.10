 MUMBAI, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian mobile phone service providers added more than 5 million GSM customers in May, taking the user base to 130.6 million in the world's fastest-growing cellular market, an industry body said on Friday. The Cellular Operators' Association of India, which represents nine carriers offering wireless services based on the widely prevalent GSM platform, said 5.04 million users signed up in May, compared with 4.13 million in April. Including the operators that run on the rival CDMA platform, India has been adding more than six million new users every month lured by call rates as low as one US cent a minute. Bharti Airtel Ltd, India's top mobile service provider, gained 1.85 million customers in May taking its user base to 40.7 million. Hutchison Essar Ltd, in which British phone firm Vodafone Plc bought a controlling stake this year, added 1.51 million users in May and boosted its total subscribers to 29.2 million. The company climbed to the third position, dethroning state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. which got just 238,553 users in May, taking its user base to 27.99 million. Reliance Communications, with 30.5 million subscribers, is India's second largest mobile services provider, but a majority of its subscribers are on the CDMA platform. The company had said on Thursday it added 1.4 million subscribers in May. Fifth-ranked Idea Cellular gained 703,412 subscribers in May, lifting its total users to 15.3 million.
