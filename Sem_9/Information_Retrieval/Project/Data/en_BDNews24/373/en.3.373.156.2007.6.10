 CAIRO, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian shares dipped on Sunday led by the housing sector, with investors cautious about an auction of residential land owned by Heliopolis Housing, dealers said. Most housing stocks in Egypt jumped in May after the government sold tracts of land near Cairo in several auctions for some $3 billion. Real estate prices rose, pushing brokerage houses to adjust the valuation of real estate companies. "Investors are afraid that this time the pieces of land would not be bought and that's why they started selling the shares, pushing them down," Ossama Gamal of Al Shorouk Brokerage said. Shares in Heliopolis Housing closed 0.5 percent down at 451.10 Egyptian pounds ($79.14). "If we find out tomorrow that Heliopolis Housing has sold the land put up for auction, then its shares will go up," Gamal added. Other housing stocks followed Heliopolis Housing. Egyptian Resorts skidded 3.1 percent to 8.77 pounds, while shares in Sixth of October Development and Investment lost 0.3 percent to close at 140.03 pounds. Alexandria Real Estate Investment and Development was barely changed, gaining 0.04 percent to 369 Egyptian pounds. Shares in investment bank EFG-Hermes, the day's most heavily traded share, recouped losses made earlier in the day and closed up 1.6 percent at 42.94 pounds. The company said in late May that it would enter the Qatari market in a joint-venture with a local Qatar company. Egypt's CASE30 Index closed down 0.8 percent to 7,643.18, while the benchmark Hermes Index fell 0.9 percent to 6,8142.18. The broader CIBC-100 was unchanged at 352.64. ($1=5.70 Egyptian poun
