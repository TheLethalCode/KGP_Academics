 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Equity and bond markets regained composure on Monday after last week's upheaval, but concern shifted to foreign exchanges when New Zealand's central bank sold its currency and unsettled a popular trading strategy. European and Asia shares were higher following heavy losses last week and government bond yields were steady after blowing out to 6-1/2-year highs. "Part of the action we saw last week was to some degree overdone," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand provided some fireworks to currency trading by selling New Zealand dollars to weaken them from what RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said were "exceptional and unjustified (levels) in terms of economic fundamentals." The kiwi, as traders call the currency, fell around 2 percent against the US dollar. New Zealand's move, however, has wider implications because the high-yielding currency is a popular target for the carry trade, in which investors borrow low-yielding currencies such as the Japanese yen to seek better returns elsewhere. "Today you might get some carry selling, because kiwi/yen will lead the way," said Geoff Kendrick, currency strategist at Westpac, adding he did not think it would last. Elsewhere on currency markets, the euro eased 0.3 percent to $1.3335, closing in on a two-month low around $1.3320 touched on Friday. The dollar was flat against the yen at 121.65 yen Equity markets rebounded with acquisition-related news boosting Europe. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.76 percent, with French and German benchmarks gaining 0.9 and 1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 putting on 0.6 percent. Centrica gained 4.3 percent to top European gainers after Russian gas group Gazprom said it was nearing a deal to increase its British market presence. The FTSEurofirst 300 lost 3.6 percent last week, its worst week since a global sell-off in late February. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.31 percent or 55.39 points to 17,834.48 and the broader TOPIX index rose 0.28 percent to 1,761.15. Trading on bond markets was calm with euro zone government bond yields flat and the US Treasury yield rising 1.5 basis points to 5.122 percent. Last week, yields rose sharply on worries about higher inflation and tighter monetary policy. Lehman Brothers' Aggregate Global Treasury index showed the yield on a global basket of government bonds hit 3.92 percent as of the close on Friday, a level not seen since 2001
