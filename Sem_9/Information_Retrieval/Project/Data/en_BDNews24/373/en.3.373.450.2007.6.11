 BEIJING, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A rare vote by residents of a dilapidated neighbourhood has thrown the largest demolition project in Beijing in decades into doubt, a result state media on Monday described as an embarrassment for the developers. State media hailed the "referendum" as significant in a country with a lucrative urban development business where arbitrary settlement terms, forced eviction and even "brutal demolition" are more common. But some are more guarded, saying it was more of a survey than a meaningful vote. Rapid urban growth across the country in the past two decades has meant the tearing down of numerous neighbourhoods to make way for office towers, hotels and upscale residential buildings. The scale of demolitions in Beijing has risen as it builds grandiose venues for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Residents in the Jiuxianqiao area of northeastern Beijing cast their votes on Saturday to decide if the demolition of their neighbourhood should go ahead on the developer's compensation terms, the People's Daily said. Jiuxianqiao is dotted by collective dormitories built in the 1950s and 1960s by now struggling state-owned electronics factories. The government says 70 percent of the housing is too old and dangerous and residents do not oppose the reconstruction. "We can't bear to live in these shabby houses any longer. We have to share a toilet, and it's a dirty and hard life. I'm old, and I want to move into a new house before I die," the China Daily quoted a resident as saying. Inhabitants could move back to the new apartments at a cost much lower than Beijing's soaring market price, but that's what the complaints are about -- with the compensation on offer, many say they still cannot afford the new accommodation, the People's Daily said. Only 2,451 households, or 45 percent of the total number of 5,473, agreed with the demolition plan, while 1,228 cast a no vote and most of those who did not vote were against it, the newspaper said, calling the results embarrassing. "It is unknown whether the demolition will start, or whether it will take place at all," the China Daily said. Last month, residents of a historic Beijing street, the Dongsi Batiao hutongs (lanes), won a reprieve from the developer's bulldozers after popular resistance to the demolition plan
