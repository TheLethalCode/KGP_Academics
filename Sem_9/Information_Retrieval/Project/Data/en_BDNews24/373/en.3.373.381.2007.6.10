 MANCHESTER, England, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Medium-pacer Darren Sammy said he lived out a dream by taking seven for 66 on his West Indies debut against England in the third test on Saturday. England, 1-0 up in the four-match series, were in control after setting West Indies 455 to win and reducing the visitors to 22 for one at the close of the third day. But Sammy, the first player from St. Lucia to appear in a test for West Indies, will always have special memories of the day he claimed three wickets in one over as England tumbled from 265 for three to 313 all out. "I always dreamt of playing cricket for West Indies," the 23-year-old told reporters. "I never thought it would turn out like that. "I was very satisfied with my performance. I remember when we went out this morning I told Chris Gayle I thought something special was going to happen. I know St. Lucian people will be very happy today," added Sammy, who also has two one-day caps. He almost picked up a hat-trick in his 17th over when he had Ian Bell and Matt Prior caught by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin with the first two balls and narrowly missed Liam Plunkett's outside egde with the third. Plunkett was then caught in the gully off the fifth ball, prompting the bowler to sink to the ground and wave his fists in the air in delight. "I was just saying to myself I have to put the ball in the right area," said Sammy after placing the match ball in his kit bag. Sammy's bowling performance was the second best by a West Indian test debutant. He had also picked up a wicket in the first inning
