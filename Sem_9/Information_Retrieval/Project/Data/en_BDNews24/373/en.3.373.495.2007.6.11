<TITLE> Final decision on Tata offer next month: BoI </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) - The interim administration will come to a decision next month on the fate of a $3 billion investment proposal by Indian business giant Tata Group, executive chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) Nazrul Islam said Monday. "We'll decide on Tata's proposal once the coal policy is finalised next month," Islam said. The government has already confirmed that it will finalise the coal policy by July. Islam made his comments after signing another big investment proposal worth $2.9 billion with UK-based Global Oil and Energy Ltd, an offshore investment arm of Ispat Industries. Owners Pramod Mittal and Vinod Mittal are related to steel magnate LN Mittal. The BoI executive chief added that Tata Group's proposal has a lot of complexities that were not present in Global Oil and Energy's investment offer. Tata Group signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bangladesh in 2004 to invest $3 billion. The plan includes a steel plant with an annual production capacity of 2.4 million tonnes, a urea factory with a 1 million tonne capacity, a 500mw coal-fired power station and a 1,000mw gas-fired power plant. Bangladesh was due to respond to Tata's proposal by the end of June last year and sign the final deal the following month. However it was delayed mainly because of gas pricing issues. Analysts said the previous BNP-led government did not make any decision on Tata's offer fearing repercussions at the end of their tenure. Tata has now suspended work on its investment plans for Bangladesh sighting 'frustrating delays' by the government in approving their proposal. bd
