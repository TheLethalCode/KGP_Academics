 SEOUL, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea's disgraced stem cell scientist Hwang Woo-suk, who is on trial for criminal fraud, is in Thailand to discuss joining an international consortium for human embryonic stem cell research, a news report said on Monday. Hwang, once celebrated as a national hero after raising hopes that his work could one day lead to cures for such illnesses as diabetes and spinal cord injuries, was indicted in May last year on charges of fraud and embezzlement related to his research. "Doctor Hwang has said he would visit Thailand at the invitation of two research institutes, including a national university, and planned to look at international stem cell research's situation," the Maeil Business Newspaper quoted a government official as saying. South Korea's Science Ministry, which previously oversaw Hwang's work, could not immediately confirm the report. Hwang is testing the possibility of joining an international study on stem cell, possibly including a US biomedical firm, because it had become impossible for him to secure human ova at home for research, the official was quoted as saying. South Korea revoked Hwang's research licence last year, barring him from obtaining human eggs. Hwang is accused of masterminding the fabrication of lab data for two landmark papers on cloning embryonic stem cells, which have since been retracted. He also is charged with fraud to secure funds and misusing state and private funds. Prosecutors have also said he violated bioethics laws in procuring human eggs for research. He faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted on the fraud charges and three years for bioethics law violations
