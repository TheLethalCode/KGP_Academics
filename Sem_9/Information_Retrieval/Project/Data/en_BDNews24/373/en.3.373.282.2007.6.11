 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European shares got off to a strong start on Monday, after losses the previous week, thanks to acquisition-related news that lifted a clutch of companies including utility Centrica and bank Barclays. At 0743 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.76 percent at 1,579.65 points, with French and German benchmarks gaining 0.9 and 1 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 putting on 0.6 percent. Centrica gained 4.3 percent to top European gainers after Russian gas group Gazprom said it was nearing a deal to increase its British market presence. Gazprom has said it is interested in Centrica as well as a number of other European firms. Centrica declined to comment. Barclays gained 2.8 percent after the Financial Times reported that hedge fund Atticus Capital was pushing the bank to drop its bid for Dutch bank ABN AMRO. The FTSEurofirst 300 lost 3.6 percent last week, its worst week since a global sell-off in late February, hurt by rate worries that sent bond yields sharply higher. But analysts said the time was not yet ripe to shift out of equities and into bonds. "Part of the action we saw last week was to some degree overdone. Underlying trends in earnings are rock-solid and, if anything, have got better in the last two to three weeks," said Franz Wenzel, a strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. "Bond yields at 4.5 percent in Europe and 5.25 percent in the United States mean that it starts to look tempting to shift towards bonds, but we see one more rate rise in the euro zone and the UK later this year, and that may be the time to shift." Despite setbacks last week and in late February and early March, the FTSEurofirst 300 has gained 6.4 percent so far this year, helped by broadly strong company results and a wave of mergers and acquisitions. German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp gained 3 percent even though saying it was not holding merger or cooperation talks with either US Steel or Severstal, denying a media report to that effect. And French bank BNP Paribas added to gains from Friday, tacking on a further 2 percent, on a media report of takeover interest from peer Societe Generale. Amid a sparse economic and corporate diary, investors will eye ECB President Jean Claude Trichet's testimony to European parliament for any further insight on monetary policy outlook. "We're in a period where there's little company data, so we might see shares treading water for the next couple of weeks," said AXA's Wenzel
