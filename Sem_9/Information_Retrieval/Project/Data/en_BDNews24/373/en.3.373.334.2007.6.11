 BEIJING, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China, whose cities are being transformed overnight as the economy races ahead, has hit out at "sensless" destruction of its cultural heritage and historical buildings, state media said on Monday. Communist China was suffering "a third round of havoc" after the disastrous Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s and the chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, it said. Qiu Baoxing, vice-minister of construction, hit out at local officials for their "senseless actions" that have "devastated" historical sites and cultural relics in the name of renovation. "Some local officials seem to be altering the appearance of cities with the determination of moving the mountain and altering the water course," he told a news briefing on Sunday, the China Daily said. "They are totally unaware of the value of cultural heritage." Qiu also slammed the "blind pursuit of large, new and exotic" buildings by some local governments. "Many cities have a similar construction style. It is like 1,000 cities having the same appearance," he said. Tong Mingkang, deputy director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, lashed out at some local governments for dismantling valuable historical sites and erecting fake replacements. "It is like tearing up an invaluable painting and replacing it with a cheap print," he was quoted as saying. Culture Minister Sun Jiazheng apologised last year for not doing enough to protect historic buildings from demolition. Many traditionally low Chinese structures have been making way for skyscrapers in Beijing and other big cities, though some old courtyards have been renovated and turned into chic residences costing thousands of dollars to rent. Other architectural schemes have been criticised for looking out of place in Beijing, home to UNESCO world heritage sites such as the old imperial palace, the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven. China did not even have a law protecting cultural relics until 1982 and during the chaos of the Cultural Revolution many priceless artifacts that were not taken to Taiwan at the end of the civil war in 1949 were destroyed by Red Guards. Beijing's historic centre and city walls had already been knocked down by communist planners to make way for a ring road, as well as the concrete expanse of Tiananmen Square and the monolithic Great Hall of the People. Chinese archaeologists in northwest Shaanxi province meanwhile have unearthed four, coloured wooden figures dating back to the Zhou Dynasty and believed to be at least 500 years older than the terracotta warriors, Xinhua news agency said
