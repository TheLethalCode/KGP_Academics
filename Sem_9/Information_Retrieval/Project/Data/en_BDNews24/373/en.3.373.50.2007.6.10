The convincing triumph not only took the All-Orange outfit to the third place with 19 points from 12 matches, but also saw a sweet revenge of their first leg 4-2 defeat to Abahani at home.

Junior opened the floodgate in the 23rd minute for Brothers Union, who played a 1-1 draw against lowly Farashganj SC in their second leg opener to continue their first- leg misery show. Manjurul Islam doubled the lead just four minutes later and the Nigerian striker made it 3-0 in the 32nd minute. Four minutes later, Junior completed his hat-trick and became the third hat-trick man after Muktijoddha Sangsad striker Alfaz Ahmed and Mohammedan's Nigerian striker Mwach Ukwu Paul Macjame. After the breather, Junior sealed the victory in the 66th minute with his fourth goal in the match.
