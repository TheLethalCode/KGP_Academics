 PARIS, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France said on Friday it would invite representatives of Lebanon's main political parties and civil society to an 'informal' meeting aimed at breaking the country's political deadlock. Lebanon was plunged into its worst political crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war when opposition ministers quit the cabinet of Prime Minister Fouad Siniora last November after the ruling majority refused opposition demands for veto power. "The minister has ... taken the initiative to invite to France representatives of all the Lebanese political forces and of civil society to participate in an informal meeting to help restore a dialogue between all political forces of the country," French foreign ministry spokesman Denis Simonneau said. During the split, the majority accused the opposition, made up mainly of Christian and pro-Syrian Shia Muslim factions, of trying to block passage of an international tribunal to try suspects in the 2005 killing of ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri. Pro-government leaders say Syria was behind Hariri's assassination. Damascus denies any hand in it. The meeting was likely to be held in late June, though the dates had not been finalised, Simonneau told a news conference, and he did not say where in France it would be held. In Beirut, the main group in Lebanon's majority coalition, led by the slain prime minister's son, quickly welcomed the French plan and said it was willing to take part in the meeting. "The Future movement welcomes the idea of a meeting in Paris. It would be willing to participate once it receives the official invitation," a senior source at Saad al-Hariri's group told Reuters. Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, and other opposition members who back the Shia militant group Hezbollah say Siniora's government lacks legitimacy. A senior opposition source said the Lebanese opposition was willing to take part in the meeting but did not have high expectations. "We do not mind participating but the invitation does not carry (high) expectations for a solution," the source told Reuters. Hezbollah, a key component of the opposition, had no immediate comment. The French foreign ministry also played down the chances of any firm commitments coming out of the meeting. "It is not a meeting that is destined to reach decisions, to decide on precise issues. It is a meeting that is aimed at favoring the renewal of this dialogue between all the Lebanese parties," Simonneau said, without specifying who would attend. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner had spoken to some of the groups involved during a trip to Beirut last month, and had been in contact with others since, he added. "We want it to be an exercise that is the most inclusive and the most representative of the diversity of Lebanese political sensibilities," Simonneau said
