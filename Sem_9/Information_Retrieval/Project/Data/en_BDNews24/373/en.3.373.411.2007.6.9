 ZAGREB, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Croatia defender Robert Kovac is leaving Juventus after agreeing to a three-year contract with Croatian champions Dinamo Zagreb, local media reported on Saturday. "Next year Robert Kovac will play for Dinamo," club executive Zdravko Mamic told the Jutarnji List daily. "He still has two years left on his contract with the Italians but has fallen out of favour with the management, so it is a done deal which we will sign next week." Mamic did not reveal details of the deal, but the daily said the 33-year-old would earn two million euros ($2.69 million) per season. Kovac has been one of the most reliable players in the Croatian squad together with his older brother Niko, a midfielder, who local media reported was also in talks with another Croatian team, Hajduk Split. Niko currently plays for Red Bull Salzburg in Austria, where his contract expires in 2008. "First I have to talk to my club's executives. If they agree, I'm ready to join Hajduk," the 35-year-old told the Jutarnji List. It was also reported that 26-year-old Croatian international striker Mladen Petric had left Swiss side Basel for Germany's Borussia Dortmund after agreeing to a four-year contract
