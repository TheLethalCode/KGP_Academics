<TITLE> Inner Mongolia powers ahead with coal </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Resource-rich Inner Mongolia could overtake Shanxi province as China's top coal centre, as the region grows through investment in minerals and industry while smaller mines are closed elsewhere, a senior government official said. Mining, power and heavy industry drove 18 percent economic growth last year in Inner Mongolia, a region that captures the imagination of most Chinese as a green land of singing sheep herders. "All other places have had to close small coal mines, so they need more from Inner Mongolia. Fifty percent of the growth has to come from us," Yu Dehui, vice chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. The region will increase coal production by 50 million tonnes a year from 300 million tonnes last year, as large mines with low output costs supply coal to power plants and steel mills. Inner Mongolia's production costs of under $4 a tonne would drive production, even as China closes in on its target of shutting 10,000 small and unsafe mines by the end of the decade. "In the future, there will be Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang defending China's energy security," Yu said. And while the French-speaking official waxed lyrical about grasslands, salt lakes and deserts, he was more enthusiastic about the growth that has propelled Inner Mongolia to the middle ranks of China's provinces and regions. "In terms of average GDP per person, we're in the top 10. That's not bad for a minority region," said Yu, a Cantonese who hails from China's southern boomtown of Shenzhen. As an "autonomous region", Inner Mongolia benefits from policies meant to stimulate growth in China's far west and in areas with substantial populations of non-Han Chinese. But the region got a slap on the wrist last year, when Beijing cracked down on unchecked growth and punished some local officials for unauthorised power plant construction. The case was meant to send a warning to other local governments not to defy Beijing in pursuing the "growth for growth's sake" that has heavily polluted China's air and water and skewed its economy towards export-oriented heavy industry. Yu was coy about further plans to develop power generation, saying new projects would follow market needs. He added that China was facing a power shortage when Inner Mongolia's maligned plants were built. "There are no small power plants in Inner Mongolia. After the problem last year, there was serious self-rectification but now there's no problem. We will only build if the centre approves; if it doesn't approve, we won't build." Growth in fixed-asset investment would stay at 20 percent this year, below national growth of 25 percent in urban fixed-asset investment, he said. Aluminium product fabricating capacity would soon reach 2 million tonnes, Yu said, while the industrial city of Baotou was growing as a centre for minor metals and heavy equipment. Inner Mongolia will soon boast 16 airports, up from 12 currently, and the airport in Hohhot is being refurbished to handle overflow during the Beijing Olympic Games of 2008. But the region is not entirely abandoning its agricultural roots. Two of China's top dairy firms, Mengniu Dairy and Inner Mongolia Yili Co. Ltd., are based in Inner Mongolia, and others are setting up shop, Yu said. "There's still a big lack of milk in China, so there's a lot of potential in dairy. Look at me, I'm from the south and I'm so short, but my son is already taller than I am because he drinks mil
