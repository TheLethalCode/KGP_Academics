 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad Saturday denied having taken money to join an Awami League-led 'mega-alliance' in 2006 and dismissed the reports as smear campaign. He vowed to call time on his political career if proved that he had taken money. "If anybody can prove that I have taken a single taka from anybody for joining the mega-alliance I will leave politics," the former president said in a statement. Ershad's comments came amid media reporters that Awami League joint general secretary Obaidul Quader confessed during questioning in police remand that Ershad took money. He said a quarter is carrying out the campaign to smear him as they are jealous of him and his party. "As a soldier I can say that I am the true soldier who can adopt strategy for winning the war. I also once said of going to the four-party alliance for strategic reasons," said the statement signed by Ershad. "But for the interest of the country and the nation I formed the grand alliance at the right time to bring down the four-party coalition government when it was undoubtedly proved that the alliance was corrupt. "We had agreements on some common programmes and sharing of seats for joining the grand alliance. There was nothing beyond this," the former military strongman said. "Neither I nor my party is involved in politics of financial transaction and will not be involved in the future." He said he risked his life to join the mega-alliance and urged people not to be misled by any propaganda. bdnews
