<TEXT>
 PARIS, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - One man simply wants a third cup for his mantelpiece and the other is chasing history -- that will be the thin line dividing Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer in the French Open final on Sunday. The duo will spend a sleepless night gearing up for act three of their riveting Roland Garros rivalry and each is keen to deflect the pressure on to the other. "He has already won the title twice, so I'd say he's the favourite, said Federer, whose only defeats in Paris over the past two years have been by Nadal. "He also won 81 matches in a row, and now he is number one on clay this year." Nadal, whose extraordinary winning streak on clay was ended last month by Federer, retorted: "He beat me the last time in Hamburg, for that reason he's the favorite." Both men have plenty to gain in a contest that is a repeat of last year's final. Boasting a phenomenal 20-0 record at the claycourt grand slam, Nadal is on course to equal Bjorn Borg's hat-trick of trophies achieved in 1980. Federer, however, knows that his place in the pecking order of the greatest players in the sport rests on the outcome of Sunday's tussle. If he captures the Musketeers' Cup, he will shoot to the top. Lose and the debate about where he stands in relation to the likes of Rod Laver, Pete Sampras, Don Budge will rage on. "If he wins the French Open, he'll be the greatest player of all time, ahead of Laver, ahead of Sampras," seven-times slam champion John McEnroe said while commentating in Paris. 'MORE PRESSURE' If Federer captures his 11th major on Sunday, he will not only trail Sampras's all-time record by just three, he will also join American Budge and his hero Laver by becoming only the third man to hold all four slams at once. It is a feat that has not been achieved in the men's game for 38 years. "He has more pressure than me because what is at stake for him is probably more difficult than just winning a final. What he's aiming at is winning a Grand Slam," said Nadal, who holds a 5-1 winning record over the Swiss on clay. "As for me, I just want to win the final of a grand slam. I'd be happy to have three cups at home rather than two." After falling at the final hurdle 12 months ago, Federer wants to block out the significance of the contest. "I don't want to think about winning the four titles in a row," he said. "I've never achieved such a thing, so I don't know how I'll feel." The levelling effect of tennis's most taxing surface means the beaten earth provides the perfect platform for the Spaniard and the Swiss to continue their duel for supremacy. Federer is undoubtedly the most complete all-round player around but on clay, where endurance rather than finesse is a key requirement, he is still cast in the role of pretender. The Swiss maestro possess a bewitching assortment of backhands, forehands, volleys and can conjure every shot in the book. When required, he can even invent them as he proved when he hit an astonishing squash-style trick shot during his 2006 semi-final victory over David Nalbandian. Finesse may not be key to Nadal's success but his lethal forehands and baseline power have left countless opponents gasping for air. When Federer and Nadal face each other, it makes for a compelling drama
