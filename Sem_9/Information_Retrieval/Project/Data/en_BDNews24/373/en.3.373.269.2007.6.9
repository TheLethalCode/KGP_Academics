<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League (AL) president Sheikh Hasina Saturday took a dig at the security men over their "ultra-stringent behaviour" to let visitors in to her Sudha Sadan home. She asked the head of the contingent to explain the excessive control and checks Sudha Sadan by the security personnel. Hasina came out of her home at 11:40am on her way to visit her ailing aunt in Gulshan and said to the officer in charge of the security team, "People come to see me and I love meeting them and helping them. But why do you allow only two persons in at a time and not any more?" The officer apparently failed to explain. Waiting for his turn to see the AL chief was Mostafa Kamal, ward 48 AL president, seated on a wheel-chair outside the barricade put up by the police. Seeing Kamal Hasina got down from her car, gave him some money and vented her displeasure at the police officer. bdnews24.
