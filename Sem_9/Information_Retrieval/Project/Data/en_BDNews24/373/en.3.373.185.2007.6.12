 LONDON, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's inflation rate slowed more than expected to its weakest rate in seven months in May as the cost of utility bills and food came down, but expectations for a fifth rate hike in a year remained intact. The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday consumer prices rose 0.3 percent last month, taking the annual rate down to 2.5 percent from 2.8 in April -- the lowest since October but still well above the 2 percent target. Sterling fell and stocks and government bonds rose as analysts had predicted a 2.6 percent reading. But economists said the Bank of England would still have to hike interest rates to at least 5.75 percent this year. "These figures, on their own, will not be enough to alleviate the Monetary Policy Committee's concerns about medium term inflation trends," said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. BoE Governor Mervyn King warned late on Monday the central bank may have to hike borrowing costs for a fifth time since August if data continued to show the economy straining against the buffers and firms eager to push up prices. The ONS said the biggest downward impact on the CPI annual rate came from utility bills as electricity and gas providers have been cutting prices after steep rises a year ago. Overall, housing and household services cut 0.23 percentage points off the headline rate. There was a further downward impact from food and non-alcoholic beverages mainly due to vegetable and meat prices falling this year. The main upward effect came from transport following large increases in the cost of air travel. Last year, fares fell in May having risen sharply the month before as the price collection period coincided with Easter in April 2006. Retail price inflation, on which most pay deals are based, eased in line with expectations to an annual rate of 4.3 percent in May, the weakest since January. In separate data, Britain's goods trade gap with the rest of the world narrowed to its smallest since October 2005 in April, slimming to 6.316 billion pounds from 7.157 billion in March. Analysts had predicted a deficit of 7 billion pounds
