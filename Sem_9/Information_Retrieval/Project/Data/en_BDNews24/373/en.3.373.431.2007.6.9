<TITLE> Japan PM Abe returns from G8 to face domestic woes </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Buoyed by a smooth G8 summit debut, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe returned to Japan on Saturday to face the greater challenge of placating voters angered by government mishandling of pensions and political corruption ahead of July national elections. A smiling Abe left Heiligendamm in Germany with everything on his modest wish list, from a summit declaration urging North Korea to stop testing missiles and start the nuclear disarmament process, to consensus on the need for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and reaffirmation of his warmer ties with China. "I am very satisfied that I was able to make a meaningful contribution to the summit's discussions and success," he told a post-summit news conference. Previous trips abroad have tended to boost Abe's support at home -- a lift he desperately needs now, with his popularity at barely half the levels enjoyed when he took office in September. North Korea's test-firing of a missile a day after Abe and US President George W Bush agreed that their patience was running thin with Pyongyang may have helped push the problem to the top of the agenda at a G8 working lunch. Abe, who built his support base by taking a hard line on North Korea, especially over its abductions of Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s, had been anxious for proof of G8 support. A G8 declaration, although criticised by environmentalists as toothless, also mentioned the need to "seriously consider" halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Abe considers that proposal his own initiative, although the European Union has been pushing for a similar target. "Strategic efforts made by Prime Minister Abe for the agreement should be rightly commended," the conservative Sankei Shimbun daily said in an editorial on Saturday. Abe's friendly meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao on the sidelines of the summit on Friday also indicated that ties were now robust enough to withstand a spat one day earlier over former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui's visit to Japan. Hu thanked Abe for his efforts to improve bilateral ties and did not even mention Lee. Analysts note, however, that popularity points scored for diplomatic "performances" are often quickly lost over issues closer to home, particularly those that hit voters in the wallet. News that millions of payments into the government pension system were unaccounted for has spread anxiety among an electorate already worried whether Japan will be able to fund its ballooning numbers of elderly through their retirement years. A second blow came with the suicide late last month of Abe's farm minister, under fire for links to several funding scandals. With support hovering at about 30 percent -- the lowest levels since he took office -- Abe has only weeks to persuade voters he can sort out the pensions muddle before an upper house election expected on July 22. A loss of his coalition's majority in the upper chamber would not automatically require Abe to resign, but a big defeat would be likely to spark calls for him either to step down or call a snap election for the more powerful lower house. "Next year Japan hosts the summit," Abe told the news conference before leaving Germany. "I want to make it a truly environmentally friendly summit," he said, adding that he wanted to showcase Japan's world-class low-energy technology at the conference on its northern island of Hokkaido. The next few weeks may determine whether he will actually be among the world leaders gathering at Lake Toya in 2008
