 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Even those Britons who are sceptical about the effects of climate change and efforts to fight it are happy to pay more for their energy to help cut carbon emissions, according to a study published on Monday. The research, for British energy regulator Ofgem, shows that even those who do not think climate change is a big problem are willing to pay up to 15 pounds ($29.52) a year more on their bills to support carbon abatement programmes. Those worried about global warming and supportive of current programmes to reduce emissions are prepared to pay up to 100 pounds a year to do something about it. Although they said government and individuals had to do their bit in the climate change battle, both groups felt businesses and energy suppliers should still bear most of the costs involved in reducing the impact of carbon emissions on the environment. "Our research shows that there is a willingness from most consumers to help tackle carbon emissions, but there is confusion and pessimism about how effectively industry and government can fight climate change," Ofgem Chief Executive Alistair Buchanan said. "So the challenge is to convince consumers that the bill for reducing emissions is a fair reflection of the real cost of making those reductions and to communicate effectively how government and business are tackling the problem." Most of the 60 customers interviewed by an independent company for Ofgem's study, conducted in London, Bristol and Glasgow, were aware of simple things they can do to cut energy consumption but felt it was difficult to be energy efficient. The customers were given 10 days to study an information pack about climate change and programmes to cut emissions, followed by day-long sessions to further discuss their vie
