 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A strong and confident Russia is good for Europe because it will make a better and more reliable business partner, former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said on Saturday. "In Europe and in Russia, people must understand that the Cold War is past," Schroeder said in a speech to an annual economic forum in St. Petersburg. "Russia is no longer in a weak negotiating position ... Russia is self-confident in political and economic terms and this is good, not bad for Europe," he added. The St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, drawing more than 6,000 business leaders, diplomats and media from over 60 countries, is intended to showcase Russia as a dynamic location for trade and investment after months of political tension between Moscow and the West. Schroeder, who as chancellor formed a close friendship with President Vladimir Putin and now chairs a German-Russian consortium building a major gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea, said a stable Russia was essential for Europe's wellbeing. Europe would only secure its position as a global player if it secured its relationship with Moscow, he added. Rejecting concerns about excessive dependence on Russian energy, Schroeder urged Europe to continue expanding its energy partnership with Russia because it was more stable than Middle Eastern countries such as Iran and Iraq. "Russia has been a reliable partner to Europe in the field of energy supply for almost four decades," Schroeder said. "I am certain this will hold true in the future"
