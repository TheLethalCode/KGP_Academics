 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com) -- Stocks continued to slip Monday, triggered by bad weather and selling pressure. Initial public offers by three companies in a row also contributed to the fall as investors rushed into selling more than buying. "More sellers gathered Monday than buyers to get IPOs offered by three companies, including two leasing ones," Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, which manages about Tk 600 million in funds, told bdnews24.com. Total transactions on the Dhaka Stock Exchange recorded Tk 109.6 crore, which was about Tk 116 crore Sunday despite incessant rains much across the country. The DSI or all-share price index ended 19.23 points or 1.168 percent lower at 1626.70. The DGEN or general index dropped 21.91 points or 1.091 percent to 1986.369 at the close of the market. The DSE-20 blue-chip index declined 19.40 points or 1.07 percent to 1786.33. "Normal trade continued to be subdued because of heavy rain and a rush to buy the shares of new arrivals by selling their shares in hand," Yawer Sayeed said. "But the trend is not alarming," he added. Sayeed said some companies here in Bangladesh are highly capitalised and a decline or increase in their prices affects the whole market. On the DSE, 63 issues advanced, 107 dropped and 21 remained unchanged. On the Chittagong Stock Exchange, 17 issues gained, 54 fell and seven held steady. Information Services Network, Golden Son, National Life Insurance, Peoples Insurance and Prime Life Insurance were the top five gainers of Monday's trade. Shares of Information Services Network Ltd gained highest by 14.86 percent. Fine Foods, Tripti, BD Autocars, Eastern Cables and Midas Finance were the top five losers. Fine Foods lost 4.54 percent in its price Monday. bd
