<TITLE> The writing was on the hills </TITLE>

 Chittagong, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  The writing was, well, on the hills in a city that had dug graves for yearscutting the rolling hills to throw up homes in a suicidal race for urbanisation. And Monday, it was payback time as overnight rains triggered the hills to tumble down with the homes in one swift stroke of vengeance, plunging no fewer than a hundred people forever into darkness. Roiling monsoon rainwater triggered mudslides to sweep away some dozens of hillside homes with most of the bodies washed away in the current of knee to waist-high waters and countless more unaccounted for. No-one can clearly recall when was the last time they saw monsoon rain leave such devastation in its wake. The commercial capital was brought to its knees with so many of its inhabitants buried alive and over 100 injured. Police, rescuers and city officials said the port city was reduced to a ghost city with so many lives lost. In Bangladesh, landslides are usually tied to the rainy season, but deaths are rare. But this time 267 mm or 11 inches of rains in the 12 hours to 6pm Monday with a few breaks were enough for all hell to break loose on the residents. Gushing waters submerged the streets, closing down businesses, offices and transport and forcing people to stay home. Regular power snaps after nightfall and crisis of drinking water deepened the woes. Some five to six mud-huts were found smashed at the foot of the hills in Dokhin Dhebapar, killing seven people including Kausar Ali's wife and children. Ali said a section of the hill came crashing down on his hut at around 8:00am. "I managed to get out but my wife and 2 children were sleeping," Kausar said, his voice breaking, eyes tearing. Environmental activists put the mudslide down to mindless hills-cutting and clumsy urbanisation. They argue nothing else could cause so many casualties; for no other reason could the streets of the city be washed up and clogged with waters coming down from the mountains. A nature-activist from Utsha, an organisation that took part in the rescue operations, showed some huts erected on reefs and at bases of hills. He said all of them were built after hills were cut. "Authorities did not come up with legal measures against the law-breakers. Their inaction has now resulted in so many deaths," he said. Architect Zerina Hossen also said the landslide was the effect of hills cut down without plan. "There are many ways to do that. But here no-one is following any. The Chittagong Unnayan Kortripakha is not taking any action either," she told bdnews24.com. Authorities are constructing roads not thinking about sewage, she added. The rainwater running down from the mountains intrude the habitats finding no proper channels. Hossen wondered how city authorities could approve 15-storey buildings in a city with inadequate sewage system. Deputy commissioner of Chittagong Mokhlesur Rahman also blamed illegal levelling of hills for the catastrophe. He predicted more deaths if it did not stop. Chairperson of Chittagong Unnayan Kortripakhya, the city developers, Shah Mohammad Akhter Uddin said, "This is a problem related to environment. So we will have to implement nature laws to stop hills being cut down." He claimed hill-cutting has come to a stop and that no-one can cut do that without approval from the Directorate of Environment. Director of the Environment Division Dr Khondoker Rashedul Haque said, "No-one issued any clearance for felling down mountains. But we do not have enough manpower to monitor the activities properly." bdnew
