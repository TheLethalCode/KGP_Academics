 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sergei Ivanov, tipped as a leading candidate to succeed President Vladimir Putin, pledged on Saturday to use foreign investment, state sponsorship and open trade to make Russia one of the world's top five economies. Ivanov, 54, was promoted to First Deputy Prime Minister in February from Defence Minister and had a long career in the intelligence services prior to that -- something which has prompted investor worries about his commitment to free markets. Opening a giant investor conference here intended to showcase Russia's economic power, Ivanov presented a vision of development to 2020 based mainly on free markets and open trade. "The Russian people have made their historical choice for democracy, openness and the freedom of society and business initiatives," Ivanov told investors. "That is a foundation that cannot undergo revision. This is the main orientation of our strategy." Before his speech, Ivanov, wearing a dark suit and red tie, spoke to CEOs in fluent English and joked with fellow First Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, also widely seen as a possible presidential hopeful. Ivanov said foreign investors would play a key role -- along with the state -- in building Russia into one of the leading economies of the world by 2020. "By 2020 our country can, and must, be one of the top five economies of the world in terms of gross domestic product," he said. Russia's economy grew to about $1 trillion last year from less than $200 billion in 1999. In the economic chaos of the early 1990s, gross domestic product shrank by more than half. The current boom has been driven by high oil and gas prices and soaring domestic consumption. Ivanov said Russia would seek to boost sectors such as nuclear energy, aviation, ship building, defence and space while increasing its processing capacity and innovation to raise the value of exports, currently dominated by raw materials. He said huge state holdings were being built up in the economy but denied this meant a return to state monopolies. "We are talking about public corporations," he said. "The holding companies will work in cooperation with private companies, including foreign ones." One day they may issue freely traded shares, he added. Ivanov said state officials had failed to create the proper conditions for small and medium business development and hit out at corruption and a lack of state support for innovation. "Russia's economy is still too dependent on the export of natural resources. For a long time we have really been hooked on resources," Ivanov said. "We must learn to use our natural resources and natural competitive advantages more effectively.
