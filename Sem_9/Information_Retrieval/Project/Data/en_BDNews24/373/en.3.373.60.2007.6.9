 CHENNAI, India, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An innings of 88 by Saurav Ganguly helped Asia XI amass 337 for seven against Africa XI in the second Afro-Asia Cup match on Saturday. India opener Virender Sehwag lashed 52 off 38 balls and Pakistan's Mohammad Yousuf (51) hit his second consecutive fifty after skipper Mahela Jayawardene chose to bat first after winning the toss. Jayawardene chipped in with 45 while Indian left-hander Yuvraj Singh plundered 30 not out from 13 deliveries at the end. South African brothers Morne and Albie Morkel shared three wickets but the fielding side wilted in the heat and humidity of the day-night fixture. Indian Ganguly was dropped on 30 and 67 during a 112-ball knock which contained nine fours and a six. He added 80 for the fourth wicket with Jayawardene and 84 for the next with the fluent Yousuf. Sri Lanka skipper Jayawardene lashed four fours and a six before being run out following a mix-up with Ganguly. Morne Morkel bowled tightly to return two for 48 in 10 overs. Asia XI can claim the three-match series, having won the first game in Bangalore on Wednesday by 34 runs. The final match will be played at the same venue on Sunda
