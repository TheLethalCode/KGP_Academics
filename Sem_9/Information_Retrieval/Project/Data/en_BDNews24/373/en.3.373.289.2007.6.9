 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com) - The top trade body Saturday asked the government to roll back import duty hike in the proposed budget that it said would cost the domestic industry dear. "It is a wrong signal to the local industry which is improving gradually," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told a post-budget press conference at its office. "No doubt, it is going to affect the local industry." The finance adviser Thursday proposed to restructure the three-tier import duty slabs at 10, 15 and 25 percent from 5, 12 and 25 percent respectively for the 2007-2008 fiscal year starting July 1. The FBCCI chief differed with the finance adviser's argument that the duty hike move would help the local industry increase competitiveness and efficiency. He said countries like China and India were giving their industries the facility. "Where does Bangladesh stand compared to those countries? Our industry has not yet reached that stage to be able to sustain such a duty hike," Mir Nasir said. He said the withdrawal of zero-duty facility on import of machinery would deal a telling blow to the textiles sector. Hamstrung by a number of limitations, the domestic industries deserved incentives such as duty cuts to survive and get better. The withdrawal of four percent infrastructure development surcharge duty, the FBCCI chief pointed out, would further hit the local industry as the move would encourage more import of finished goods at the cost of local products. The FBCCI president lauded big steps in the social sector, poverty reduction and price control. He referred to the four major steps announced by the finance adviser, namely, massive step up in outlay on education, power, human resources development, agriculture and information technology. He complimented the finance adviser on the major steps he had proposed for financing the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation's liabilities worth Tk 7,523 crore. Senior officials of the FBCCI were present at the briefing. bdnew
