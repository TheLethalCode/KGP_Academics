<TITLE> Nikkei slips as trade turns cautious before BOJ </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei average fell 0.36 percent by midday on Tuesday with insurers like Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co Ltd down after a recent rally in cautious trade ahead of a Bank of Japan interest rate decision this week. Shares of shipping companies were also hit, with Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd down more than 4 percent on concern about higher fuel costs following sharp rises in US crude oil futures. "This week's BOJ meeting is one reason why the market cannot be bullish because the possibility of a rate hike is not zero," said Katsuhiko Kodama, a senior strategist at Toyo Securities. Data on Monday showed Japan's economy outperformed both the United States and the euro zone in January-March for a second straight quarter, reinforcing expectations the central bank will raise rates in August. The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold at its two-day policy meeting that ends on Friday, but it has said it will raise rates gradually to keep on top of inflation. Higher rates are seen as hurting stocks in general since they increase borrowing costs and can curb consumer spending. "Today's market is a mix of sharp profit-taking and buying on dips," Kodama said. The Nikkei finished the morning down 64.63 points at 17,769.85, while the broader TOPIX index shed 0.48 percent to 1,752.66. Trade volume slowed, with 932 million shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. That compared with last week's morning average of 1.44 billion shares when volume swelled, especially on Friday when futures and options contracts were settled. Declining shares outpaced advancers by a ratio of about three to one. Insurance company shares fell, with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance down 4.5 percent at 1,618 yen, and Sompo Japan Insurance Inc losing 2.6 percent to 1,607 yen. Among shipping companies, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha fell 4.4 percent to 1,408 yen and Mitsui OSK Lines lost 1.6 percent to 1,620 yen. The shipping subindex has risen 38 percent this year, making it the best performing sector and also leaving it ripe for profit-taking. Japan Airlines Corp declined 2.5 percent to 233 yen and All Nippon Airways Co Ltd slipped 0.9 percent to 464 yen on concerns about higher fuel costs. But Nippon Oil Corp, Japan's top refiner, gained 1.5 percent to 1,123 yen and Japan's biggest oil developer INPEX Holdings Inc added 0.9 percent to 1.14 million yen on news that Saudi Arabia's European and Asian customers will receive no extra supply in July. Elsewhere, shares of Konica Minolta Holdings Inc climbed 3.2 percent to 1,738 yen after Daiwa Institute of Research said in a report the company was more confident of its strategy. Toshiba Corp rose 1.1 percent to 953 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported on Tuesday the electronics conglomerate plans to boost its flash memory production capacity by 70 percent by June 2008. Shares of drinks maker Calpis Co Ltd remained untraded due to a glut of buy orders at 1,306 yen after food and seasonings giant Ajinomoto Co said on Monday it would make Calpis a wholly owned unit in a $680 million share swap deal, the latest consolidation move in Japan's mature food and beverage sector. Ajinomoto was down 1.5 percent at 1,448 yen
