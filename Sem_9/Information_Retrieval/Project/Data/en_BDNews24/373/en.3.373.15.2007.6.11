 PARIS, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rafael Nadal remained the undisputed claycourt king by taming Roger Federer 6-3 4-6 6-3 6-4 to complete a hat-trick of French Open titles on Sunday. World number two Nadal displayed superior power and mental strength to overcome the world number one and become the first man since Bjorn Borg in 1980 to win three successive Roland Garros finals. Swiss Federer, chasing the only grand slam crown to elude him, fought bravely but could not match the raw determination of the muscular Spaniard, who also beat him in four sets in last year's final. "Of course I'm a bit sad but I fought, I tried," said Federer. "I'll come back next year and I'll do the maximum to win this tournament I love." Showing signs of nerves at crucial moments and making unusual unforced errors, Federer could not stage the perfect show he would have needed and bowed out by hitting a forehand long on the first match point after three hours and 10 minutes. "It's true that I feel at home here but I worked extremely hard for this," said Nadal. "I'm extremely happy and, at the same time, a bit sad for Roger, who's a friend and a true champion." The key to an eagerly anticipated clash was Federer wasting many break opportunities and Nadal converting the few he was presented with. Federer, who had beaten Nadal for the first time on clay in the Hamburg final last month, now trails his arch-rival 6-1 on the slow surface. OTHER PLANS The elegant Swiss all-rounder was hoping to become the third man to hold all four grand slam titles at the same time but Nadal had other plans. There were no break opportunities for either player until Federer earned two break points in the fourth game of the first set. Nadal saved them both to hold serve. Two games later, the 21-year-old Spaniard survived five more break points in a thrilling, 17-minute game featuring amazing winners from both sides. In the next game, Nadal earned three break points, his first in the match, and needed just one to capture Federer's serve, the top seed netting a backhand to present his opponent with a 4-3 lead. Nadal broke Federer again in the ninth game with a forehand winner to take the set after 51 minutes. The second set was tight until Federer earned three break points in the seventh game. Nadal saved one with a superb winner but then dropped serve for the only time in the match with an unforced error. The 25-year-old Federer stayed in control until serving for the set, wrapping it up courtesy of an unforced error by Nadal to keep his chances alive. Nadal was soon back on top, however, managing a break in the second game of the third set. Federer saved a set point in the eighth game but the Spaniard then served for the set. Nadal mercilessly took it with a forehand winner and then set himself up with a break in the second game of the fourth set before cruising to victor
