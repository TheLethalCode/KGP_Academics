 SAO PAULO, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An estimated 3 million gays, lesbians and transvestites paraded peacefully down the main avenue of Brazil's business capital Sao Paulo on Sunday, to condemn homophobia, racism and machismo, organisers said. "This is the biggest parade on the planet. Our city is again showing that it respects diversity," said Tourism Minister Marta Suplicy. The Sao Paulo Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals and Transvestites (GLBT) Parade Association said warm temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius (88 Fahrenheit) helped draw more than last year's 2.5 million marchers. Military police estimated that around 1 million people jammed into the skyscraper-lined Avenida Paulista, but there were many more in surrounding streets. Some 900 officers were on duty to help maintain order. On a five-day visit to Brazil, the world's most populous Catholic country, Pope Benedict last month attracted less than 1 million to listen to his calls to reinforce traditional family values. During the parade, bands played on 23 "trios eletricos," or huge trucks, with their music blasted from massive loudspeakers. Marchers, many wearing feather costumes, unfurled a giant rainbow-colored flag. "I'm proud to parade...here there's no violence only fun," said Jose Alves Filho, a 42-year-old hairdresser. Sponsors included Brazil's state energy company Petrobras and the state-owned Caixa Economica Federal bank. The parade, which was officially sanctioned for the first time, is seen as a major cash cow, attracting some 300,000 Brazilian and foreign visitors, who boost the receipts of hotels, restaurants and shops. A study this year by consumer research consultants Insearch found that Brazilian gays were above-average wage earners and spent 40 percent more on leisure than heterosexuals
