<TITLE> IGP asks police to play neutral </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rajshahi, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Police chief Noor Mohammad Sunday said it was time for the police to act neutrally. "Police have to work for the country and the people, not for the government," the inspector general of police said when he met journalists and members of civil society in Rajshahi divisional headquarters. Police had earlier been armed with enough powers but the wing lacked efficiency and integrity, he said. The police boss sought people's cooperation to ensure his department's sensible performance in future. He unveiled a slogan: "Say yes to police." He, however, asked people to come up with complaints, if there is any, against his colleagues. "Please file complaints with the higher authorities," he said. The country's police department is often accused of misusing power and harassing innocent people while corruption is routine. The department insiders often say that the wing has long been intimidated by political governments, making it a dysfunctional organ of the state. But the military-backed interim government is trying to purge the department of corruption and nepotism. The IGP arrived in Rajshahi Saturday and held a meeting with his colleagues in the city. He warned them, saying no members of the department would be spared if anybody was found guilty. "If anybody is found guilty, he will lose the job and be punished," he said. He asked them to stay cautious about the people's basic rights. "You must be careful so that innocent people are not harassed," he said. He earlier inaugurated a training centre at the district police outpost at 9.30am. bdnews2
