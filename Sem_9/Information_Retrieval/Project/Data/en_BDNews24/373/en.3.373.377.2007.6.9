 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com) - The government has asked the deputy commissioners (DCs) to keep the local administration beyond controversy for a free, credible election, cabinet secretary Ali Imam Majumder said Saturday. It also asked them to rein in soaring essential prices and watch out against extortionists staging a comeback. Top government officials said some advisers and secretaries advised the district administrators not to be worried about separation of the judiciary from the executive. Local government adviser Md Anwarul Iqbal Thursday told bdnews24.com the DCs were told that there are some constitutional embargoes on the procedure of separating the judiciary from the executive. They may initially face some problems but those will disappear. "I don't think the DCs will turn out to be powerless if the judiciary is separated from the executive. They will lose their magisterial powers in line with the CrPC but they will act as executive magistrates," the cabinet secretary said. "I asked the DCs not to be worried. I discussed many points before them and I hope they realised the matter," establishment secretary Md Abdus Salam Khan said. bdnews24.c
