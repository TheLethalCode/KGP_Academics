 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Anti-Kremlin protesters who plan a march in St Petersburg on Saturday have nothing to fear if they respect public order, a source in the city administration said. A coalition of President Vladimir Putin's radical opponents, known as Other Russia, plan to march in Russia's second city in a protest timed to coincide with an international conference intended to showcase Russia's economic power. Several previous Other Russia protests, held in various Russian cities, have been crushed or blocked by police. "Those who take part in the action in accordance with agreed terms are free to do so because the rights of citizens to express their opinion is respected in Russia, and in St Petersburg in particular," the source said. "But any attempt to break the law or resort to illegal actions against law-enforcement bodies, any attempt to disrupt the normal life of other citizens will be stopped in strict accordance with the law," he added. Other Russia, led by former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, is an amalgam of small groups ranging from liberals to communists united by their opposition to Putin, whom they blame of rolling back democracy. St Petersburg authorities have allowed up to 500 protesters to march down the sidewalk of a central street, saying this will prevent traffic disruptions. Russia's democracy record under Putin, who is due to leave next year after serving eight-years in the Kremlin, was raised by several Western leaders at the summit of the Group of Eight industrialised nations in Germany earlier this week. At the final news conference in the German town of Heiligendamm, where the summit was held, Putin reiterated his tolerance of the opposition as long as it stuck to law. "I will not violate the constitution and will not allow anyone to do this," he said. Ahead of a previous march in the Volga city of Samara last month, when Other Russia timed its demonstration to tie in with an EU-Russia summit, the authorities took Kasparov off his plane in Moscow preventing him from taking part. Kasparov safely arrived in St Petersburg on Saturday
