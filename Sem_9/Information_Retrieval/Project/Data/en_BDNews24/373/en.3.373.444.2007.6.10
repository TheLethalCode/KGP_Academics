 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) - Different areas of the country have been experiencing incessant rain since Sunday midnight, due to the influence of the south-western monsoon. In the capital, heavy rain has paralysed city life. The Met office said the situation would continue for one or two more days. Stocks traded sluggish on Dhaka Stock Exchange due to heavy rain. "Normal trading was subdued. Dhaka Stock Exchange was logged by rainwater," Yawer Sayeed, chief executive of AIMS of Bangladesh, told bdnews24.com. Dhaka city woke up to the sounds of rain Sunday morning with office workers and students becoming stranded on their journeys. Several main roads as well as alleys were inundated with rainwater, including in Mirpur, Shantinagar, Mailbag and Paltan. Transportation throughout the city was severely hampered with many commuters reaching their destinations drenched. The compound of the Secretariat remained stagnant overnight because of heavy rain and lack of drainage. In other areas, Chittagong, Mongla and Cox's Bazar seaports have been asked to hoist local cautionary signal No. 3. All fishing boats and trawlers working in the North Bay area have been advised to remain close to the coast and proceed with caution until further notice. Met office weatherman SM Mahmudul Haque has added that much of the country is experiencing light to moderate rain with some areas hit by downpour as the monsoon wind remains active. The meteorological department predicts further rain and thunderstorms over Dhaka, Barisal, Chittagong and Sylhet divisions with some areas of Rajshahi division facing squally weather. The food and disaster management ministry had earlier issued a handout saying that a depression in the Bay had caused a cyclone, which was not true. The ministry later regretted the statement after the bdnews24.com correspondent contacted ministry officials. Reached by bdnews24.com, Mokhlesur Rahman, an official of the ministry, said: "It was a mistake." bdnews24.com/fwc/mh
