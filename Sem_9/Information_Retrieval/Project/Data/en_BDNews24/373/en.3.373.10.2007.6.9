 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League Saturday renewed its pledge to reform the party once the ban on indoor politics goes, a senior party leader said in a meeting with the European Union's Troika delegates. AL presidium member Abdur Razzak told reporters at a post-meeting briefing that for them to carry out reforms the ban on parlour politics should be lifted. The delegation members met the AL leaders at the home of Germany's envoy to Dhaka. Razzak termed the meeting "successful". "We have discussed the current situation of the country in detail," he said. "We have assured them of bringing reforms to the party, but the right to practice politics must be back for that to go ahead. "Once the ban goes, we'll be able to talk about the reforms within the party," he said. Razzak said they explained to the EU delegation the need to create an environment for new elections at the earliest. Senior AL leader Tofail Ahmed also aired the demand of lifting the ban. "The Election Commission and the government need to talk to the political parties. Political activities must regain pace, and that's possible if the ban is lifted," Tofail told reporters. He said the delegation also agreed with the AL view. Tofail said the way the EC is trying to bring reforms without discussion with political parties would bring little good. "The commission will not succeed in bringing meaningful changes in this way," he said and said the meeting also discussed the matter. AL presidium member Suranjit Sengupta, joint general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam, Sheikh Hasina's political secretary Saber Hossain Chowdhury and her assistant Hasan Mahmud also attended the meeting. Earlier, CPD executive director Debapriya Bhattacharya and The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam separately met the EU delegates. Anam later told reporters that they had talked about politics and reforms. bdnews24.com/sum/ra
