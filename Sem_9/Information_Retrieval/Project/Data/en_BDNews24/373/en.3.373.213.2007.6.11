<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's next prime minister, Gordon Brown, arrived in Iraq on Monday for his first visit since it was confirmed he was taking over the premiership from Tony Blair on June 27, Iraqi state television said. The television said Brown, who is on his second visit to Iraq, would meet Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. The British embassy declined to comment on the report. Brown's visit comes as the size of the British force in Iraq is being reduced by about 1,500 soldiers to 5,500 troops. Almost 150 British soldiers have been killed since the US-led invasion in 2003. Brown, now finance minister, said last month that he planned to visit Iraq to look at the situation on the ground. The war, which has never had widespread support in Britain, sapped his predecessor's popularity. British forces have handed over security responsibility to Iraqis in three of the four provinces they were in, with only the southern province of Basra remaining. That is due to be transferred in the coming months
