 NEW YORK, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sunday is Tony night -- and not just for Tony Soprano whose fate will be sealed in the final episode of `The Sopranos'. It's also the night Broadway hands out its biggest prizes of the year, the Tony Awards. Hot favorite to walk away with a string of theater awards, including best musical, is `Spring Awakening', a dark rock-musical about teen-age sexual angst, which goes in with 11 nominations and rave reviews all around.

Julie White, star of `The Little Dog Laughed', and Eve Best in `A Moon for the Misbegotten' are in the running too, as well as longshot Swoosie Kurtz. The League of American Theatres and Producers and the American Theatre Wing are hoping to lure viewers to the live broadcast on CBS television with big name presenters such as Harry Connick Jr, Felicity Huffman, Liev Schreiber, Kevin Spacey and R&B star Usher. But New York Post theater writer Michael Riedel predicted a sharp fall in ratings from last year.
