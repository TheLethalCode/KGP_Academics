 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Saturday that practical steps were needed to defuse a bitter row between Russia and Georgia after their presidents met for the first time since last year. A freeze on trade and transport with Georgia, introduced by Russia last year, sent rocky ties between Moscow and Tbilisi to all-time lows. Russia resents its former Soviet ally seeking NATO membership. "The leaders agreed to order their foreign ministers to cooperate in stabilising bilateral relations," Kremlin spokesman Alexei Gromov said after a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili. Putin and Saakashvili, who met in the Konstantinovsky Palace outside St Petersburg on the fringes of an informal summit of ex-Soviet states, discussed the lifting of Russian sanctions, Gromov told reporters after the "friendly and frank" meeting. The meeting coincided with an international investment conference in Russia's second city. "The Georgian president spoke about his interest in lifting limitations in bilateral trade and economic ties," Gromov said. "Putin replied that further movement is possible and will depend on practical changes in relations between Russia and Georgia and on their overall atmosphere." Russia has been alarmed by Saakashvili's commitment to end Georgia's traditional reliance on Russia in favour of closer relations with the European Union and NATO. The future of Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which have close ties with Russia, has become another bone of contention between Tbilisi and Moscow. Tbilisi, keen to restore the Caucasus nation's territorial integrity, accuses Moscow of seeking to annex the regions. Russia, which keeps peacekeeping forces in both regions, suspects Georgia of planning to take them back by force. Moscow has said the trade and transport sanctions, introduced after Russian officers were briefly detained in Tbilisi on spying charges last September, could be lifted only after Georgia gave up its "aggressive anti-Russian rhetoric". It has also said easing tensions over Abkhazia and South Ossetia is another condition. Putin and Saakashvili briefly met last November. But since then relations have deteriorated further. Georgian Foreign Minister Gela Bezhuashvili, who attended the talks, was quoted by the Russian news agencies as saying the Saturday's meeting was "very interesting ... and open". "I have an impression there is a movement towards each other, an understanding of each other's interests and ... an understanding that something should be done," he said
