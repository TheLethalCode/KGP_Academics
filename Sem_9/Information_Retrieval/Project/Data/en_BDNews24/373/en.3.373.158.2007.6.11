 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka University teacher Monday said the government had attached priority to donor agendas in its proposed budget for fiscal 2007-08. "The proposed budget reflects the whims of the World Bank and IMF," said Professor Mahbubul Mokaddem Akash, who teaches economics at Dhaka University. Akash has identified several forces behind the political changeover in Bangladesh and supportive of the national budget. Akash was speaking at a seminar "Dream of building a self-reliant Bangladesh: Trade, investment and budget" organised by VOICE Bangladesh and ActionAid Bangladesh at the Jatiya Press Club Monday. He highlighted five critical points that had influenced the present political climate and the current budget proposals. Donors were unhappy with the BNP and the Awami League alliances. The civil elite was supportive of neither of the main parties. Leaders and workers of the BNP and the AL were unhappy with their own party leaderships. Ordinary people were trapped by the "politics of plundering". The role played by the army. Prof Akash said liberalisation of the economic sector resulting in freer investment and withdrawal of funds would create a fresh "Asian problem". Executive director of VOICE Bangladesh Ahmed Swapan Mahmud, who also spoke at the seminar, said: "The import duty structure was readjusted to make the donors happy." "Wholesale privatisation, trade liberalisation and poverty reduction cannot work together," he said. Nationalised services sectors such as education, health and water were being handed to the private sector, he said. "This is affecting poor people hard," he added. Prof Salimullah Khan said the proposed budget was against industrialisation. "It had made the import of raw materials difficult while import of finished products easy." He suggested laundered money recovered from corrupt politicians and others should be added to the budget calculations. bdnews24.
