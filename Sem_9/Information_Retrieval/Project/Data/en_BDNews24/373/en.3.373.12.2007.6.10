 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court Sunday deferred the date for charge-framing in a duty-dodging case against former law minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed. The court had earlier fixed Sunday to hear the charge-framing, but Moudud's lawyers appealed for more time saying they did not have the documents related to the case. Metropolitan senior special tribunal judge Md Azizul Haque will hear the matter on June 17. Moudud was taken to court from jail shortly after 12.00pm. Joint forces arrested the BNP leader at his Gulshan home on April 13. The next day a case was filed with Gulshan Police Station against Moudud in line with the special powers rules for importing 16 bottles of foreign alcoholic beverages and 32 cans of beer without paying duty. bd
