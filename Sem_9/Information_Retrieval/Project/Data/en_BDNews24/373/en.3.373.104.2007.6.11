<TEXT>
 WARSAW, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Poland should support the European Union's constitution in return for the bloc's solidarity with the post-communist member in a recent row with Russia, Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer said on Monday. Poland's leaders, the eurosceptic twin brothers Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski threatened to veto the opening of talks on the stalled treaty unless its EU partners agree to discuss Polish proposals on the bloc's voting system. But Gusenbauer said that the constitution should be accepted by all member states as soon as possible, as it was an important symbol for the bloc's solidarity and unity. "The constitution is a symbol of compromise ... We cannot risk another year of discussions about it," Gusenbauer told a news conference after meeting Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski. "All EU countries have experienced how important solidarity is but especially Poland knows how important it was for itself in the face of the Russian embargo on Polish food products," he said. EU leaders supported Poland in a row over food imports to Russia telling the Kremlin at an EU-Russia summit in May that its attempts to split the bloc would fail. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told Moscow that Poland's interests were just as legitimate as those of France , Germany and other European heavyweights. But after the meeting with the Austrian chancellor, Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski did not appear to back down from his previous threats to veto constitution talks. "We have the right to use it (the veto) and we will do it if we believe that it is in our country's or Europe's interests," he said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Spanish Prime Minister Jose Louis Zapatero will visit Warsaw to discuss the issue with Polish leaders before the June 21-22 summit in Brusse
