 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews.com)  The government Monday allowed realtors and developers to complete the unfinished multi-storey buildings. Law adviser Mainul Hosein gave the go-ahead at a meeting with leaders of the Real Estate and Housing Association of Bangladesh at the housing and public works ministry, Rehab president Abdul Awal said. "They will be provided with assistance within a legal framework. We want them to start right away. This would accelerate circulate money and some poor people would be employed," Hosein said. An official of the ministry preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com that there were no talks on illegal land grab by some unscrupulous real estate businessmen. "We went to the adviser for a way out to solution to our problems. He gave us instant decisions," Awal said. If anything goes wrong, the adviser said the secretary will see, Awal added. Awal said Rehab will not protest if the land grabbers are punished. The adviser also allowed the land developers to post advertisements with some conditions. The interim government had banned advertisement as many unscrupulous businessmen cheated people with advertisements full of false promises. Authorities approved 200 private housing projects in line with the land development rules. But amendments to the rules in 2006 forced the land developers to keep their projects incomplete. bdnews24.com/
