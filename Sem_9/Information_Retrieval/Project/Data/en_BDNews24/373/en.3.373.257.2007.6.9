 PARIS, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Excellence comes naturally to Roger Federer and only his very best will do if he is to prevent Rafael Nadal from completing a hat-trick of titles in Sunday's French Open final. World number one Federer, chasing the only grand slam crown to elude him, knows exactly what he must not do against the world number two, and that is run out of steam after a great start, like last year, when the Spaniard won 1-6 6-1 6-4 7-6. "Last year I came out of the blocks very, very strong with a great first set but after that, I couldn't handle Nadal," Federer said. "So I hope this year's going to be different." The ultimate weapon on clay, the 21-year-old Nadal, can wear down any opponent with his relentless groundstrokes and will fight for every ball. Federer, who masters every shot in the book, has what it takes to trouble him, providing he is ready for a bruising battle against the Spanish dynamo with the bulging biceps. "Physically and mentally, I'm ready," Federer said. The difference from last year is that the elegant Swiss has beaten the explosive Spaniard on clay at last, in the Hamburg final last month. The 25-year-old Federer, who trails Nadal 5-1 on clay, now knows he can beat Nadal on the slow surface and there is no better time and place to do it again than the final Sunday on the Roland Garros Centre Court. MERCILESS WINNERS "The only difference is that I know now that I have defeated Rafa on clay in Hamburg, so maybe that will help me get on the right tracks", Federer hoped. Having lost to Federer once does not mean Nadal, who dreams of becoming the first man with three successive titles here since Bjorn Borg in 1980, has become vulnerable. The muscular Majorcan has advanced to the title match without dropping a set, crushing everything in his path with merciless forehand winners to extend his 100 percent French Open record. Now he could stop Federer from becoming the third player after Don Budge and Rod Laver to hold all four grand slam titles at the same time. As if to take some of the pressure off, Nadal suggested his opponent was the slight favourite. "He's the best player in the history of the game and I will have to be at my very best", said the Spaniard. "That's the only way you can beat Roger." Federer realises he has more to gain from what promises to be a thrilling, tight contest. By winning on Sunday, Nadal would confirm only that he is the best claycourt player. If Federer managed to prevent Nadal from lifting the Musketeers' Cup again, he would establish himself as the top player on any surface and, arguably, the greatest ever
