<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 09 (bdnews24.com) - The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI) Saturday said that traders who had hiked the price of sugar before approval of the proposed budget should be punished severely. "This is a very bad trend. There is no reason to increase the price of sugar at the moment," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told journalists at the FBCCI conference room. "This dishonest trend should be stopped immediately," Hossain said to queries of journalists. Sugar traders have already increased the prices of the item since announcement of the budget for fiscal 2007-08 Thursday. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam has proposed to re-fix the specific rate of duty at Tk 4,000 instead of the existing specific rate of duty at Tk 2,250 on raw sugar to avoid mis- declaration and also to address the problems faced by 5 lakh sugarcane growers and local sugar industries. Soon after announcement of the duty hike proposal, dishonest traders raised the prices of sugar by Tk 2 to 4 per kilogramme although the duty enhancement is supposed to come into effect July 01. The FBCCI chief said 'unscrupulous' businessmen increase prices of items soon after announcement of the budget, but they do not do the same for products whose prices are reduced. "They wait for the specific date for reduction of the prices," he said citing example of edible oil. bd
