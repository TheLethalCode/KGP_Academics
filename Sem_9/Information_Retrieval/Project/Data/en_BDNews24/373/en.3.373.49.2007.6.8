 Dhaka, June 8 (bdnews24.com)  A Nottinghamshire club has expressed the desire to get all-rounder Saqib Al Hasan, skipper Mohammad Ashraful said Friday. "A Pakistani, agent of the club, phoned me this afternoon from England to make the bridge between Saqib and the club. "They want Saqib to play for them in their local league. But I do not remember the name of the club," Ashraful told bdnews24.com Friday. Ashraful said the club is looking for a left-arm spinner, who also can bat well. Bangladesh spin troika of Mohammad Rafique, Abdur Razzak and Saqib Al Hasan had a tremendous World Cup in the West Indies where the Tigers stunned India and South Africa, gave England a real scare. "They know Bangladesh have a busy schedule this year and they want Saqib for one month in the gap between the Bangladesh tour of Sri Lanka in June-July and the Twenty20 World Cup in September," said the 22-year old Bangladesh captain. Ashraful also played in England last year for Rainhill Club in Liverpool. He said he asked the agent to call him Saturday and he would arrange a meeting with Saqib by phone after the training session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. bdn
