<TITLE> Russia must boost oil fund to fix pensions: former PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia must capitalise on the boom in oil prices to massively expand state saving and shore up its pensions system, former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar said on Saturday. Russia has channeled windfall oil revenues into a budget stabilisation fund worth $117 billion, or around 10 percent of gross domestic product, to safeguard its public finances against a possible slump in oil prices. But, Gaidar said in a speech, the fund -- now being widened to include growth-oriented investments -- should grow to as much as 70 percent of GDP if Russia is to safeguard living standards for the elderly. "While oil prices are abnormally high, we have a chance to resolve this most difficult strategic task," Gaidar told a hand-picked audience of business and political leaders at the 11th St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Russia's population, now just over 140 million, is falling by 700,000 a year, and a shrinking working-age population will threaten its state-run pension system by 2020 if remedial action is not taken. Private pension provision is small by comparison. Gaidar estimated the cost of fixing Russia's pension system at around 4 percent of GDP, making a big expansion to the stabilisation fund vital to cover that cost and avert the painful alternative of tax increases. He noted that government pension fund of Norway, another oil exporter, was worth 100 percent of that country's GDP. "We need 70 percent of GDP to ensure the stability of our pension system," said Gaidar, author of Russia's 'shock therapy' reforms of the early 1990s and now head of the Institute for the Economy in Transition think tank. Russia has learned from the Soviet Union's economic collapse, which Gaidar said stemmed in part from a collapse in oil prices: "The money just ran out." In addition to the oil-funded stabilisation fund, Russia under President Vladimir Putin has amassed the world's third-largest central bank reserves and is moving to a three-year budget cycle that strips out volatile oil revenues. "These all demonstrate that we have learned our lessons," Gaidar said. "It won't make us independent from oil and gas prices, but it gives a safety cushion." Russia's economic successes should not divert attention from its development challenges, Gaidar said, comparing Russia today with the boom in post-World War Two Europe that boosted incomes and state revenues. Most of Russia's budget revenues depend on prices for oil and gas, which over the years have fluctuated by a factor of up to 10, he warned. "When revenues are growing so quickly, you think that money is unlimited," said Gaidar
