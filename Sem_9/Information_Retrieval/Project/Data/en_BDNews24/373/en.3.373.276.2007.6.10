 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam Sunday said the government would amend the budget in case any proposal hurt domestic interests. "We are taking opinions and suggestions on the proposed budget. We must amend if anything goes against the country's interests," Azizul told reporters after inaugurating a handbook on 'Entity-wide Auditing' at the Audit Bhaban. Top trade bodies, including FBCCI, BGMEA and BKMEA have differed with the finance adviser over enhancing import duty from 5 percent to 10 percent on basic raw materials and capital machineries. The adviser however said: "We must keep in mind the government needs tax. We're taking opinions on how the proposal would affect local industry." The adviser reiterated that the proposal would not put any significant impact on the industry as the government also proposed complete withdrawal of 4 percent infrastructure development surcharge. Local industrialists feared withdrawal of infrastructure development surcharge would accelerate imports of finished products, which may jeopardise domestic industry. The country's apex trade body, FBCCI, Saturday opposed the proposed import duty hike and asked the government to cancel the proposal for the sake of the industry. "It is a wrong signal for the local industry which is improving gradually," FBCCI president Mir Nasir Hossain told a post-budget press conference at its office Saturday. "No doubt, it is going to affect local industry," he said. The finance adviser Thursday proposed to restructure the three-tier import duty slabs at 10 percent, 15 percent and 25 percent from 5 percent, 12 percent and 25 percent respectively for the fiscal year starting on July 1. In the outgoing budget, duty between zero and 5 percent was imposed on basic raw materials and capital machinery, 12 percent on intermediate goods and 25 percent on finished goods. The finance adviser Sunday said the government welcomed criticism of the budget. "We are taking opinions and must accept those that are real." Islam said nothing is beyond criticism. "Give me a budget of any country in the world, I'll criticise." The adviser strongly opposed that the budget was ambitious. He, rather, argued investment requires an ambitious budget and employment needs investment. Asked about Sheikh Hasina's remark on the budget, the adviser did not make any comment. Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday said the budget proposed for fiscal 2007-08 was illegal, as it was not presented in parliament by an elected government. bdnew
