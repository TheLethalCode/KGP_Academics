 TOKYO, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Nikkei average rose 0.47 percent on Monday with exporters such as Canon Inc up after a rise in shares in the United States, one of the biggest markets for Japanese goods. Investors also continue picking up shares in insurance firms such as Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co Ltd as rising yields on government bonds raised prospects of higher revenues, said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities. "Exporters are up following a gain in US stocks, but it's not just that, because in recent trade investors have been quick to buy on dips after taking profits," he said. "Investors are generally encouraged by solid corporate earnings outlooks and rising yields, which could indicate a healthy economy." The Nikkei finished the morning up 84.15 points at 17,863.24, and the broader TOPIX index added 0.59 percent to 1,766.50. Trade volume was moderate with 1.07 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. That compared with last week's morning average of 1.44 billion shares when the volume swelled especially on Friday when futures and options contracts were settled. Advancing shares outpaced decliners by a ratio of about two to one. The benchmark 10-year yield was up 1.5 basis points at 1.905 percent, though still down from the 10-month high of 1.920 percent hit the previous session. Loftier yields generally make bonds attractive relative to stocks and also lift long-term borrowing costs for companies, factors that could prompt stock investors to lock in some of the rally that has driven many Asian markets to record highs. Rakuten's Fukunaga said investors are closely watching overseas yields, but if their impact on stock markets turned out to be limited, Japanese stocks, laggards among global markets, could expect a correction. Among exporters, Canon added 1.1 precent to 7,170 yen and Honda Motor Co Ltd climbed 2.2 percent to 4,250 yen. Demand for insurance shares lifted Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance 4.7 percent to 1,718 yen. Sompo Japan Insurance Inc advanced 2.6 percent to 1,660 yen. Elsewhere, shares of Kenwood Corp climbed 2 percent to 206 yen after sources familiar with the matter said on Saturday that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd is in talks with Kenwood over the sale of its stake in JVC after a deal with US private equity firm Texas Pacific Group fell through. Shares of Matsushita rose 2.2 percent to 2,555 yen, while JVC tumbled 12.2 percent to 434 yen. Among the stocks that were sold, Sumitomo Metal Mining Co Ltd, Japan's major nickel and copper producer, lost 4.6 percent to 2,710 yen after nickel prices tumbled to their lowest levels since March. Elsewhere, Watami Co Ltd, a Japanese restaurant chain operator, surged 9.7 percent to 2,010 yen after it said it was considering buying the nursing home division of Goodwill Corp's Comsn unit. Goodwill, which operates staffing agencies, said on Friday it was open to selling its scandal-hit nursing care unit, a day after the government effectively nixed its plans to sell the unit to another group firm. Goodwill remained untraded due to a glut of sell orders. Shares of Tonichi Carlife dropped 15.7 percent to 167 yen after the Tokyo Stock Exchange said on Friday it had put the auto dealer on its supervisory post while considering whether it should be delisted
