 LONDON/SINGAPORE, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Monday, as dealers saw a buying opportunity after a sharp slide, with OPEC producers maintaining supply curbs and worries remaining over US summer gasoline supplies. London Brent crude, seen as currently more representative of the global market, rose nine cents to $68.69 a barrel at 0840 GMT, after falling by $2.62 on Friday amid a commodities sell-off on fears of slower economic growth. US crude rose 19 cents to $64.95 after a $2.17 drop. "It's a light correction after such a decline -- I'm not confident that the drop-off has been stopped," said Ken Hasegawa at Himiwari CX in Tokyo. "But the oil market is supported by fundamentals." Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia has told its Asian and European lifters it will keep supplies steady in July versus the month before at around 10 percent below full contracted volumes, showing no signs of attempting to soften oil prices by pumping extra barrels. Iran's Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh, said in Kuala Lumpur on Monday there is no shortage of crude in the market and OPEC has no plans to increase supplies, in the latest rebuff from the producers group to consumer nation calls for more oil. "Now there is no shortage of crude oil in the market," he said when asked if OPEC should release more supplies to the market to temper high oil prices. "The reason for the price hike is not because of crude supply problems." Worries over Iran's nuclear dispute with the West have been a driving factor for oil prices this year. But Vaziri-Hamaneh said the country's crude output is expected to rise to 5.3 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2014, up from 4.3 million bpd currently. Oil's Friday rout was part of a sell-off sparked by a strengthening dollar and fears of an economic downturn that could undermine demand, with copper falling 4 percent and gold 3 percent. Most Asian stock markets rebounded on Monday, after a sharp fall last week on worries over rising global interest rates. Prices had also been also pressured by news Oman's only oil terminal resumed operations on Friday after a three-day closure caused by Cyclone Gonu, and after US government data earlier in the week showed an unexpected increase in gasoline stockpiles
