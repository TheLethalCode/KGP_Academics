 VATICAN CITY, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush met Pope Benedict on Saturday and told the pontiff he believed the G8 summit in Germany had been a success. The Pope and Bush held talks for about 35 minutes in the pontiff's private study in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace to the backdrop of tight security in Rome for fear of violent anti-US demonstrations. "It's good to be with you sir," Bush told the Pope as he sat before the pontiff's desk. When the Pope mentioned Bush had just come from the summit of world powers in Heiligendamm, Bush said: "I did, your old country, and it was successful ... a lot of different opinions, but it was good." When the Pope asked Bush if his dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin had been good, Bush responded with a smile: "I'll tell you in a minute," referring to the reporters who were about to be ushered out of the room. Putin turned the tables on Bush at the Group of Eight summit in Germany this week by suggesting the United States use a Russian-controlled radar as part of an anti-missile shield protecting Europe, instead of US hardware. US plans to deploy interceptor missiles in Eastern Europe have infuriated Moscow, which says this could upset the global strategic balance and be used to attack or spy on Moscow. Bush and the 80-year-old pontiff see eye-to-eye on ethical issues such as abortion and euthanasia but are divided over the war in Iraq, which Benedict's predecessor, John Paul, tried hard to avert. Bush told an Italian newspaper on June 1 his intention was "mainly to listen" to the Pope. Bush also said he would be eager to discuss changes in China and the future of post-Castro Cuba if the Pope wanted. As Bush began a day of meetings with a visit to President Giorgio Napolitano -- an 81-year-old former Communist, in a country now ruled by a centre-left coalition critical of US foreign policy -- about 10,000 police secured central Rome against expected mass demonstrations. Leftists and pacifists opposed to the war in Iraq and to the expansion of a US military base in northern Italy took trains to Rome for protests that will echo those in Germany at the G8. Many who elected Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition, as well as some of Prodi's own members of parliament, may join the rallies -- which the organisers promised would be peaceful. "Bush is the biggest international terrorist. It's a disgrace the Italian government elected by the votes of pacifists should invite him to this country," said Elio Luppoli, arriving in Rome with about 70 protesters from Milan. Fears the protest might turn violent were highlighted by the cancellation of Bush's planned visit to Rome's colourful Trastevere quarter, where he was to have met leaders of the Sant'Egidio Roman Catholic community. One of Rome's oldest neighbourhoods, its narrow, cobbled alleys would have been difficult for the presidential motorcade. The Sant'Egidio group, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize because of its work brokering peace and fighting AIDS in Africa, was due instead meet Bush at the US embassy
