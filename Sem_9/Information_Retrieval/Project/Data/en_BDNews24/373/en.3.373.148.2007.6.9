<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 9 (bdnews24.com)  The European Union's Troika mission Saturday asked the government for an early end to a ban on indoor politics. The mission pledged support to the interim government and the Election Commission to hold elections in 2008. It, however, expressed concern about the human rights during the state of emergency and suggested formation of a National Human Rights Commission soon. The EU mission has also said the political parties will have to earn confidence of the people as they abused power in the past. "We suggested to the government that it should look at an early lifting of ban on indoor politics," Ambassador Andreas Michaelis, head of the EU Troika mission, told journalists at Hotel Sonargaon at the end of the four-day visit to Bangladesh. "The EU Troika has raised points of concern related to the human rights with the government. The EU emphasises that respect for human rights is of particular importance during the state of emergency. "It is vital that human rights violations are rigorously investigated and adequately punished." "They (political parties) really have to address the question of reform to regain the credibility that is necessary to convince the people to support them," Michaelis said. He said there was a lot of frustration and disappointment about the manner in which the political parties behaved in the past. On the proposed timeframe for the holding national elections, the Troika head said, "If the whole process is ready by mid-2008, if it is ready in September 2008 you should not wait and hold the election." Michaelis said the EU welcomed the Election Commission's commitment to announce by mid-July "a roadmap setting out the technical and political stages leading to parliamentary elections in 2008." He praised the government move to make the election commission independent financially and administratively. German Ambassador Frank Meyke, the Netherlands Ambassador CSM (Kees) Beemsterboer, EU Ambassador Dr Stefan Frowein, mission member Helen Campbell, among others, attended the press conference. bdn
