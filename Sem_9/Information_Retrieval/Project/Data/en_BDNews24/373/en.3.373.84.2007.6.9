 PARIS, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Voting in some French overseas territories began on Saturday in the first round of parliamentary elections which are expected to lead to a large majority for conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy. Voting started first in the two tiny islands of St Pierre and Miquelon, off the eastern coast of Canada, a day before polls open in mainland France at 8.00 am (O600 GMT). About 1 million French nationals living in overseas territories, and in the Americas and French Polynesia, are eligible to cast their ballots a day early. Sarkozy's UMP party is expected to retain its majority in the 577 seat National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, after the second round of the election on June 17. He easily beat the Socialist Segolene Royal in the May 6 presidential election and media say his party will ride a "blue wave" of conservative support to defeat rivals for the parliamentary seats, clearing the way for his planned reforms. A BVA poll last week gave the UMP 42 percent support against 28 percent for the Socialists, who have been in a state of disarray since Royal's presidential defeat. That would give the UMP 366-419 deputies, a larger majority than the 359 seats they currently hold, against 120-173 for the Socialists, who have 149 seats in parliament. Smaller groups like the Communists or Greens are expected to win just a handful of seats. The ballot is the third in less than two months but opposition parties have urged voters not to give way to election fatigue and make sure they turn out to vote and keep Sarkozy from having too big a majority. "React", said the front page on Saturday's left-leaning Liberation newspaper. In an editorial it said France must "resist a blue wave which threatens to wash everything away in political and parliamentary life". All candidates and parties were required to stop campaigning on Friday night. Sarkozy spent Saturday in Tours where he unveiled a series of measures aimed at helping the handicapped. Prime Minister Francois Fillon led the opening of a new high-speed train line that is part of a plan to improve links between western and eastern Europe. Eleven members of Sarkozy's newly-appointed government are running for parliament. They are all expected to win but Fillon has said they will have to leave the government if they lose. Alain Juppe, the environment minister, is facing the closest race in Bordeaux where Royal easily beat Sarkozy in a surprise result in the presidential election. Candidates can win a seat in the first round if they get over half of the votes cast by at least a quarter of registered voters. If no candidate meets these criteria a second round will be held on June 17. There are around 44.5 million registered voters in France who are called on to elect a new National Assembly every five years, unless it is dissolved earlier
