<TITLE> Le Pen put to the sword in French election </TITLE>

 PARIS, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's far-right National Front party, headed by veteran leader Jean Marie Le Pen, suffered a severe mauling in a parliamentary election on Sunday, but insisted it could survive the trauma. The party won just 4.3 percent of the first round vote, its worst showing since 1981, and only Le Pen's daughter, Marine, has any chance of winning a seat in the National Assembly lower house in next week's second round run off. "We have suffered a setback, we know it and we slightly expected it ... but the National Front is not dead," said Marine Le Pen, who is standing in a northern French constituency. She won 24.47 percent of the vote in the Pas-de-Calais region, coming second to a Socialist candidate who won 28.24 percent and who will be favourite to win the June 17 run-off. The blustery Jean Marie Le Pen stunned France by coming second in the 2002 presidential election, raising fears that Europe's third largest economy was lurching towards hard-right politics. But he failed to pull off a repeat performance in this year's presidential vote, trailing in fourth with 10.5 percent -- his worst showing in a presidential election since his first, disastrous campaign in 1974. Some National Front leaders were quick to blame newly-elected rightist President Nicolas Sarkozy for their defeat, saying he had hijacked many of their pet themes, including national identity and tough anti-immigration policies. "I ask activists and the party members not to give up hope because whatever happens, Nicolas Sarkozy will disappoint because he has not given himself the means to restore security in our country, to make immigration stop," said Marine Le Pen. But mainstream conservative opponents made clear they thought the National Front was facing a rout. "From this first round we can see straight off that as in the presidential election, there has been a strong pullback by the extremists," said Interior Minister Michele Alliot-Marie. Although the National Front has hardly ever won seats to parliament, party candidates have often undermined conservative hopefuls by splitting the right-wing vote. In 1997, the National Front won 15 percent of the vote and made it through to run offs in 75 constituencies -- a result which helped the left take power that year. In 2002 the party won 11 percent of the vote and made it into 37 run offs. With only his daughter through to a run off this time around, Le Pen blamed the slump in support on voter disenchantment with France's electoral system. "The French have understood that the legislative power is no longer in the National Assembly in Paris but in Brussels," he said, never missing an opportunity to attack the European Union. Le Pen, 78, has no plans to relinquish the party leadership, but he might be forced to give up his party headquarters. The presidential and parliamentary setbacks mean he will only get limited state financing to cover his campaign costs and might have to raise cash to balance his books. "We will adapt our real estate policy to the financial situation of our movement," he said last month
