<TITLE> Mahi abandons LDP post </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 11 (bdnews24.com)  Mahi B Chowdhury Monday abandoned his post on the Liberal Democratic Party as organising secretary and presidium member. For now, Mahi will be continuing with the LDP as primary member. He turned in the resignation letter to the party president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury citing several reasons, including LDP's failure to achieve targets. In the letter, Mahi admitted he was feeling embarrassed to talk about promoting democratic practices in the party as he himself had not democratically assumed the positions of presidium member and organising secretary of the national working committee. The LDP media cell chief Jahangir Alam signed a notification accompanied by Mahi's resignation letter to circulate the news of Mahi's leaving the party. The LDP was formed in October 26, 2006 in protest against the then mainstream political strains with a slogan of nurturing healthy political practices. Mahi played the crucial role in Bikalpadhara Bangladesh teaming up with the former BNP MPs and ministers including Oli Ahmed to float LDP. Mahi told bdnews24.com that he had given up the post on the LDP, as he "believed in democratisation and reforms of political parties". He said the position he was in was not elected. "I will hold any position party leaders and activists elect me to at the next council." "Staying in a nominated position and talking about democracy and reforms are conflicting," he said. "I hope other leaders will follow me." bdnews24.com/al
