 MANCHESTER, England, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Alastair Cook batted throughout the morning to help England reach 136 for two and stay in command against West Indies at lunch on day three of the third test at Old Trafford on Saturday. England, who in their first innings scored 370 and then bowled West Indies out for 229, led by 277 runs at the interval. Cook was 48 not out and Kevin Pietersen was unbeaten on 23. Cook and captain Michael Vaughan broke the 41-year-old second-wicket partnership record for England against West Indies at Old Trafford when they went past the 89 set by Colin Milburn and Ken Barrington. Their 98-run stand ended when Vaughan's push shot was brilliantly caught by Sammy off his own bowling. Otherwise some of the West Indies' fielding was disappointing. Cook was dropped on 42 when hard-working pace bowler Fidel Edwards surprised the left-hander with a quick bouncer and his attempted hook shot should have been caught by fine leg fielder Corey Collymore. However, Edwards's fellow Barbadian did not even get a hand on the ball and he slid on his knees and watched in embarrassment as it bounced to the boundary. Three overs later, Jerome Taylor allowed a shot from Pietersen, which should have prevented even one run, to pass through his legs and through to the boundary for four. His straightforward stop the next ball brought an ironic cheer from spectators in the sell-out crowd. England lead 1-0 in the four-match series
