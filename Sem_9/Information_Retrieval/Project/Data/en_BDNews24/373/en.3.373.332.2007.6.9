 GAZA, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gaza militants launched a surprise attack on a border crossing with Israel on Saturday, firing rocket-propelled grenades as they rammed a jeep into the crossing and infiltrated several gunmen past the border post, militants said. (update) The Israeli army confirmed a gun battle near the Kissufim crossing and said four to five militants had entered Israeli territory near the border. An army spokesman said there were no reports of missing soldiers or injuries on the Israeli side. Militants said they identified hitting several Israeli soldiers and that one was being held captive by an infiltrator inside Israeli territory. Militant groups said some of their fighters were unaccounted for. "There was an infiltration (by Gaza militants) into Israeli territory in the area of the Kissufim crossing," an army spokesman said, adding that the army believed it had pinpointed their location. Local residents said they saw unmanned aircraft and helicopters hovering over the area and gunfire could be heard. The daytime attack on the crossing came as Israeli ground forces entered southern Gaza and exchanged fire with Palestinian militants there, injuring at least one of them. Israel stepped up its military operations in Gaza last month in response to a surge in cross-border rocket attacks against Israeli towns. In the Kissufim attack, militants riding in a jeep marked with UN insignia crashed into the crossing itself, according to Abu Ali, a spokesman for a unit of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, which took part. The militants then jumped out of the jeep and opened fire on the Israeli soldiers guarding the crossing. Some of the militants withdrew but others remained at the scene of the attack. "The attack comes as a natural reaction to the Zionist crimes and assassinations against fighters in Gaza and the West Bank," Abu Ali said. The attack was carried out jointly by Islamic Jihad, the Popular Resistance Committees and the unit of al-Aqsa, an offshoot of President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction. In southern Gaza, at least one Hamas gunmen was wounded in an exchange of fire with Israeli troops who entered at least two small neighbourhoods on the outskirts of Rafah. Local residents said the troops, backed by tanks, conducted house to house searches and questioned men between the ages of 18 and 40. "Gunmen fired at the forces and the forces identified hitting one of the gunmen," an Israeli army spokesman said of the clash near Rafah. The army spokesman added that several residents were taken into custody for questioning
