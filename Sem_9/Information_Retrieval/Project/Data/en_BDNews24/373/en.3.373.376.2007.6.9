"In case of an American attack against Iran, the interests of this country around the world and in the region will be endangered," Mohammad Baqer Zolghadr, a deputy Interior Minister for security affairs, was quoted as saying. "Today, all American bases in the region are within the reach of our medium-range weapons," said Zolghadr, former deputy commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards. "Today, if the slightest disorder in the region's security and in the security of the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf is created, oil prices will reach $250 a barrel and this will lead to the death of European countries and America in terms of economy and security," he added. Worries about any supply disruption from the world's fourth biggest oil exporter, Iran, have been one of the factors helping to prop up oil prices. US crude is now around $65 a barrel. "Maybe the start of an evil act (could) be in America's hand but its continuation and end won't be (in its hands)," he said.
