 GUWAHATI, India, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A round-the-clock curfew has been imposed on a northeastern Indian town after deadly clashes between two tribal groups, police said on Sunday. Eleven people have been killed in Moreh in Manipur state near the border with Myanmar, resulting in the closure of the area's only border road link. Trouble started on Saturday after local residents recovered the bodies of five Kuki tribespeople with bullet wounds. Angry Kukis attacked the local police station, where the bodies were kept, and razed several houses belonging to the rival Meitie ethnic group. Later in the evening, police recovered the bodies of six Meitie fishermen. The dominant Kukis do not support a separatist campaign by the Meities in the restive landlocked state. They accused the Meities of crossing over to Moreh from Myanmar to kill five of their tribesmen. "The situation is very tense and the army has intensified patrols to stop further violence," a local police officer said. Indian intelligence officials say around 3,000 insurgents, live and train in camps inside the jungles of Myanmar, and often cross over to fight their separatist battle in Manipur.
