 ISLAMABAD, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan announced a 9 percent increase in its defence spending on Saturday to 275 billion rupees ($4.53 billion) for the 2007/08 fiscal year beginning in July. The proposed spending compares with 252 billion rupees spent on defence in this fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and amounts to about 3 percent of gross domestic product. "Impregnable defence is indispensable for a nation which wants to live with honour and dignity," Minister of State for Finance Omar Ayub Khan said in his budget speech to parliament. "Pakistan is a nuclear power. If any one looks at us with bad motive, we will respond with full force." Pakistan has fought three wars with arch rival India since their independence from British rule in 1947, and they nearly went to war a fourth time in 2002. But relations have improved since they launched a peace process in 2004. Despite the thaw in ties, the nuclear-armed South Asian rivals have continued to focus on their military build-up. In February, India raised its defence spending 7.8 percent to nearly $22 billion for 2007/08. Khan said peace could only be achieved by making defences invincible. The planned defence spending is in addition to military aid Pakistan is getting from the United States for its role as a front-line state in the war against terrorism. In the past six years, Pakistan has received an estimated $10 billion of assistance from Washington, much of it in the form of military aid. In October, Pakistan and the United States agreed on a multi-billion dollar package to supply the Pakistani air force with 18 new F-16 aircraft. The deal also covers supply of an unspecified number of upgraded, second-hand F-16s. The budget announced on Saturday has to be approved by parliament. The government is unlikely to face any obstacle as it holds a simple majority needed for the bill's passage
