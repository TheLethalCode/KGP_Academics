<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com) -- The government will finalise its coal policy by July and private organisations producing power will also be given permission to use national gridline, power and energy adviser Tapan Chowdhury said Sunday. "Now is the time for decision," Chowdhury said in his address to a roundtable on "National Energy Policy". "The coal policy is to be finalised by July. It will later be incorporated into a national energy policy. The policy is being made giving highest priority to people's interests." Chowdhury also stressed the importance of involving local entrepreneurs in the power sector. "If private entrepreneurs establish big power plants they will be given the opportunity to use the national grid." This was an unprecedented opportunity, he said, adding that most complexities are in power distribution. The roundtable was organised at the CIRDAP auditorium by "Energy and Power" magazine on the occasion of its fifth founding anniversary. Speaking of the urgent need for designing a policy on coal, energy and mineral resources secretary AMM Nasir Uddin said: "We are facing problems signing deals with companies as we don't have a specific coal policy." Former energy secretary Toufique Elahi Chowdhury said the policy must be formulated in such way that future decisions can be implemented. "It should be made as a guideline rather than a document." Chowdhury Quamaruzzaman, associate professor of the geology and mining department of Rajshahi University, said if the open pit method was applied to Bara Pukuria, 90 percent of coal deposits could be extracted and turned into daily output of 2200 megawatt. Prof Ijaz Hossain, who teaches chemical engineering at BUET, assured that Bangladesh's gas resources would not be exhausted by 2015. "But instead of sitting idle we must continue exploration," he said. Khulna Power Company chairman Aziz Khan said that most of gas must be supplied to fertiliser factories. Chief geologist for Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission Dr Yunus Akon presented the keynote paper. bdnews24.c
