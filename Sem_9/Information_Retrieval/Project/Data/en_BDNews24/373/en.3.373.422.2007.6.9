 Naogaon, June 9 (bdnews24.com) - Rail communication on the Ishwardi to Parbatipur line was suspended after a freight train derailed near Atrai rail station at 10.30 pm Friday. Limited communication for passengers was restored with two relief trains. Rail officials could not say when the relief operation would end. With direct rail communication suspended, passengers were stranded at different stations including Shantahar, Ahsanganj, Panchbibi, Joypurhat, Akkelpur, Shahgola, Natore and Tilokpur. Station master of Shantahar railway junction, Dalim Hossain, said on Saturday that the derailed compartments have not been salvaged yet. He added that although attempts to recover the derailed engine and fire compartment had started, they were being hampered by heavy rain. bdnews2
