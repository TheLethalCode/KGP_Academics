 BEIJING, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Corruption investigators have detained the board chairman of China's largest airport operator in connection with using company funds to buy shares in a media investment company, Chinese financial magazine Caijing reported. Li Peiying, board chairman of state-owned Capital Airports Holding Co, had been held since Sunday in relation to buying stocks in Huawen Media Investment Corp, Caijing said in a report posted on its Web site, citing unnamed sources. Under Li, Capital Airports acquired shares in Shenzhen-listed Huawen Media "at a critical juncture" when the media company's parent Huawen Investment Holdings Co was in financial difficulty following the detention of one of its vice presidents in November, Caijing reported. It said Li had been "close" to Wang Zheng, chairman of New Huangpu Real Estate Co, and a vice president at Huawen Investment, who was detained as part of corruption investigations into the more than 3-billion yuan misuse of Shanghai's social security fund. The scandal, described as the city's largest since economic reforms began in the 1980s, has netted more than a dozen Shanghai government and company officials, including Communist Party chief, Chen Liangyu. Li's brother and two other vice presidents at Huawen Investment were also under investigation, Caijing said, without providing details. Capital Airports employees contacted by Reuters on Saturday could not confirm the report. Calls placed to Huawen Media offices went unanswered. Capital Airports has registered capital of 5 billion yuan ($653 million) and is the parent of Hong Kong-listed Beijing Capital International Airport Co, whose 3 billion yuan investment in a new terminal and runway is one of Beijing's key Olympic projects for the 2008 Games. Capital Airports has stakes in eight other airports across China, and handles about 30 percent of the country's flight passengers, according to its Web site
