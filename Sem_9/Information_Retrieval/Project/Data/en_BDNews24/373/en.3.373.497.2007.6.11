 GAZA, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rival Palestinian factions fought their most intense battles in weeks on Sunday in the Gaza Strip, raising the weekend toll to five dead and 53 wounded. Among the victims was a pro-Hamas Islamic cleric pulled from his home and shot several times in the street after a guard from the rival Fatah movement was shot and thrown to his death from a high building in Gaza City, officials said. Witnesses said masked gunmen from both Islamist Hamas and secular Fatah streamed onto the streets, setting up roadblocks and barriers to stop cars and check identification papers and pulling rival supporters from vehicles and houses. Main roads were paralysed by the fighting, and shops and businesses closed early. The latest round of fighting, the worst since an Egyptian-brokered truce was declared in mid-May, began on Saturday night in the town of Rafah, where hundreds of rival gunmen took up positions on street corners and rooftops. Hamas and Fatah pounded each other with rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns in Rafah, said witnesses who took shelter indoors as the rivals fought block by block. Three men from Fatah and two from Hamas were killed in all, including the cleric of a main mosque in Gaza City, and a member of President Mahmoud Abbas's elite Force 17, hospital officials said. The officials said another Hamas man died of wounds from a shooting last week, while a total of 53 people were wounded in Sunday's fighting. Hamas accused Fatah of executing the cleric, a shooting that followed the killing of the guard, which Fatah blamed on Hamas. Fighting was also reported in a central Gaza refugee camp, where Hamas and Fatah accused each other of abducting at least one member of each group, sparking a gun battle that wounded four more people, hospital officials said. As the factional violence spread, Israeli aircraft bombed a Gaza building used by Islamic Jihad, wounding two people, after gunmen from the group infiltrated into Israel at a key border crossing on Saturday using an armoured vehicle marked "TV". Israeli soldiers killed one of the gunmen who infiltrated, and several others fled back into Gaza. In a statement, the Palestinian journalists' union criticised militants for placing a "TV" insignia on the vehicle they used to approach Gaza's border with Israel. Militants' use of media markings, the union said, could turn journalists who use armoured vehicles in the Gaza Strip into targets for Israeli attack. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said militants had tried to "take advantage of the special sensitivity that we have in a democratic country, such as ours, to the right of the media to operate freely and independently in security-sensitive areas". Tension has remained high in Gaza since the killings of 50 Palestinians in internal fighting last month, followed by a surge in Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel and Israeli air strikes on militants. Hamas said the fighting started on Saturday night when Fatah gunmen shot dead a local Hamas commander in Rafah. Fatah said the fighting began when Hamas used rocket-propelled grenades and explosives to destroy the homes of two Fatah militants. The once-dominant Fatah formed a unity government in March with Hamas to try to end faction fighting and ease international sanctions imposed after Hamas rose to power a year earlier. An estimated 616 Palestinians have been killed in factional fighting since Hamas's 2006 electoral victory, a leading Palestinian rights group said in a report on Wednesday
