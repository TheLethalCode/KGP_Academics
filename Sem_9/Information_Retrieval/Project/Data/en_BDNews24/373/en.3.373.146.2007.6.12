 Dhaka, June 12 (bdnews24.com)Nine education boards Tuesday published the results of SSC and equivalent exams with the pass percentage of 58.36. This year 10,24,537 students took SSC and equivalent exams and 5,97,955 students passed the hurdle. The pass percentage has edged down about 4 percent from last year. However, the number of GPA-5 achievers rose to 32,646 this year from last year's 30,490. The examinees could know results from their examination centres and schools. Results were also available online and some cellphone operators provide the results through SMS. Dhaka recorded the rate of successful examinees at 60.81 percent, Rajshahi at 59.18 percent, Jessore 60.87 percent, Comilla 46.83 percent, Barisal 50.67 percent, Chittagong 57.94 percent and Sylhet 47.27 percent. The pass percentage under the Madrasa Education Board was 65.87 while SSC vocational examinees recorded the pass rate at 51.08 percent. In Dhaka Board, a total of 9,439 students or 4.12 percent of successful examinees bagged GPA-5. In Rajshahi Board, 6,910 students got GPA-5. It is 3.28 percent of the total students who passed. In Jessore Board, 2,329 examinees, or 1.99 percent of the successful students, scored GPA-5. Comilla Board is lagging behind in terms of scoring GPA-5: 2,387 students, or 2.66 percent of the successful examinees, got GPA-5. In Chittagong Board, 3,313 students bagged GPA-5, which means 5.35 percent of the total passed students. In Barisal Board, 641 examinees got GPA-5. It is 1.25 percent of the total students overcoming the race. In Sylhet Board, 713 students or 2.21 percent of the total, got GPA-5. Viqarunnissa Noon School and College that falls under Dhaka Board topped the list of GPA-5 earners across the country. A total of 564 examinees from this school scored GPA-5 this year. Students of Motijheel Ideal School and College got 527, Mirpur Monipuri High School 314, Rajuk Uttara Model School and College 281, Motijheel Government Model High School 259, Dhaka Residential Model College 178, Government Laboratory High School 172, Motijheel Govt Boys' High School 171, Dhanmondi Government Boys High School 149, Holy Cross Girls' High School 149 and AK High School in Demra got 131 GPA-5s. This year all students of 774 educational institutions who participated in the SSC and equivalent exams from seven general education boards, madrassa and technical education boards came out successful. On the other hand, not a single candidate could cross the hurdle from 248 institutions this year. On the decrease of pass percentage, additional secretary of the education ministry AKM Abdul Awal held last year's teachers' movement and months of political unrest responsible. "The teachers' movement for 100 percent salary and allowance and volatile political situation affected the preparation of the students. Maybe this is the cause. The ministry will look into matter," Awal said at a press conference at Dhaka Education Board office. At the press conference, education ministry officials said this time the pass percentage has slightly dropped from the last-year figure. The number of schools from where 100 percent students passed decreased while the number of institutions with zero pass-percentage has increased this year. The education ministry would review the cases of the institutions, they said. The government will suspend its allocation for salary and allowance for institutions with zero pass percentage. bdnews24.com/ehb-
