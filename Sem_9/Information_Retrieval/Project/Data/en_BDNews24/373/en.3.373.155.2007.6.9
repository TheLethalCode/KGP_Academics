 BRUSSELS, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Belgian businessman rejected a Nigerian job applicant because the businessman said his own dog was racist and would bite non-whites, Belgian media reported on Saturday. The 53-year-old man Nigerian told De Standaard newspaper he arrived at the Belgian's wrought-iron business and was immediately confronted by the barking dog. The Belgian turned the man away before he could even enter, and wrote on his labour office letter that he could not hire the man because of his colour, adding there was a risk the dog would bite him. The local labour office has concluded that the Belgian was racist and has removed him from its list of potential employers. "My dog is racist. Not me," the Belgian told De Standaard. The Nigerian, who has lived in Belgium for 32 years, said it was not the first time he had been rejected for a job because of his colour, although other employers had been more subtle. He told the newspaper that he did not wish to lodge a formal complaint because he did not wish his family in Nigeria to hear about the case
