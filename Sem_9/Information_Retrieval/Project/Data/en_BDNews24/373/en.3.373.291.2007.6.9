 BAGHDAD, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iraq's Foreign Ministry on Saturday accused Turkey of 'intensively shelling' northern Iraq this week, adding it had handed the Turkish envoy in Baghdad a protest letter.

A ministry spokesman said the shelling took place over three hours late on Wednesday and early Thursday. "This attack caused wide fires and huge damage in the area and made citizens fearful," the Foreign Ministry statement said, without precisely identifying the damage. Financial markets were rattled by a report late on Wednesday that Turkey had launched a major incursion across the border into northern Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels. Turkey denied the report but a military source said troops had conducted a limited raid, a rare incursion into northern Iraq where 4,000 rebels of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) are said to be hiding. Iraq's Foreign Ministry called for talks between the two governments.
