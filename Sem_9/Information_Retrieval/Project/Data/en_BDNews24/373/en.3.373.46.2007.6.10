I would simply move them to the United States and put them into our federal legal system," Powell told NBC's Meet the Press. "Essentially, we have shaken the belief the world had in America's justice system by keeping a place like Guantanamo open and creating things like the military commission. We don't need it and it is causing us far more damage than any good we get for it," he added. The United States is holding about 380 foreign terrorism suspects at Guantanamo. Rights groups and foreign governments have called for the prison to be closed, saying holding prisoners there for years without trial violated legal standards. But Washington says the prison is legal and necessary to hold dangerous individuals.

"It's a more equitable way, and more understandable in constitutional terms," he add
