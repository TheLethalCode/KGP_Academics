<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 10 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League is watching the demonstration of an electoral roll with photographs that began in Sreepur of Gazipur district, the party chief said Sunday. Sheikh Hasina told reporters that her party was monitoring the process of preparing the roll. She made the comment, as she was returning home after visiting Saifuddin Ahmed, a friend of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Hasina reached Saifuddin's home in Fakirerpool at 11.30am and stayed there for more than an hour. A voter list with photographs was one of the main demands of the Awami League and its allies during several months of tumultuous politics last year over electoral reforms. But the then four-party coalition refused to meet the demand for what the Awami League said was to rig the forestalled Jan 22 polls. bdnews
