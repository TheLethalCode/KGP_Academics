 ISLAMABAD, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan has exempted private equity funds from tax until 2014 in order to speed up investment, Minister of State for Finance Omar Ayub Khan told the National Assembly in a budget speech. "In order to speed up investment in this area, private equity funds have been made tax exempt until 2014," Khan said. "In case assets or shares of private companies are sold to private equity and venture capital funds, the rate of capital gains tax has been reduced from 35 percent to 10 percent," he said. Khan also announced tax concessions for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) -- a tool which enables investors to reap profits from investments in real estate. "The profit of REITs will be exempt from taxation up to 90 percent upon distribution," he said. "The most important tax concession for REITs is that under this scheme, sellers of property will be exempt from tax up to 2010." Analysts said the steps were positive, and would ultimately help in the development of capital markets. "The tax exemption for sellers of property is a major one, as it was one hindrance in the development of REITs," said Asif Qureshi, head of research at brokers Invisor Securities. "The incentives for private equity funds are also encouraging, as development of such funds will lead to development of capital markets," he said
