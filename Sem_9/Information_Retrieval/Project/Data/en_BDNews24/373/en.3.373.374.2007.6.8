 PARIS, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A European investigator says he has proof Poland and Romania hosted secret CIA prisons under a post-9/11 pact to hunt down and interrogate "high value" terrorist suspects wanted by the United States. Swiss senator Dick Marty said Poland housed some of the CIA's most sensitive prisoners, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who says he masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that killed almost 3,000 people. "There is now enough evidence to state that secret detention facilities run by the CIA did exist in Europe from 2003-2005, in particular in Poland and Romania," Marty says in a report for the Council of Europe human rights watchdog. Marty accused the former Polish president and the current and former presidents of Romania of having known and approved of the secret CIA operations on their soil. European Union members Poland and Romania have repeatedly denied the existence of secret prisons on their territory. In a preliminary report last year Marty said 20 mostly European countries colluded in a "global spider's web" of secret CIA jails and flight transfers of terrorist suspects stretching from Asia to Guantanamo Bay. Marty said Germany and Italy had used "state secrecy" to obstruct investigations and his report could embarrass European governments, which have criticised the detention without trial of suspects at Guantanamo Bay. Reacting to Marty's report, the European Commission called on Romania and Poland to hold urgent, independent investigations into the allegations and ensure any victims were compensated. Commission spokesman Friso Roscam Abbing told a daily news briefing the European Union executive was "very concerned indeed" about the report, which was the culmination of a 19-month investigation. According to the report, Poland's then-president Aleksander Kwasniewski, head of National Security Bureau Marek Siwiec, Defence Minister Jerzy Szmajdzinski and head of military intelligence Marek Dukaczewski were aware of and could be held accountable for the operation of CIA secret prisons in Poland. "Marty's work is pure political fiction...It is a waste of time and a waste of money," Szmajdzinski told Reuters. Former Romanian president Ion Iliescu, current President Traian Basescu and former defence Minster Ioan Mircea Pascu were among those who "knew about, authorised and stand accountable" for Romania's role in the CIA programme, Marty said. "The current report, as the previous one from 2006, brings no evidence to confirm these allegations, except for unnamed sources, whose credibility cannot be estimated," the Romanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. "Poland maintains its position...There were no secret centres in Poland," a foreign ministry spokesman said in Warsaw. The facilities were "run directly and exclusively by the CIA" and European governments connived with the secret transfers and detentions, known as extraordinary renditions, Marty said. U.S. President George W. Bush confirmed last September the CIA had run secret detention centres abroad where terrorism suspects had been interrogated, but he named no country. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano said he had not yet seen the report. "Europe has been the source of grossly inaccurate allegations about the CIA and counter-terrorism," he said. "And people should remember that Europeans have benefited from the agency's bold, lawful work to disrupt terrorist plots." The report said U.S. intelligence contacts and other sources confirmed Poland and Romania "did host secret detention centres under a special CIA programme established by the American administration in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 to 'kill, capture and detain' terrorist suspects deemed of 'high value'". Interrogation techniques used on suspects were "tantamount to torture" said the report. Marty told the Le Figaro daily that Washington had waged a war against terrorism without rules, handing suspects to "rogue states like Syria" to avoid the constraints of U.S. law. As Marty's report was issued, 26 Americans, almost all of them suspected CIA agents, went in trial in absentia in Italy, accused of kidnapping a Muslim man in Milan in 2003 and flying him to Egypt as part of Washington's extraordinary rendition poli
