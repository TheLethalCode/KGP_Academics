 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US Treasury yields rose in Europe on Monday in follow-through trading from Asia where investors sold paper to cut losses and remained wary of a further market sell-off. US Treasuries rose on Friday on bargain-hunting and short-covering after a week of selling pressure on fading expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts and worries about global monetary tightening. Investors in Asia such as Japanese banks took the gains as an opportunity to sell to get out of positions and limit losses as the sell-offs over the past week had been very sharp. Ten-year T-Note yields raced up nearly 30 basis points during the past week, with the 10-year T-Note scaling 5.25 percent on Friday -- on a par with the Federal funds rate. Benchmark yields had stayed below 5.25 percent since the Fed finished lifting rates in June last year. "We are slap bang in the middle of the range 5.0 percent to 5.25 percent now and likely to stay there for now," said a trader in London. "We have a 10-year T-Note auction on Tuesday but yields might stay around current levels, after mortgage-backed sellers on Thursday dried up and afforded us something of a rally on Friday." At 1000 GMT, September 10-year futures were flat at 105-6/32 after striking an 11-month low of 104-20/32 last week. Benchmark 10-year notes yielded 5.13 percent, 2.5 basis points up since the New York close on Friday when the 10-year yield peaked near the 2006 high of 5.255 percent. Two-year notes were yielding 5.009 percent, up 0.4 basis points from late US trade. Traders said investors bought Treasuries on Friday believing the Fed would not boost interest rates from current levels. While the market does not currently factor in a rate hike later in the year, traders said they would continue to scrutinize data for clues on the future direction of US monetary policy. The break in 10-year yields above 5.0 percent last week triggered a wave of selling in Treasuries and similar positions in interest rate swaps, paying fixed rates, as mortgage portfolio managers were forced to cut back on duration. A spike in yields causes the estimated life of a mortgage-backed security to lengthen as homeowners are less likely to refinance, prompting holders to dump Treasuries and pay fixed rates in swaps to keep their portfolios in balance. Views that rising price pressures are persuading central banks around the world to raise interest rates and changing expectations that the Fed would cut interest rates later this year have driven global bond yields higher. US inflation of around 3 percent since 2005 was too high for comfort in the longer term, Cleveland Federal Reserve President Sandra Pianalto said on Monday in the text of a speech released in advance. For near-term market direction, market players will watch data due later this week including retail sales, consumer price index and industrial output. "We think that retail sales on Wednesday are likely to be firm but that core consumption, ex-gasoline, will be more modest," said Harvinder Sian, a bond strategist at ABN AMRO in London. "The greater danger could be from strong consumer prices on Friday," he added. Ten-year US Treasuries yielded 58 basis points more than German debt
