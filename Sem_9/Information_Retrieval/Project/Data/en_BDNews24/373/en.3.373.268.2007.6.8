 LONDON, June 8 (bdnews24.com/The Guardian/Reuters) -- The head of Britain's Serious Fraud Office Friday took responsibility for the decision to withhold information from an international anti-corruption organisation about the existence of 1 billion ($2 billion) worth of payments to a Saudi prince, news reports said. The arms company, BAE Systems, secretly paid Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia the money in connection with Britain's biggest ever weapons contract, it was alleged. A series of payments from the British firm was allegedly channelled through a US bank in Washington to an account controlled by one of the most colourful members of the Saudi ruling clan, who spent 20 years as their ambassador in the US. It is claimed that payments of 30m were paid to Prince Bandar every quarter for at least 10 year It is alleged by insider legal sources that the money was paid to Prince Bandar with the knowledge and authorisation of Ministry of Defence officials under the Blair government and its predecessors. For more than 20 years, ministers have claimed they knew nothing of secret commissions, which were outlawed by Britain in 2002. In a statement, the SFO director, Robert Wardle, said the decision was made by his own organisation "having regard to the need to protect national security". The attorney general, Lord Goldsmith, who superintends the SFO, has denied a report in the Guardian that he himself ordered the information to be withheld from the anti-bribery panel of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It has been disclosed that 1bn worth of payments to accounts controlled by Prince Bandar in Washington were made as part of the 43bn al-Yamamah arms deal, under which BAE supplied a fleet of Tornado aircraft to Saudi Arabia over a period of 20 years. The money was transferred by BAE, with UK government approval, from Bank of England accounts in quarterly payments of 30m a time to Riggs Bank accounts in Washington. Prince Bandar was serving as ambassador to the US at the time. The allegations of payments to Prince Bandar is bound to ignite fresh controversy over the original deal and the aborted SFO investigation. The Saudi diplomat is known to have played a key role in setting up Britain's biggest ever series of weapons deals. For more than 20 years Al-Yamamah, Arabic for "dove", has involved the sale of 120 Tornado aircraft, Hawk warplanes and other military equipment. Up to 2bn a year was deposited in the accounts as part of a complex arrangement allowing Saudi oil to be sold in return for shipments of Tornado aircraft and other arms. The Guardian investigation has revealed that: The attorney general became aware of these payments because of the SFO inquiry into BAE corruption allegations. He recognised the vulnerability of the government to accusations of complicity over a long period in the secret payments. There is no dispute that, as reported by the Guardian, the fact of the payments was concealed from the OECD when they demanded explanations for the dropping of the SFO inquiry.  UK government officials have been exposed as seeking to undermine the OECD process, and have complained that its Swiss chairman has been too outspoken. ATTORNEY GENERAL Lord Goldsmith told Friday morning's BBC Radio 4 Today programme: "It is absolutely untrue that I ordered investigators to conceal payments from the OECD. This is what the Guardian alleged. It is categorically denied." Lord Goldsmith, however, refused to discuss the allegations concerning the payments - including claims that they continued after Labour came to power in 1997. "I am not going into the detail of any of the individual allegations," he said. "The reason is, as the Ministry of Defence has made clear and they are the responsible department, that they regard the United Kingdom as bound by confidentiality provisions. It is not for me to break those." The Guardian asked the attorney general's office Friday whether Lord Goldsmith had knowledge at the time of the SFO's decision to withhold information. His spokesman did not answer the question, saying: "Treasury solicitors were instructed last night: the matter is now in their hands." Reuters reports: BAE denied any wrongdoing in response to media reports that it paid 1 billion pounds over a decade to a Saudi prince in connection with Britain's biggest-ever arms export contract. "The Al Yamamah programme is a government-to-government agreement and all such payments made under those agreements were made with the express approval of both the Saudi and the UK governments," BAE said in a statement. Solicitors acting for Bandar said he was considering legal action. "This is an extremely serious allegation against a senior member of the Saudi government and one which Prince Bandar categorically denies," they said in a joint statement. "The accounts at Riggs Bank were in the name of the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Defence and Aviation. Any payments into those accounts made by BAE were pursuant to the Al-Yamamah contracts and as such would not in any way have been 'secret' from the parties to those contracts. "Whilst Prince Bandar was an authorised signatory on the accounts, any monies paid out of those accounts were exclusively for purposes approved by MODA," the statement added. In December 2006 Britain's Serious Fraud Office dropped an inquiry into the Saudi deal, for which BAE has been the prime contractor, providing Tornado fighter jets, Hawk trainer aircraft and other defence equipment along with support and maintenance services. Prime Minister Tony Blair said at the time that pursuing the inquiry would have harmed national security and relations with Saudi Arabia, which he called crucial for counter-terrorism and Middle East peace. Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement Thursday: "The MoD is unable to comment on these allegations since to do so would involve disclosing confidential information about Al Yamamah and that would cause the damage that ending the investigation was designed to prevent." BAE said: "We deny all allegations of wrongdoing in relation to this important and strategic programme." The company added that it would abide by confidentiality obligations imposed by the agreement. "All the information regarding the Al Yamamah contract in our possession has been made available to the Serious Fraud Office over the last two and a half years and, after an exhaustive investigation, it was concluded, over and above the interests of national security, that there was and is no case to answer," BAE said. The company said there was nothing in the latest media reports that changed that position. Blair later on Thursday said: "This investigation, if it had gone ahead, would have involved the most serious allegations and investigation being made of the Saudi royal family and my job is to give advice as to whether that is a sensible thing in circumstances where I don't believe the investigation would have led to anywhere except to the complete wreckage of a vital strategic relationship to our country." He told reporters at the G8 conference in Germany that the fight against terrorism would have been harmed and, "we would have lost thousands, thousands of British jobs". The Guardian and Reuters contributed to the report.
