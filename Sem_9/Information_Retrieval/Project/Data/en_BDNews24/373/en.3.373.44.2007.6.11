<TITLE> JVC shares dive on Kenwood talks with Matsushita </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Shares of JVC dived to a five-year low on news that Kenwood Corp has resumed talks with Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd to buy a stake in JVC, after a deal with private equity firm Texas Pacific Group fell through. Shares of JVC, the loss-making electronics maker whose official name is Victor Co of Japan Ltd., fell as much as 14 percent to 426 yen as the likely deal would involve it issuing new shares to Kenwood, diluting the value of existing JVC stock. Talks with Texas Pacific fell apart after the private equity firm said it wanted JVC to sell off its music production business, and asked Matsushita to continue investing in JVC to bolster JVC's credit, sources close to the deal told Reuters. But analysts were skeptical that Kenwood, which posted a 74 percent drop in net profit in the business year ended March due to falling audio equipment prices, would be any more successful than Matsushita to help struggling JVC battle price competition. "Kenwood now looks like the Japanese white knight to save JVC from foreign-style demands to make quick returns, but I don't see strategic growth from the Kenwood-JVC partnership," said Yoshihisa Toyosaki, president of IT consulting firm J-Star Global, Inc. Kenwood's strength is in car audios and navigation, a very specialized market, and it does not have the expertise to succeed where Matsushita failed in marketing JVC's consumer audio goods, he said. Kenwood, which was originally one of the companies interested in JVC before the bidding had been narrowed down to Texas Pacific, is in talks to buy 20 billion yen ($165 million) worth of new shares from JVC and then merge with JVC under a holding company, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. Matsushita would then sell part of its 52.4 percent stake in JVC to the holding company. Matsushita is aiming to get loss-making JVC off its consolidated accounts, but would likely hold on to some of its shares, the sources said. "JVC really needs the additional 20 billion yen," wrote Nikko Citigroup analyst Kota Ezawa in a note to investors, noting that the cash-strapped firm faces bond redemptions of 10 billion yen and loan repayments for 4.5 billion yen within the year. Shares of Kenwood were up 2.0 percent at 206 yen, after jumping as much as 10 percent to 222 yen. Shares in JVC were down 10.7 percent at 441 yen, while Matsushita's stock rose 2.2 percent to 2,555 yen. The benchmark Nikkei average was up 0.32 percent. Kenwood spokesman Takaaki Nose said on Saturday it still sees a merger with JVC as an attractive option to survive tough competition in the electronics industry, but he would not comment on whether it was once again talking with JVC. JVC, Kenwood and Matsushita all issued statements saying nothing had been decided. Kenwood, which had 16.9 billion yen in cash and deposits and 6.8 billion yen in net debt at the end of March, has already secured a 70 billion yen credit line from its banks for the deal. Sparx Asset Management Co, an investment firm that holds Kenwood shares, may also participate in the deal, according to sources. Sources familiar with the matter had told Reuters earlier last week that TPG's bid for JVC was struggling to win backing from lenders, putting the roughly $550 million deal in jeopardy and possibly opening the door for other suitors. Banks had resisted funding the acquisition of JVC because they were unconvinced that Texas Pacific could turn around a company heading for its fourth straight annual loss. Matsushita also turned sour on the deal with Texas Pacific because the American firm lowered its offer price after JVC's earnings announcement in April, when its operating loss turned out to be larger than previously forecast, sources told Reuters. Yokohama-based JVC said on May 30 it expects a net loss of 10.5 billion yen for the business year to March 2008, hit by 16 billion yen in restructuring cost
