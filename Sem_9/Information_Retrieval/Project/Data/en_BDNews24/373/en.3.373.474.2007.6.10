<TEXT>
 TIRANA, June 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - President George W Bush arrived in Albania on Sunday for the first visit by a US leader to the Balkan republic, once a byword for hardline communist isolationism but now a staunch ally of America. A warm welcome was assured for Bush, and no protests were expected contrary to his sometimes hostile reception in Germany and Italy. Bush was expected to reassure Prime Minister Sali Berisha that his country's NATO membership aspirations are close to fulfillment, and that Washington's support for the independence of Albanians in the neighboring Serbian province of Kosovo is undiminished despite Russia's strong opposition.
