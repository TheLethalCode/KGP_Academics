 Gazipur, June 10 (bdnews24.com) Students of the Islamic University of Technology Sunday blocked traffic on the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway for an hour after a police official allegedly beat a fellow student. The incident later sparked altercations between the students and the security officials in the district's Board Bazar area. Witnesses said an umbrella was at the heart of contention. They said Abu Bakar, a student of the university from Niger, was beaten up at 12:30pm, as he sought help from an on-duty policeman to recover his umbrella that went missing at Dhaka Bank's local branch. Bakar went to the bank to draw money at about 12.15pm. On his way out, he found his umbrella missing. He then sought help of an on-duty policeman to recover the umbrella, as incessant rain battered the country Sunday. The officer refused to make any effort, saying it was none of his business. Bakar was not happy with the reply and ran into a quarrel with him. The officer bent his muscles to give Bakar a lesson. As information flew fast to the campus, Bakar's friends made their way to the troubled spot and exchanged heated words with the officer. IUT registrar Ahsan Habib described the chaos as a result of "misunderstanding". "The officer did not understand the student," Habib told reporters. A senior police official also did not find anything serious into it. "The student thought the policeman was a security guard of the bank," Gazipur's additional superintendent of police Saifullah Al Mamun told reporters. The disruption, however, prompted RAB and army officials to rush to the scene to take everything under control. The officers finally made the students understand that the responsible officer would not be spared. bdn
