<TITLE> Private equity set to fight threats to UK tax breaks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Private equity firms will begin a battle on Tuesday to defend lucrative tax breaks which are under threat at a series of Treasury meetings that publicly kick off the British government's inquiry into the buyout industry. It was nine years ago that finance minister Gordon Brown, to encourage business growth, introduced the idea of a 10 percent capital gains tax instead of the regular 40 percent income tax rate for investors that sold a company after owning it for at least 10 years. By 2000, the lower rate would apply to businesses owned for four years, and two years later it was just two years. Brown, now the prime minister in waiting, last week promised the union delegates most critical of private equity "justice and equality in all the tax treatment of this area." Much of the industry remains opposed to any change in the tax regime, but some insiders have joined the chorus questioning the justification for it. "Any common sense person would say that a highly paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady or other low-paid workers ... can't be right," said Nicholas Ferguson, the chairman of SVG Capital, the largest investor in buyout firm Permira. The Treasury Committee is investigating more than just taxation. It is looking broadly at how private equity is regulated, whether it discloses enough, the extent of leverage used and its effect on the economy, too. The first meeting is Tuesday with the private equity trade group the British Venture Capital Association, the umbrella worker group Trades Union Congress and several academics who have studied the industry all due to appear. Meetings scheduled for June 20 and July 3 will hear from the firms themselves, including Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., along with union represenatives and the Financial Services Authority. The financial regulator said on Monday it was beefing up oversight of leveraged buyouts because it sees a risk of too much borrowing in the deals leading to credit defaults. Private equity firms, which are forecast to raise nearly $500 billion globally this year after creating $430 billion of funds last year, have come under increased scrutiny as they borrow more to buy ever-bigger companies, many of them household names. The proposed 11.1 billion pound ($21.84 billion) sale of pharmacy chain owner Alliance Boots to KKR, for example, would be the largest leveraged buyout in European history and the first of a FTSE 100 company. Unions have accused private equity executives of using financial engineering to enrich themselves while cutting jobs at the companies they buy and depleting their pension funds. The firms claim they have a track record of investing in businesses and creating jobs. Studies on the subjects show conflicting eviden
