<TITLE> Turkey's Motherland Party quits July election race </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ANKARA, June 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Turkey's small centre-right Motherland Party (ANAP) said on Friday it would not contest a July 22 parliamentary election, in a move that analysts said might help the ruling AK Party government. The decision follows last weekend's collapse of a planned merger between ANAP and the rival centre-right True Path Party (DYP), which has now been renamed the Democrat Party (DP). "We decided to give our support to the Democrat Party in the election," senior ANAP official Suleyman Saribas told reporters. Political analysts say the divisions and recriminations dogging the two secular-minded parties could boost Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, which is also on the centre-right but has an Islamist past. The DP has a chance of crossing Turkey's 10 percent threshold to enter parliament, but its image as a competent, decisive party may have suffered because of the prolonged and ultimately abortive talks with ANAP, analysts said. "(This failed union) must have affected their supporters at the grass-roots level, especially party workers on whom they rely at election time," said William Hale of Istanbul's Sabanci University, a veteran observer of Turkish politics. Some ANAP supporters may instead decide to support Erdogan's AK Party or possibly other parties, he said. ANAP's pledge of support for DP may still produce enough votes to carry DP over the 10 percent threshold, he added. The two parties had tried to merge because they believed this would boost their chances of getting into parliament. Saribas said DP may still field candidates from ANAP, but analysts said this was unlikely to help. "We still believe the chance of seeing ANAP and DP in the next parliament is diminished significantly after the first failure of the merger," said Ozgur Altug, chief economist at Raymond James Securities. Erdogan's pro-business AK Party is widely expected to remain the largest party in the new parliament but its ability to form a government alone hinges on the size of its majority and on how many other parties can enter parliament. If the DP passes the 10 percent threshold this would increase the chances of AK having to forge a coalition, possibly with the DP, which is ideologically closest to Erdogan's party. Investors fear a coalition government could lead to slower reforms and to greater political and economic instabili
