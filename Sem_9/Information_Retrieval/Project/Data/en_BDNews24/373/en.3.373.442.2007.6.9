 ROME, June 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US President George W Bush's limousine briefly stalled during a ride to the American embassy in Rome and then could not squeeze through its gates, prompting him to get out, wave to the crowd and enter on foot. Bush was on his way to meet a religious group at the US embassy during his one-day visit to Italy when his car troubles began, stopping the entire motorcade for about five minutes.

Bush's back-up limousine was pressed into service for his next ride to the Italian prime minister's office nearby.
