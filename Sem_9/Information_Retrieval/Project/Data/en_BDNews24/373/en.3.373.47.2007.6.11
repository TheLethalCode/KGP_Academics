<TITLE> UK's next PM makes fact-finding visit to Iraq </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BAGHDAD, June 11 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's next prime minister, Gordon Brown, arrived in Iraq on Monday for what he called a fact-finding trip as he weighs Britain's future involvement in a four-year-old war that is hugely unpopular among Britons. It is his first visit since being confirmed as the successor to Tony Blair, whose popularity at home waned over his steadfast support for the US led war. Brown said he wanted to "listen and learn" before taking office on June 27. "I'm here to ... see what's happening with al Qaeda ... in relation to Iran ... to the sectarian conflicts, to see all the people on the ground and make an assessment of what's happening so I'm better informed," Brown, Britain's finance minister, told reporters travelling with him. Brown has said he wants to suggest new ideas but has ruled out an immediate pullout of British troops. That has not stopped the British media speculating he may speed up the withdrawal to assuage public anger. He has always accepted responsibility for the cabinet decision to invade Iraq but has also said mistakes were made in the aftermath of the invasion. On a farewell visit to Iraq last month Blair said he had no regrets about his part in the war. Brown's visit comes as the size of the British force in Iraq is being reduced by about 1,500 soldiers to 5,500 troops. Brown, who was accompanied by Defence Minister Des Browne, was due to hold talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and President Jalal Talabani, the top British general in Iraq, US commander General David Petraeus and the US ambassador. Brown said in his talks with Maliki he planned to discuss national reconciliation between Iraq's warring sides. "On political reconciliation I want to know how they are going to move forward ... and if I don't have suggestions from them I will put suggestions to them," he said. Thousands of US and Iraqi troops have been deployed in Baghdad, epicentre of sectarian violence, to crack down on Shi'ite and Sunni Arab militants and buy time for Maliki's government to reach political compromises to form a real powersharing government with minority Sunni Arabs and Kurds. Washington is demanding movement in key areas, such as revenue-sharing oil law, provincial elections and constitutional reforms. But analysts say the Shi'ite-led coalition government is weak and divided and incapable of meeting these benchmarks without external pressure. Nearly 30,000 extra U.S. troops have been sent to Iraq for the crackdown as British troops in the more stable Shi'ite south have begun reducing their numbers. But U.S. officials say they are confident Brown will not pull British troops out early. British forces have handed over security responsibility to Iraqis in three of the four provinces they were in. The remaining southern province of Basra is due to be transferred in the coming months. Brown has said he will reduce troop numbers as and when possible, but aides say he is unlikely to make any big sudden shifts in policy as the British military is already planning further cutbacks. Brown, who has repeatedly stressed that economic regeneration is vital to end the violence, said he would also talk to Maliki about the economy. With no letup in sight in the violence, unemployment and inflation are surging and infrastructure crumbling. "They are not short of money to be allocated to infrastructure, the problem is the actual spending of it," said Brown, who guided Britain through an uninterrupted 10 years of economic growth. Insurgents are attacking Iraq's infrastructure in their campaign against US forces and the Iraqi government, hitting bridges, oil pipelines and other key installations. A suicide car bomb attack on a bridge overpass south of Baghdad late on Sunday killed three US soldiers and wounded six more, a US military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Ra
