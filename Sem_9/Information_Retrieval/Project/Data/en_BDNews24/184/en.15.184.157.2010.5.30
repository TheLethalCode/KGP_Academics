<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 30 (bdnews24.com)A senior BNP leader has alleged that prime minister Sheikh Hasina breached the electoral code by holding a meeting with her ruling Awami League party's Chittagong leaders ahead of the June 17 city corporation election. At a meeting on Sunday in Chittagong, BNP's standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy claimed that the holding of such a meeting "after the declaration of election schedules is a breach of electoral codes." Hasina on May 27 held a meeting at Ganabhaban, her official residence, where she asked the city's party leaders to work for the AL-backed mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury keeping aside past disputes. Mohiuddin has submitted his nomination papers under the banner of the Nagorik Committee. Threatening the Election Commission and the government, Goyeshwar said, "If there is any wrongdoing in the election, the movement to topple the government will be launched from June 17. "Things will then be clear what the BNP can and cannot do," he added. Goyeshwar said, "We have to save this election from the Awami League's 'digital rigging'." Claiming Mohiuddin as an egoistic person, he said, "Mohiuddin thinks that there is no alternative to him as the Chittagong mayor." He also said that Mohiuddin would sell the Chittagong port if he was re-elected. Opposition BNP-backed candidate M Manzur Alam was also present at the meeting organised to mark the death anniversary of BNP's founder and former president Ziaur Rahman. Regarding the party's support for Manzur, the central leader said the BNP supported Manzur Alam considering the "wellbeing of Chittagong." Goyeshwar asked Chittagong voters to elect Manzur forgetting party identity. City's south unit president Zafrul Islam Chowdhury, city BNP president and Manzur's chief election agent Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury were amongst other speakers at the meeting. bdnew
