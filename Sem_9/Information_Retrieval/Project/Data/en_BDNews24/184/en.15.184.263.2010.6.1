<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--A new list of private educational institutions for the monthly payment order, popularly known as MPO, was published on Monday. Prime minister's advisor on education, social development and political affairs Alauddin Ahmed handed over the new list of 1,483 institutions to education minister Nurul Islam Nahid on Monday. The first list, prepared by the minister, was published on May 7 incorporating 1,022 institutions. But the list was criticised later at a cabinet meeting on May 10. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina was also unhappy with the list. Hasina then asked her education advisor to scrutinise and finalise the MPO list. She also asked for a fresh list incorporating institutions recommended by the MPs. Media reports suggest that the minister had some disagreements with the adviser over the MPO selection. After handing over the list, the advisor on Monday told reporters: "The minister, if he feels necessary, can change and revise the list at any time." He said the new institutions were included considering geographic locations and those lagging behind. The advisor also suggested paying two months' salary to the teachers, which the minister said would be effective from January. When asked about the cancellation of vocational institutions, Alauddin said, "Most of these are fakes. They do not even have infrastructural facilities. "Moreover, locals, MPs, and ministers complained against these institutions. The decision on cancelling those MPOs was made after the allegations were proved true," he added. The advisor also said there would be no problem with the budget funding after the increase in number of the institutions. "There is already an allocation of Tk 112 crore in the budget. If needed, more will be asked from the finance minister." bdnew
