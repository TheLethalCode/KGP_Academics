 Dhaka, Jun1 (bdnews24.com)  Food minister Md Abdur Razzaque has said that the government may take up the Rohingya issue at international forums if it lingered indefinitely. "We are trying to resolve the issue bilaterally, but we won't hesitate to move the international bodies," Razzaque said on Tuesday. "We have done a lot for the Rohingyas over the years. But we can hardly afford it for an indefinite period," he said. The minister made these statements at a discussion on Rohingya crisis in Bangladesh at the National Press Club. The Centre for Education, Research and Advocacy (CERA), a Dhaka-based research and advocacy group, organised the discussion to highlight various aspects of the long-drawn crisis. Less than 28,000 Rohingya Muslims live in two official camps run by the food ministry and UNHCR at Teknaf and Ukhia in Cox's Bazar. But unofficially, there are 200,000 others, and according to some, not less than 400,000, who are not recognised by Bangladesh as refugees. The documented Rohingya people get housing, food and healthcare facilities in the official camps but the undocumented ones do not. Thousands now live illegally in squatters near the official camps, and many hope to become registered some day. The food minister said that the government would be willing to register the rest. But indicating persecution and torture in Myanmar, the minister said there was an apprehension of further influx of refugees from across the border. "It won't be wise if it attracts more people from Myanmar," he said. The food minister also warned international NGOs and said they should be careful before making false and fabricated reports on 'maltreatment' of Rohingyas. This presumably came as a reply to recent campaigns by some groups claiming a crackdown on Rohingyas. The minister argued that Bangladesh has done a lot since the 1970s when the Rohingya issue emerged. Muhammad Zamir, former ambassador and chief information commissioner, who attended the occasion as special guest came down hard on the UNHCR for not making enough efforts inside Myanmar to prevent Rohingyas from crossing over to Bangladesh. He strongly insisted on a more active role of UNHCR and international organisations. He said camps for Rohingyas could be set up by UNHCR inside Myanmar territory and not in Bangladesh. He said the UNHCR should take the issue to the UNGA since Myanmar is a member state of the UN. 'A more effective and meaningful border control mechanism should be enforced so that Rohingyas are stopped from crossing over. Although it is a question of human rights, many countries have enforced a limit to the entrance of refugees," Zamir said. He said a more comprehensive registration system with pictures and bar codes could be introduced to ascertain the exact number of state of the refugees. Abu Murshed Chowdhury, a human rights activist from Cox's Bazar, said a huge presence of Rohingya people in Cox's Bazar and other parts of the Chittagong Hill Tract are putting extreme pressure on the resources. Representatives from some international agencies like Muslim Aid, UNHCR, International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the US Embassy also attended the occas
