 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)--A Dhaka court has rejected former BNP state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar's bail petition in two cases over a grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Aug 21, 2004. The attack on Bangabandhu Avenue killed at least 23 people and left scores injured, including the then opposition leader Sheikh Hasina, now prime minister. Judge Mohammad Ismail Hossain of Dhaka Metropolitan Session Judges' Court passed the order on Tuesday. Babar was earlier refused bail in the same cases on May 5. Jainal Abedin Mesbah, who argued Babar's case at Tuesday hearing, told bdnews24.com that they would appeal the order at the High Court. Babar needed bail for treatment abroad, as he was ill with backbone, eye and heart complications, the court heard. His doctors suggested that Babar, now under treatment at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University hospital, should go abroad for better treatment. Currently serving 17 years in jail following his conviction in an arms case, Babar was shown 'arrested' in the grenade attack case filed on Oct 26, 2009. The Criminal Investigation Department later remanded him for 12 days. He was also shown 'arrested' in the former Awami League finance minister Shah AMA Kibria murder case filed on Feb 2, 2010. Babar was previously remanded for 12 days, over two phases on Feb 11 and on Mar 14, in connection with the murder. Babar is also facing charges of concealing income of around Tk 8.6 crore in the 1999-2000 and 2008-2009 tax years and not paying his tax as a director of Master Electronics Industry Limited. bdn
