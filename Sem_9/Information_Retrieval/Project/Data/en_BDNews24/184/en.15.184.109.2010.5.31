<TEXT>
 London, May 31 (bdnews24.com/AFP) --Steven Finn took five wickets on his home debut as England beat Bangladesh by a convincing eight-wicket margin in the first Test at Lord's here on Monday to go 1-0 up in this two-match series. Bangladesh, following-on, were bowled out for 382 shortly before lunch on the final day with Middlesex fast bowler Finn taking five wickets for 87 runs in 24 overs. That gave the 6ft 7in paceman, who played his first two Tests during England's 2-0 series win in Bangladesh in March, match figures of nine for 187. England, set 160 to win in two sessions, finished on 163 for two. Andrew Strauss, the England captain, in his first international match for several months after resting from the tour of Bangladesh and missing the World Twenty20 triumph, as he no longer plays that form of the game, made 82 before he was out with England 13 runs short of victory. Jonathan Trott, whose Test-best 226 was the centrepiece of England's first innings, was unbeaten on 36 after ending the match with a boundary. Kevin Pietersen was 10 not out. Strauss, like Finn playing on his home ground, square cut the first ball of England's chase, from Shahadat Hossain for four, to spark several boundaries in quick succession. He was missed at slip against Mahmudullah's on 28 but the off-spinner did take a wicket when Alastair Cook, England's other left-handed opener, was lbw for 23. Strauss went onto complete a run-a-ball fifty with five fours before he was caught behind, by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim, cutting against the spin of opposing captain Shakib Al Hasan, to end a second wicket stand of 80. Victory gave England their seventh win in as many Tests against Bangladesh and left the Tigers with just three wins from 67 matches at this level. But, compared to the corresponding Test between the two sides at Lord's five years ago, which England won by an innings and 261 runs, there was no denying Bangladesh's progress. Earlier, Finn took three wickets for eight runs in 15 balls on Monday to secure his place on the Lord's honours boards. Bangladesh began the last day on 328 for five having seen Tamim Iqbal make 103 off just 100 balls on Sunday. Junaid Siddique, 66 not out overnight, and Shakib, unbeaten on two, took guard under cloudy skies favouring England's seam attack. England did not have long to wait for a sixth wicket with Shakib cutting Finn straight to the bowler's county colleague Eoin Morgan at point. Siddique had, like Tamim, made a first innings fifty. But there was to be no second innings hundred. The left-hander drove too soon at a clever Finn slower ball and was caught at mid-off by Tim Bresnan for 74 to end nearly four-and-a-quarter hours of resistance. Bangladesh's collapse continued when Mushfiqur was caught behind off Finn for nought. Finn, after a spell of three wickets for 21 runs in eight overs, was replaced by Bresnan. And the Yorkshire paceman wrapped up the innings by dismissing Rubel Hossain and Mahmudullah with the aid of catches by Strauss, at first slip, and wicketkeeper Matt Prior respectively. Bresnan finished with three for 93 from 26.2 overs. Bangladesh were bowled out for 282 in their first innings, senior paceman James Anderson leading the attack with four for 78 in the absence of the rested Stuart Broad. England's first innings saw Shahadat beat Tamim to a place on the honours boards with five wickets for 98 runs. The second and final Test of this series starts at Old Trafford on Fr
