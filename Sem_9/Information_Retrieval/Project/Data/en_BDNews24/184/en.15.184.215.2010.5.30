 Dhaka, May 30(bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami is trying for prime ministerial intervention over the public rally scheduled for May 31 at Paltan ground, a senior party leader said on Sunday Police on Saturday banned rallies and processions on the venue as Jamaat and pro-government Jubo League called for rallies at the same venue at the same time. The opposition party's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed told a press conference at Mogbazar headquarters in on Sunday efforts were on to contact the prime minister. Mojaheed demanded postponement of Jubo League's programme and withdrawal of restriction on rallies and procession. He alleged the authorities had given them permission to hold the rally on May 31, but Jubo League called for a rally just a day before their programme is to take place at the government's directive. Mojaheed termed the ban unconstitutional and undemocratic and warned that they would be forced to launch any programme if they were pushed into the path of confrontation. Nayebe ameer Mokbul Ahmed, senior leader Delwar Hossain Sayedee and other central leaders were present at the press conference. bdn
