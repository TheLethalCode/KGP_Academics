 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)--In a blow to private recruiting agencies, the government has announced it will now train and send abroad women to work as housemaids. Speaking to the executive committee of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) at Dhaka's Hotel Sheraton on Sunday, overseas employment minister Khandakar Mosharraf Hossain also said the government would soon be providing training to 1500 women. In the past, private recruiting agencies were involved in sending women to work abroad as housemaids, but this practice was stopped after allegations that many women were badly treated. The Association had been hoping that the government would remove the ban. However, the minister told the meeting, "The government is not going to allow agencies to export housemaids abroad any more." He said this was because many Bangladeshi female workers, who were recruited by private agencies, suffered torture and distress abroad. Mosharraf claimed that housemaid torture had reduced as result of the government stopping recruitment through private agencies. "The employers are also happy that they are now getting trained workers," he added. "There are increases in torture and harassment whenever housemaids are sent abroad through private agencies." The minister said that a list of the 1500 maids selected to be trained would be posted on the ministry's website. Mosharraf also asked for BAIRA's support in creating new markets. "In the past, the government had created new markets and BAIRA had worked to destroy them as fast as possible," he said. "It is BAIRA's responsibility to create and maintain new markets." The minister asked BAIRA to provide an estimate of the minimum cost for sending a worker abroad. "It could not provide this figure for a year, however the importers are not willing to recruit workers at the current high costs." The minister also announced that a two-day international conference will be held from Oct 19 in Dhaka to widen the international market for Bangladeshi migrant workers. Minister-level representatives from 40 countries involved in human resource exports and imports will attend the conference. At the meeting, BAIRA president Abul Bashar continued to argue that agencies should be allowed to export house maids. He also asked that recruiting agencies be allowed to continue to operate even when investigations into their conduct was taking place He demanded that the government cancel the minimum requirement to send at least 300 workers a year and permit the transfer of a licence to a successor when the licensee dies. He also asked for the inclusion of representatives of BAIRA in the management committee of the expatriate welfare bank. Expatriates welfare secretary Jafar Ahmed Khan and the general manager of Bangladesh Manpower Employment and Training bureau (BMET) Khorshed Alam Chowdhury also spoke at the meeting. bdnews2
