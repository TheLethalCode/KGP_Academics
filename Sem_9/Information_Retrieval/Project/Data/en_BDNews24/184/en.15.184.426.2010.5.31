 MADRID, May 31 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Jose Mourinho said he hoped to sprinkle some of his magic over Real Madrid when he was unveiled as the Spanish giants' new coach on Monday. The Portuguese joins Real on a four-year deal in the wake of leading Inter Milan to an historic treble of successes in Italy's Serie A championship, the Italian Cup and Champions League. Mourinho, who replaces Manuel Pellegrini after the Chilean failed to bring league or Champions League success to the club, said however he would not change his combative approach to the game. Mourinho said: "I don't know if I was born to coach Real Madrid but I was born to be a football coach. I love important challenges. "I am Jose Mourinho and I don't change. I arrive with all my qualities and my defects. "My attraction to Real Madrid is due to its history, its frustrations in recent years and its expectations to win. "It's a unique club and I believe that not to coach Real leaves a void in a coach's career. "Luckily, I've had a beautiful career and it makes me proud to have come here. I am very enthusiastic.

Mourinho made his name when he led FC Porto to the Champions League title in 2004.

"I am a coach that has a lot of self-esteem and confidence and I don't think about the possibility of being sacked," he added. "I think four years of contract is enough to win, to build a strong team for the present and the future. "I have a lot of confidence in my players, I have the hope that my new players have confidence in me." Mourinho said little about what changes, if any, he would bring to the squad, placing his focus on the need to forge a winning identity throughout the club. "It's too early to speak about changes," he added. "I believe it's time to analyse the situation, to get to know my club, ask lots of questions and get answers. "The most important thing is not the coach or the players but the club. "If we work as a group, it's not difficult to get results. I want this group to have an identity, to win everything. "The strength of my team is always the team and not the individu
