<TITLE> Minister against legal steps over MPO </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid has requested authorities of the non-government institutions having no place in the just published MPO (monthly pay order) list not to go to court challenging the government decision. "Every institution will be brought under MPO. So they should not file any lawsuit. It (lawsuit) will hamper the institutions included in the MPO list," he said on Wednesday answering a reporter's query at his Secretariat office. Asked if any institution goes to court disregarding his request, the minister said: "In such case, the government has to accept whatever verdict the court delivers." The government on Monday published the revised MPO list, which included 1,483 non-government secondary and higher secondary educational institutions. Teachers and employees of many institutions failing to secure place in the list started protests at different places of the country. Nahid said: "After announcement of the budget (for the new fiscal year), we'll try how we can fast bring rest of the institutions under MPO." He felt sorry for the institutions securing place in the first list but excluded from the revised one. The revised list was prepared under the supervision of prime minister's advisor Alauddin Ahmed, as the first one, prepared under the education minister's guidance and published on May 7 this year, including 1,022 institutions, drew flak of many. "I've the authority to re-evaluate the list finalised by the prime minister's advisor." "But it's not always right to exercise authority one has. Because it doesn't look good," Nahid said. He added: "With the list the advisor has sent a letter, in which he recommended cancellation of the population-based MPO policy. But he himself didn't follow it when preparing the list." The prime minister in the May 10 cabinet meeting asked her advisor and the minister to prepare a fresh list after further scrutiny following criticism of the first one. To a question on the new education policy, Nahid said a monitoring committee would be constituted to assist its implementation. He, however, did not mention timeframe for committee formation. Asked how long it will take to expand primary education up to class VIII, he said it would be implemented through a pilot project. "Brainstorming over this is on." He, however, advised the students not be scared of the new policy though more exams would be held under it. "We'll make exams pleasing rather than scaring." He said pro-opposition educationists and politicians, including Dhaka University's former vice-chancellor Moniruzzaman Miah and former education minister M Osman Faruk, praised the new policy. b
