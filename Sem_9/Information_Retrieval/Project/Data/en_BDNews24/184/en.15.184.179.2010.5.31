 Natore, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- A clash during contractor selection lottery of Local Government Engineering Department at Natore on Sunday left at least 10 injured. Police charged the warring contractors at Natore LGED office with baton to disperse them. Police and witnesses said the lottery for picking the contractor for a road construction work worth Tk 75 lakh was set to be held at 11:30am. The lottery started with 10 out of the 13 contractors, who submitted tenders, present. After the lottery concluded peacefully, a few pro-government Juba League-backed contractors arrived at the scene and demanded that the lottery be held again. Clashes erupted following a heated exchange between the Juba league-backed and Chhatra League-backed contractors. They chased each other and threw brickbats for quite a while. LGED's executive engineer Lokman Hossain said, "The lottery was held with majority of the contractors present. The result will be declared later." However, he declined to make any comments about the clash. Injured Hira, Belal and Shahin were admitted to Natore Modern Sadar Hospital. The others including Afzal were released after primary treatment. District Juba League general secretary Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com, "The injured Belal is a member of the municipality's Kanaikhali ward Juba League while Hira is the member of Lalbazar ward unit. "They are both contractors originally. The lottery was demanded to be held again as they were absent in the first one." He also claimed that the clash was not political. Sadar police chief Al Mamun said, "The contractors got involved in violence. We charged baton and bought the situation under control. We will take legal steps against miscreants if we get complaints." bdn
