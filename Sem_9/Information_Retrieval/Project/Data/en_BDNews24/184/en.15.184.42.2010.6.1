<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Bengali-language daily Amar Desh publisher Hashmat Ali has been released after six hours in detention since Tuesday morning, the family says. He returned to his Shahjahanpur residence around 3pm, the family told bdnews24.com. But Hashmat went out after a while and had yet to return. A family member preferring anonymity said: "We are in danger. Please do not reveal our names." Some four members of an intelligence agency whisked Hashmat away around 9am, the family had earlier said. The pro-opposition newspaper's acting editor Mahmudur Rahman claimed at around 1pm that National Security Intelligence took Hashmat and were forcibly trying to file a case against him. No NSI officials nor the police admitted the detention. NSI director Shafiqullah told bdnews24.com earlier that they had not detained anybody by that name. "He is probably sitting at home." "This is reminiscent of June 16, 1975 when all but four newspapers were banned," Mahmudur said of Ali's detention. "Coincidentally, this is June again." "I have heard that he is being coerced into bringing charges against me," he told bdnews24.com. "Is this what they have learnt from the MoeenUddins, the perpetrators of 1/11?" "I guess they will try to file a case against me," he said. Mahmudur said he would make everything known at a news conference at the newspaper's office at 5pm. Mahmudur took over the management of the newspaper in 2008. Later he sent a letter to the deputy commissioner for serving as editor of the newspaper. Since then he has been the acting editor of the newspaper. bdne
