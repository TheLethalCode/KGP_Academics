 KABUL, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan insurgents are being trained inside Iran and given weapons to fight security forces, the commander of US and NATO forces said on Sunday, joining a rising drumbeat of criticism of Iran's role in the country. General Stanley McChrystal said coalition forces were working to stop Iran from giving material help to the Taliban who have stepped up the campaign to force foreign forces out of Afghanistan in a nine-year conflict.

"There is however clear evidence of Iranian activity, in some cases of providing weapons and training to the Taliban that is inappropriate," he said. Iran backed the Northern Alliance in the war against the Sunni Muslim Taliban in the 1990s, but security analysts said Tehran's intelligence services could be helping elements in the Taliban as a tool against the United Sta
