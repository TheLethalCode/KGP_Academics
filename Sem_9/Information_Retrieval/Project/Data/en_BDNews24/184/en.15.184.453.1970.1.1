 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain has taken a swipe at the government for its 'two-faced stance' on withdrawing political cases. He said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had been cleared of all charges against her and that about 6,000 cases against ruling party members were also withdrawn. However, none of the cases against opposition BNP chief) Khaleda Zia was withdrawn. "This is partiality and injustice," he said at a meeting on Monday marking the 29th death anniversary of founding president Ziaur Rahman which fell the day before. His reaction comes in the wake of the High Court cancelling the last of the 15 corruption cases against Hasina, also ruling Awami League president, on Sunday. Delwar slammed the government for what he said was its naked interference with the functioning of the judiciary. "She (Hasina) was the main initiator of the NIKO agreement. However, she was released while the case is still pending against Khaleda." "This means 'everything is alright for me' (Hasina) and every case against Khaleda will continue. And that is the government's manifestation of justice," Delwar said. He warned the government saying, "You will not get away with it." Delwar termed the government's policy regarding withdrawal of political cases as a 'game of digital magic'. He repeated his party's allegation that the Election Commission was working for the government, being a 'slave' and an 'opportunist'. "The people are not supporting their one-eyed stance," he added. Delwar said the people who were working against the national interest had put this government in power to wipe Zia's name off. "They are carrying out a negative campaign against his family. But it will not work," he said. BNP standing committee member MK Anwar, labour wing Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal's general secretary Jafrul Hasan, among others, spoke in the meeting.
