 Munshiganj, May 29 (bdnews24.com)  Evidently alluding to the excesses of its student and youth wings, a top leader of the ruling Awami League has cautioned his party again. The 'associate bodies'  as the Juba League and the Bangladesh Chhatra League are called  continue to worry the mother party, which has been reflected in the statements of Awami League's top leaders almost since the party came to power early 2009. On Saturday the Awami League general secretary also regarded as its spokesman, Syed Ashraful Islam, said that the Awami League will have to pay for its youth and student cadres' activities. He told a ceremony at Srinagar upazila in Munshiganj, "The Awami League will have to pay for the mistakes of Chhatra League and Juba League." "The mistakes of Chhatra League and Juba League are responsibilities of party men, and we must accept the liabilities," he says. Syed Ashraf was laying the foundation stone of a museum at the sub-district. bdn
