 Dhaka, May 29 (bdnews24.com)Two workers and a security guard were injured by extortionists at Senpara Parbata in the city on Saturday. The three, including two with gunshot wounds, were admitted to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Md Ujjal Hossain, 20, who was admitted to the hospital with a leg wound, told journalists that he worked as a construction assistant at a project of the Suncity Developer Limited at 465 Senpara Parbata. He said that he was shot in the leg by four miscreants, who came to the site looking for the contractor around 7.30am. Finding the contractor missing, they tried to enter the construction site. They shot Ujjal and struck another construction worker, Md Manzur, with a sharp weapon when the two tried to prevent them from entering the construction area. Earlier, at around 7am, a group of miscreants shot Md Abdul Wahab, a security guard of Spiel Garments Limited at 58/1 Senpara Parbata. He told journalists at the hospital that the extortionists threatened to come again if they were not paid. Kafrul police chief Md Delwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that they suspect that one group was responsible for both incidents. Hossain said that the real estate developer's authorities had earlier informed the police that extortionists demanded Tk 5 lakh from them. The gang also demanded tolls from another developer. "We have arrested a man for questioning," said the police official. Two cases have been filed. bdnews
