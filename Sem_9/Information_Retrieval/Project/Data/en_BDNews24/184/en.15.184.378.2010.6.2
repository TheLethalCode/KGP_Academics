 Bagerhat, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  At least 16 people were killed and 30 others injured as a bus and truck collided head-on on the Khulna-Mawa highway in Bagerhat early on Wednesday. The accident occurred at around 4:30am when a Mongla-bound bus of Meghna Paribahan coming from Dhaka and a mango laden truck crashed head-on, Mollarhat police chief Masud Alam told reporters. It is feared that the death toll might rise as all the passengers trapped inside the bus could not be rescued until 8:30am, he said. Police, fire fighters and local people were still carrying on rescue operation, Alam said. Among the dead, only one could be identified as Mozaffar, 32, of Foila Daldha village under Rampal Upazila in Bagerhat.
