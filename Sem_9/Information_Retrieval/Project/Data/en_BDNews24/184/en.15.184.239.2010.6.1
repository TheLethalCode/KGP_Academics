 GUATEMALA CITY, June 1 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  The death toll from a violent weekend storm that lashed Central America neared 150 Tuesday, and more fatalities were feared as rescuers reached villages cut off by floods and mudslides. Guatemala's President Alvaro Colom told a news conference that 123 people were now confirmed killed and another 90 missing in his country as a result of Tropical Storm Agatha, which dumped heavy rains before dissipating in the country's highlands. "I want to make clear that those are provisional numbers because new information continues to come in," he said. "There are many villages that still have not been able to report their tragedies." Earlier, the Red Cross disaster response unit in Panama City had reported 118 dead in Guatemala, 17 in Honduras and nine in El Salvador. "Most of the fatalities were due to landslides that collapsed building and peoples' homes," Paco Maldonado, the unit's chief, told AFP. Among the dead in Guatemala were four children in a house that was swept away in a landslide, officials here said. Tens of thousands of people were in shelters, either because their ramshackle homes had been destroyed or they were evacuated from the path of possible flooding. International aid was beginning to step up. Some aid organizers were turning to Facebook, Twitter and other Internet social networking sites to appeal for necessities to send to populations or authorities. France said Monday it was sending humanitarian supplies, and issued a statement expressing its condolences to the affected countries. Colom said six US military aircraft had been deployed from a base in Honduras. Mexican President Felipe Calderon, at Colom's behest, offered the airport in the border city of Tapachula for emergency flights in and out of Guatemala, Calderon's office said. In Guatemala, which has been under a state of emergency since Saturday, 155,000 people were forced to flee their homes at peril of floods and mudslides. Of those about, 50,000 were in shelters, officials said. The worst storm-related disaster in Guatemala occurred in a village in Solola department where a landslide swept away 25 homes killing 15 people, with another 10 missing, according to San Antonio Palopo Mayor Andres Cumes. To prevent an outbreak of disease, bodies will be buried at once, Cumes told reporters. Honduras and El Salvador both declared nationwide states of emergency. More than 8,000 people were forced to leave their homes in El Salvador, and more than 3,000 in Honduras, which has received 225,000 dollars in help from regional banks, in addition to 500,000 dollars and 5,000 tons of food from the UN's World Food Program. Guatemala City's response was hampered by a separate emergency: the eruption of a nearby volcano whose ash forced the closure of the capital's international airport since last week, when two people were also killed and three went missing. Colom said the airport would reopen Tuesday. The World Bank said it was finalizing with Guatemala an 85 million dollar loan to help it cope with the two disasters. "First there was a rain of ash, and now it's water. It's one disaster after another," said one resident in the southern town of Palin, Julio Figuer
