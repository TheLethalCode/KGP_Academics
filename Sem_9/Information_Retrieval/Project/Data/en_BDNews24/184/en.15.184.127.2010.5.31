 TEHRAN, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fire blazing at an Iranian oil rig may take up to one month to extinguish, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported on Sunday. Three oil workers were killed and at least 10 injured when the fire broke out at well number 24 at the Naft Shahr oil field early on Saturday. "Extinguishing the fire will take from two weeks to a month," Shahpour Etesami, an official at the Western Oil and Gas Co. told Mehr. Oil officials blamed the fire on a structural fault inside the rig. Naft Shahr is the only active oil field in Kermanshah province, bordering Iraq, with estimated oil reserves of 692 million barrels. The fire poses no risk to Iran's oil exports
