 TUNIS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France's captain and most prolific scorer Thierry Henry faces the once inconceivable prospect of being a substitute at the World Cup for the country he has graced for over a decade. The only player in the squad who was part of the team's 1998 World Cup triumph, the 32-year-old appears set to lose his place up front in coach Raymond Domenech's first team to Nicolas Anelka and the captain's arm-band to left back Patrice Evra. Prior to naming his squad for the June 11-July 11 finals in South Africa, Domenech endorsed Henry as a trusted 'great player', yet has started him on the bench for France's two World Cup warm-ups against Costa Rica and Tunisia. Henry, despite boasting a record 51 goals in 120 appearances and standing on the verge of becoming the first France player to take part in four World Cups, appears to be paying the price after suffering a series of setbacks.

Henry has not complained after being left out of the starting line-up twice, even congratulating Evra after he wore the armband in a 2-1 win over Costa Rica last week, but has also been careful to avoid the media. "The coach has made choices that can be difficult to accept but Titi is still ready to help out," Abidal said of Henry's uncomfortable situation. Beloved of French fans for lifting the team out of tight spots and fondly remembered at Arsenal where he scored 226 goals during his eight-year spell at the London club, Henry could still make an impact at the World Cup. For now, he faces the task of recapturing his scoring instinct from back-stage, instead of being the front-man. "I don't see any first-choice players or substitutes," Domenech said of his decision to leave Henry on the bench. "We're a group. Everybody must remain under pressure and available to h
