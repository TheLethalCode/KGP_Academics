<TITLE> Tamim praises coach for encouraging flair play </TITLE>

 Manchester, June 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bangladesh batsman Tamim Iqbal believes team coach Jamie Siddons' commitment to flair play has allowed him to flourish against England. Tamim was unsure whether his attacking style might need to be modified when he began his Test career, but the left-handed opener has been in fine form over the last few months after being told by Siddons to go with his natural instincts.

We have (captain) Shakib (Al Hasan) -- who is one of the best in the world -- and if he bowls well we can do better." If Tamim frustrates the opposition along the way, it is unlikely to bother him and neither will he be put off if he encounters any sledging. "There was some chat (at Lord's)," he said. "But that was just part of the game -- and anyway I like to talk when I am batting. It happens in every match, and I was loving
