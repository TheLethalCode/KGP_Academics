 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court has refused the Bashundhara Group chairman bail in seven criminal cases and ordered him to surrender before the trial courts in eight weeks. The bench of justice Md Shamsul Huda and justice Abu Bakar Siddiquee on Tuesday passed the order after hearing petitions filed by Ahmed Akbar Sobhan alias Shah Alam for ad-interim bail. The court also asked the law-enforcing agencies not to arrest or harass him in the cases during the period. The cases were filed on different charges, including illegal earth-filling, intimidation, cheating buyers of housing plots, and bribery for escaping murder charge. Criminal Investigation Department (CID) police superintendent Arman Ali filed a case on May 8, 2008 accusing the Bashundhara chief of bribing former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar to hush up murder incident of Sabbir Ahmed, Shah Alam's partner. A Detective Branch inspector lodged another case on June 7, 2007 for his alleged grabbing of waterbodies. Ratan Chandra Sarker filed a case with Dhaka's Badda Police Station on Nov 17, 2006 accusing Shah Alam of attack and ransacking for protesting his land-grabbing. Kazi Sarwar Hossain and Hazera Parveen lodged two separate cases with the same police station on Feb 24, 2007 charging him with theft of land pillars and illegal earth-filling. MA Malek filed a case on Mar 18, 2007 accusing him of not handing over plot after receiving money, and Gazi Obaidul Kabir another on Apr 24, 24 on charge of land grabbing and intimidation. Sheikh Fazle Noor Tapash argued for Shah Alam at the hearing while deputy attorney general Mohammad Selim represented the state.
