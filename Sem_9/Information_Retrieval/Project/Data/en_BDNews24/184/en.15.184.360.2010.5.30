<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)--There remains no more cases against prime minister Sheikh Hasina after the High Court cancelled the BEPZA corruption case, her lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh says. Fifteen cases have so far been filed against Hasina--nine during the 2001-6 BNP-led alliance government regime and six others when the 2007-8 military-installed caretaker government was in office. The High Court on Sunday quashed the case against Hasina over the appointment of a consultant for the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority filed in December 2001. In its verdict the court said the case was filed out of political vengeance. "So the dead child is quickly buried," the court commented. The most recent corruption case against Hasina to be quashed by the High Court was the Frigate graft case on May 18. The other cases include a 'Meghnaghat power plant' case, the 'NIKO' case, the 'Mig-29 purchase' case, the 'barge-mounted power plants' case, and the 'Novo theatre' cases. Among them, the Niko and barge-mounted power plants cases were filed during the caretaker government term and the others during the BNP government term. Three extortion cases were filed against Hasina by businessmen Azam J Chowdhury, Noor Ali and Tajul Islam Faruque during the caretaker government regime. They later withdrew the cases, Hasina's lawyer Taposh said on Sunday. Hasina was exempted in the final chargesheet of the Paltan killing case, he said. She was also exempted in two other cases, the lawyer said. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddique began delivering verdict shortly after the midday and ended it at around 1pm. Taposh told bdnews24.com after Sunday's verdict that Hasina had been exempted from all the cases after nine years. "We have got fair justice, all cases have been quashed through legal procedures," he said. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Hasina, former foreign affairs state minister Abul Hassan Chowdhury and three others on Dec 11, 2001. The ACC claimed that this specific instance of corruption cost the state over Tk 1 million in losses. Charges were framed in June 2002. The High Court on Dec 14, 2002 stayed the proceedings of the case following a petition by Hasina to quash the case. The court also ordered the government to explain why the case should not be declared illegal. The bench in Sunday's ruling said that Hasina did not make any crime by appointing consultant to the BEPZA, nor did she cause any loss to the state coffers. If such cases are allowed to be continued nobody will be able to do anything for the country, it said. The court observed that since the case details and chargesheet did not reveal any crime against Hasina it would be synonymous to abusing the legal procedures if the case proceedings are allowed. bdnew
