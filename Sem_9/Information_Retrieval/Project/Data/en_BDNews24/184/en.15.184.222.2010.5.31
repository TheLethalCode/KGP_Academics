 Khulna, May 31 (bdnews24.com) Opposition chief whip Zainal Abdin Farroque secured bail from a Khulna court on Monday in one of the over 20 cases accusing him of defaming the prime minister's son. BNP MP Shahiduddin Chowdhury Annie was also granted bail in the case. Chief metropolitan magistrate Mohammad Barekuzzaman gave the order after the two leaders appeared before the court and appealed for bail. Advocate Saiful Islam, general secretary of Khulna sadar Awami League, filed the case against Farroque and Annie for allegedly defaming Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, by stating in parliament and elsewhere that Wazed was involved in illegal VoIP operations. Some 21 cases have so far been lodged against the opposition chief whip across the country. Farroque has secured bail from a number of other courts in defamation cases filed against him over the same allegations. bd
