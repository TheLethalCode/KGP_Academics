 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--The government has approved six power plants with a capacity of 567MW under its 'quick rental' plan. Two of six the furnace oil-fired plants , with a capacity of 217MW, went to the Summit Group, owned by commerce minister Faruk Khan's younger brother Aziz Khan. The urgent meeting of the cabinet committee on purchase, headed by its chief finance minister AMA Muhith, on Monday endorsed the six unsolicited bids, three of which were sent back from last week's meeting for asking a high price. Commerce minister Khan was also present at the meeting. Those three are 102MW plant at Madanganj (Summit Power), 115MW plant at Khulna (Khulna Power Company Ltd) and 100MW plant at Kodda, Gazipur (IEL Consortium and Associates). Summit Power and its sister concern the Khulna Power Company had asked for Tk 7.96 and Tk 7.8 per unit but settled for Tk 7.78 in the end. A power ministry official, who requested not to be named, said the proposals were accepted as the contractors reduced their price. The three other proposals approved on Monday are 50MW plant at Chapainawabganj (Sinha Power Company Limited), 100MW plant at Kodda, Gazipur (Dutch Bangla Power Limited) and 100MW plant at Julda, Chittagong (BanglaTrac). Their prices have been fixed at Tk 7.73, Tk 7.78 and Tk 7.76 respectively. With the Monday's approval, 12 projects with a capacity of 1107MW have been given the go-ahead. These rental plants will be operational within six to nine months after contracts are signed. The ministry official told bdnews24.com that the government will soon sign the contracts. But on May 26, three other proposals were approved at comparatively lower rates 100MW plant at Keraniganj (Power Pac Holdings Ltd) at Tk 7.78 per unit, 100MW at Meghnaghat (JV Consortium and PVD Power Technologies Ltd) at Tk 7.70 and a 40MW plant at Nowapara (IFDC Vulcan Energy Ltd) at Tk 7.77 per unit. Earlier, three proposals on diesel-run rental plants were approved under the quick rental plan, undertaken by the government to add 1015-1215MW by next March. Cost of power will be between Tk 12 and Tk 14 from these diesel-run plants. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in March modified the procurement policy so that high cost rental deals could be accommodated as an emergency measure. With the costlier power, government subsidies will also increase as it sells power at Tk 3.66 per unit on average. According to the plan, contracts of rental plants will be awarded to qualified firms without tender. The proposals were sent to the cabinet committee on purchase after signing initial contracts with the companies who made 'competitive' bids. After the purchase committee approval, a technical team was supposed to visit the proposed sites to assess the bids after which a formal contract will be signed. The unsolicited deals are handled by a high-powered committee headed by power secretary Abul Kalam Azad. The committee also includes representatives from Bangladesh Power Development Board, the National Board of Revenue, law ministry, power ministry and the prime minister's office. The opposition BNP, protesting the 'quick rental plans', alleges that the government had 'manufactured' the power crisis to award projects to reward its political coterie. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in her recent speeches at different rallies also asked the government officials not to sign the documents relating these projects. She even threatened probes once BNP returns to power. The country is currently facing a shortfall in power production of around 1000-1500MW. Power generation on Sunday stood at 4100MW during the peak hours against a demand of 5100MW, according to BPDB. bdnews2
