 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court's Appellate Division has asked Amar Desh acting editor Mahmudur Rahman, its publisher Hashmat Ali Hashu and three others to appear in court on July 5 in relation to a contempt of court petition. The six-member Appellate Division bench headed by Md Fazlul Karim also asked the men to explain within two weeks why they should not be charged with contempt of court in relation to a report they published in the Bangla-language daily. Supreme Court lawyer Reazuddin Khan filed the petition following a report published in the newspaper on Apr 21 with the headline, 'Chamber Bench of the Appellate Division means stay order on behalf of the government'. Police early on Wednesday stormed the Amar Desh newspaper office and arrested acting editor Mahmudur Rahman on fraud charges, hours after the government closed the BNP-leaning daily. Additional attorney general MK Rahman, lawyer for the petitioner, said in the hearing that the report was in contempt of court. Mahmudur took over the management of the newspaper in 2008. Later he sent a letter to the deputy commissioner stating that he was serving as editor of the newspaper. Since then he has been the acting editor of the newspaper. He served as the executive chairman of the Board of Investment during the BNP-led four-party government regime. bdnew
