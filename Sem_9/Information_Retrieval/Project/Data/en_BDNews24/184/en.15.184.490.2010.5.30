<TITLE> Prandelli to coach Italy after World Cup </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, May 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Fiorentina boss Cesare Prandelli will become Italy coach after the World Cup, filling the large shoes of Marcello Lippi and ending a saga that had threatened to cast a shadow over the team's defence of their title. Lippi had never publicly said he was leaving after the June 11-July 11 tournament and conflicting signals from the World Cup winner and Italian soccer federation president Giancarlo Abete prompted an array of rumours. Abete wanted a solution before the team flew off to South Africa and has now found his man, famed for his slicked-back hair and purple puffer jacket. "Prandelli will be coach for four years. Prandelli will be officially presented as Italy's coach after the World Cup," a federation spokesman said on Sunday, adding that financial details and Prandelli's backroom staff had yet to be determined. The soft-spoken 52-year-old has been front-runner with the bookmakers for months after guiding the stylish Florence club to the Champions League last 16 last term against the odds. Lippi, who stepped down after their 2006 World Cup triumph before returning to the job after a poor Euro 2008 under Roberto Donadoni, welcomed the appointment. "The federation has found the right person. I had said to Abete at Christmas that I would do my two years and then stop," he told reporters at Italy's training camp in the Alpine town of Sestriere, where they are preparing for South Africa'a altitude. Italy players have also backed the move although striker Giampaolo Pazzini, forced to leave Fiorentina for Sampdoria to gain more playing time, was less enthusiastic. "He deserves it but I played little under him," he said. The change is unlikely to have much effect on Italy's World Cup campaign. "I think deep down everyone knew for a while Lippi would be going so I don't think there will be much of an impact. Prandelli is a good guy," Italy's 1982 World Cup winner Alessandro Altobelli told Reuters. CLEAR FAVOURITE The world champions, in Group F with Paraguay, New Zealand and Slovakia, are only outside bets to repeat their 2006 success because of an ageing team and recent uninspired performances. Prandelli's major task in the Euro 2012 qualifiers starting in September will be to find the right balance between younger talent and experienced heads amid a side with only a handful of world class players. Abete had said any replacement for Lippi would be Italian but his options were limited given Chelsea's Carlo Ancelotti, Manchester City's Roberto Mancini and Roma's Claudio Ranieri, who had all previously expressed interest in the job, have only just completed their first seasons with their clubs. That left Prandelli as frontrunner despite Fiorentina enduring a poor campaign in Serie A where they finished 11th. Fans blamed the slump on their European run, a drugs ban for Adrian Mutu and tensions between Prandelli and the board. Fiorentina knew Prandelli was set to leave and have talked with Sinisa Mihajlovic, who quit as Catania boss last
