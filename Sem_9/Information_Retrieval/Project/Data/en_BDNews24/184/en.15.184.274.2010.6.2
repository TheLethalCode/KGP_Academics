 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) -- Election Commission is set to engage a fulltime executive magistrate and video cameraman from Saturday to monitor the conduct of the two main mayor candidates for Chittagong City Corporation polls, election commissioner Sohul Hossain said. He was briefing reporters about EC's decision on Wednesday. "A decision has been taken to engage an all-time executive magistrate and a cameraman from June 5 to monitor the electioneering of two mayoral candidates ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and Manzur Alam", he told reporters. The monitoring will be done to prevent further violation of electoral code of conduct by the candidates, who had already been warned for their alleged violation of electoral law, he said. Sohul said if needed the magistrate and video cameraman might be engaged for other candidates in the interest of free and fair election. In all, eight candidates are running for the mayoral position in the CCC polls slated for June 17. At least a video camera will be made ready at each of 41 voting centres for recording election scenario, he said. A total of 41 executive magistrates are going to be appointed at phases from Thursday to observe the conduct of the candidates and voters, he said. Hossain said 20 executive magistrates would be appointed on Thursday, who would take immediate action for any violation of electoral law. They will be entitled to sentence an offender up to 2 years in jail, in addition to fining. The provision has been included in mobile court law on May 25, he said. bd
