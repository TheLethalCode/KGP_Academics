 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has asked poor countries vulnerable to climate change to stand on a common platform in the upcoming global climate talks in Cancun, Mexico in November. She said the challenges of climate change could not be addressed without a strong unity among the most vulnerable countries voicing their demands unitedly. Opening a regional climate conference at Dhaka on Sunday, Hasina cautioned that the outcome of the climate summit could even go against the interests of the vulnerable countries if they are not united. Global Climate Change Alliance' organised the two-day conference of the Asian chapter. Environmental ministers around the world are set to meet for the next U.N. climate talks in Cancun from Nov 29 to Dec 10 after the Copenhagen summit in Dec 2009 fell short of a binding global pact on warming. Citing that climate change has become a major challenge for the mankind, Hasina said, "The South Asian communities are currently under the biggest threat. "And if the affects are not addressed properly and timely, existence of these countries will be at risk," she added. "The only success of the ongoing talks is the agreement from the Copenhagen climate summit, held last December, though it was held outside the usual discussions," Hasina said. "However, the global leaders in Copenhagen could make the people understand that they were willing to reach a consensus." Top leaders from more than 120 countries attended that summit. Hasina, who was among those leaders, on Sunday said, "The huge presence proves the concern of the world regarding the climate change issue." "The willingness and wishes will bring an optimistic result in the COP-16 summit at Cancun in Mexico," Hasina stressed. The prime minister said the climate change discussions were lengthy. "But we are in such a vulnerable situation that we have no room to sit back." She mentioned the formation of Climate Change Trust Fund, under the government's own funding, to address the adverse affects. "We have allocated $ 100 million for the fund in the current fiscal year." But, she said, the developed countries have not moved ahead yet on providing funds to the affected countries. In addition, the vulnerable countries will benefit from the $30 billion fund pledged at the Copenhagen climate summit to be paid out in three years between 2010 and 2012, Hasina added. "Here the developed countries will have to lead to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gas. The developing countries also have to come forward according to their ability." Prime minster Hasina also said the duty of the developing countries regarding the emissions is more here than those of the small and the vulnerable countries. Hasina said, "We have to remember that we are living in the same world, where any harm on it will stand as an equal threat to us." State minister for environment Hasan Mahmud, European Union commissioner on climate action Connie Hedegaard, representative of the EU delegation in Bangladesh Stephen Frowen, among others, also spoke in the programme. Ministers, prime minister's advisors, environment experts and development partners attended the conference. bdn
