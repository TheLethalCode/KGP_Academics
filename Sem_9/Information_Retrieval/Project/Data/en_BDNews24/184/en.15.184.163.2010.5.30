<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)--The High Court on Sunday ruled against Awami League presidium member Obaidul Quader's application which had sought to quash a corruption case against him. The bench of justices Khondkar Musa Khaled and Kazi Reza-Ul-Haque also cancelled its earlier order which had stopped proceedings against him in the trial court. Khurshid Alam Khan, the lawyer for the Anticorruption Commission, told reporters that proceedings in the lower court could now resume. ACC deputy director Ashraful Islam had filed the case against Quader on Oct 30, 2007 accusing him of earning illegal wealth worth about Tk 62.84 lakh and concealing information about his wealth amounting to Tk 15 lakh. Criminal charges were pressed on Apr 17, 2008 and Quader was indicted a month later on May 22. The High Court had later stayed the criminal proceedings on July 2, 2008 following a petition lodged by Quader, and had asked government to explain why the case should not be quashed.. Quader's lawyer Khairul Alam Pipul said that his client would decide whether or not to appeal after they had met. bdnew
