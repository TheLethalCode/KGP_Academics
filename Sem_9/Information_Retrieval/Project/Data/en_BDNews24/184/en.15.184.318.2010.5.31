 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)  The leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami held a meeting on Monday morning to decide how to respond to a police ban on using the Paltan ground as a venue for their rally that was due to take place on Monday. "We are in a meeting We'll inform you of our decision at a briefing after the meeting," party assistant secretary general Mohammad Kamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com. He did not make it clear whether or not they would go ahead with the rally. "We will say what we will do after the meeting." Police on Saturday banned rallies and processions at Paltan as Jamaat and pro-government Jubo League scheduled their rallies at the same venue at the same time. Jubo League president Mirza Azam told bdnews24.com that they would now not hold their planned rally due to the police ban. Paltan police chief Shahidul Haque said policemen have been deployed around the Paltan ground which was totally empty on Monday morning. "We are on alert," Haque said. Jamaat on Sunday sought the prime minister's intervention over the issue of holding the party's rally at Paltan. Party secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohamad Mojaheed on Sunday demanded the postponement of Jubo League's programme and withdrawal of restriction on rallies and procession. He had alleged the authorities had given them permission to hold the rally on May 31, but Jubo League called for a rally just a day before their programme was to take place at the government's directive. Mojaheed termed the ban unconstitutional and undemocratic and warned that they would be forced to launch an agitation if the party was not allowed to hold the rally. bdnews24.
