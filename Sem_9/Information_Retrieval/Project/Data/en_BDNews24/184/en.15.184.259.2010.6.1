 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP has demanded immediate reopening of Facebook. BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed made the demand at a discussion on Tuesday. Moudud said, "The government has obstructed the people's freedom of acquiring knowledge and exchanging information by closing Facebook." He also demanded proper action against those who committed cyber crimes. On May 29 Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission shut down the popular social networking site which has over 875,000 users in Bangladesh. BTRC told the media that it had temporarily closed the website for publishing caricatures of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. Severely criticising the government's decision, Moudud said, "It was not prudent to close a popular website summarily. "Even Pakistan has reopened Facebook." He said, "We extend our support to the demand of university teachers, students and conscious citizens for reopening it immediately." Terming Facebook a medium of learning, Moudud alleged that freedom of the mass media is being curbed. The government has stopped transmission of private television Channel 1, he said adding that intelligence agency personnel whisked the publisher of Daily Amar Desh away. "The newspapers only have controlled freedom now." Moudud urged the people to unite under the leadership of Khaleda Zia to topple the government. 'Conscious Citizen Society' hosted the discussion on Bhola-3 by-election at the National Press Club. Awami League candidate Nurunnabi Shaon won the election beating heavy-weight BNP candidate major Hafiz Uddin Ahmed. Moudud alleged that the ruling Awami League rigged the votes in the by-election. Election Commission worked as their cohort in the election, he alleged. Chaired by Mijanur Rahman, the programme was also addressed among others by BNP vice-president Abdullah Al Noman, major (retd) Hafiz Uddin Ahmed.
