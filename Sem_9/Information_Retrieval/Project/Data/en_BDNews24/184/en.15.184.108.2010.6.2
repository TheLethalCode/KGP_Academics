 Chittagong, June 2 (bdnews24.com)-- BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury said he hoped that the army would 'amend its mistake' in the Chittagong City Corporation polls. "The army was deployed in the national elections to manipulate the voting results. After the BDR killings they have now understood who the patriots are and who are not," he told reporters at his Goods Hill house in the port city on Wednesday. "I hope they will amend their mistake through carrying out their duty in Chittagong City Corporation elections this time." The Sheaf of Paddy (BNP's symbol) turned into Boat (Awami League's symbol) in the 2008 national elections due to the law enforcers, he said. Awami League-led Grand Alliance won a two-thirds majority in Dec 2008 elections. Chowdhury alleged that AL-backed mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowhdury had close association with a top official, who is in charge of maintaining law and order in the CCC polls. "He (the top official) has been assigned to snatch votes." Chowdhury, however, did not mention his name. The BNP MP alleged that plans had also been made to prevent BNP leaders and workers from going to field by deploying law enforcers. Mohiuddin Chowdhury and opposition BNP-backed M Manzur Alam are contesting for the mayoral posts in June 17 elections. He condemned the closure of BNP-leaning Bangla daily Amar Desh and arrest of acting editor Mahmudur Rahman. "This incident is reminiscent of 1975. It is the BAKSAL process of 2010." All but four newspapers were banned when one-party Bangladesh Awami Krishak Sramik League was launched in 1975. bdne
