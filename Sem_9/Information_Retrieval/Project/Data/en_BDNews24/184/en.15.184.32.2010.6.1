 LAHORE, Pakistan, June 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least four gunmen attacked a hospital in Pakistan's eastern city of Lahore on Tuesday morning, killing up to a dozen people and holding several hostage before escaping, a senior doctor told Reuters. "They barged into the hospital building and opened indiscriminate fire," said Javed Ikram, Chief Executive of Jinnah hospital. He said at least 12 people were killed in the firing while some had been held hostage. However, other accounts put the number dead at five.

The five dead included three policemen, a woman and a private security guard, he said.

More than 80 people were killed in those attacks. The attackers were either trying to rescue or kill a wounded attacker from Friday's assault who was being treated in the Intensive Care Unit of Jinnah Hospital, said Punjab police chief Tariq Saleem Dogar. A Reuters reporter saw the bodies of four policemen. "There are blood patches at the entrance of the hospital building," a Reuters reporter said.

People and patients who were able ran from the hospital and television footage showed exhausted looking women climbing over security fences to escape.
