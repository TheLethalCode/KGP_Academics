 London, June 1 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Ryan Sidebottom has been named as a replacement for the injured Tim Bresnan in England's squad for the second Test against Bangladesh at Old Trafford. Pace bowler Sidebottom, a key member of England's World Twenty20-winning campaign in the Caribbean last month, has not played Test cricket since the final match of four against South Africa in January. The 32-year-old comes back into the fold as Bresnan suffered a stress fracture of his left foot during England's first-Test win over Bangladesh at Lord's. Bresnan will undergo further assessment this week before a recovery time frame is established. National selector Geoff Miller, said: "We can be very pleased with a number of aspects from the first Test at Lord's, resulting in a comprehensive win against Bangladesh. "It's very unfortunate that Tim Bresnan will miss the second Test through injury, because his bowling benefited from five days of Test cricket at Lord's - and he would have been looking forward to getting more overs under his belt at Old Trafford. "It does, however, provide Ryan Sidebottom with an opportunity to push for Test selection following his outstanding performances in the World Twenty20. "The entire bowling unit will be better for the overs bowled during the first Test and looking to further build on this in Manchester." Squad: Andrew Strauss (capt), James Anderson, Ian Bell, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Eoin Morgan, Kevin Pietersen, Matthew Prior (wkt), Ajmal Shahzad, Ryan Sidebottom, Graeme Swann, Jonathan T
