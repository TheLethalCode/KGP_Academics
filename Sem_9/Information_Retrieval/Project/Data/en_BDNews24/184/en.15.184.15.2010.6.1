 Dhaka, Jun 1 (bdnews24.com)Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has slated the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for giving erroneous data on production of different crops. She asked the BBS officials to apologise to the people and the media. The minister said on Tuesday the data were sent to the finance ministry without coordinating with the agriculture ministry and its related agencies As a consequence, the Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARSO) and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) provided three different statistics over the same issue. Matia expressed her resentment to reporters after a coordination meeting among the ministry, BBS and DAE at her office. She said the real figure of Boro production this year was 18.7 million tonnes until now. The harvest is yet to be completed and the actual figure can be only estimated after the collection is completed, she added.

It also said that the production growth has been reduced to almost half and the growth in agricultural sectors was only 2.77 percent. That report was prepared fully on speculations, the minister said. b
