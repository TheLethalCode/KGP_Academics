<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 01 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has said it will no more tolerate deaths in custody and defiance of its orders to stop such murders. The court in an order said it was under oath to safeguard people's lives in line with the constitution. The bench of justices AHM Chowdhury and Mohammed Delwar Hossain also warned authorities through the attorney general's office and other lawyers that they must stop custodial deaths. The tendency to defy court orders also has to end, it said. Additional attorney general Murad Reza and Chittagong Metropolitan Police commissioner's lawyer Abdul Matin Khasru have been asked to inform the police officials of the court's concerns over the deaths. Different newspapers, including Bangla-language Daily Jugantor, on May 11 published reports on the death of night guard Mohammed Manik in police custody in Chittagong. Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh filed a public interest petition with the High Court over the issue on the same day. The court on May 12 had ordered the police officials to investigate the incident and report. It had also ordered Chittagong Kotwali police sub-inspector Younus Mia to appear before the court on May 23 and submit a written explanation on the incident. Later he was excused from court appearance since some actions had already been taken against him. CMP commissioner Md Muniruzzaman had been ordered to submit another report to the court on whether measures were being taken in accordance with the law. The court on May 23 issued a contempt rule against the CMP chief for not filing the report. He, however, was released from accusation after he sought unconditional apology. On Tuesday, Muniruzzaman appeared before the court and offered unqualified apology before he was cleared of the contempt charges. He told the court that police officer Younus had been temporarily suspended for his alleged connection in Manik's killing. Departmental actions have also been taken against him, the commissioner added. A case has already been filed against Younus on charges of killing Manik in custody. Advocate Manzil Morshed stood for the petitioner at the court. bdne
