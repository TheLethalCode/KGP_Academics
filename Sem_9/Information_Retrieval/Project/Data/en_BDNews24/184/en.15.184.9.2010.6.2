 Jhenaidah, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com)  At least 25 pro-government activists were injured in an intra-party clash on Wednesday in Jhenaidah. The feuding Awami League activists also vandalised six houses during the clash. Locals said that about 1000 people were involved in the two-hour fight. Shailkupa police chief Anwar Hossain told bdnews24.com that two factions of AL, loyal to two former chairmen of Bagura union - Nazrul Islam and Sirajul Islam alias Makhan - fought over establishing supremacy in the area. Hundreds of activists of both the groups attacked each other carrying bamboo sticks, machetes and other sharp weapons, the police official said. Sirajul Islam said the clash erupted when about four to five hundred people of the Nazrul group, led by a man called Mokabbar, attacked Alfapur village. They also ransacked the house of Bagura union council member Ziarat Hossain, Sirajul claimed. However, Nazrul Islam refuted this and accused the Makhan group activists of vandalising houses of his supporters. bdnews2
