 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Tuesday granted police five more days to quiz Saidur Rahman, chief of the banned Islamist outfit Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh. Two others were also remanded for the same duration. Saidur, his aide Abdullahel Kafi and Kafi's wife Ayesha Akhter were produced before Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court after a six-day remand in relation to a case filed under the Antiterrorism Act. Sheikh Mahbubur Rahman, inspector of Detective Branch, on Tuesday asked for nine days to question the suspects. Magistrate SK Tofail granted five days. The DB inspector, also the investigation officer, in his plea for remand said that lot of plans on anti-state and destructive activities were revealed by them during their previous remand. Further interrogation was needed to get the names, addresses and current position of their associates, and to recover the firearms and ammunition in their possession. The defendants filed no petitions for bail or opposing the remand appeal. However, police statements over the arrest of JMB chief Saidur along with the two others were conflicting. Inspector general of police Nur Mohammad told a press briefing on May 24 that a special team of detectives arrested Saidur the previous night at Dania in Dhaka's Jurain. But a press release handed to reporters immediately after the briefing mentioned the time of the arrest as morning of May 24. Saidur took over the helm of the group after the execution of JMB chief and spiritual leader Shaokh Abdur Rahman. The JMB and several other Islamist groups aim to transform Bangladesh into a Sharia state and thus agencies or individuals like lawyers, judges or courts have borne the brunt of their violence. Militants launched a series of bombings in Aug 2005 and are believed to have staged a grenade attack on Aug 21, 2004 that killed 23 people at an Awami League rally being addressed by prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Hasina, then the opposition leader, escaped with partial hearing loss. The Islamists kept a low profile after Shaokh Abdur Rahman, JMB's military chief Siddiqur Rahman alias Bangla Bhai and four other JMB leaders were executed in March 2007. But they started regrouping after Hasina took office in January 2009. Intelligence reports say they were planning an offensive soon as the government undertook a fresh sweep against them. b
