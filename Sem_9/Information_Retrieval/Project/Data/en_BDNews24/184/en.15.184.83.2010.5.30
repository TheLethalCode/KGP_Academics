 Savar, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has confirmed that agricultural subsidies will be increased in the upcoming budget. "The success achieved by the government in directly subsidising farmers to buy agricultural materials will be replicated and the subsidy will be increased in this sector." She spoke to the media after inaugurating the 46th Fundamental Training Course at Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre at Savar on Sunday. However, the minister did not specify the products that will enjoy greater subsidy. Matia also said, "The government has ensured supply of good fertiliser and seeds along with agricultural subsidy. Due to proper maintenance, there was no lack of fertiliser and seeds." "The government is always concerned about the farmers and is determined to meet their demands," she added. Referring to the opposition, the minister claimed that there was no use in threatening the government with general strikes. "We did not form the government on anyone's mercy, the Awami League formed this government with public mandate."

As many as 252 administrative officials under 23 civil service cadres will participate in the four-month foundation training. bdnews24.
