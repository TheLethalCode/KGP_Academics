 Rotterdam, Netherlands, June 2 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- A storming attacking display late in the second half handed the Netherlands a convincing 4-1 win over an overwhelmed Ghana in a pre-World Cup friendly here on Tuesday. The Dutch, who will play in Group E of the World Cup against Denmark, Japan and Cameroon, took a one-goal lead into the half-time interval after Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt pounced on a loose ball on the half hour.

Sneijder, fresh from helping his Italian club claim an historic treble of the Serie A title, Italian Cup and Champions League, unleashed a volley from 20 yards out that flew past Ghana 'keeper Richard Kingson and into the net. Robin van Persie made the scoreline look even more one-sided when he converted from the penalty spot three minutes from full-time. The Netherlands are coached by Bert van Marwijk, and he has now set a new national record of stretching their unbeaten streak to 18 consecutive matches. Ghana meanwhile will hope to do better when they face Latvia at home in their final friendly on June 5.
