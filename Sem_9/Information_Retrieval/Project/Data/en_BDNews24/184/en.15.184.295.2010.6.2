 Dhaka, Jun 2 (bdnews24.com)  No admission test will be held in the eleventh grade this year and the students will be admitted on the basis of their SSC and equivalent examinations result. The students who secured the highest grade point average of 5 will be given priority. This decision was made by the education ministry on Tuesday night. For the past two years, college admission was done on that basis. The ministry warned that any college, especially the non-government ones, defying the policy would lose their eligibility for MPO (monthly pay order) entitlement. In government colleges, steps will be taken against the principals of the colleges. According to the policy, the students who passed the SSC and equivalent examinations held in 2008, 2009 and 2010 will be eligible to be admitted into the colleges. The last date of collecting and submitting admission forms to the institutions is Jun 10. The list of nominated students for admission will be published on Jun 17. Students, who would be nominated, should complete the admission formalities within Jun 28 without any late fee, which will be collected from those who enrol after that until July 11. Classes are set to start from July 1. According to the policy, the students who passed from the same institution will get the priority in the admission. Among them, children of the freedom fighters should be given priority. In addition, 88 percent seats should be open to all for admission in the district and division level colleges. The students should submit their original mark sheets and testimonial from their respective institutions to the colleges they are seeking admission to. The college authority should publish all of the information related to admission on its website and the authority should try to conduct all the activities online. The policy says that the college authorities should collect Tk 10 for the form and Tk 50 for the admission management from each of the students. During the admission, the education board-approved registration fee, (Tk 100), sports fee, (Tk 25), rover scout and girls guide fee, (Tk 15), Red Crescent fee, (Tk 15), science and technology fee, (Tk 7), section and subjects change fee, (Tk 25) should be taken.
