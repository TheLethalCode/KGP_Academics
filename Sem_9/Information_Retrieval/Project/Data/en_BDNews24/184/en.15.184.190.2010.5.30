 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Main opposition BNP's three-day programme to observe the 29th death anniversary of its founder, Ziaur Rahman, started on Sunday. The day's programme began with BNP activists, led by party chairperson Khaleda Zia, also Zia's widow, paying their respects at his grave at the capital's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar around 10:45am. Doa and Milad Mahfils, organised by Jatiyatabadi Olama Dal, were held at the grave amid the presence of scores of party activists. BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain, standing committee members Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and Moudud Ahmed were present among others. Dhaka city BNP, Jatiyatabadi Juba Dal, Jatiyatabadi Sramik Dal, Jatiyatabadi Krishak Dal, Jatiyatabadi Mahila Dal, Jatiyatabadi Tanti Dal and other associate organisations also paid their respect. Following the programme at Zia's grave, Khaleda distributed food among the destitute at Mohammadpur Town Hall around 12pm. The programme was held at other places also, including Rayer Bazar. Dhaka city BNP's former general secretary Abdus Salam told bdnews24.com that the opposition leader would distribute food among the poor at 51 places in the capital. BNP's office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com that similar programmes are being held around the country to commemorate the death anniversary. BNP's central office at Naya Paltan hoisted both the national flag and a black flag to mark the occasion, along with the party's own flag at half mast. Then an army major, Zia declared the country's independence on March 27, 1971 from Chittagong's Kalurghat Radio Station on behalf of independence architect Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Zia, a sector commander during the war of independence, was later widely criticised for his military rule and for rehabilitating anti-liberation forces. Following the assassination of the founding president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman along with most of his family by a group of renegade army officers on August 15, 1975, Zia took over as the army chief. Following the second coup on Nov 7, 1975, he became the deputy chief martial law administrator and took over as chief martial law administrator on April 21, 1977. Zia took oath as the country's president on April 21, 1978. He was assassinated in a coup by army officers at the Chittagong Circuit House on this day. bdne
