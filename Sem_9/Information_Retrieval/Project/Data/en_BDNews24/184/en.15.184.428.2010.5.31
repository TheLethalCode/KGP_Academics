<TITLE> Jamaat seeks EC talks without changing charter </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami wants to sit with the Election Commission ignoring three reminders to amend parts of its charter that contradicts the country's constitution by June 10. The Islamist party's secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed told bdnews24.com on Sunday that they had written to the Commission for time for a meeting in the first week of June. He had said the Commission requirements about amending its constitution were not clear enough and thus the party sought an appointment. Mojaheed also said the party was likely to amend its constitution at the regular meeting of its highest policymaking body, the Majlish-e-Shura, scheduled in July. The Commission had notified Jamaat that its existing constitution contradicted Bangladesh's constitution and thus had to be amended. It wrote three times calling for an amendment, the latest being in early May. Earlier it wrote to the party on Jan 24 and Mar 25. A total of 39 political parties registered with the Commission by submitting their amended draft constitution before national elections of December 2008. The Election Commission cancelled the Freedom Party's registration on Jan 25 for their failure to submit their constitution. Mojaheed told bdnews24.com that they had been trying to contact the Commission for exchange of views over the specific sections that the Commission finds objectionable. Although the Commission has responded 'positively', no date has yet been fixed, Mojaheed said. He clarified the party's reason for seeking an appointment. "The Election Commission's statement about amending our party constitution is not clear." "If there is any need for amendment, we will firstly discuss with the Commission about it and if needed the party will have a meeting regarding that." They want to decide over the amendment after the Shura meeting in July. The Commission has set June 10 as deadline for submission of their amended constitution. NI Khan, joint secretary (law) of the Commission Secretariat and convener of the committee on scrutinising party constitutions said Jamaat had asked for scheduling a meeting before their council in July. He said the Commission, however, has not decided about Jamaat's request. Jamaat is claiming that the issue over amendments to their party's constitution will be settled if talks are held between them. There are around seven sections in Jamaat's constitution, which the Commission says are in conflict with the constitution. The Commission officials said Jamaat was asked to amend some sections of the constitution, including 33 percent representation of women in the party by 2020. The other points of concern include 'eradication of all kinds of atrocities, corruption and injustice from society by establishing the rule of Islam through concerted effort' and 'change the government in a conventional way to establish the rule of Islam'. According to the Commission's review committee, the country will be run in line with its constitution in a democratic manner. It alleges that Jamaat's constitution is contradictory to the national constitution. Election commissioner M Shakhawat Hossain has already said that Jamaat's constitution will not be accepted unless it amended it. bdne
