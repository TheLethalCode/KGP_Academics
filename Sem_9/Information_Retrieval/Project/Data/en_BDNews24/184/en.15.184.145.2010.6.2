 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)--The death toll from the building which toppled on tin-shed shanties on Tuesday night rose to 22 as two more bodies were recovered at around 11pm on Wednesday. Twenty-one people have so far been rescued with more missing amid the rubble of the building that collapsed at Begunbari in Tejgaon, Dhaka, officials said on Wednesday. Rescue operations by the fire service and the army were still underway. They were trying to dismantle the building to recover the bodies trapped under it. A rescue team of the 14th Army Engineering Corps joined the fire service, police and RAB personnel at around 2am. Alamgir Hossain, a shanty resident, identified the two  'Shaon', 7, and 'Bishal', 3 months old  as his sons. While talking to the bdnews24.com correspondent at the spot, he said another son was missing. Of the deceased, seven have so far been identified as 'Ejen', 35, Azizul Huq, 32, Sahara Khatun, 30, 'Mamtaz', 30, Morsheda Begum, 28, Manjila Begum, 25, 'Jahanara', 25, Shamsunnahar, 24, 'Sharmin', 22, 'Mehgna', 8, and 'Jehad', 7. The five-storey building had fallen off its base  like an uprooted tree  onto tin-shed shanties at about 10:45pm on Tuesday. Fire service officials said 21 people have been pulled out of the rubble and sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. Nazma Akhter, an official of the Dhaka fire service, confirmed bdnews24.com about the recovery of 20 bodies until 3:15pm. But Dhaka's deputy commissioner Muhibul Haque told bdnews24.com: "Eighteen bodies were recovered until 6pm according to our estimates." "Among the four, sent to hospital assuming 'dead' on the night of the incident, two regained consciousness. Another 16 bodies were brought out of the debris on Wednesday," he said. An investigation will be launched, the DC added. Snapped electricity cables and leaked gas pipes were hampering the rescue operation, he had told reporters early in the day. The approach towards the building site was very narrow preventing entry of rescue vehicles and delaying the rescue efforts. Dhaka's Nezarat deputy collector Babul Mian said eight bodies were handed over to the families from the spot until 1pm. The Dhaka district administration gave Tk 20,000 each to the families for burial. Tejgaon Industrial Area Police Station officer-in-charge Omar Faruk said the building had crushed onto at least four three-storey tin-shed shanties by its side. The house, 18/B on Post Office alley, toppled around 10:45pm, trapping the inhabitants of the building and the shanties, he said. Nazrul Islam, rescued from the building with serious injuries, said the building toppled suddenly with a loud bang. He was rescued from the ground floor of the building after cutting a grill fence. Community volunteers of the fire department joined the drive for the first time. Formation of this specialised unit is underway to combat different natural disasters including earthquakes. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, director general of fire services, said, "Almost everyone except those at the bottom could be recovered." "Now we will try to move the building or tilt it a little more." Residents of the adjacent buildings were also asked to move away for safety. The building, on two kathas of land, with two two-room units on each floor, fell on its south face. The fourth floor of the building, owned by one Abbas Uddin, was under construction. Initially, locals feared between 50 and 100 people had been trapped in the collapsed building and the adjacent shanties. But most residents of the five-storey structure escaped unharmed, they said. Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka and LGRD state minister Jahanir Kabir Nanak visited the spot. State minister for housing and public works Abdul Mannan Khan went there at 2pm. He said that the building was 'illegal', but there was a court order not to remove it. "We have to face protests while taking legal steps against anybody. On the other hand, we face criticisms when we don't." He said that RAJUK, the regulatory body to oversee building construction in Dhaka, was sincere about removing all illegal structures. "All the illegal installations in this area will be removed," he added. ASM Maksud Kamal, a geology department teacher at Dhaka University, came to the spot to advise the rescue workers. He told bdnews24.com: "The building toppled as it was not constructed firmly and was situated beside a water body." A similar incident had taken place at Mirpur recently, he said. A fire service diver was sent into the water body on Wednesday afternoon to search for bodies. However, he did not find any. bdnews24
