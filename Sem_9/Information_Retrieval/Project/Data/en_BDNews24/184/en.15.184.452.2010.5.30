 LONDON, May 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Bells rang out in Liverpool on Saturday to mark the 25th anniversary of the Heysel stadium disaster in which 39 football fans were killed. Thirty-nine chimes sounded out at the city's town hall in memory of the victims who died after gathering to watch Liverpool play Italian club Juventus in the 1985 European Cup final at the stadium in Brussels. The victims, mostly Italians, were killed when a wall collapsed amid scenes of violence. Flags at all Liverpool FC's buildings were flown at half-mast as a show of respect, while the club's managing director Christian Purslow attended a memorial service in Turin, the home city of Juventus. Supporters from both teams also linked up to play a match at Liverpool's Kirkby Academy as a symbol of the reconciliation between the two clubs. Juventus fan Serafino Ingardia told Liverpool FC's official website: "Having lived in Liverpool for over five years, I have seen with my own eyes how Liverpool fans regret that tragic night and feel genuinely sorry for what shouldn't have happened." Liverpool supporter Dave Usher told the website: "We just wanted to put on a united front in memory of those who died on that tragic night 25 years ago, and to show people in Italy that we haven't forgotten." UEFA president Michel Platini, who played for Juventus in the fateful match which went ahead despite the deaths, vowed to ensure such a tragedy never happens again as he attended the service in Turin. "I was carefree like all players who were going through an important moment," he said. "But that match was played in darkness for us players. I still remember that match today and I can't forget it. "As president of UEFA I guarantee that it will be one of my priorities to ensure such a tragedy never happens again." Despite criticism of UEFA and the Belgian Football Association over the condition of the ageing stadium and the ticketing allocation, no official inquiry was ever held. The stadium was demolished in 1994 and the King Baudouin Stadium built on the site. After a five-month trial in Belgium in 1989, 14 Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaug
