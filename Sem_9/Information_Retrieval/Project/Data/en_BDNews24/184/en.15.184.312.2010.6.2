 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  Two were killed in an encounter with elite crime busters Rapid Action Battalion at South Begunbari in the capital Wednesday evening, officials said. The deceased were identified as 'Jobbar', 32, and 'Selim', 30. Operation officer of RAB-2, captain Abu Khaled Al Noman said a RAB team was patrolling the area and challenged Jobbar and Selim. RAB members returned fire, when the two opened fire at the lawmen, Noman claimed. Selim and Jobbar took bullets. They were sent to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared them dead. The bodies were later sent for autopsy. A revolver and a pistol were recovered from the spot, the official added. The local rights groups, besides the global Amnesty International, have so far protested the regular extra-judicial killings. Amnesty in its recent annual report alleged that extrajudicial executions reported as deaths from "crossfire" or in "shootout" had not stopped in Bangladesh. It also said the ruling Awami League in its campaign pledges vowed to stop such murders without trial. Human rights organisations reportedly investigated a few selected incidents of "crossfire" and found them to be killings. Government high-ups seem to be contradicting themselves about these controversial killings. The foreign secretary on May 30 admitted that there were stray incidents 'due to some legal loopholes'. However, the law minister recently claimed that no 'crossfires' were taking place. Earlier, the home minister, state minister for home and many government policymakers had implicitly advocated such extra-judicial executions.
