 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com) Information minister Abul Kalam Azad told parliament on Wednesday that it was not the government but the deputy commissioner of Dhaka who had closed the Bengali daily Amar Desh for alleged violation of the publication law. He was responding to the allegation of BNP MP Moudud Ahmed who said that the government shut the newspaper. "The deputy commissioner, be it of Sherpur or Dhaka district, is the authority to give declaration for newspapers. The DC can cancel the publication in case of any violation of the law," said Azad. He further said the Channel 1 television was shut by the High Court for violating the government rule of transferring ownership. "There was a case on transfer of ownership of Channel 1 in the court. The channel went off air as per the directive of the court," he clarified. At one stage during his prolonged speech, he launched personal attack against Moudud. Speaker Abdul Hamid intervened, saying, "Honourable minister, your point is: the deputy commissioner has closed the Amar Desh and the High Court shut Channel 1". "Yes, honourable speaker," said Azad, adding the present government believed in free flow of information
