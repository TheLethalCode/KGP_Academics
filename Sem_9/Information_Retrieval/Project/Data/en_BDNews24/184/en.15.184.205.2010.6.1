<TEXT>
 TOKYO, June 1 (bdnews24.com/AFP) - Japan's unpopular Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama battled for his political survival Tuesday as he faced mounting pressure to step down ahead of upper house elections next month. The centre-left leader, who took power in a landslide election last August, has seen his approval ratings dive below 20 percent amid a row over a US military base on the southern island of Okinawa. Hundreds of journalists crowded parliament when Hatoyama met Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling party's chief election strategist often dubbed the "Shadow Shogun" and the power behind the premier's throne. But both men kept the nation guessing about Hatoyama's political future when they emerged from the meeting separately and without speaking. Hatoyama smiled briefly at the cameras as he left the building. His right-hand man, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano, said Hatoyama and Ozawa had "analysed the current situation and exchanged views. We will continue holding talks," Hirano said without giving a date or time. Neither Hatoyama or Ozawa announced news briefings for Tuesday. Newspaper headlines have been filled with speculation that Hatoyama's days in office may be numbered after he backflipped on his election promise to move an unpopular US airbase off Okinawa island. Some media reports, quoting unnamed party sources, said the premier and Ozawa would discuss whether Hatoyama should resign ahead of an election for the upper house of parliament, slated for July 11. Hatoyama's U-turn on the US base caused a split in his three-party coalition, with the small, pacifist Social Democrats quitting the government on Sunday. Hatoyama earlier Tuesday told reporters: "I want to cooperate with him (Ozawa) to tackle national challenges." Later in the day, he conceded: "I really work hard but I have yet to gain the people's understanding." Hirano earlier ruled out Hatoyama's resignation, saying: "I think it is unreasonable in the first place that people should talk about whether the prime minister should stay or leave." But many analysts said Hatoyama was in a tough spot. "His resignation is a matter of time," said Koji Nakakita, professor of politics at Rikkyo University in Tokyo. "He has lacked leadership. The DPJ needs coalition partners, but no party wants to join under Hatoyama. Since the approval rate has plunged to such levels, he has no option but to step down." Cabinet ministers professed their loyalty, even as they spoke about the government's deep troubles. Finance Minister Naoto Kan, seen as among the likely contenders for Hatoyama's post, said: "I have been saying I want the prime minister to fulfil his duties for the full four-year tenure and my thinking hasn't changed." But Kan also said Hatoyama's handling of the Okinawa issue had damaged the government, telling journalists: "I believe almost everyone in the DPJ shares the view that we are in a very severe situation." Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada said that amid plunging voter support, "both the secretary general and I feel the wind blowing against us. But I think it would be wrong to think the party would be all right if we changed the leader." Transport Minister Seiji Maehara, another possible contender for the premier's job, said support for the DPJ had diminished in part because both Hatoyama and Ozawa have been embroiled in political funding scandals. But he also stressed the need for continuity in leadership. "It's problematic if the prime minister is replaced frequently, so I want the prime minister to reflect on his past conduct and work hard." Hatoyama is Japan's fourth premier in four ye
