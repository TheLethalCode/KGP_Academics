 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  A suspected mugger was shot dead by the police in front of Mirpur Bangla College in the capital on Sunday. Witnesses said that the suspected mugger had charged cocktail bombs at the police when they approached him at a tea stall. Police claimed that they shot the suspected mugger in self-defence. The identification of the deceased could not be ascertained immediately. He was said to be in his mid 20s. The incident occurred between 10:30am and 11am. Mirpur police chief Wazed Ali told reporters that acting on a tip off about the possibility of a major mugging in the area, a team of plainclothesmen gathered at the spot. The team suspected three people sitting on a bench at a tea stall with a bag under an over bridge under-construction at around 10:30am, Wazed said. As the plainclothesmen asked them what was in the bag, one of the men took a bomb out of the bag and threw it at the law enforcers before running off. The man threw another 'cocktail' when the police chased him. Then he threw the bag at the policemen chasing him. Sub-inspector Shahinur Rahman, who led the drive, told bdnews24.com that they fired seven to eight rounds when the man was trying to go over a wall. The two other men fled the scene on a motorcycle. Police took the man to the hospital where doctors declared him dead.
