 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com) Foreign assistance in agriculture is very low, although agricultural research is crucial for a country like Bangladesh, according to the finance minister. Abul Maal Abdul Muhith was indicating the low level of investment in agriculture as he stressed more funds to conduct research. "Most of the studies in the sector were done internally where the contribution from the government was also very little. The contribution from the public is rather greater and the government plays a catalyst's role," Muhith told reporters on Wednesday after the signing ceremony of the Joint Cooperation Strategy (JCS). The JCS was agreed upon at a policy-making meeting between the government and development partners in February this year. The Bangladesh Development Forum had developed the strategy to coordinate development initiatives. Replying to a query on accountability of the development partners, Muhith said that they would also have some responsibility as per the new strategy document. Last month, the government and the donors sparred over the issue of mutual accountability in a meeting, which was convened to gather feedback on the draft framework of the JCS. The meeting was attended by representatives of the civil society, including economists, NGO leaders and former bureaucrats along with representatives of the development partners. The government is looking for foreign assistance on a priority basis in the energy and power sector, followed by communications, climate change and environment, according to the finance minister. Touching on the issue of aid effectiveness, Muhith said that the government has taken quite a few steps to boost implementation capacity. "In the last 9 months, we've achieved implementation progress of 57-58 percent, which we never achieved in the past." The finance minister, however, admitted that the government is slow in monitoring and implementation. Economic Relations Division (ERD) secretary and co-chair of the Local Consultative Group (LCG) M Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan and heads of concerned foreign missions and agencies signed the document. The JCS, prepared in the spirit of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda for Action, has been aligned to the government's revised National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (Steps towards Change) and the upcoming 6th five-year plan, says a statement of the ERD. National ownership, development partners' alignment to government policies, priorities, strategies, systems and procedures, harmonisation of development assistance, management for results and mutual accountability are among the key features of the agreed strategy. "The aim of the JCS is to turn the donor commitments into real actions for an improved aid delivery and a positive change in Bangladesh," reads the ERD statement. b
