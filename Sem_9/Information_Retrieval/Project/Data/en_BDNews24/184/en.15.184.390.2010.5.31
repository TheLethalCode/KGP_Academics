<TEXT>
 Bandarban, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -The Awami League government that signed the 1997 Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord created the UPDF to sabotage the deal, Santu Larma claimed on Sunday. Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma, better known as Santu Larma, the chairman of the CHT Regional council, launched the attack on the government at the fourth bi-yearly conference of of Bandarban district chapter of Parbatya Chattagram Jana Sanghati Samity (PCJSS) on Sunday.. The two decades of armed struggle by the indigenous people of the hill tracts ended when the peace deal was signed on Dec 2, 1997. Santu then formed the PCJSS after disbanding the Shantibahini militia. However, a group of indigenous people rejected the peace accord and formed the United Peoples Democratic Front (UPDF) and the two organisations have been fighting each other since then. Recently, a number of murders were committed in the three hill districts including Rangamati. The people of the CHT are being held hostage by the military, UPDF and Islamic expansionists, said Santu in the meeting. He also said that terrorism by UPDF over the past 12 years has claimed lives of 96 PCJSS leaders and activists. He continued to say that the last three governments did not show any sincerity about implementing the peace accord. Criticising the parliament members from the CHT, Larma said, "They did not utter a single word for the benefit of the tribal people in the parliament despite being CHT people." "BNP also did not want anything good for us. They filed cases against the accord through their lawyers. And the higher court's verdict has only created a negative impact among the CHT people", added the PCJSS chief. Santu was also critical of the two-year emergency period between 2007 and 2009. He claimed that his normal movement in the area was being hampered by government surveillance. "Wherever I go, government spies follow me. The government is spending a huge amount of money on the spies." He urged PCJSS leaders and activists to be prepared to make any sacrifice for speedy implementation of the peace accord. PCJSS central vice chairman Ushatan Talukdar, Pragati Bikash Chakma and others spoke in the meeting presided over by district PCJSS chairman Shadhuram Tripura. bdnews24
