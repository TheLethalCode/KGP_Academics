 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)The government has approved a new national education policy, extending free and compulsory primary schooling up to class eight from grade five. The decision came from a weekly meeting of the cabinet on Monday chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, her press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told a briefing. The National Education Policy-2010 has set the secondary education level from class eight to class 12. Azad said the government will soon form a committee to implement the new policy. Terminal examinations of class 10 will be held at the Upazila, municipality or thana level under the same question paper. Students will be awarded with scholarships based on results. This appraisal will also be applied in case of the class five terminal examinations. The new policy also suggested launching a pre-primary education for the five-year-old children, the press secretary said. Students of all faiths will get equal facilities to study their religions, he added. Moreover, the indigenous students will be provided with indigenous teachers and learning materials so that they can learn their own languages. The policy in defining madrasa education says it means building good faith in Almighty Allah and the Prophet and enabling students to realise the real meaning of Islam as the religion of peace. In coordination with the other sections of the policy, the Ibtedayee-level students will have to study Bengali, English, Bangladesh studies, mathematics, social environment, introduction to natural environment, ICT and science in addition to religious and ethical studies. Likewise, Dakhil-level students will also have to study the compulsory subjects for the general education. The press secretary added that the government will also form a non-government teachers' Commission to supervise selection and training at the nongovernmental educational institutions. In addition, National University's divisional centres will be established in each of the seven divisional districts as part of its decentralisation process, Azad said. These centres will later be gradually turned into government-approved universities, he added. Azad said the new policy aims to provide education imbued with the spirit of the liberation war to the people regardless of their race, religion, class and colour. The policy was supposed to have been tabled in the cabinet in December, but was deferred due to protests from different quarters including from religion-based groups. The government in April last year formed a policy formulation committee, led by professor Kabir Chowdhury, which in September had submitted the draft. The cabinet at Monday's meeting also approved the drafts of the Law and Order Disrupting Crime (Speedy Trial) (amendment) Act-2010 and the National Tourism Policy. bdnew
