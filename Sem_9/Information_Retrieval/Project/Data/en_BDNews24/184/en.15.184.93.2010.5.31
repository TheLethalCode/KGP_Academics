 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Juba League appears to be setting the standard as far as democratic practice goes. Although the ruling Awami League appears reluctant to come down hard on its associate bodies, the Juba League has decided to question its mother party. The ruling party's youth front had announced a rally on Monday in protest against Awami League's in trying the war criminals. Frustrated at the long-drawn process, Juba League declared this programme to shake the government into action, Mirza Azam, Juba League general secretary told reporters. Azam was speaking at a press conference at the organisation's Bangabandhu Avenue headquarters. "Awami League came to power a year and a half ago. But still, the trial procedures do not conform with its election pledges," Azam said. Police on May 29 banned rallies and processions at the Paltan ground in Dhaka as the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami and the Juba League scheduled their rallies at the same venue on Monday. They had realised that if Juba League took to the streets, high-profile Jamaat leaders would be swiftly tried, Azam claimed. Neither Juba League nor Jamaat managed to hold their rallies on Monday due to the ban. Police, however, detained 55 Jamaat activists from Paltan as they were attempting to defy the police ban and bring out a procession. Juba League has declared countrywide programmes demanding that the war crimes trial be expedited. These include protest rallies at all sub-districts on Jun 3, at all the districts on Jun 5 and finally a 'grand rally' at Dhaka's Muktangan on Jun 12. They have also planned to launch a long march from Teknaf to Tetulia from the southern tip of the country to the north. bdn
