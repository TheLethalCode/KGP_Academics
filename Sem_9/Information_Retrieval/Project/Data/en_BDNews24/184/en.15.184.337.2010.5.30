 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  SAARC countries unanimously agreed to form a forum to help coordinate their election commissions, the chief election commissioner has announced. The forum will be named the 'Forum of Election Commissions of SAARC Member States', ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters on Sunday after a two-day meeting of SAARC countries' chief election commissioners at the Radisson Water Garden Hotel, the first meeting of its kind. The forum will aim to share election experiences, information and innovative strategies. It will also build institutional relations and long-term cooperation among all SAARC countries, he said. A discussion on the formation of such a forum took place during the 16th SAARC summit in Bhutan this year. Huda said a specific charter will be tabled at the next SAARC conference. "A second round of discussions on the proposed forum will be held in Pakistan before the next SAARC summit. I hope this forum will have a full shape before the next SAARC summit." A country's chief election commissioner and secretary will be the forum's chairperson and secretary for a period of two years, Huda said. Navin B Chawla of India, Fuwad Thowfeek of the Maldives, Hamid Ali Mirza of Pakistan, Neel Kantha Uprety of Nepal, Daso Kunzang Wangdi of Bhutan, and Ayub Assil of Afganistan were present at meeting.
