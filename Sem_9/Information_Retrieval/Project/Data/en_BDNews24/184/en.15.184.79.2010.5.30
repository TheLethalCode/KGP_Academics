 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)--Foreign secretary Mohamed Mijarul Quayes says some extra-judicial killings may have been taking place in the country due to some legal loopholes. Briefing journalists at the foreign ministry said on Sunday, the secretary said the government had been working hard to implement its policy of 'zero tolerance' towards impunity. Quayes was commenting on the latest Amnesty International's annual assessment report in which the global human-rights watchdog alleged that 70 extra-judicial killings had taken place during the last one year. Two days ago, law minister Shafique Ahmed told the media that extra-judicial killings had stopped. Police and RAB usually characterise suspected extrajudicial executions as deaths from "crossfire" or after a "shoot-out". "The government's policy is zero tolerance towards impunity. But it does not mean that such incidents (extra-judicial killings) are not taking place," Quayes told reporters, asked whether his claim of zero tolerance contradicted the ground reality. "This (the stray incidents of extra-judicial kilings) means that there are some loopholes. And these should be addressed," he said. "We are proceedings toward zero tolerance of impunity. Time will come when Amnesty will praise us." Quayes said the government had both institutional and political commitment against extra-judicial killings. Amnesty alleged that extrajudicial executions reported as deaths from "crossfire" or after a "shoot-out" had not stopped in Bangladesh though the ruling Awami League in its campaign pledges vowed to stop such murders without trial. The Awami League-led government has come under strong criticism from the local and international NGOs for some alleged incidents of extra-judicial killings.

The local rights groups prepared a report on extra-judicial killings by scanning the newspapers. Some NGOs reportedly investigated a few selected incidents of "crossfire" and termed those as killings
