 Dhaka, June1 (bdnews24.com)--The ruling Awami League and its allies are set to meet on Tuesday evening at the prime minister's house. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will chair the meeting at Ganabhaban at 7pm to discuss social, economic and political issues. The ruling party's central working committee, advisory council and the parliamentary party will join the meeting. The allies view the joint meeting as a 'positive' development. Awami League joint general secretary and the prime minister's special aide Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif earlier said the joint meeting will be the first such meeting ever. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers' Party, said his party has been calling for all decisions to be taken unanimously. "We want all decisions to be made unanimously through meetings like this," he said. Jatiya Party presidium member Anisul Islam Mahmud said, "Such a meeting is ideal for the Grand Alliance." He said despite the problems, there were many successes for the government. "It will be best for the Grand Alliance if problems can be resolved through such meeting," the JP leader said. Awami League's advisory council had only held its first meeting last Tuesday, following the party's national council on 23 July last year, though the central working committee meets regularly. Members of the advisory council called on Hasina to strengthen the alliance and hold councils with the party's associate organisations. b
