 Narayanganj, June 1 (bdnews24.com) Eighteen illegal installations were dismantled along the banks of Shitalakhya River in Narayanganj on the first day of a drive launched on court orders. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA) and Narayanganj district administration jointly started the drive on Tuesday from the western and southern sides of the river in Syedpur area. Mostly thatched houses, toilets, tin-shed buildings, warehouses and walls were razed down. In addition, a fence, erected by Gognagar Union Parisad's former chairman Mojibor Rahman that encroached on around one-bigha land, was also removed. Executive magistrates Shova Shahnewaz and Shamsuddoha led the drive. Alamgir Kabir, deputy director of the BIWTA in Narayanganj, and others from the power, gas, WASA and fire service agencies were also present. Huge police and RAB men were also deployed to fend off any obstruction from those who owned the illegal installations. Kabir told reporters: "Over 200 workers and ships 'Agrani' and 'Agrajatra' participated in the drive for removing unauthorised installations." District administration and BIWTA officials said scores of industries, warehouses, brick-built buildings and business institutions had been erected along the banks of the rivers Shitalakhya, Balu and Buriganga flowing through the district town. Illegal jetties were also thrown up there for loading and unloading goods from ships. These installations had encroached nearly 30-40 feet onto the river. In line with a recent High Court order, the district administration identified 3,010 illegal installations, according to CS (a survey), and 320, according to RS. Of them, 11 illegal installations had been knocked down in Sonargaon on Mar 9. Magistrate Shahnewaz told reporters that the drive will continue on Mondays and Tuesdays. bdnews24.com
