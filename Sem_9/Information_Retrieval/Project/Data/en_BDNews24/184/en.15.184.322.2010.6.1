 Dhaka, June 01 (bdnews24.com)Parliament's budget session starts Wednesday amid confusion whether the main opposition BNP will join. According to Parliament secretariat officials, finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith is set to table the national budget for 2010-11 fiscal on June 10. Chief whip Abdus Shahid hoped that the BNP-led opposition would attend the crucial budget session for the sake of the country's vital financial interest. But opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said his party was yet to decide on joining the House. "The BNP parliamentary party will discuss the issue and come up with a decision in this regard". Farroque reiterated the BNP's previous demands such as allocating more front row seats, withdrawal of the 'false' cases against leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia and her two sons, stop alleged plot for evicting Begum Zia from her cantonment residence and others. "As they attended the previous session by abandoning their previous illogical demands, we hope that the BNP will join the House for playing its constructive role as the main opposition," chief whip Shahid told bdnews24.com Tuesday. He said the BNP should play the role of a strong opposition so that the budget session became vibrant. Meanwhile, Jatiya Sangsad secretariat officials say the fifth session of the current 9th parliament may continue up to July 18, though the date would be fixed at Wednesday's meeting of the business advisory committee headed by speaker Abdul Hamid. The committee, composed of prime minister, leader of the opposition, and other senior MPs from the treasury and the opposition benches, meets an hour before every session and fixes the working days. On the opening day, prime minister Sheikh Hasina will take questions from the MPs for 30 minutes. b
