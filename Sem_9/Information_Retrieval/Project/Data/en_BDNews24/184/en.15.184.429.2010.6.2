<TITLE> Doubts as Karzai launches Afghan peace bid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KABUL, June 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Afghan President Hamid Karzai launches an ambitious peace plan on Wednesday that he hopes will persuade Taliban fighters to put down their weapons at a time foreign forces are flooding in for an offensive. Unpopular at home despite an election victory last year that was mired in controversy, Karzai has called a traditional gathering of tribal leaders, elders and other notables to forge national consensus for overtures to the Taliban. The peace jirga, as the centuries-old gathering is known in Pashto, draws 1,300 delegates under a vast marquee in the west of the capital, but noticeably absent will be representatives of the insurgents -- although there will certainly be sympathisers. With the insurgency at its most intense since their US-led overthrow in 2001, the Taliban remain confident they can outlast the latest foreign invasion in the long history of Afghanistan's conflicted past. "Obviously, the jirga will provide yet another pretext for America to continue the war in Afghanistan, rather than bringing about peace in the country," the Taliban said in a statement on the eve of a gathering to which they hadn't been invited, but wouldn't attend if asked. Their confidence comes despite a surge in US forces that will push the size of the foreign military to around 150,000, with an offensive planned in coming weeks to tackle the Taliban in their Kandahar heartland. But following its rapid disengagement from Iraq, the US is keen, too, to get out of Afghanistan, and President Barack Obama has said he wants to start withdrawing troops from July 2011. Washington is also stressing an accompanying hearts-and-minds operation that it hopes will see better Afghan security and governance put in place. Corruption and incompetence by some officials has caused open friction with Karzai at times. As a result, some diplomats and analysts are paying lip service to the jirga's noble aims while doubting its effect. Competing interests from Pakistan, India, Iran and even Russia further poison the atmosphere. WILL JIRGA BRING PEACE? The presidential palace said Karzai had received messages of support from US secretary of State Hillary Clinton and British Prime Minister David Cameron on the eve of the jirga. "This is a big week for Afghanistan," Mark Sedwill, NATO's top diplomat in the country, said. "The international community led by the United States has made clear we give complete support to Afghanistan to reach out to disaffected compatriots who are willing to re-enter the political mainstream. "The jirga is a critical opportunity to advance that process." But the man Karzai beat for the presidency last year, Abdullah Abdullah, dismissed the jirga out of hand, although he said he would not call for a boycott. "The outcome of the jirga will not take us anywhere towards peace, even not close to it," Abdullah said. "The agenda is not known to people, the norms are not known, people invited to the jirga do not represent the people. This event sounds to me like a PR exercise." The key points of Karzai's plan call for an amnesty for rank-and-file Taliban who renounce the insurgency and agree to the constitution. To encourage them, they would be offered training and jobs on development projects in their home areas. He also wants the names of certain Taliban officials removed from a United Nations blacklist and for others to be allowed to seek sanctuary in a friendly Muslim country. This would allow him to seek a more direct approach to the leadership. As well as fighting the insurgency, foreign forces are also involved in training a national army and police force that will be charged with security when they leave. How effective they would be against the Taliban without foreign support remains doubtful. Security in the capital, increasingly the target of Taliban suicide raids or commando attacks, has visibly tightened in the days leading to the jirga and officials say they are confident they have taken all precauti
