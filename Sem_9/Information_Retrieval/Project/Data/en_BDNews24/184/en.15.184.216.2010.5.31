 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Education minister Nurul Islam Nahid says he is happy with the cabinet endorsing the new education policy at its Monday meeting. "The cabinet meeting gladly accepted the policy. As the original initiator, we (the education ministry) are also happy," he told reporters at his office after the cabinet meeting. "My 14-year dream has now come true. I was on the Awami League's standing committee during its previous term and was assigned to formulate this policy," the minister added. "It is not any particular party's education policy but a national education policy. This policy will be implemented in phases," he explained, pointing out that "the words 'non-communal' have been used instead of the word 'secular' in the policy." The policy, which the ministry later reviewed, was formulated keeping the war of independence and the constitution in mind. Opinions on the policy were also elicited from ordinary people through 39 separate seminars and through the ministry website, he said. The education minister said the education system has been divided into primary, secondary and tertiary levels and that there will be two standardised examinations for each level. The primary level will have exams at class five and class eight while the secondary level will have SSC and HSC exams, as before, after the 10th and 12th year, he continued. Graduation and post-graduation exams will also be held as before, he added. He dismissed the contention by Jamaat-e-Islami and other Islamist parties that madrasa education will be harmed in the new education policy. "We sat in talks with the [Islamic thinkers] before formulating the policy and accepted their recommendations. The policy was prepared on the basis of their opinions. They did not see anything (in the policy) against Islam," said Nahid. A madrasa education department and an 'affiliated' Islamic University will be set up in line with the new education policy, the minister said. A commission of madrasa teachers will also be formed to run Quami education and they will decide how the madrasa education would be run, said Nahid. He suggested that those who have opposed the education policy so far have no reason to do so now and that anybody who still does is ignorant of the policy. bdnews
