<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jun 1 (bdnews24.com) Agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has slated the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics for giving erroneous data on production of different crops. She asked the BBS officials to apologise to the people and the media. The minister said on Tuesday the data were sent to the finance ministry without coordinating with the agriculture ministry and its related agencies As a consequence, the Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization (SPARSO) and the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) provided three different statistics over the same issue. Matia expressed her resentment to reporters after a coordination meeting among the ministry, BBS and DAE at her office. She said the real figure of Boro production this year was 18.7 million tonnes until now. The harvest is yet to be completed and the actual figure can be only estimated after the collection is completed, she added. The BBS, however, in two reports sent to the finance minister on May 13 said the amount was 17.4 million tonnes. It also said that the production growth has been reduced to almost half and the growth in agricultural sectors was only 2.77 percent. That report was prepared fully on speculations, the minister said. Matia criticised BBS director general Shahjahan Ali Mollah and other officials and asked them to coordinate with the three agencies in future. This year, both the production of Boro and the growth of production have increased. The BBS will have to revise its reports, the minister added. The farmers have become enthusiastic after the government started subsidising the farm sectors. "The erroneous BBS data suggest that the subsidies came to no use," she said. Matia also alleged that some BBS officials may have entente with those who were against the subsidy. The minister warned the Bureau officials that if they repeat such mistakes, they will have to answer. Agriculture secretary CQK Mostaque Ahmed, DAE director general Sayeed Ali, SPARSO chairman Mujibur Rahman Hawlader, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) director general Abdul Mannan, among others, were present at the meeting. b
