<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)-The central bank has moved to introduce an independent, comprehensive guideline and monitoring system to supervise Islamic banking operations. The initiative has been included in the first-ever five-year strategic plan of the banking sector regulator. The plan was officially unveiled at a programme on Sunday in the capital's Hotel Purbani by Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman. It says, "A coordinated guideline and monitoring system will separately be developed for Islamic banking." Seven banks now run Islamic banking operations on a full scale, while a number of local and foreign banks have separate Islamic banking branches. Under this banking system, loans and Amanat operations are conducted through giving profit shares instead of interest. A number of media reports have accused some Islamic banks of funding Islamist militants. State minister for law Qamrul Islam recently asked the government to take control of a number of Islamist Jamaat-e-Islamibacked banks and financial institutions including the Islami Bank, the largest private bank by capital. The plan for the years 2010-2014 also targets to automate majority of the banking sectors and outreach their services to a larger clientele. Atiur Rahman said, "It is our request to all banks and financial institutions in the country to make such strategic plans." The new plan lists 17 strategies for adoption. They include re-evaluation of current monetary policy framework, strengthening regulatory and supervisory framework of the financial sector, further deepening of financial markets, developing more efficient currency management and payment systems and strengthening reserve management capabilities. Other than these, enhancing regulatory and supervisory framework against money laundering, developing more effective management of government domestic debt, develop ICT network for data exchange, fully automate credit information bureau, and empowering Bangladesh Bank in different functional areas are also included. Adding value to the central bank's risk management process and promoting CSR activities and preparedness for climate change in the country with conducive policy support have also put in the strategic plan. bdnew
