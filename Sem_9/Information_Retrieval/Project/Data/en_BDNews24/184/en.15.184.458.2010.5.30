<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court on Sunday granted the Criminal Investigation Department two days to question JMB member Hafez Mahmud, alias Rakib Hasan, in connection with the attempted murder of author Humayun Azad. CID inspector Mostafizur Rahman, the second investigation officer involved in the case, on Feb 17 had sought seven days' remand from Dhaka's First Additional Chief Magistrate AKM Habibur Rahman Bhuiyan. Rahman told bdnews24.com that he had earlier questioned JMB's other central leader Salahuddin and JMB member Minhajur Rahman Shaon in connection with the killing. On Oct 20, 2009 Azad's brother Manjur Kabir filed a petition to re-open the investigation into the case. He said the previous investigation officer, CID inspector Kazi Abdul Malek, had failed to identify the perpetrators for the murder. Humayun Azad, while alive, had said that he had received many threats after the publication of his book 'Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad'. The late professor of Dhaka University's Bangla department was attacked in front of the Bangla Academy while he was on his way back home from Ekushey Book Fair on Feb 27, 2004. After he recovered, Azad was sent to Germany where he died on the night of Aug 11, 2004, the day he reached Germany. The day after he was attacked, Kabir had filed two cases against unknown people with Ramna Police Station. On Nov 14, 2007, CID inspector Malek had pressed charges against Jama'atul Mujahedin Bangladesh linchpin Shaokh Abdur Rahman, top leaders Ataur Rahman Sunny, Noor Mohammad Sabu (aka Shamim), Minhaj (aka Shafiq, aka Shaon, aka Hamim) and Anwar Alam (aka Khoka, aka Bhagne Shahid). The investigation officer later appealed for removal of Shaokh Rahman and Sunny from the charge sheet as they had been hanged in another case. However, as the case moved to the First Chief Magistrate's Court, Manjur Kabir successfully petitioned the court for further investigation. Kabir claimed that Azad held top Jamaat-e-Islami leaders Matiur Rahman Nizami, Delwar Hossain Sayedee, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed indirectly responsible for launching the attack on him. Following this petition, the police have so far failed to make four deadlines for submission of an investigation report to the court. bdne
