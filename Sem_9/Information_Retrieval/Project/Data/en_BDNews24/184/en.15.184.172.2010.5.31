<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)-- The government's move to hold war crimes trial will disappear without trace, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed has said. "War crimes trial is a falsehood. We don't take it seriously. God willing, it will be vanished into the thin air," he told a press briefing at the party's Moghbazar headquarters on Monday. The leader of the party that directly opposed the nation's freedom struggle in 1971 claimed that people did not endorse the issue of war crimes trial. He also said it was nothing but a conspiracy of the Awami League with its local and foreign cohorts. Mojaheed faces charges of committing crimes against humanity as the chief of Al-Badr militia that collaborated with Pakistan army during the nation's war of independence from Pakistan in 1971. Asked to comment on the allocation of funds in the upcoming budget for the trial, Mojaheed said his party do not attach any importance to the initiative. On the security measures arranged on its own by Indian High Commission in Dhaka, the Jamaat leader said: "Plots are on-going to bring foreign soldiers into the country. "This is a planned conspiracy of colonialism. They (the government) want to make the country an ineffective state," Mojaheed said. Asked about status of the opposition four-party alliance, he said not only BNP and Jamaat, the entire nation will unite against the government.
