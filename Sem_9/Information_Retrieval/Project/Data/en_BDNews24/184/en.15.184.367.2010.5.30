 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steven Finn captured two wickets in eight deliveries to turn the first Test against Bangladesh back in England's favour on Saturday. After steady rain had delayed the start until mid-afternoon and cut the day's play almost in half from 90 to 50 overs, Finn soon made up for lost time. Confirming the excellent impression he had made on Friday's opening day Finn bowled with purpose, pace and control from the Pavilion End, consistently touching speeds in excess of 140 kms an hour. James Anderson followed up with two wickets and at tea Bangladesh, who had resumed on 172 for two in reply to England's 505, had slumped to 229 for six still needing 77 to avoid the follow-on. Junaid Siddique added five runs to his overnight 53 before he perished to the first ball he faced from Finn, beaten for pace and edging a catch to Matt Prior. Mohammad Ashraful got off the mark with a streaky four through gully and did well to negotiate an over in which the ball twice flew off the pitch and thudded into Prior's gloves. Ashraful was not so fortunate with the second ball of Finn's next over. He was hit on the pads moving across his stumps and adjudged lbw by Asoka da Silva, although the ball appeared to have moved back enough to miss the leg-stump. By comparison, Anderson struggled from the Nursery End, consistently pitching his out-swingers too wide to the right-handers. He finally found the correct line against Jahurul Islam, removing the obdurate right-hander for 20 after two hours at the crease with a delivery which touched the outside edge to give Prior his second catch of the day. Switching ends to rest Finn, Anderson captured his second wicket of the match when Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan (25) edged a delivery to Prior. The ball popped out of the wicketkeeper's gloves but fortuitously fell into the hands of Andrew Strauss at first slip as Prior tried to grab the reb
