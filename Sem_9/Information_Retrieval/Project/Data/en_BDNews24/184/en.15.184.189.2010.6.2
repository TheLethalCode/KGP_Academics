 Chittagong, June 2 (bdnews24.com) Awami League-backed mayoral candidate ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury has been allocated polls logo ship and his BNP-supported rival M Manzur Alam pineapple to contest in Chittagong City Corporation polls slated for June 17. Returning officer Jasmine Tuli on Wednesday distributed the polls symbols among eight mayoral candidates at the port city's Muslim Hall. For the posts of 42 general ward councillors 249 candidates would contest and another 59 for 14 reserved councillor posts for women. Mohiuddin is contesting under the banner of Nagorik Committee and Manzur contesting from Chittagong Development Movement. Jatiya Party (Ershad) candidate Solayman Alam Sheth got 'Television'. Among the independent candidates Syed Sajjad Joha was allocated 'spectacles', Mohammad Ibrahim 'motorcycle', 'inkpot-pen' for Zane Alam, 'helicopter' for Mofazzal Hossain Bhuiyan and Rafiqul Alam was allocated 'lock'. Mohiuddin, who is seeking an unprecedented fourth term for office of CCC mayor, had 'lantern' as his symbol in the previous election. Mohiuddin was present during the symbol allocation process. Manzur had asked for 'pineapple', but there was another contender for that symbol. They later settled the matter through discussion. Manzur was not present there. The former mayor was apparently happy with 'ship' as his election symbol, saying: "I have got what I wanted." "Last time I enlightened citizens' homes with 'lantern'. This time I will bring them good-luck with my 'ship'." "The candidate is above the symbol... People will vote judging the merit of the candidate," an upbeat Mohiuddin added. Regarding campaign strategy, he said, "Earlier I went from door to door." "But it will be a new strategy this time," Mohiuddin quipped. bdnews2
