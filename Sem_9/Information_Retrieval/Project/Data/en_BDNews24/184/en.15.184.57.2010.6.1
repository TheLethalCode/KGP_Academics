 Dhaka, June 1(bdnews24.com) BNP secretary general Delwar Hossain alleged that a conspiracy was going on to shut down the Bengali daily, Amar Desh. He made the allegation at a press briefing at the BNP office on Tuesday. Delwar said, "Hashmat Ai, the publisher of the daily was taken to the NSI office and was forced to write down complaints against Mahmudur Rahman. The government has done it to shut down the paper." Criticising the government's oppressive policy regarding the media, Delwar said, "This government threatens to close down a daily if they publish any news against it." "Channel 1 was closed down in the same manner. Amar Desh is now under the cross-hairs as it uncovered and exposed recent government corruption." He alleged recently that the daily's acting editor Mahmudur Rahman and Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud was given death threats by government-backed people. The BNP secretary general continued to say, "The daily's ownership was changed in 2008. Letters were issued to that effect." He said that even though requisite clearances had been secured in line with the legal procedures. "However the matter is still hanging with the deputy commissioner's office." National Press Club president Shawkat Mahmud and BNP senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and Chhatra Dal president Sultan Salauddin Tuku were present at the meeting. bdne
