 LONDON, May 29 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rain washed out the opening session of the third day of the first Test between England and Bangladesh at Lord's on Saturday. Light rain started to fall an hour before the scheduled start time of 1000 GMT and the covers remained on the pitch and surrounding areas throughout the scheduled first session. The rain is forecast to last for the remainder of the day with fine weather predicted for Sunday. Bangladesh had the better of Friday's play after they were outclassed on the opening day. They dismissed England for 505 in their first innings, taking the remaining six wickets for 143 runs, and in response were 172 for two at the close. Junaid Siddique was 53 not out and Jahurul Islam 16 not out. Five years ago Bangladesh were beaten by an innings and 261 runs within three days in their first Test at Lord's. They have lost each of their six matches against England
