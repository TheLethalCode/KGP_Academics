Ratnayake has promised to clean up Sri Lanka Cricket which has grown rich through lucrative television and sponsorship deals for the country's most popular sport. The minister also added he would replace the current interim committee headed by former spinner Somchandra de Silva next week. There was no immediate comment from the committee members. Ratnayake said he would appoint a new set of administrators to prepare for the cricket World Cup that Sri Lanka will co-host with India and Bangladesh in February-April.
