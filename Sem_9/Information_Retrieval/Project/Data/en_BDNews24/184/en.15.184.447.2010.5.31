 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--The allies of Awami League view the joint meeting between them and the ruling party's working committee, its advisory council and the parliamentary party as a 'positive' development. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will chair the meeting on Tuesday at her official residence, Gono Bhaban, at 7pm, Awami League joint general secretary and the prime minister's special aide Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif, told the media on Sunday. The joint meeting is the first of its kind, he said. Describing the meeting as positive, Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers' Party, said his party has been calling for all decisions to be taken unanimously. "We want all decisions to be made unanimously through meetings like this," he said. Jatiya Party presidium member Anisul Islam Mahmud said, "Such a meeting is ideal for the Grand Alliance." Claiming that although there were problems, there were also many successes for the government, the JP leader said, "It will be best for the Grand Alliance if problems can be resolved through such a meeting." It is expected that socio-economic and political issues will be raised at the meeting. Awami League's advisory council had only held its first meeting last Tuesday, following the party's national council on 23 July last year, though the central working committee meets regularly. Members of the advisory council called Hasina to strengthen the alliance and hold councils with the party's associate organisations. bdnews2
