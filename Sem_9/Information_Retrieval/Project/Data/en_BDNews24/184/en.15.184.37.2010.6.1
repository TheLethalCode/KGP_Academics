 Dhaka, June 01 (bdnews24.com)Thirty-nine Bangladeshis, languishing in jails for three months in the west African country of Liberia, returned home on Tuesday, officials said. They ended up in jail instead of getting the lucrative jobs the manpower agents promised them. "All of the 39 stranded Bangladeshis have returned," Zaman, an officer-in-charge of the airport's immigration department who gave only one name, told bdnews24.com in the evening. Foreign ministry sources say the Bangladesh Association for International Recruiting Agencies (BAIRA) and Bureau of Manpower Employment and Training paid for their repatriation. "The manpower agents promised us jobs with salaries ranging from $450 to $500 per month in addition to free accommodation and food," Nasir, one of the returnees, told bdnews24.com after landing at Shahjalal International Airport. He said the recruiting agencies took Tk 2,70,000 to Tk 500,000 per person promising jobs in a Norwegian company in Liberia. "They just left us in Liberia," said Nasir, a resident of Munshiganj district, who along with 38 others left Bangladesh on Jan 30. "We ended up in jail for three months instead of the promised lucrative jobs," he said. Saida Muna Tasneem, a foreign ministry director general (external publicity), told bdnews24.com that Bangladesh peace-keeping contingent in Liberia and the International Organisation for Migration supported the repatriation effort
