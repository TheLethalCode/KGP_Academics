<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court has asked the government to explain why it has not issued directives to remove a salt factory built after encroaching on the Buriganga River. It also ordered Lalbagh police chief to submit details of the factory's owner within seven days. The High Court bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Delwar Hossain issued the rule nisi on Sunday following a public interest petition by rights organisation, Human Rights & Peace for Bangladesh. The home secretary, BIWTA's chairman, Dhaka's deputy commissioner and Lalbagh police chief were asked to respond in three weeks. The petition related to a May 4 article in a national daily about the salt factory. Advocate Monjil Morshed who represented the NGO at the hearing mentioned that the High Court in a previous ruling on river protection had directed the removal of all illegal installations built on the four rivers surrounding Dhaka. "Building a salt factory by encroaching the Buriganga River is illegal and a violation of the High Court directive", he added. Deputy attorney general Nazrul Islam Talukdar argued for the government. bdne
