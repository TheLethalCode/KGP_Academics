 Karachi, May 31 (bdews24.com/AFP) -- Dubai and Abu Dhabi will stage their first-ever Test matches when they host Pakistan and South Africa in November, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Monday. Fear of suicide attacks in Pakistan, where the army is fighting militancy and the Taliban, have forced international fixtures to neutral venues because touring teams will not visit the country. The Tests -- the first in Dubai and the second in Abu Dhabi -- will be played after a Twenty20 international and five one-day matches spread between both venues. PCB chairman Ijaz Butt thanked Cricket South Africa (CSA) for helping to make it happen. "This series will provide great entertainment for cricket fans of both countries," Butt said. "PCB and CSA have worked hard to bring this event about and we are very excited to be returning to the facilities in UAE and hope it's a great series." Pakistan have played the West Indies, Australia and New Zealand in three limited-overs 'home' series in the United Arab Emirates since 2008 because of security fears back home. In 2002, Pakistan played a Test series against Australia in Sri Lanka and also Sharjah, in the UAE. CSA chief executive Gerald Majola said: "The Proteas always enjoy playing Pakistan and CSA was glad to assist the PCB and ensure this tour happened. "We are especially delighted that the fans will get to see top-flight cricket between these two teams."
