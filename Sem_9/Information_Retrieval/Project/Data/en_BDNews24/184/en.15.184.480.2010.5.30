 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Narcotics Control Act-1990 will be made up-to-date for prevention of smuggling, home minister Shahara Khatun said on Sunday. "The law will either be changed or reformed to prevent smuggling if needed," she told reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting on prevention of smuggling. "Smuggling cases have remained unresolved for years due to a lack of proper implementation of the law." Almost 23,000 cases remain unresolved and the law ministry has been asked to form a monitoring cell in this regard, the home minister said. Border Haat and barbed wire fence came up during the meeting, she said. In addition, the authorities concerned have been ordered not to pull up trains anywhere near the border areas except at stations to prevent smuggling. Initiatives will be taken to recover smuggled goods that are already inside the country, she said. Replying to a reporters' query, she said initiatives have been taken to arrest god fathers of smugglers. Shahara said she hoped that these initiatives would soon bear fruit. State minister for home Shamsul Hoque Tuku, among others, was present at the meeting.
