<TEXT>
 PARIS, May 31 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Novak Djokovic reached the French Open quarter-finals on Monday, convinced that the confident way he swept past Robby Ginepri makes him a potent threat to favourites Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. The third seeded Serbian saw off Ginepri 6-4, 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, reeling off 12 of the last 15 games, and will now face Jurgen Melzer, who ended Russian qualifier Teimuraz Gabashvili's run with a 7-6 (8/6), 4-6, 6-1, 6-4 win. Melzer, the oldest man left in the draw at 29, became the first Austrian to make the last eight since former champion Thomas Muster in 1998. "With the kind of game I performed in the third and fourth sets, I think I have a good chance against anybody on the court now," insisted 23-year-old Djokovic, a semi-finalist in 2007 and 2008. "It took me time to get into a rhythm out there and get warmed-up, but I'm not a morning person. "He was very aggressive from the start. He played well. I was lucky to pull out that first set. Second set, as usual in these tournaments, went the other way for my opponent. "Unfortunately I lost focus. But I overcame it. Third and fourth were really, really good. I was aggressive, I was serving well, and playing from all over the court." Djokovic had won all of his four previous meetings with world number 98 Ginepri, who had reached this stage after putting out 2003 champion Juan Carlos Ferrero in the third round. He broke in the 10th game to take the opening set before Ginepri, the last American player in the men's singles, hit back to level with breaks in the third and seventh games of the second. But that was as good as it got for Ginepri, a former US Open semi-finalist, as Djokovic dictated the remainder of the tie. Ginepri, a former world 15, had squeezed into the main draw in Paris after enduring a traumatic year which had brought him just win on the tour and no success at all on clay. After losing in a Bordeaux Challenger four weeks ago, the 27-year-old American then lost both matches he played at the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf. He then had to hire a van to reach Paris accompanied by compatriot Sam Querrey who he defeated in the first round here. Meanwhile, 22nd seed Melzer ended the run of world number 114 Gabashvili, the Georgia-born Russian who put out American sixth seed Andy Roddick in the third round. Gabashvili, who hadn't won back-to-back matches on the tour all year before Roland Garros, was hoping to be the first qualifier to reach the quarter-finals since Uruguay's Marcelo Filippini in 1999. But Melzer, who put out Spanish ninth seed David Ferrer in straight sets in the third round, triumphed in five minutes short of three hours with Gabashvili's 45 unforced errors to his opponent's 27 proving decisive. "It's very slippery out there on Court Suzanne Lenglen," said Melzer, who has never got this far in a Grand Slam. "I was 5-4 down, set point down. But I was still in it, and then set points again down in the tiebreaker. Somehow I cruised through that set. "I knew he had played a lot of matches and he would have to win three more and I wasn't going to make it easy for him. I made him hit a lot of balls." Later Monday, four-time champion Rafael Nadal tackles Brazilian 24th seed Thomaz Bellucci who he beat in the first round of Roland Garros in 2008. The winner of that clash will face either seventh seed Fernando Verdasco or Nicolas Almagro, the 19th seed, in an all-Spanish duel. Verdasco, who has yet to make the quarter-finals in Paris, has never lost to Almagro in three meet
