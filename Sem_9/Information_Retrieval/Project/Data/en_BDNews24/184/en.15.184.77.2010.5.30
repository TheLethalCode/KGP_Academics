 KARACHI, May 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Former players on Sunday lashed out at Pakistan cricket authorities for lifting a one-year ban on ex-captain Shoaib Malik, saying it would set a bad example. A one-man arbitration panel set up by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday accepted Malik's appeal against a one-year playing ban imposed for breach of discipline during foreign tours last year. Retired judge Irfan Qadir on Saturday halved the original two million rupees (35,000 dollars) fine, paving the way for Malik's return to international cricket. Former paceman Sarfraz Nawaz said the overturning did not bode well for the future of the game. "The PCB has taken a coward's stance," Nawaz told AFP. "It's a decision taken under political pressure and will damage Pakistan cricket in the future." Malik and all-rounder Rana Naved-ul were banned for one year and fined two million rupees each for breaches of discipline during Pakistan's tours of United Arab Emirates, New Zealand and Australia between November and February. The pair were among seven players who were fined and banned for indiscipline. Former captains Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf were banned for indefinite periods over infighting. Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi and Umar Akmal were fined heavily. Yousuf retired in protest, but the other six players appealed. The five remaining appeals were adjourned until next month. Nawaz said the PCB's decision was abrupt. "(The) PCB took a decision against discipline breaches but couldn't stand the pressure from political forces. I also question the authority of the arbitrator as well who doesn't have the credibility and authority to take such a decision," said Nawaz. Another former captain and ex-chief selector Amir Sohail said the PCB had been too quick to act. "The PCB has taken a hasty decision," said Sohail, who resigned as director of the national cricket academy after differences with PCB chairman Ijaz Butt last year. "To hide its own incompetence, the PCB targeted the players and after pressures from outside they abruptly lifted the ban." Another former chief selector Abdul Qadir said Malik's ban overturn will encourage bad behaviour. "By lifting the ban on Malik, the PCB has succumbed to political pressures," said Qadir, a former leg-spinner. "If the Board had taken a strong decision, it should have stuck to it come what may, but their decision will now encourage the players to violate discipline and get away with it." Qadir said other players like Younis should also be cleared. "Now it's the duty of the Board to clear other players also because it will be blamed to have done preferential treatment to one player after Malik is cleared," said Qadir. The PCB has denied Malik's ban overturn was politically motivated, saying the decision "was taken after Malik's behaviour was monitored for three mon
