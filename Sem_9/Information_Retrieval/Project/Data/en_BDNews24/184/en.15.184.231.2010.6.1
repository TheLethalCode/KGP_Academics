 Panchagarh, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  Three Indian nationals arrested for intruding into Bangladesh through Panchagarh border on Monday midnight were sent to jail. The chief judicial magistrate's court in Panchagarh ordered them to jail after they were produced before the court on Tuesday. The arrested were identified as Rajan Roy, 50, Shumon Roy, 35, and Manik Roy, 25, of Ghumti Sarkarpara village of Jalpaiguri district in India. BDR soldiers arrested them from Barashashi border area under Boda Upazila. Khairul Bashar, a BDR official of Barashashi, filed a case against them for intruding into Bangladesh territory. BDR handed them over to Boda police on Tuesday morning. Boda Police Station officer-in-charge Kaiser Khan said the three were moving suspiciously after entering Bangladesh. The arrested, however, claimed to be Bangladeshi nationals. They said they were inhabitants of Khansama under Dinajpur district and went to India several years back, but came back to Bangladesh after hearing of the death of a relative in Dinajpur. bdnews24.c
