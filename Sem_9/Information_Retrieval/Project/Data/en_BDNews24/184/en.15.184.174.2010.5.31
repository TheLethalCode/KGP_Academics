 Syed Nahas Pasha London, May 31 (bdnews24.com)Record number of Bangladeshis have got British citizenship in 2009, while the highest number of immigrants were also granted the citizenship, the UK government statistics say. According to the UK Home Office, 12,040 Bangladeshi were awarded citizenship in 2009, which was 231 percent more than in 2008. Britain started publishing citizenship statistics from 1962. More than 200,000 residents and immigrants attained British citizenship through applications in 2009--a new record. Of those immigrants, 50 percent got citizenship for living in Britain for a long period, 25 percent through their spouses and 25 percent by birth. Any resident, who lives as an immigrant in Britain for at least five years, is eligible to apply for citizenship by following certain conditions. The immigrants from the sub-continent top the list of those who got citizenship last year. Among those, 25,035 are Indians and 20,945 Pakistanis. According to the 2001 census, around 600,000 Bangladeshis are currently living in Britain. Their actual number, however, will be known after the 2011 census. The Home Office statistics say higher birth rates among residents of Bangladesh origin could be the reason behind the surge in citizenship for them. The British government has recently taken stricter position about granting citizenship. The knowledge of English is a must for the applicants, who also have to sit for the spoken and written English exams. This year, citizenships were issued upon the applicant's educational background, skills and earnings, resulting in a high number of applications. bdnews24.com
