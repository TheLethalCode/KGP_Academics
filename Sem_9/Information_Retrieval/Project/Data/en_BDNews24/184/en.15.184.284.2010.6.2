 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  At least 12 students of Eden College were allegedly assaulted by policemen on Wednesday during a meeting on the campus demanding investigation into sexual harassment of a fellow student by a doctor last month. According to news reports, a female student was assaulted by a doctor at his Dhanmondi chamber as she went there to receive treatment on May 9, 2010. Some students, who requested anonymity, told bdnews24.com that the policemen also took their pictures, threatening future action against them. Police also allegedly vandalised the loudspeakers used at the meeting. They, however, denied the allegations. Sub-inspector Imran Hosain of Lalbag police station told bdnews24.com that police did not assault any female student at the meeting. He, however, admitted that they just prevented students from using loudspeakers which were not allowed to be used on the campus. In protest of the police assault, students later chanted slogans demanding withdrawal of the police from the campus. They also informed their college authorities of this. Efforts to reach the college principal over phone were not successful as his cell phone was turned off. Students began their protest meeting on Wednesday demanding establishment of a medical centre at college campus and free supply of medicine, among others.
