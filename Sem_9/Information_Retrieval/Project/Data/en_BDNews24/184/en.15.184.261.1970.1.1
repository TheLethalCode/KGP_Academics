 JERUSALEM, June, 1 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Israel, still reeling from a botched commando raid on an international aid flotilla which killed nine activists, warned on Tuesday it will halt a new bid to breach its blockade of the Gaza Strip. The warning came as Israeli police jailed or deported hundreds of activists after commandos boarded their Gaza-bound vessels in international waters on Monday in a bloody pre-dawn raid which sparked global outrage. "We will not let any ships reach Gaza and supply what has become a terrorist base threatening the heart of Israel," deputy defence minister Matan Vilnai told public radio. Vilnai's remarks were made as organisers of the "Freedom Flotilla" said they were preparing to send two more aid boats to Gaza, despite the tragic ending to their high-profile mission to deliver humanitarian aid to the besieged Strip. Greta Berlin of the Free Gaza Movement told AFP a new attempt would be made to run the blockade but not for several days. "The Rachel Corrie (cargo ship) is currently located off the coast of Italy and the other boat is still being repaired," she said. Monday's raid turned into a fiasco, with live footage from the Turkish ferry Mavi Marmara showing black-clad Israeli commandos clashing with activists and several wounded people lying on the deck of the ship which was carrying hundreds of people. The Israeli military, which blamed activists on the ship for creating the confrontation by attacking its soldiers as they boarded the vessel, said nine passengers were killed in the fracas. The bloody ending to the humanitarian mission prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel a visit to Washington, where he had been due to hold talks with US President Barack Obama on Tuesday. Netanyahu expressed regret at the loss of life but insisted that the Israeli commandos had "defended themselves from a lynching" as they rappelled down from helicopters onto the ships. Israel's ambassador to Britain admitted the raid was not a success. "It's obvious, and I won't beat around the bush on this, that this wasn't successful," Ron Prosor told BBC radio on Tuesday , when asked if the raid had helped or hindered Israel. "I think that it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently." Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told delegates at an emergency session of the UN Security Council that Israel had "lost all legitimacy." A statement issued by the Security Council president Tuesday condemned the killing and wounding of civilians, requested the immediate release of all ships and civilians held by Israel and called for an impartial investigation. Authorities were set to deport 45 of the 686 passengers aboard the flotilla, interior ministry official Yossi Edelstein told army radio. Hundreds of others were in jail. At least one passenger, former US career diplomat Edward Peck, already has been deported, said flotilla organiser Berlin. Another 45 activists, most of them Turkish nationals, were being treated in various hospitals. Six soldiers also were hospitalised. Turkey said it was sending three ambulance planes to Israel to bring home 20 of its wounded nationals. Most of the dead were Turkish and their killings plunged into crisis the Jewish state's already fragile relations with Ankara -- once Israel's closest Muslim ally. Turkey recalled its ambassador and there were angry anti-Israeli protests in several Turkish cities. Britain France, Russia and China, all veto-wielding permanent council members, called for Israeli blockade of Gaza to be lifted -- in line with Security Council Resolution 1860 -- and for an independent inquiry. Israel issued an advisory warning its citizens against travelling to Turkey, but officials said there were no plans to recall its envoy. Ambassadors from the 27 European Union countries condemned Israel for using violence against the aid flotilla and demanded an impartial inquiry. Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas slammed the navy raid as "a massacre" and announced a three-day mourning period, while Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, called on the Palestinian leadership "to halt negotiations, direct or indirect, with Israel because of this crime." The six ships were on a mission to deliver some 10,000 tonnes of supplies to Gaza, which has been under a crippling Israeli blockade since 2007 when the Islamist Hamas movement seized control of the territory. Israel had warned that it would intercept the sh
