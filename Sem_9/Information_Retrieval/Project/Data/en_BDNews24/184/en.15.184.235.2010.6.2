<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Parliament's budget session starts on Wednesday afternoon without attendance of the main opposition BNP. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque said on Wednesday that his party would not join the opening session which starts at 5pm. The decision on whether to join the House later will be taken after a meeting of the BNP parliamentary party, he said. Hours before the session was due to start, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain explained that, "The government has not yet created any favourable environment for us to join parliament." "What happens in the House is ill speaking. So it is very uncertain whether we will attend in the future." BNP joined the fourth session but boycotted its final days. "We want to return to parliament. It is the responsibility of the government and the ruling party (Awami League) to create an environment for us," he said. Prior to the session starting, the business advisory committee will sit in a meeting with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair to fix the working days of the fifth session of the ninth parliament. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will attend the meeting. According to Parliament secretariat officials, finance minister AMA Muhith is set to table the national budget for 2010-11 fiscal on June 10. Chief whip Abdus Shahid said on Tuesday that he hoped that the BNP-led opposition would attend the crucial budget session for the sake of the country's vital financial interest. On the opening day, prime minister Sheikh Hasina will take questions from MPs for 30 minutes. bdne
