 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)Bengali-language daily Amar Desh publisher Hashmat Ali has been picked from home by security agency people on Tuesday morning, his family says. Some four members of an intelligence agency whisked Hashmat away from his Shahjahanpur home around 9am, the family told bdnews24.com. The pro-opposition newspaper's acting editor Mahmudur Rahman confirmed bdnews24.com at around 1pm that National Security Intelligence took Hashmat and were forcibly trying to file a case against him. No NSI officials nor the police admitted the detention. "This is reminiscent of June 16, 1975 when all but four newspapers were banned," Mahmudur said of Ali's detention. "Coincidentally, this is June again." "I have heard that he is being coerced into bringing charges against me," he told bdnews24.com. "Is this what they have learnt from the MoeenUddins, the perpetrators of 1/11?" "I guess they will try to file a case against me," he said. Mahmudur said he would make everything known at a news conference at the National Press Club at 5pm. Mahmudur took over the management of the newspaper in 2008. Later he sent a letter to the deputy commissioner for serving as editor of the newspaper. Since then he has been the acting editor of the newspaper. Hashmat's family said he has not returned home until afternoon. They do not even know where he is. A family member preferring anonymity said: "We are in danger. Please do not reveal our names." bdne
