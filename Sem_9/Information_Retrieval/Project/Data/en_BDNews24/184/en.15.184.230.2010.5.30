 Dinajpur, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Agitating students of Haji Danesh University of Science and Technology started an indefinite hunger-strike from Sunday. Students of agro-industrial and food process engineering (AFE) have been pressing the university for a long time to launch a masters programme. The protesters, at about 10am on Sunday, sealed several entrances of the university's administrative building. Tension broke out among the students as some teachers tried to unlock the doors. AFE dean professor Kamaluddin Sarker told bdnews24.com, "The university authorities have urged the students to withdraw their programmes. Their demand will also be considered." Even after the assurance, the students were hampering regular activities, Sarker added. He pointed out that putting the administrative building under lock and key breached disciplinary rules. The dean threatened to call for police assistance if the authorities failed to persuade the students to withdraw their movement. Ajit Kumar Das, a protester, however, told bdnews24.com that they would continue with their programmes until their demands were met. The protesting students first voiced their demands from a press briefing at the Dinajpur press club on May 22. On May 23, they informed the university's vice-chancellor of their demand. bdnews24
