 Dhaka, May 30(bdnews24.com)  Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has said the commission intends to initiate dialogues with political parties in the next two to three months about a new law that would determine who could be appointed members to constitutional bodies. He said this on Sunday at a conference of election commissioners of eight south Asian countries at a local hotel. The conference, among other things, discussed the method of appointments of election commissioners, and the terms and conditions of their jobs. Huda said appointments to constitutional bodies such as the Election Commission, Public Service Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General should be done through enactment of a separate law. "There is a provision in the constitution for framing laws in relation to appointments of members, other officers and their work. But it has not been done yet," he said. "We have prepared a draft mentioning the number of election commissioners and what pre-requisites should be put in place to determine their competence. We will discuss the matter with other SAARC countries and add some further propositions to discuss with political leaders." The tenure of the three-member Election Commission ends in February 2012. So far 10 CECs and 19 election commissioners have been appointed. Law minister Shafique Ahmed had last week said that he favoured a guideline in appointments of election commissioners and that if the Commission proposes it to the government, the government will look into it. Shafique said the government is extending all sorts of cooperation to strengthen the Commission. "We want honest and competent persons for the commission. If there are honest and competent persons,the EC will be strong". bdnews24
