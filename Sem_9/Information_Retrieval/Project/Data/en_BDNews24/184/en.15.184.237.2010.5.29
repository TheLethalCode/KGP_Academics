 Dhaka, May29 (bdnews24.com) -- BNP on Saturday warned of series of agitation programmes if the country-wide general strike scheduled on June 27 faced obstruction. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain issued the warning at a discussion marking the 29th death anniversary of former president Ziaur Rahman, also BNP founder, at the Institution of Engineers Bangladesh on Saturday. Delwar said, "We want to proceed in a peaceful and democratic manner." "We will be forced to launch a stronger agitation programme if the hartal is obstructed." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, BNP founder's wife, listened to the discussion sitting among the audience. Pointing to Khaleda Zia, Delwar said, "Don't worry. The people of this country have confidence in your leadership." "We will continue with the campaign after making June 27 general strike a success," he said. Delwar claimed, "There was a conspiracy to destroy multi-party democracy and make the state ineffective by declaring emergency on Jan 11, 2007." "The conspiracy still continues," he said adding that the ideology of Ziaur Rahman would survive beating all sorts of conspiracies. BNP standing committee member Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain said, "Amnesty International has expressed concern over human rights violation and extra-judicial killings during the tenure of the ruling government." He said, "But the law minister said there was no incident of cross-fire. They are lying to cover up all their failures." Senior BNP leader and former law minister Moudud Ahmed said, "The government will under no circumstance revive 1972 Constitution." "It will necessitate scraping special power act and provision for state of emergency, free market economy and Islam as state religion from the constitution which Awami League will never do," he said Chaired by Khandaker Delwar Hossain, the programme was addressed among others by BNP standing committee member Mirza Abbas, Rafiqul Islam, Nazrul Islam Khan and vice president Sadeque Hossain Khoka.
