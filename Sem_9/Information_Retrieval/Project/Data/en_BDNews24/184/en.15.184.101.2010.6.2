 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP will attend the budget session of the parliament beginning at 5pm on Wednesday, a senior leader has said. Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, who sits on the policymaking standing committee, told bdnews24.com they will join the key proceedings. He said party chairperson Khaleda Zia has decided to attend the session to protest a number of recent decisions including closure of the BNP-leaning Amar Desh and arrest of its editor, and other government activities. She asked all MPs to prepare to attend the first day of the fifth session, said Chowdhury, who is also an MP. But he did not make it clear at what time the BNP MPs will join. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque earlier said that his party would not join the first day. The decision on whether to join the House later will be taken after a meeting of the BNP parliamentary party, he added. Hours before the session was due to start, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain explained, "The government has not yet created any favourable environment for us to join parliament." "What happens in the House is ill speaking. So it is very uncertain whether we will attend in the future." BNP joined the fourth session but boycotted its final days. Prior to the session starting, the Business Advisory Committee will sit in a meeting with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair to fix the working days of the fifth session of the ninth parliament. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina will attend the meeting. According to parliament secretariat officials, finance minister AMA Muhith is set to table the national budget for 2010-11 fiscal on June 10. Chief whip Abdus Shahid said on Tuesday that he hoped that the opposition would attend the crucial budget session for the sake of the country's vital financial interest. On the opening day, the prime minister will take questions from MPs for 30 minutes. bdnews2
