 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Appellate Division on Wednesday stayed the High Court's cancellation of district- and sub-district level Freedom Fighters' Council elections by one week. Appellate Division chamber judge Mozammel Hossain gave the order on a government appeal. The court also asked the government to file a leave to appeal petition against the High Court order within the one-week time. State attorneys believe that the stay order has removed barriers to the election. "Following the order, the election could be held, as there is no more bar to it," said deputy attorney general Motahar Hossain. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and Motahar stood for the state during the hearing. The election was scheduled for Apr 17. But the High Court ordered cancellation of the schedule on May 26 following a petition by two freedom fighters, Shahabuddin and Yunus, challenging legality of district- and upazila-level election schedule. The High Court order, however, did not affect the Central Command Council election. bdnews24.com/corr/m
