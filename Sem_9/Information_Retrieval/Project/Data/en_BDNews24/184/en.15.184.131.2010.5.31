<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com) The government on Monday decided to extend the Speedy Trial Act until 2012 to ensure quick resolution of crimes like murder, extortion, vandalism, and mugging. The decision was made at a cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina, which gave final approval to the drafts of the Law and Order Disrupting Crime (Speedy Trial) Act 2010 in its weekly meeting, press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told journalists. Earlier on Apr 5, the cabinet approved the extension for a further two-year period. If the Act was not extended, it would hamper the ongoing cases, Azad said. The government made the decision even though the Awami League had opposed its introduction when it was originally enacted in 2002 by the ruling BNP, describing it as a "black law" designed to harass and persecute political opponents. The Act was subsequently extended three times; the last extension was made on Apr 9. Under the Act, a special court is required to dispose of a case within 90 working days. A further 30 working days can be granted if it cannot complete the process during that time. An aggrieved person is entitled to appeal to the High Court against a judgment of the Speedy Trial Tribunal within 30 days of the ruling. Monday's cabinet meeting also approved the draft of National Tourism Regulation 2010, the press secretary said. The meeting also approved in principal amendments to  Appointment and Working Conditions Act of Non-cadre Gazette Officers (Duty, Vat and Excise) 2000, the Customs Act 1969 and Value Added Tax Act 1991.
