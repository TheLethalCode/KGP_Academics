 Narayanganj, June 1 (bdnews24.com)At least 50 people, including 12 policemen, were injured on Tuesday when garment workers clashed with police at Sonargaon in Narayanganj. Workers of SA Fashion and Apparels blocked the Dhaka-Chittagong highway at Kanchpur demanding reinstatement of sacked workers, Sonargaon police chief Md Younus Ali said. They also torched one bus and smashed some 10-12 vehicles. Police clubbed the demonstrators in a bid to move them off the busy highway, leading to the two parties chasing each others. Police fired 25 rounds of bullet and teargas grenades to disperse the angry workers, Ali said. Traffic on the highway ground to a halt for an hour from 9am during the clash and resumed after the workers withdrew from the highway. The situation is now under control, the police officer said and added the injured were admitted to hospitals. Garment employee Mizan said authorities had sacked eight workers two days ago without any specific reason. "We have been demanding their reinstatement," he said. An official of the factory preferring anonymity said the workers had been sacked on disciplinary charges. About 7,000 workers are employed in the factory. bd
