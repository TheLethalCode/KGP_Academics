 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--The law minister says the government is determined to do away with the 39 year-old wound afflicting the country by holding trials for crimes against humanity during the 1971 liberation war maintaining international legal and human rights standards. Shafique Ahmed made the remarks on Monday at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of International Criminal Court at Kampala in Uganda on Monday, the ministry's information officer told bdnews24.com. Delegations from 111 countries are participating in the conference that will end on June 11. "Bangladesh government is committed to bring an end to the culture of impunity to such crimes as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes at national and international levels," Shafique told the conference. He also said that the Awami league government had already initiated the trial process against those who committed those crimes in 1971. Trial will be conducted in accordance with international legal and human rights standards, said the law minister. "This would bring justice to the victims; heal the wounds that we are carrying for the last 39 years, end the shameful legacy, and help Bangladesh move forward with its agenda of development," he was quoted as saying. The minister said Bangladesh was one of the 120 countries that voted in favour of adoption of the ICC Rome Statute. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina, in her previous term in office, signed the Rome Statute on Sept 16, 1999 in New York. Bangladesh is the third Asian country and the first in South Asia to sign the Rome Statute, which it ratified in March 2010. b
