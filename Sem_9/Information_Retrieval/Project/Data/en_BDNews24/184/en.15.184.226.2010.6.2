 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com) Finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith on Wednesday tabled a bill in the parliament for realizing 1 percent transfer fee on non-agricultural land in rural areas. The 'Income-tax Ordinance (amendment) Bill 2010' was tabled with a view to amending the Income-tax Ordinance, 1984. For further scrutiny, the draft law had been sent to the parliamentary standing committee on finance ministry before passage. The bill is expected to rectify the existing discrimination in collecting transfer fees of non-farming land in the rural and urban areas. As per the existing ordinance, the government collects 1 percent of the total value of the non-agricultural land worth up to Tk 100,000 at the source for transfer in the semi-urban areas outside the city corporations, pourashabas and cantonment boards. But the rule is not applicable to rural areas. "There are some problems in determining the value of the non-agricultural land in the rural area. "Therefore, the government committee in charge of evaluating the prices of land has suggested applying the rule in all areas," said the finance minister while justifying the bill. Muhith also initiated another new amendment bill for collection of three percent of the total value of land as registration fee irrespective of areas. As per the existing Stamp Act 1899, people in the urban areas pay 3 percent while the charge in the rural areas is 2 percent
