 Dhaka, June 2 (bdnews24.com)  Death toll from the building collapsed Tuesday night rose to 16 while 21 people were rescued from the rubble at the scene of the disaster at Begunbari in the city's Tejgaon, officials said Wednesday. Of the deceased, seven were identified as 'Kejen', 35, Azizul Huq, 32, Sahara Khatun, 30, 'Jahanara', 25, Shamsunnahar, 24, and Sharmin, 22. The five-storey building had fallen off its base onto tin-shed shanties around 11pm on Tuesday night. The rescue operation, which began just after the incident, was still underway. Fire service officials said 21 people have been pulled out of the rubble. They were sent to Dhaka medical College Hospital. Nazma Akhter, an official of the Dhaka region fire service, told bdnews24.com at 10:30 am: "The bodies were recovered from the tin-shed shanties crashed and mangled under the concrete building." A rescue team of the 14th Army Engineering Core joined the rescue drive with fire service, police and RAB personnel at around 2am. Snapped electricity cables and leaked gas pipes were hampering the rescue operation, deputy commissioner of Dhaka Muhibul Haque told reporters early on Wednesday. Tejgaon Industrial Police Station officer-in-charge Omar Faruk said the building had also crushed at least four three-storey tin-shed shanties by its side. The house, 18/B on Post Office alley, toppled around 11:15pm, trapping the inhabitants of the building and the shanties, he said. Nazrul Islam, rescued from the building with serious injuries, said the building toppled suddenly with a huge loud bang at around 10:45pm. He was rescued from the ground floor of the building after cutting the grill fence. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, director general of fire services, said, "The building fell on several tin-shed shanties." The building, on two kathas of land, with two two-room units on each floor, fell on its south. bdnews24.com correspondent Shyedul Islam Talat with Rifaat Newaz at the scene reported that the building, owned by one Abbas Uddin, was under construction beside a water body. Local people feared between 50 and 100 people might still remain trapped in the collapsed building and the adjacent shanties. But most residents of the five-storey structure escaped unharmed, they said. "We have seen two bodies under the debris," a local resident said. He said they had seen four more people trapped in the shanties but could not confirm whether they were still alive. Another person, trapped under the rubble, said that there were three dead bodies right beside him. The bdnews24.com correspondents said the approach towards the building site was very narrow preventing entry of rescue vehicles, delaying the rescue efforts. bdnew
