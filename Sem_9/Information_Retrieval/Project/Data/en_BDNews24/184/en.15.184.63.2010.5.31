 Dhaka, May 31 (bdnews24.com)--Australian high commissioner Justin Lee has called for slashing duties on Australian products and lifting non-tariff barriers to increase his country's trade with Bangladesh. Addressing a seminar on Australian-Bangladesh trade on Monday, the Australian envoy said the Australian businessmen were interested in investing in Bangladesh's energy sector. "Reduction of the duties (on Australian products) will contribute to the increase in bilateral trade and help the consumers with quality products from Australia," Lee told the seminar at Hotel Lake Shore in Dhaka. He said high tariff and non-tariff barriers on Australian dairy products and fresh fruits should be reconsidered. The high commissioner said businessmen used to pay 65 percent duty on fresh fruits and milk products while the tariff on liquified petroleum gas (LPG) was 24 percent.

He said Australia has been providing Bangladesh with duty-and quota-free market access since 2003. The volume of bilateral trade stands at Aus $495 million in 2008-09 fiscal year in Australia's favour. In 2007-08, the figures were Aus $ 281 million with Aus $ 43 million exports to Bangladesh. The Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry president Annisul Huq said the Australian businessmen could invest in Bangladesh's infrastructure and coal-based energy sectors. Australian trade commissioner for South Asia Peter Linford, former minister Mizanur Rahman Shelley, acting president of Australia-Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry Obaidur Rahman and its secretary Shakil Ahmed Khan also spoke
