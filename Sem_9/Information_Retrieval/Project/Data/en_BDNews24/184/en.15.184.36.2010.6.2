 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)At least two people died after a five-storey building in Begunbari in Dhaka fell off its base into an adjacent water body on Tuesday night. Tejgaon Industrial Police Station officer in charge Omar Faruk said the building had also crushed a number of tin-shed shanties by its side. Police initially feared a high number of casualties with a number of witnesses saying many more may have died. The fire service officials said 15 people have been pulled out of the rubble and rescue operations would continue through the night as more vehicles and equipment reached the scene. The house, 18/B on Post Office alley, toppled around 11:15pm, trapping the inhabitants of the building and the shanties, he said. Nazrul Islam, rescued from the building with serious injuries, said the building toppled suddenly with a huge loud bang at around 10:45pm. Abu Nayeem Mohammad Shahidullah, director general of the fire service, said, "The building fell on several tin-shed shanties." Rescue operations are going on jointly with the police and RAB, he said. The building, on two kathas, with two two-room units on each floor, fell on its south face. bdnews24.com correspondent Shyedul Islam Talat with Rifaat Newaz at the scene report that the building, owned by one Abbas Uddin, was under construction beside a water body. According to the correspondents citing witnesses, between 50 and 100 might still remain trapped under the building in the shanties. But the building did not have residents, they said. The fire service chief said that four persons have been rescued. "We have seen two bodies under the rubble." He said they had sighted four more people trapped in the shanties but could not confirm whether they were still alive. Another person, trapped under the rubble, said that there were three dead bodies right beside him. The bdnews24.com correspondents said the approach towards the building site was rather constricted preventing entry of firetrucks and rescue vehicles which were delaying rescue efforts. bdnew
