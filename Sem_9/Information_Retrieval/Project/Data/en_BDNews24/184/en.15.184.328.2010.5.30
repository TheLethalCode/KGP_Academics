<TITLE> Colombians head for presidential polls </TITLE>

 BOGOTA, May 30 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Colombians head to the polls on Sunday to choose from among nine candidates their next president, with former defense minister Juan Manuel Santos and former Bogota mayor Antanas Mockus neck-and-neck to replace President Alvaro Uribe. Sunday's ballot is the first round in the election, in which the nine candidates will be whittled down to just two -- likely Santos and Mockus -- in a knockout round on June 20. The latest opinion polls indicate a second round is unavoidable given how close the two top contenders are running -- around 35 percent each, with some of the trailing rivals, especially conservative Noemi Sanin and leftist Gustavo Petro gaining enough ground to carry some negotiating weight before the climax vote. The Organization of American States, which has sent 85 observers to the election, has warned Colombia's voting system -- manual count and results sent by phone -- could pose some difficulties. "The fragile polling system will be put to a test in a very close and important election," OAS observer mission chief Enrique Correa told AFP. Pre-election violence reared its ugly head Saturday with four people killed, including two soldiers who stepped across a rural mine field, and two children aged nine and 14 killed when a home-made-bomb was tossed inside a house. A Marxist rebel warning to voters in Colombia to stay away from presidential elections may have delivered a possible break to Santos, Uribe's chosen successor, who has said the threat was explicitly aimed at blocking ballots for him. Santos climbed to front of the pack in the election campaign by boasting of his 2004-2009 ministerial record of battling the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas. Uribe, who has to step down in August after completing the maximum two four-year terms, and failing to secure a constitutional change for a third term, is leaving office with a huge popularity rating for his successes in decimating the FARC. Victories include the 2008 liberation of one-time presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt and three US military contractors, and an incursion into Ecuador to kill a senior FARC figure, Raul Reyes. The rebels, though, continue to engender great fear in the population and remain active in half the jungle-covered country. Campaign rallies have been punctuated by slogans saying "No to fear" in reference to the 46-year-old FARC, the oldest insurgency in the Americas responsible for murders, kidnappings and extortion, and generalized crime. Most of Colombia's 30 million voters were expected to ignore the rebels' threat, as they did in 2006 when they re-elected Uribe despite the FARC's demand to the contrary. "The FARC intend to interfere in the elections. In some areas of the country they are threatening people to stop them from voting for me," said Santos, who has vowed to pursue Uribe's hardline policies against the rebels. Authorities reported combats Saturday in northern Bolivar department between the army and FARC guerrillas, but gave no casualty toll. On Uribe's eight-year watch, military spending has swelled from three percent of gross domestic product to 4.1 percent, boosting the security forces from 220,000 men to 425,000. Anti-FARC operations over the same period thinned the rebels' ranks from an estimated 17,000 in 2002 to around 7,500 today. The tough fight, though, also raised charges against Uribe's government of perpetrating human rights abuses and encouraging rightwing paramilitary forces as brutal as the FARC. It has also created friction with neighbors Venezuela and Ecuador, who resented the 2008 cross-border military raid against Reyes and Bogota's accusations that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez gave weapons and other support to the FARC. Mockus, for his part, has promised he would give no quarter to the rebels, either, though he also emphasized his neo-liberal economic policies. His base of support is the relatively better-off citizenry of the capital, while Santos has wooed Colombia's large population of rural and poorer voters. The last poll, published a week ago by the firm Ipsos Napoleon Franco, credited Santos with 34 percent of voter intentions in Sunday's election, and Mockus with 32 percent. The margin of error of 2.8 percent meant that was viewed as a dead heat. A former ambassador to Britain, Noemi Sanin was seen as a distant third with around six percent. In a knockout round between Santos and Mockus, the latter was tentatively seen as having the edge, 45 percent to 40 perc
