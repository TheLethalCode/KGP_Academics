<TEXT>
 TOKYO, May 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, his coalition fractured and his ratings sinking, brushed aside calls to quit on Monday ahead of an upper house election despite fading chances of the decisive win needed to smooth policy-making. Some calls have emerged in Hatoyama's Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for the premier to step down after a tiny leftist party bolted the ruling coalition in anger at his failure to keep a campaign pledge to move a US airbase off Okinawa island in southern Japan. But with time short and no guarantee that replacing Hatoyama would boost his party's fortunes in an upper house poll expected in July, analysts say Hatoyama will probably cling to his post. "If the sense of crisis mounts to such a level that they are ready to swallow someone who is less of a consensus maker, they may be ready to get rid of Hatoyama," said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano. Most pundits have tipped outspoken Finance Minister Naoto Kan as likely successor if Hatoyama quits. "But at the end of the day, Hatoyama would have to step down voluntarily and that's unlikely, though not impossible," Nakano said. Support for Hatoyama's government took another hit, falling as low as 17 percent in one of a spate of surveys published on Monday, after he fired the head of the tiny Social Democratic Party (SDP) from her cabinet post on Friday, prompting the party to leave the coalition two days later. The political furore is distracting the government as it thrashes out a plan to cut Japan's huge public debt and a strategy to engineer growth despite a fast-ageing population. Financial markets are keeping an eye on the political confusion, which has deepened since the Democrats swept to power last September, ousting the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) after more than 50 years of almost non-stop rule. "The political turmoil in Japan may not immediately deal a blow to the Japanese economy, but it may dampen foreign investors' appetite for Japanese stocks and stock falls may affect consumer sentiment, " said Junko Nishioka, chief Japan economist at RBS Securities. WOBBLY ON PLEDGES Equally if not more troubling for the government than the cabinet's ratings slide, a survey by the Yomiuri newspaper showed that 19 percent of voters now plan to cast their ballots for the main opposition LDP compared to just 14 percent for Hatoyama's party. Hatoyama has wobbled on a range of campaign pledges from cash allowances for parents to toll-free highways, although analysts say some glitches were to be expected given the raft of problems inherited from the LDP and the Democrats' attempt to change how Japan is governed by relying less on bureaucrats and focussing policies on consumers and workers rather than companies. In the latest blow to the struggling Hatoyama, the tiny SDP left the ruling bloc on Sunday after the premier gave up on his pledge to move a US Marine airbase off Okinawa, citing the lack of a viable alternative and the need to keep US-Japan ties tight given tension on the Korean peninsula. The SDP's departure could deprive the Democrats of some votes in the upper house poll, but will not topple the government since the Democrats have a big majority in parliament's lower house. Social Democratic Party leader Mizuho Fukushima said on Monday that her party would now find it hard to oppose a no-confidence motion against Hatoyama if other opposition parties submit one. A motion would have no chance of passing given the Democrats' lower house majority, but would be an embarrassment if his former allies back it. Hatoyama repeated on Monday that he planned to stay in his post, although most polls showed a majority of voters think he should resign and some Democratic Party lawmakers agree. But time is short ahead of the upper house poll, expected on July 11, and others in his party worry changing the premier so soon would remind voters of previous LDP-led governments, two of whose leaders threw in the towel after about a year in office. Nor is it clear just how badly the Democrats and their remaining partner, the small People's New Party, will do at the polls, since support for their main rival LDP remains limp. Analysts expect the coalition to fall short of a majority in the chamber but to cobble together the votes needed to enact bills smoothly from small new parties created by LDP rebels and the New Komeito, a former partner of the Liberal Democra
