 KOLKATA, June 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A major ally in the Manmohan Singh government won municipal elections in the swing state of West Bengal on Wednesday, dealing a blow to the ruling Congress party in a possible voter backlash over high inflation. The Trinamool Congress, a regional party based in West Bengal and the biggest ally of Singh's government, won 27 out of 81 seats, becoming the biggest single party in the state, according to the latest results from election commission. While it was not an outright win for 53-year-old Mamata Banerjee, head of Trinamool, it signalled her party's growing political momentum and could give her more weight within the ruling coalition. The ruling Congress party won only seven seats in what many analysts said was a vote against high inflation, currently at nearly 10 percent. Food inflation reached an 11-year high of 20 percent last December, although it has since cooled. "I accept the failure of Congress to come up to the expectation which we had," Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters after the results came through. Banerjee is railway minister and her party holds 20 seats in parliament, helping give Prime Minister Singh a majority. In the first year of the government, Banerjee has proved a difficult ally and has opposed major policy moves such as relaxing acquisition of farmlands and rises in state-regulated fuel prices. The vote was also a defeat for the communists of West Bengal, who won 18 seats. They lost last year's parliamentary elections in the state and they are widely expected to lose a state vote next year after being in power for nearly four decades. Congress and Trinamool joined together for the 2009 national elections. In this municipal election they ran on separate tickets after differences over seat allocations. "Inflation was one issue in the election that cost the Congress votes. They also suffered for fighting these elections on their own," said Amulya Ganguli, a political analyst. Prime Minister Singh is facing immense political pressure to tackle inflation which is threatening to undermine its support among India's poor who helped the coalition return to power for a second straight term a year ago. "The results show the Congress government has to think very carefully about rapid reforms and ways to counter inflation," added Mahesh Rangarajan, another anal
