<TITLE> Facebook ban sparks protest, loss </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Hundreds of Dhaka University students took to the campus streets on Sunday to protest the government temporarily shutting down the popular social networking website Facebook. They called the decision a contradiction to the government's 'Digital Bangladesh' vision and "interference with the right of expression". The students also said such a step would embolden radical Islamists who are demanding a complete ban on Facebook on charges of "blasphemous contents". On Friday, a number of religious organisations demanded closure of the site. Common people, however, appeared ambivalent about the issue as most of them do not have access to Internet and hence do not know what Facebook is all about. Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission blocked the site "for a while" on Saturday evening following requests from the elite crime busters RAB, a senior official confirmed to bdnews24.com. RAB arrested a youth from the capital early on Saturday for publishing caricatures of prime minister Sheikh Hasina and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. More than 400 million people worldwide use this social networking of which Bangladesh accounts for just over 875,000 users, mostly youth. And it is these young people who are finding the decision a contradiction with the government's 'Digital Bangladesh' vision-- a slogan featuring high on the ruling Awami League campaign pledges-- saying that blocking the site will bring no benefit. "Information should be free flowing. When that is hampered, people will only find more interest in finding ways to bypass it," educationist Prof Jamilur Reza Chowdhury told the media. And that is what exactly thousands of Facebook users have been doing since Saturday night. "There are a lot of free proxy server providers over the Internet. Anyone can easily access Facebook through those," Awad Islam, who studies at United International University, told bdnews24.com on Sunday. Dhaka University student Jannatul Ferdaus said she believes that such activities cannot be stopped by blocking websites. "A lot of girls are being abused in Facebook every day. Will they do the same for me?" All users cannot be blocked for something wrong done by one individual, she added. Businesswise, several software firms in Bangladesh develop content for Facebook, according to Habibullah N Karim, the ex-president of Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services. "This is a huge market. I have even made $1,000 a month," Mahfuz, who only gave one name, told bdnews24.com. According to him, making $500 per month is very common among the freelance developers. "I know a person who earns $8 per hour just through developing Facebook content." According to rough estimates, there are about 200 such freelancers, who are not engaged with any firm. And industry insiders say that there are in addition one or two firms who solely work for Facebook. "We make around $30,000 per month and we only develop content for Facebook," said a software firm owner, preferring anonymity. The block appears to have not only curbed the freedom of access but also may have thousands of foreign currency in lost business. bne
