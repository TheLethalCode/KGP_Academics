 Dhaka, June 01 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has condemned the Israeli attack on Turkish aid ships bound for Gaza strip that killed 10 Palestinian people on board. "Bangladesh is shocked and saddened at the unwarranted attack on unarmed civilians on board the Mavi Mrmara on May 31 and the resultant loss of lives," said a foreign ministry press statement issued Tuesday. "Bangladesh expresses its profound condolences and sincerest sympathy to the bereaved families, and joins in prayer for the eternal peace of the departed souls," the statement added. Dhaka also urged the international community to initiate a 'collective action' to end the Israeli siege immediately, and to allow the people of Palestine to lead a normal life. Israeli special commandos stormed the Turkish ship bound for Gaza, in a daring attempt to stop the aid flotilla heading for Gaza. They were carrying 700 unarmed volunteers and 10,000 tonnes of supplies for the beleaguered Palestinian people living in the Gaza strip. The military action triggered a diplomatic crisis for Israel, which drew widespread condemnation from all across except the United States, its principal backer. On its part, the US regretted the loss of life and demanded an impartial investigation into the tragedy
