 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com) The High Court has thrown out corruption charges against prime minister Sheikh Hasina over the appointment of a consultant for the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority. There remains no more cases against Hasina after the court quashed the BEPZA corruption case, her lawyer Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh said. The bench of justices Md Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddique in its ruling said Hasina did not make any crime by appointing the consultant, neither did she cause any loss to the state coffers, as alleged in the case. If such cases are allowed to be continued nobody will be able to do anything for the country, the court observed. The court said since the case details and charge-sheet did not reveal any crime against Hasina it would be synonymous to abusing the legal procedures if the case proceedings are allowed. The bench ended hearing the petition on May 25. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case against Hasina, former state minister for foreign affairs Abul Hassan Chowdhury and three others on Dec 11, 2001. The ACC claimed that this specific instance of corruption cost the state over Tk 1 million in losses. Charges were framed in June 2002. The High Court on Dec 14, 2002 stayed the proceedings of the case following a petition by Hasina to quash the case. The court also ordered the government to explain why the case should not be declared illegal. Fifteen cases have so far been filed against Hasina, nine cases during the BNP-led four-party alliance government regime and the six others filed during the military-backed caretaker government term. The most recent corruption case against Hasina quashed by the High Court was the Frigate graft case on May 18. The other cases include a 'Meghnaghat power plant' case, the 'NIKO' case, the 'Mig-29 purchase' case, the 'barge-mounted power plants' case, and the 'Novo theatre' cases. Among them, the Niko and barge-mounted power plants cases were filed during the caretaker government's term and the others when the BNP government was in office. Three extortion cases were filed against Hasina by businessmen Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, Noor Ali and Tajul Islam Faruque during the caretaker government regime. They later withdrew the cases, Hasina's lawyer Taposh said on Sunday. Hasina was exempted in the final chargesheet of the Paltan killing case, he said. She was also exempted in two other cases, the lawyer said. Taposh told bdnews24.com after Sunday's verdict that Hasina had been exempted from all the cases after nine years. "We have got fair justice, all cases have been quashed through legal procedures," he said. bdnew
