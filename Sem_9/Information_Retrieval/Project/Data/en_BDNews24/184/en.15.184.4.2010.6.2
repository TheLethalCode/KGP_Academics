 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)-- Before the budget session got down to business, the main opposition BNP walked out of the parliament shortly after it had begun at 5pm on Wednesday. BNP's Moudud Ahmed stood up for a point of order as speaker Abdul Hamid was giving floor to prime minister Sheikh Hasina for taking questions for the first 30 minutes of the opening day. Hamid promised the BNP leader floor provided the opposition MPs to listen to the prime minister first, saying :"This is not the right time." "There is no scope in the Rules of Procedure to give point of order during the question-answer hour," Hamid explained. After the speaker's ruling, Moudud silently led the BNP MPs out, mainly to avoid the prime minister's question-answer hour, the BNP insiders say. "You are not abiding by the Rules of Procedure. This is really unfortunate," said Hamid. Earlier, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury MP, who sits on the policymaking standing committee, told bdnews24.com they will join the key proceedings. He said party chairperson Khaleda Zia had decided to attend the session to protest a number of recent decisions including closure of the BNP-leaning Amar Desh and arrest of its editor, and other government activities. Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque on Tuesday said that his party would not join the first day. The decision on whether to join the House later will be taken after a meeting of the BNP parliamentary party, he added. Hours before the session was due to start, BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain explained, "The government has not yet created any favourable environment for us to join parliament." BNP joined the fourth session but boycotted its final days. Prior to the session starting, the Business Advisory Committee will sit in a meeting with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair to fix the working days of the fifth session of the ninth parliament. Prime minister Hasina attended the meeting. According to parliament secretariat officials, finance minister AMA Muhith is set to table the national budget for 2010-11 fiscal on June 10. bdnew
