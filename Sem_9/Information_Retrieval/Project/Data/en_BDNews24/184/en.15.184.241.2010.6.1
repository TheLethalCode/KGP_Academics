 Dhaka, June 01 (bdnews24.com)--A parliamentary panel has rejected a proposal to acquire over 900 acres of land near Uttara for setting up a training facility for the armed forces. The parliamentary standing committee on land ministry at its meeting Tuesday recommended that the proposed training facility should be located outside the metropolis considering huge expansion of the city to accommodate a growing population. "The committee chairman has raised the issue at the meeting. The committee recommended building the military training facility outside, not inside the city," Benjir Ahmed, a committee member, told bdnews24.com over telephone. He said the committee made such recommendation as Dhaka city had been witnessing huge expansion every day. "We have just discussed the issue, but made no formal recommendation on this yet", A K M Mozammel Huq, the committee chairman, told bdnews24.com. "This is not an issue to be reported as there was no specific proposal for setting up the training facility," said Huq. His portrayal of the matter as a nonissue appears to avoid a confrontation with the military. The parliament secretariat, however, issued a press statement, saying, "Considering the convenience of the city dwellers, the committee has suggested the ministry (land) not to acquire 916.35 acres of land for a military training facility"
