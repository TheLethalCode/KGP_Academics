 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)--The detained 55 Jamaat-e-Islami activists were sent to jail on Monday after showing them arrested in a case filed in February when the Jamaat-backed Islami Chhatra Shibir activists clashed with police. Police arrested them at Paltan as they were attempting to defy a police ban and bring out a procession. Dhaka's Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Ali Hossain ordered them into jail following a request from the investigation officer on the case. The court also ordered the jail authority to let one of the arrestees, third-year student Nurul Islam of Dhaka Kabi Nazrul College, sit exams in the prison. Paltan police sub-inspector Shamsur Rahman Khan, the investigator, produced the arrestees to the court. Police on Saturday banned rallies and processions at Paltan as Jamaat and pro-government Jubo League scheduled their rallies at the same venue on Monday. The Jamaat-e-Islami and Chhatra Shibir activists clashed with the police on Feb 12 as they tried to take out a procession in protest against the killing of a Shibir member and subsequent countrywide crackdown on their supporters. Nine were arrested during the clash that ensued when police barred the activists from bringing out a procession from Baitul Mukarram National Mosque after the Juma prayers. IO Khan in his report said all the suspects were members of the Jamaat and its associate organisation. "They gathered at the west side of Culvert Road at Paltan defying the ban, hurled police with brickbats and obstructed police duty." Counsel for the suspects, Abdur Razzaque, however, denied the allegations. "The suspects were arrested from different parts of Dhaka over the Paltan rally called by Jamaat," he told bdnews24.com. Paltan police chief Shahidul Haque said the men were detained early on Monday following a joint operation of the Motijheel and Paltan police. Police said the activists were trying to organise a procession coming out of Baitul Mukarram mosque after Fazr prayers
