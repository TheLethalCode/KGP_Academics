 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Dhaka has sided with the America-backed South Korea over a row between the two neighbours in the Korean peninsula. Bangladesh voiced its concern over the alleged sinking of a South Korean frigate by North Korea. The government stated on Sunday that such incidents were threatening regional peace. "Bangladesh expresses its deep concern at the sinking of the vessel and conveys to the government of the Republic of Korea sincerest condolences for the lives lost in the incident," the foreign secretary told reporters at a press conference in the ministry. "Such incidents can destabilise peace and security in the Korean peninsula," Mohamed Mijarul Quayes said. The secretary continued that Dhaka has called on the international community to ensure that such incidents do not recur. Bangladesh's official reaction came in the wake of South Korea's urge to condemn the alleged North Korean attack on the ship 'Cheonan' on March 26 this year. Foreign ministry sources say Bangladesh's economic involvement with South Korea is more than the reclusive North. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina's latest visit to South Korea has further strengthened the ties. Seoul has promised taking in more workers from Bangladesh the next year. Seoul will recruit 4,400 instead of present 3,800 Bangladeshis next year. The two countries have agreed to strengthen their ties in the field of trade, defence, energy and environment. Seoul alleged that North Korea attacked the ship killing 46 on board. The international community, led by the US, investigated the incident and concluded that the ship was sunk by the communist country's weapons. North Korea denied the allegation. Seoul has severed all commercial relations with Pyongyang. The socialist country threatened to retaliate with a full-scale war against South Korea. US foreign secretary Hillary Clinton last week flew to China, North Korea's main ally, to secure international support for punishing the North. However, Beijing refrained from supporting the western move and sought more evidence on North's involvement in the ship's sinking. bdnew
