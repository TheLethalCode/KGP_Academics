 Chittagong, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong City mayoral candidate M Manzur Alam has sought to woo apparently divided BNP leaders and supporters to work for him, saying he is only following the directions of party chairperson Khaleda Zia. Manzur on Sunday made the request at a BNP meeting held to mark the death anniversary of the party's founding president Ziaur Rahman. Standing committee member Goyeshwar Chandra Roy and leaders of Chittagong city BNP were present at the meeting. The candidature of Manzur, who filed nomination papers from Chittagong Development Movement, was endorsed by the BNP. Manzur said, "I am working in line with the madam's directions and will continue to do so." Earlier in the day, Manzur attended a city BNP meeting and placed wreaths at a grave of Ziaur Rahman at Rangunia. He also attended several other programmes in the city marking the death anniversary and campaigned for the upcoming CCC polls. bdnews24.com
