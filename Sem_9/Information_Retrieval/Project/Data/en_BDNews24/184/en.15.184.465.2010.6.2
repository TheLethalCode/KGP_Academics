<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has told parliament that the government should rethink its policy about checking the country's population. "Many countries in the world are worried about their decreasing population, because, there are not enough young people," Hasina told parliament while answering the question put by Awami League MP Khan Tipu Sultan who advocated checking Bangladesh's population boom. "I don't consider our population as a problem. They are our resources," she said amid desk-thumping from the attending MPs. She said population control measures were going on. "We will educate our boys and girls and send them across the world," said Hasina. In reply to a separate question from Gazi Golam Dastagir MP, the prime minister said that the upcoming labour policy, to be formulated under the Vision-2021, will secure gender equity. The policy will also include welfare of the workers abroad, she added. Hasina also pointed that the garment factory owners need to be more sympathetic on the workers. "Owners must oversee if the workers are paid properly against their labour." Moreover, she said, "A wage commission has been established and decisions will be implemented on the basis of overall consultations." Rashed Khan Menon asked her about formation of the commission. Replying to a question from Hasanul Huq Inu, the prime minister said that her government was keen to ease problems of farm workers. Citing the current government as friendly to agriculture, Hasina said that the government has undertaken different programmes for the farmers in flood-affected haor areas. bdnews2
