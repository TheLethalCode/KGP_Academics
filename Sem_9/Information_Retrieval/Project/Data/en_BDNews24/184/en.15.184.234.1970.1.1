 Dhaka, June 02 (bdnews24.com)  BNP standing committee member Moudud Ahmed has alleged in parliament that an 'invisible government' was running the democratically-elected government. Speaking on a point of order on Wednesday, the former law minister said the Awami League government had been ruling the country in the same style as that followed by the military-backed interim government that resorted to torture. A military-backed government had assumed government in Jan 2008 and declared a state of emergency until the national elections in Dec 2009. Moudud stood to protest the closure of the Bengali BNP-leaning newspaper, Amar Desh, and arrest of its acting editor Mahmudur Rahman. "The country is being run in line with the culture of torture and injustice introduced by the immediate-past military-backed caretaker government," said Modud before leading the second walkout on the first day of the budget session. "We had hoped that there would be no closure of newspaper under this democratically elected government. We had hoped that a smooth democratic system would be in place," he said, terming the Awami League an advocate of 'one party rule'. The BNP MP said similar to the actions of the previous military-installed caretaker government, the publisher of Amar Desh was whisked away by intelligence agency officials who forced him to sign on a white paper. "It means that an invisible quarter is running the country from behind the scenes. It seems there is government within the government. There are wheels within wheels," said Moudud suggesting that the inner wheel was the one that turned the government outward wheel. He said Amar Desh editor was arrested on the same day that a case was filed against him. BNP said that Awami League shut the newspaper as Amar Desh criticised the government. "The caretaker government arrested BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia immediately after a case was filed. The same happened to Tarique Rahman," said Moudud. He demanded that the government allow resumption of Amar Desh publication and release of its acting editor
