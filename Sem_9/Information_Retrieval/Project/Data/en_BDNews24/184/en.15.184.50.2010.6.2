 BETHLEHEM, Palestinian Territories (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said on Wednesday he will ask US President Barack Obama to take "bold decisions" on Middle East peace during an upcoming visit. "My message to Obama during our meeting in Washington next week will be that we need bold decisions to change the face of the region," Abbas said at the opening of a Palestinian investment conference in the West Bank. Abbas was to meet with US envoy George Mitchell later in the day for the latest round of indirect "proximity" talks with Israel launched on May 9. "My message to all parties is that we need bold decisions to change the face of the region and end the suffering and the pain and the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands," Abbas said. He added that he hoped to see the Middle East transformed "from a region of terrorism, as they call it, to a region of building and of peace, and to give an opportunity for the whole world to participate in the peace process." The Palestinian leader spoke at the opening of the 2010 Palestine Investment Conference, which Abbas referred to as the "Freedom Conference" in honour of those killed on Monday aboard an activist aid flotilla bound for Gaza. Abbas accused Israel of "state terrorism" over the violent seizure of the ships by naval commandos in a botched assault in which nine activists were killed and scores wounded, including some Israeli soldiers. "The Palestinian people were facing state terrorism when Israel attacked the Freedom Flotilla. The Palestinian people and the entire world are confronted with this terrorism," he said. "We saw terrorism against innocent volunteers and we have seen daily examples of terrorism with the killings and the expulsions from houses, the confiscation of lands and the siege on Gaza. "We ask the world, how long will this go on? It's a big question. When will this tyranny and occupation end, and when will Israel respect the freedom of the Palestinian people?" At the opening of the business conference, attended by dozens of international delegations, participants observed a moment of silence for those killed aboard the ships. "Just as the Freedom Flotilla came to break the siege on Gaza, this Freedom Conference is in order to break the siege on the Palestinian economy," Abbas said. There was a roar of applause and a standing ovation when Abbas hailed Turkey's harsh response to the raid on the aid flotilla, which had been strongly backed by Ankara. On Tuesday, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan had slammed the operation as a "bloody massacre" and urged the world to punish Israel for its "lawlessness" in a speech that helped transform him into a Palestinian hero. Ankara had earlier recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv and scrapped planned joint military exercises with Israel, plunging already tense relations between the two once close allies into a new cri
