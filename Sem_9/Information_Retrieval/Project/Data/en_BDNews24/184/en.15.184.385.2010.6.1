<TEXT>
 Dhaka, June 1 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League and its allies in the grand alliance have started talks at Ganabhaban. This meeting of all the ruling alliance members is being held for the first time after the Awami League came to power. It began at around 7:30pm on Tuesday. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina is presiding over the meeting set to discuss social, economic and political issues. The ruling party's central working committee, advisory council and the parliamentary party is also expected to be in the meeting. The alliance view the meeting as a 'positive' development, especially in the context of a sense of deprivation among some of the major allies of the government. Awami League joint general secretary and the prime minister's special aide Mahbub-Ul-Alam Hanif earlier said the joint meeting would be the first ever. Rashed Khan Menon, president of the Workers' Party, said his party has been calling for all decisions to be taken unanimously. "We want all decisions to be made unanimously through meetings like this," he said. Jatiya Party presidium member Anisul Islam Mahmud said, "Such a meeting is ideal for the grand alliance." He said despite the problems, there were many successes for the government. "It will be best for the alliance if problems could be resolved through such a meeting," the JP leader said. Awami League's advisory council had only held its first meeting last Tuesday, following the party's national council on 23 July last year, though the central working committee meets regularly. Members of the advisory council called on Hasina to strengthen the alliance and hold councils with the party's associate organisations. bdnews
