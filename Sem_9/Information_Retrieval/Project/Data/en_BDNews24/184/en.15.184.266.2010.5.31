<TITLE> Dhaka to get $100m climate aid </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 30 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh is set to receive $100 million as aid initially upon joining the EU-backed Global Climate Change Alliance (GCCA). Environment state minister Hasan Mahmud announced establishment of a Bangladesh Climate Change Resilience Fund (BCCRF) at the inauguration of a two-day regional climate conference on Sunday. Initial pledges total some $100 million from several EU countries including the UK, Denmark and Sweden, according to a participant, with more pledges still coming in until Sunday evening. Participants privy to proceedings behind closed doors told bdnews24.com that although pledges were being made there was no guarantee that these funds would be 'above and beyond' the funds European countries had already pledged, which has been a constant demand of the Bangladesh government. Ministers and high officials from Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, Myanmar, the Maldives and Nepal are taking part in the conference mainly organised to launch and showcase the GCCA initiative. Bangladesh is set to sign a bilateral agreement with the European Union upon conclusion of the conference. According to Saleemul Huq, a lead author of Fourth Assessment Report of IPCC, the top climate body in the world, the bilateral agreement is to put in place a framework under which the EU would provide climate aid to Bangladesh. Huq is also taking part in the conference. The Bangladesh government has already allocated another $100 million fund from its resources to deal with the adverse impacts of climate change triggered by global warming as the sun's heat is trapped in the atmosphere by greenhouse gases emitted by industries. It is speculated that the EU initiative aims to pressure the United States and other major polluters, particularly the advanced developing countries like India, Brazil, South Africa and China (that form the BASIC countries), into accepting a legally binding global climate agreement and obligatory emission cuts. But Huq said that there was no such indication on the surface. "And we will take it on face value." According to experts closely working with the Bangladesh government on climate change, the new alliance mainly including the poor countries vulnerable to climate change could also strengthen Bangladesh's move for constituting a 'Most Vulnerable Countries' group within the UN framework as a separate negotiating group. They also speculate that entering into an 'alliance' with the European Union might limit Bangladesh's negotiating options due to an obligation, implied or otherwise, to support the EU position in global climate negotiations. "But this is more like a making a deal with the lesser devil to keep the worse devil at bay," said a climate expert, who was on the Bangladesh government delegation at the last UN climate summit in Copenhagen, suggesting that the position of the United States, India, China or Brazil was more regressive than that of the EU. He also suggested that Bangladesh might gain more from stronger negotiations with the EU. Also head of the UK-based International Institute for Environment and Development, Huq, however, said such speculations looked too far ahead and things had not matured that much. He did not agree that there was much scope to negotiate with the EU over the agreement at hand. "And this agreement does not necessarily have to be detrimental to Bangladesh." Huq was of the opinion that if the poor countries could agree on progressive issues and get EU endorsement, it would not limit negotiating options. The climate conference is being attended by a EU climate delegation, including Connie Hedegaard, currently the EU commissioner for climate action. Hedegaard chaired the first part of the Copenhagen climate summit as the Danish minister for climate and energy, but stepped down as the high-level segment began. There were strong criticisms from a number of developing country delegates about Hedegaard's autocratic style of conducting the negotiations. The environment minister is expected to brief the press about the GCCA initiative and the agreement on Monday afternoon in a press briefing. The GCCA initiative will also be launched in Africa, Pacific and the Caribbean after the Asian regional conference in Dhaka. The EU is expected to enter into similar agreements with the Maldives and Cambodia as wel
