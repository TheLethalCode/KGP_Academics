<TITLE> BP, Obama face clamour to halt oil spill `crime' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 VENICE, La. May 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US lawmakers and the American public clamoured on Sunday for BP and the Obama administration to do more to save the US Gulf Coast from an out-of-control oil spill that one congressman called an "environmental crime". The failure on Saturday of a "top kill" technique attempted by British-based BP to try to seal its leaking Gulf of Mexico well unleashed a surge of anger and frustration that poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama. Obama, who has called the leaking BP well a "manmade disaster", is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the nearly six-week-old spill, now known to be the worst in US history. The crisis could swell into a political liability for the Democratic president as his administration and party, bloodied by bruising healthcare and economic policy debates, head towards key mid-term Congressional elections in November. "This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country," top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told NBC's "Meet the Press." British energy giant BP, its reputation and market value already battered by the catastrophic spill, and the entire US oil industry face more and more probing questions about why safety backups did not accompany their relentless hunt for more oil in ever deeper offshore waters. "I think without question if the word criminal should be used in terms of an environmental crime against our country, that what's going on in the Gulf of Mexico is going to qualify," Massachusetts Democrat Congressman Ed Markey said. Department of Justice officials are part of an ongoing federal investigation into the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the spill, and the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of a criminal prosecution. Markey, who chairs a select committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, pilloried BP for its repeated failed efforts so far to shut off the gushing seabed well. "BP has been making it up as they go along ... They do not know for sure what the result is going to be of anything which they are doing," he told CBS' "Face the Nation." In Louisiana, which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far, senators and local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush into place a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up and joining up outlying sandbanks and islets. "I'm devastated ... We are dying a slow death, every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh, a piece of Louisiana is gone forever," said Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines parish, where the oil has clogged wetlands. "Even the government seems powerless and all the experts. If these people can't stop it, then who in the name of God can?" Father Gerry, a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulpur, La., said, his voice heavy with emotion. "OIL COMING UP 'TIL AUGUST" After giving up on Saturday an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to "kill" it, BP engineers are now pursuing another option from their undersea toolbox to try to contain the seabed oil gusher. But BP warns that the new procedure, which will try to fit a containment cap over the leaking well, could take between 4 and 7 days. Even then success is not guaranteed because it has never been attempted before at the depth -- a mile(1.6 km) down -- where the oil is leaking. BP Managing Director Robert Dudley told NBC's "Meet the Press" the company would know by the end of the week whether the new containment effort worked. The next BP step would involve undersea robots using diamond-rimmed saws to cut off a pipe over the well to put in place a containment device that would try to siphon off most of the leaking oil and gas up to a tanker ship on the surface. Dudley said he did not think BP CEO Tony Hayward, who has faced heavy criticism, should be forced to resign. A surer solution to the leak, a relief well already being drilled, will only be finished in early August. This means crude oil continues to spew out daily, feeding a huge, fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana. "There could be oil coming up 'til August." Browner told CBS's "Face The Nation," "We are prepared for the worst." Louisiana Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu called on BP to immediately invest $1 billion to protect marshes, wetlands and estuaries across the region. "While we may not be able to plug the leaking well right away, there is nothing that should stop us from getting help to the Gulf Coast immediately," she said. She and Louisiana Republican Senator David Vitter urged BP and the government to immediately fund and support the plan to use dredging materials to create the offshore island barrier. In the Venice, Louisiana, area, oil clean-up operations were temporarily suspended on Sunday for safety reasons because of severe thunder and lightening storms, the Coast Guard said. OBAMA'S "KATRINA"? Gulf residents fear the spilled oil could be whipped further inshore by what promises to be the most active Atlantic storm season since 2005, the year of Hurricane Katrina. That deadly storm proved a political disaster for President George W. Bush, who was accused of complacency in handling it, and Obama is fighting to prevent the Gulf spill from becoming his own "Katrina" ahead of the November Congress elections. Louisianians still recovering from Katrina's devastation were frustrated by the oil spill response. "It's been a screw-up from day one. Nothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond," said Claude Marquette, a retired physician, 68, speaking as he sat with his wife in his boat. BP's Hayward had predicted that despite risks, the "top kill" had a 60 to 70 percent chance of success. He said he did not know why it failed to stop the gusher. The misstep is likely to drive his credibility lower, along with his company's market value, which has dropped by 25 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20, killing 11 workers, and triggering the spill. The government estimated last week that 12,000 to 19,000 barrels (504,000 to 798,000 gallons/1.9 million to 3 million liters) a day are leaking from the well. At that rate, the government now knows that the Gulf disaster has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan waters. Obama on Saturday called the continuing spill "as enraging as it is heartbreaking.
