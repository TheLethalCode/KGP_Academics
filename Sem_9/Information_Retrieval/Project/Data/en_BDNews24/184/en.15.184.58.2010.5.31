<TEXT>
 Sylhet, May 30 (bdnews24.com)  BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal has called an indefinite strike at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology from Monday in protest at attack on its leaders that left three injured. University unit's convenor SM Jahangir, Al Amin Russel and 'Mehedi' were injured when pro-government Bangladesh Chhatra League activists allegedly beat them on Sunday evening near the central mosque. Jahangir claimed that the BCL members pounced on them without any instigation. The strike would continue until those responsible are punished, he told reporters. The BCL, however, denied the allegations and countered that the JCD leaders entered the campus with outsiders Gazi Liton, 'Jamal' and 'Murad'. They sat in a secret meeting at the central mosque after a Milad Mahfil. BCL convenor Mostafizur Rahman Raju alleged that JCD was trying to destabilise the campus by bringing in outsiders. He said they had only stopped the meeting. Proctor SM Saiful Islam denied any knowledge of the strike. He also said he was not aware of any outsiders entering the campus and promised steps against those guilty if the claims were proved right. bdnews24
