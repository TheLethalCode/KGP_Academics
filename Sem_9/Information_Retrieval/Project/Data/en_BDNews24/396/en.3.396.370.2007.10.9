 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  The National Board of Revenue has asked commercial banks to give information on accounts of another 55 people, its chairman said Tuesday. The banks have also been directed to suspend banking transactions of nine persons. Accordingly, the banks Monday suspended transactions and asked the branches to come up with information on accounts. Industrial entrepreneurs, businessmen, politicians and their family members, and officials of Hawa Bhaban, which was the informal nerve centre of BNP administration, are on the new list. The Central Intelligence Cell of the NBR has already sent two lists to the chief executives of the commercial banks. "[The move] is part of the ongoing drive against corruption. This is nothing new," NBR chairman Badiur Rahman told bdnews24.com by telephone. The cell had written to the banks seeking information on the sources of income of the account holders in question and asking them to investigate if they had dodged tax payment. It also asked the banks to send information about current, savings, fixed deposit, loan account, foreign currency account, credit card, wealth in vaults or lockers, savings certificates and any other credit or debit operations of the listed persons in seven days. Withdrawal and transfer of money from the accounts of those whose accounts had been frozen have also been suspended. The NBR had earlier sought information on bank accounts of former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. bdnews24.
