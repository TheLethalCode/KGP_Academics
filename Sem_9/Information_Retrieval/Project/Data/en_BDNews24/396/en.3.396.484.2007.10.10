 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The government has appointed 179 officials as judicial magistrate in the first clear effort to separate the judiciary from the executive, an official said Tuesday. Updates with more details There was no official announcement from the government in the form of a circular, but a senior official of the Supreme Court confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed told bdnews24.com: "The judicial magistrates were appointed on merit." The government made the appointments to the important post in consultation with the Supreme Court in line with the constitution. The appointments came as part of efforts to implement the verdict in the Mazdar Hossain Case to carve out a free judiciary. Of the 179, 41 have been appointed as chief metropolitan magistrate and chief judicial magistrate, 60 as additional metropolitan magistrate and additional metropolitan judicial magistrate, 11 as metropolitan magistrate and 67 as judicial magistrate. All will be working under the judiciary, not the executive. Asked on what criteria the judicial magistrates were appointed, Iktedar told bdnews24.com that efficiency, merit, qualifications and honesty were the yardstick of the appointments. He also said the law ministry and the Supreme Court took the decision after reviewing the records of officials. Iktedar said an amended Criminal Procedure Code for the separation of the judiciary comes into effect on Nov 1. "From that day, the judicial magistrates will conduct trial directly under district and sessions judges," he said. The Supreme Court on Sept 27 in a full-court meeting of all the judges of the Appellate and High Court divisions, chaired by chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, recommended implementation of the amended CrPC. The judges of the Supreme Court and high judicial officials would give guidelines to the chief metropolitan magistrates and chief judicial magistrates on October 17 and to the district and sessions judges on October 18 on how to discharge their new responsibilities. Chief justice Md Ruhul Amin, Appellate Division judge MM Ruhul Amin and High Court judges Mirza Hossain Haider, Kamrul Islam Siddiqui, law secretary Kazi Habibul Awal and Supreme Court registrar Iktedar Ahmed will speak at an orientation programme at the Judicial Administrative Training Institute. bdnew
