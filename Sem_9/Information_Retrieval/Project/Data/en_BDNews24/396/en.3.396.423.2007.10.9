<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank Tuesday framed regulations to govern bank transactions with foreign money transfer companies. Bangladesh Bank sent a circular to banks in a move that came in response to a case of fraud by a London-based money transfer company last June. First Solution failed to send remittances from expatriate Bangladeshis in London and then declared bankruptcy. The BB regulation asked banks to confirm the legitimacy and financial support of the companies and to require adequate security deposits before signing deals with them. The central bank said it would take punitive action against non-compliant banks. The regulation specified that the foreign money transfer companies with which local banks did business should have licences from the central bank of their country of origin. It further required that remittances be deposited in bank accounts within 24 hours, and clarified that Bangladesh Bank's name or monogram must not appear in advertisements. The required bank guarantee has been increased to $50,000 from $25,000 in order to compensate clients in the event of bankruptcy. bdnews24.c
