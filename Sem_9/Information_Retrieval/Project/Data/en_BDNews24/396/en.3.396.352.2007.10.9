<TITLE> UK's Darling flags slower growth, cuts tax </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The British economy will slow next year, finance minister Alistair Darling said on Tuesday as he cut taxes on inherited wealth in a bid to regain the initiative after his Labour Party shied away from an early election. The Chancellor of the Exchequer told parliament in his first pre-budget report the economy would grow by 2.0 to 2.5 percent next year as Britain faced "increased international economic uncertainty and a more fragile global environment". That was down from 3.0 percent predicted for this year, and a lowering of the March budget forecast of 2.5 to 3.0 percent growth in 2008, but Darling predicted the economy would pick up again the following year. Prime Minister Gordon Brown was forced to rule out an election this year after his opinion poll lead narrowed sharply last week after the opposition Conservatives announced proposals to cut inheritance tax and help first-time home buyers. Darling issued Labour's riposte -- Married or co-habiting couples will now be allowed to inherit up to 600,000 pounds ($1.22 million) before paying any tax, 700,000 pounds by 2010. The current threshold is 300,000. The Conservatives said he was stealing their clothes. "Let there be no doubt who is winning the battle of ideas," the party's finance spokesman, George Osborne, told parliament. "He should have called that election and let us give the budget." BORROWING UP The new finance minister also closed an unpopular tax break for private equity bosses by enacting a single 18 percent capital gains tax and getting rid of taper relief. And he responded to Conservative proposals to target foreigners living in the UK who claim a "non-domiciled" status to escape tax by proposing they pay a charge after seven years. "Overall, a reasonable defence in the face of what has proven to be popular proposals by the Conservatives," said Alan Clarke, economist, at BNP Paribas. "However, the damage has been done and the proposed measures are always going to be seen as the brainchild of the opposition." Brown had been riding high in the polls since taking over from Tony Blair in June until the Conservatives enjoyed a successful party conference flush with new tax plans. After weeks of government whispers, the new premier ruled out on Saturday an election this year, ending speculation that he would call a contest nearly three years earlier than he must. The opposition immediately branded him a coward. Despite the prospect of a few revenue-raising measures, Darling had to revise up borrowing. Public sector net borrowing was now expected to come in at 38 billion pounds this year, not 34 billion. Borrowing was also 6 billion pounds higher in the next fiscal year and then 3 billions up in 2009/10. As expected, the greatest largesse was for the state health service which would see its funding rise to 110 billion by 2010. The government announced a review into the private equity industry earlier this year after unions lambasted buyout bosses for paying less tax than their cleaners while reaping millions of pounds from deals.
