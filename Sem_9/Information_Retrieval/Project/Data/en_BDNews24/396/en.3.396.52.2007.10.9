 Martyn Warwick LONDON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/telecomtv.com)  So the gossip and rumours were correct. Siemens is indeed dissatisfied with the way its joint venture partnership with Nokia of Finland is panning-out and is equally unhappy with its tie-up with Fujitsu of Japan. On Friday morning Telecom TV ran the story "Is Nokia Siemens on the skids?" after hearing rumours to the effect that executives at the big German trades union IG Metall (the body that represents the interests of many Siemens' employees) had been told by senior management of Siemens that the company is looking to exit the joint venture a mere six months after it became operational. Under the terms of the agreement with Nokia, Siemens is contractually tied to remain in the 50:50 partnership for a minimum period of six years. Nokia and Siemens agreed the principle of a strategic union back in June 2006, and the JV agreement runs from April this year through to 2013. The deal does carry the codicil that an early termination of the partnership is possible, but it can be effected only by mutual consent and common agreement between the two. To pull out of the venture now would be massively expensive and would cause some raised eyebrows amongst investors and the stock market. Nokia Siemens is in the throes of a huge reorganisation as it strives to mesh two very distinct corporate cultures and to push through a restructuring strategy that is costing a lot both in terms of hard cash and jobs as the company seeks to meet its target of saving 1.5 billion euros by the end of next year. Nonetheless, reliable sources contended that a split is on the cards and that rumour was confirmed late on Friday afternoon when a statement made on Thursday by Peter Loescher, the new CEO of Siemens, but held under embargo until after the European markets closed for the weekend, was made public. In it Herr Loescher says, "We are absolutely not satisfied with NSN". [Nokia Siemens Networks]. You can't put it much more plainly than that. The new CEO, who is Austrian rather than German, is seeking to put his stamp of authority on the sprawling conglomerate and is carrying out a management reshuffle that will consolidate and centralise his power whilst emasculating regional top brass who have got used to running various divisions of the company pretty much as their own autonomous fiefdoms whilst simultaneously being able to avoid taking the rap for mistakes and poor performance by hiding within the Byzantine maze that is the company's "matrix management" structure. So, Siemens is to be restructured to reflect the three major sectors (infrastructure & industry, energy and medical technology) in which the company operates. Furthermore, the heads of the three businesses will sit on the main management board and will be directly responsible and accountable to it for the performance of their divisions. Peter Loescher said, "Siemens was, is and will remain an integrated technology company" but added that he will go through the company's portfolio of products with a fine tooth comb to determine what will be kept and what will be canned. He also said that the Siemens' supervisory board will see the details of the wide-ranging new management plan at its November 28 meeting. Turning his attention to the Far East, Herr Loescher said that he is equally dissatisfied with the way the Fuijitsu Siemens joint venture in computing is going. Whilst he refused to confirm (or deny) that he wants out of both the Fujitsu and Nokia adventures) the CEO admits that he is to focus more on Asia and the Asian market in future. He said, "We are set up well in Asia. There is huge potential there to keep growing," whilst adding the caveat that the US market is still "enormously important" to Siemens. As the German media was saying last week, in the case of Siemens there's no smoke without fire.
