 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangabandhu National Stadium's press box roof Monday night collapsed some three hours after the World Cup pre-qualifying tie between Bangladesh and Tajikistan. The roof breakdown however left no-one hurt at the empty box that was packed during the match that ended in a 1-1 draw. The National Sports Council (NSC), administrator of the stadium, Tuesday formed a three-member probe committee, headed by its director (planning and development) Abdur Rahman, and asked the committee to report in a one working day. Other members of the committee are NSC assistant directors (planning and development) M Habibur Rahman and Ahmed Abdul Gani. "We have formed an enquiry committee and asked it to submit a report in a one working day. Once we get the report, we will go for action against those guilty," NSC secretary Aminul Islam said. "We hope to submit the report on Thursday as Wednesday is a government holiday," said a member of the probe committee, who preferred to remain unnamed. The 150-capacity suspended press box opened to journalists in March, 2006 ahead of the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup in Bangladesh in April. The press box was rebuilt under the renovation project of the BNS at a cost of Tk 25 crore. The NSC had formed a six-strong advisory committee, with two BUET teachers and four engineers from PWD, to supervise the BNS renovation. The NSC high-ups Tuesday had a meeting with the construction firm Shahidullah Associates that immediately took responsibilities for the roof caving in. "We had a meeting with Shahidullah Associates and it took all responsibilities and blamed the collapse on faulty design that had no channel to drain out the rainwater," said an NSC official, seeking anonymity. The firm expressed its willingness to rebuild the press box at its cost, the official said. bd
