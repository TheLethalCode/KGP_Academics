<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  In its quest for a national team coach by October 30, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has stumbled in getting one of its choices, former South African captain Keppler Wessels, for the job. The BCB president had directed the coach selection committee to ensure a coach for the national side by this month before the Bangladesh tour of New Zealand, and the committee, headed by Gazi Ashraf Hossain Lipu, is in the search for probable coaches with West Indian Gordon Greenidge and Australian John Dyson at the top of the priority list. Apart from Greenidge and Dyson, the committee is also looking for other coaches and contacted Wessels, who categorically refused to take charge of the Bangladesh team. A source, seeking anonymity, Tuesday confirmed that discussions with Wessels had been nipped in the bud before details. When asked, Lipu also admitted the matter and said that Wessels was not prepared to take charge of the Bangladesh team. "Wessels has a cricket academy and he wants to pass his time with it," the former Bangladesh captain said, "Besides, Wessels thinks he is not ready to take charge of any national team at this time." bdn
