 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnew24.com)  The leaders of major political parties have shown support for former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury's proposal for a national consensus government. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman, BNP vice president Mir Shawkat Ali, former president HM Ershad, Workers' Party president Rashed Khan Menon and pro-reform BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan have welcomed the proposal. The president of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh called for a 10-year national consensus government in his address to an iftar party at Dhaka Sheraton Hotel Monday. Chowdhury said that a 10-year national consensus government would spare the country clashes, hartals, demonstrations, looting and economic disruptions after the elections. However, no clear idea as to the structure of a national consensus government was given. Zillur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "Mr Chowdhury's proposal is a good one. The Awami League thinks unity can be turned into strength if the destination is the same. We want to do something good in the interest of the country and the welfare of people." He did not, however, elaborate on how unity could be achieved. Pro-reform BNP leader Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com, "At the concluding session of the eighth Jatiya Sangsad, I made a call for a consensus of the political parties on national issues." "I support Chowdhury's proposal to set up a consensus government. However, to implement the proposal, the political parties must reach an understanding." "The parties must be on common ground regarding issues like development, divisive politics and hartal is essential. If this can be done, the next step would be to form a consensus government after the next election." Bhuiyan stressed better communications between political leaders: "We have reached a point where we don't maintain relations with one another as political leaders. Personal relationships among leaders have decreased." Former president HM Ershad called it a "good proposal." "I can only speak further on this matter after consulting with my party. The political parties should shun the culture of divisiveness. All of us need to work together for the economic emancipation of the country." Jatiya Party acting chairman barrister Anisul Islam Mahmud told bdnews24.com: "Unity among the political parties is necessary. If a consensus government is formed after the election, it will be good for the country." BNP vice president Mir Shawkat Ali said: "The proposal is good. As a freedom fighter I want the country to remain united. We should unite and set aside differences. "The job of the next government will be to set a long term economic programme to lead the country on the highway of development. We will have to work together to reach the goal." Rashed Khan Menon told bdnews24.com that previous calls for unity governments had failed, but the principle was good. "During the movement in the 1990s, the alliances proposed a consensus government for three terms. That did not get through. Now we want to see the establishment of democracy through a fair election." Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Muhammad Qamaruzzaman told bdnews24.com that a consensus government would still have to be subject to the democratic process. "The idea contained in Chowdhury's proposal is good. However, it is not yet time to comment on the matter. Much discussion is required on the issue." "If a national government or consensus government can be formed with the parties represented in parliament after the election, it will be good. If such a government is formed before the election, it will not be acceptable to the people." bdnews24
