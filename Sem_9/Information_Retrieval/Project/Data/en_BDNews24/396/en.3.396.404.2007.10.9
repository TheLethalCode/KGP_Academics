<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnews24.com)  The wife of a BRAC official, abducted in Afghanistan on Sept 15, appealed to the government Tuesday to get her husband Nurul Islam freed. "They (abductors) will kill my husband if the ransom is not paid," she said. "I urge everyone, including the government, to help get my husband released," Anwara Parvin Rani said to reporters. The kidnapped man's wife met foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury in his foreign ministry office Tuesday and was assured that the government was doing "everything possible to get him freed". "I have sent a letter to the Afghan foreign minister to secure Nurul Islam's release," the foreign adviser told journalists before meeting Rani accompanied by her two brothers and son Arial. The adviser said he had asked the US government and the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to assist in the effort to free the Bangladeshi national. The foreign affairs adviser said the chief adviser had taken up Nurul Islam's plight with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. "Efforts are on at every level to get him freed," the foreign adviser said. Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), believed to be the largest NGO in the world, has had around 400 officials working in Afghanistan in the microcredit, health, education, agriculture and women's empowerment sectors since 2002. Two days before Nurul Islam was abducted, another BRAC official was murdered in Afghanistan by some unidentified assailants. bdnews
