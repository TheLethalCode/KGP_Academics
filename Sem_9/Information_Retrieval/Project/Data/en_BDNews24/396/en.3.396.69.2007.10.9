 MOSCOW, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday infighting was threatening to tear apart a network of ex-secret policemen who hold many of the country's most important posts. Viktor Cherkesov, a former officer in the Soviet KGB secret police and now head of the state anti-drugs service, issued the warning in an open letter after the Federal Security Service (FSB) detained several senior officers in his service. Putin, himself a former KGB spy who served in east Germany, has installed dozens of former colleagues in top jobs in the government and in state-run businesses. Critics say they are a secret caste which runs the country. Cherkesov described the network of "chekisty," or serving and ex-secret service officers, as a corporation which had helped rescue Russia from collapse since Putin came to power. His comments were a rare acknowledgement by a senior official of the existence of such a network. But Cherekesov said it was now under threat. "Experts and journalists are already talking about a 'war of groups' inside the secret services," Cherkesov wrote in his open letter, published in the Kommersant newspaper. "There can be no victors in this war. A war in which everyone fights everyone else will end in the complete collapse of the corporation." Cherkesov said the "chekist" community was being threatened by members who were preoccupied with making money, not protecting Russia. "You cannot try to be a trader and a warrior at the same time. It does not work," he said. Cherkesov was deputy head of the FSB, the main successor organisation to the now-defunct KGB, in the late 1990s when Putin led the service. Ex-KGB officers in senior jobs in Putin's team include First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov, a former spy who was stationed in Scandinavia and is now a possible contender to replace Putin when he steps down next year. Viktor Ivanov, an advisor in Putin's administration, and Sergei Chemezov, head of the powerful state arms exporter, also served in the KGB. Dozens of other senior officials are believed to have a secret service background but have not made it public. Analysts say KGB links have been a key factor in allowing Putin to build a powerbase and create a loyal, disciplined team. Evidence of infighting within the "chekist" community rarely comes to the surface. The detained anti-drugs service officials are suspected of accepting bribes and illegal phone-tapping, Kommersant daily reported. Anti-drugs service security guards tried to stop the FSB arresting one of them at a Moscow airport, and briefly blocked FSB investigators from searching his apartment, the newspaper said. "Chekisty" is a derivative of Ch.K. -- the acronym for Chrezvychainnaya Kommissiya or Extraordinary Commission, the name of one of the precursors of the K
