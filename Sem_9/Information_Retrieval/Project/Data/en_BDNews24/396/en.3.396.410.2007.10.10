 DEARBORN, Mich., Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Fred Thompson made a crisp debut in his first 2008 debate appearance on Tuesday, and rivals Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney battled over their records on taxes and spending. Thompson, who did not participate in two debates held since he formally entered the race last month, said the US economy was not headed for a recession and warned against strict trade restrictions on China during the debate with his eight Republican rivals. But he was a bystander in an early confrontation between Giuliani, former mayor of New York, and Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who continued their running campaign-trail battle over tax and spending policies while in office. Giuliani, who leads Republicans in national opinion polls in the November 2008 presidential race, said he brought taxes down 17 percent in New York while Romney let them increase by 11 percent in Massachusetts. "The point is, you've got to control taxes. But I did it. He didn't," Giuliani said. Romney shot back: "It's baloney. Mayor, you've got to check your facts. I did not increase taxes in Massachusetts. I lowered taxes." Thompson and the other Republicans criticized the explosion of federal spending in recent years and said rising budgets and deficits under President George W. Bush had to be tamed. Arizona Sen. John McCain pointed to his own Republican Party as the culprit. "We have to get spending under control," he said. "We Republicans who came to power in 1994 to change government -- government changed us." Several of the candidates said mandated government spending on Social Security and Medicare, the programs that fund retirement and medical care for seniors, were to blame for exploding spending. "We're spending the money of future generations, and those yet to be born," Thompson said. "Everyone knows that we have to address that, and it's the fundamental and foremost challenge, I think, facing our country economically." Thompson, the former Hollywood actor and Tennessee senator, has shot up in polls since entering the race. He said it was important to keep US troops in Iraq "to stabilize that place and not have to leave with our tail between our legs." He fired back at rival Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, when he recommended levying punitive tax duties on China because "they are cheating on trade right now." Thompson said he favored restrictions on China's imports of potentially dangerous materials but "turning our back on free trade, that's not the direction to go in. It's meant too much for our country," he said. "And every country in the history in the world that's ever turned its back on free trade has suffered for it as a consequence," he said. Romney, a native of Michigan, home of the hard-hit auto industry, said the United States is facing a "one-state recession." "Industry is shrinking here, jobs are going away. This is just unacceptable. And, therefore, everyone's going to have to come together to solve the problem," he said. Bd
