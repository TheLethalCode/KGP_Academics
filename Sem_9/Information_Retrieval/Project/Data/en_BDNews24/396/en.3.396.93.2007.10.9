<TITLE> EU satellite navigation funding still uncertain </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Funding for the European Union's multi-billion euro satellite navigation system was still up in the air on Tuesday as the bloc's finance ministers put off until next month attempts to map out a financing plan. The executive European Commission proposed last month that public money be used to build Galileo, a rival to the US Global Positioning System (GPS). The Commission said unused agricultural funds budgeted for 2007 and 2008 could plug most of the 2.4 billion-euro ($3.4 billion) hole left in the project. On Tuesday, Germany, backed by Britain, the Czech Republic, Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland balked at reopening the bloc's seven-year budget deal for a project that has yet to find any private sector backing, one EU diplomat said. Instead, some of them prefer using cash already earmarked for boosting competitiveness and research. "On the basis of our discussions there is consensus (that) this is an excellent initiative," Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told a news briefing. "But it is too soon to talk in terms of a consensus on the necessary financial solution in order to implement the project. Thus it is a subject that will require further debate," said Texeira dos Santos, whose country is EU president. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck told reporters he still rejected the Commission's funding suggestions and expressed concern over a "far reaching" proposal for awarding contracts for the satellite system. Industry in countries that will pay the lion's share of Galileo should get something in return, Steinbrueck told reporters. The original consortium of companies charged with building Galileo included EADS, France's Thales and Alcatel-Lucent, Britain-based Inmarsat, Italy's Finmeccanica, Spain's AENA and Hispasat, and a German group that included Deutsche Telekom. The consortium collapsed after companies refused to foot a large chunk of the bill for the project. ($1=.7120 euros)
