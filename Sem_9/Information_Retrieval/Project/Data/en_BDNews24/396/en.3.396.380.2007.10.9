 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The High Court Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to former energy adviser Mahmudur Rahman, in a case of fraud and embezzlement of money. The one-member High Court vacation bench of Justice AFM Abdur Rahman issued the order when Mahmudur Rahman, also former managing director of Shinepukur Holdings, appeared in court and appealed for anticipatory bail. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case with Motijheel Police Station on Sept 30 against seven people, Mahmudur Rahman, Beximco Group chairman Sohel F Rahman and his brother and the company's vice chairman Salman F Rahman on charges of fraud and money embezzlement.
