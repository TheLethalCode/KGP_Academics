<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com) -- The DGEN or general index topped the 2800 mark Tuesday as risk takers continued to exploit tax-free capital gains and gambled on profits in banking and power company blue-chips. "It appears that all investors are upbeat with many exploiting the opportunity of tax-free capital gains. Besides, a section of large investors who accumulated profits earlier are reinvesting them," said Arif Khan, an analyst at IDLC Finance. The market surged from the opening bell with a strong buying rush from individual heavyweights as well as institutional investors. The DGEN closed at 2802.60, up 40 points or 1.45 percent. The index crossed the 2700 mark on October 7. Market operators said institutional investors, especially banks, are buying stocks amid low credit demands. A 10 percent tax at source in savings instruments also diverted investors to savings certificates which buoyed a market notable for its limited supply of quality issues.

The DSE-20 blue chip index rose 27.26 points or 1.28 percent to end on 2156.44. Gainers dominated losers 168 to 35 with 12 issues holding steady. Turnover stood at Tk 2.25 billion from 13,980,257 traded shares. "It's simply crazy and makes no sense at all.
