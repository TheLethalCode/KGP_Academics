<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnews24.com) - Labour and employment adviser Anwarul Iqbal Tuesday directed readymade garment factory owners to pay their employees salaries and Eid bonuses by October 11. "If garment factory owners do not pay their employees salaries and bonuses in time, cases will be filed against them with labour courts," said Iqbal after a meeting on the readymade garments sector at the labour ministry. "Action will be taken under the emergency powers rules against any worker who demonstrates in public for pay," the adviser said. Iqbal said factory owners still feared further unrest over their salaries and Eid bonuses. "Relations between factory owners and workers have, however, improved in some factories. To continue this improvement dialogue should be encouraged between the two parties," he said. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Anwar-ul Alam Chowdhury said it would be difficult to pay all salaries and bonuses in the timeframe given by the government. "I ask for assistance from the banks in this matter. The tripartite agreement signed between factory owners, workers and the government has yet to be implemented in 65 factories," Chowdhury said. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufactures and Exporters Association president Fazlul Hoque said: "There are 42 workers' organisations in different industries in the country. There have been allegations made that the groups are inciting unrest among workers using foreign funds." bdnews24
