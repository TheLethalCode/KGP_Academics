<TITLE> UK tightens tax loopholes used by private equity </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling on Tuesday proposed tightening private equity tax loopholes by enacting a single 18 percent capital gains tax and ending a taper relief scheme from April 2008. The changes, announced in the pre-Budget report, would double the capital gains tax charged on business asset investments from 10 percent. Private equity chiefs have come under fire this year for paying the lower tax rate applied to capital gains for businesses owned for at least two years instead of the higher 40 percent income tax. "So from April next year I will withdraw the capital gains tax taper relief, and in its place there will be just one rate of 18 percent -- one of the most competitive single rates of any major economy," Darling said. "The changes I propose ... taken together with the tax loopholes that I am closing will ensure that those working in private equity pay a fair share," he told parliament. The government announced a review into the matter earlier in the year after unions lambasted buyout bosses for paying less tax than their cleaners. The system of taper relief was put in place by the Labour government less than a decade ago as a way of encouraging investment. The GMB union said the government's new proposal was too little, leaving multi-millionaires paying lower tax rates than others who earn far less. "There is no justification for affording privileges to this elite and indeed proposing to continue to do so is scandalous," GMB General Secretary Paul Kenny said in a statement.
