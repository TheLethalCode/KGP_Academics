 Dhaka, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda Tuesday said he expected voter registration to be complete before July to pave the way for national elections by Oct 2008. "Voter listing might be complete before next July. In that case the national poll will be held by October. But we will only be able to confirm the date when we are fully done with voter listing," he told reporters in his office. "We will declare the date for city corporation elections when the voter enlistment in those areas will be done in January. February will be reserved for correction of the list. Then we can make an announcement in March for the April elections," he said about the city elections. According to the EC roadmap published on July 15, the voter registration should be done within October 2008 and the polls held by December 2008. Expecting the city corporations to complete their voter registration by January 2008, Huda said, "We'll be able to make public the city corporation election schedule as soon as the city corporations complete their voter listing." He said the EC would discuss relevant issues with the government before publishing the election schedules. The CEC said voter registration was ongoing in 34 areas including the city corporations. Voter listing would be done in 75 upazilas of 64 districts by November 11. "One-fifth of the total voter registration activities will be complete before January 2008. The total number of voters may be lower than the 2006 count as voters are now being listed with photos to avoid fake ones," Huda said. bdnews24
