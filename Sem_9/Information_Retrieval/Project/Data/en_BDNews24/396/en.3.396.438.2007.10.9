<TEXT>
 PARIS, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - European stocks advanced on Tuesday, rising for the eighth time in 10 sessions as mergers and acquisitions activity boosted sentiment while oil firms rallied on buoyant crude prices. Drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis rose 2 percent, adding to the previous session's hefty gains on market talk that Pfizer was looking to buy a stake in the group from Sanofi's major shareholders. Mining shares were lifted by rising base metal prices. Xstrata gained 3 percent, Anglo American rose 1.8 percent and BHP Billiton, also boosted by an upbeat note from UBS, added 3.2 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares closed 0.5 percent higher at 1,587.66 points, its highest close since July 23. Europe's benchmark index has gained 11.3 percent since falling to a year low of 1,426.51 in mid-August, when fears over the impact of a debacle in the US subprime mortgage market hit stock markets worldwide. "The trend is still up, although we're overbought at this point and might see some consolidation," said Philippe Gijsels, senior equity strategist at Fortis Bank in Brussels. "We've been rising since the Fed cut its rates by 50 basis points, and last Friday, the US jobs figures came in better than expected, especially the revision on August data. All in all, the bull market remains intact and will continue in 2008, but I don't think there is much upside left until the end of this year." The UK's FTSE 100 index rose 1.1 percent, outperforming France's CAC 40, which was up 0.6 percent, and Germany's DAX index up 0.1 percent. Britain's Burren Energy, the target of a hostile 1.48 billion pound ($3 billion) offer by ENI, surged 28 percent, while Eni gained 0.1 percent. Both BP and Royal Dutch Shell added 2 percent while Total rose 0.9 percent. Also on the M&A front, Dutch electrical parts distributor Hagemeyer jumped 13.5 percent after France's privately-held Sonepar said it plans to launch a 2.5 billion euro bid for the company. Vallourec soared 3.9 percent on renewed market talk that the French seamless steel tube maker could be the target of a takeover bid from Arcelor Mittal. An Arcelor Mittal spokesman declined to comment. British bank Northern Rock jumped 20 percent on news that the British government had offered to guarantee new retail deposits and extend funding arrangements. Northern Rock said the new help would buy it time to assess its full range of options, which include being taken over as a whole, being broken up or attempting to remain independent. On the downside, French retailer Carrefour dropped 1.7 percent after Exane BNP Paribas cut its rating on the stock to "underperform" from "neutral".
