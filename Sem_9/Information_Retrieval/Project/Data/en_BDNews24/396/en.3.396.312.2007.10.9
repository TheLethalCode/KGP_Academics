<TITLE> Muralitharan to miss fourth ODI v England </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 COLOMBO (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralitharan has been ruled out of Wednesday's fourth one-day international against England through injury. Sri Lanka had hoped he would recover from a bicep problem in time to face the visitors but the team management is not willing to risk him with an important test series against Australia coming up next month. "He wants to play but we have to make the right decision and he's still not 100 percent," Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene told Reuters on Tuesday. "He bowled about six to seven overs today and looked fit but we have to err on the side of caution," he added. "He can field and throw so the only issue is bowling -- in a few days he may be able to play." England, meanwhile, have been boosted by the news that captain Paul Collingwood has been passed fit to play after a precautionary scan on his shoulder. "It has come out clear without any damage," an ECB spokesman told the media. "Paul didn't take any part in fielding sessions today but he batted in the nets and should be fit for tomorrow," he added. England lead the five-match series 2-1 with the final game being played on Saturday
