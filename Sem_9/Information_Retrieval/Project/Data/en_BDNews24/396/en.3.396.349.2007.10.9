 Dhaka, Oct 09 (bdnews24.com)  A government committee has recommended withdrawal of three High Commission staffers from Kuala Lumpur after an investigation into Malaysia's decision to suspend manpower intake from Bangladesh, an adviser said Tuesday. "After returning from Malaysia, the high-powered government committee has recommended withdrawing one administrative officer, one office assistant and a driver from the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur," foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said. Malaysia's move to suspend the intake of workers from Bangladesh followed ongoing problems with domestic recruiting agents and Malaysian employers as well as some of the staff at the High Commission. "Pressure started to mount on the Malaysian home minister to resolve various problems involving Bangladeshi workers," the foreign adviser said at a press conference at foreign ministry. "As a result, the Malaysian cabinet decided on October 3 not to accept fresh applications from Bangladeshi workers until the problems with Malaysian employers and Bangladeshi recruiting agents were resolved." "Malaysian employers and domestic recruiting agents must change their practices," said Iftekhar, also expatriates welfare and overseas employment adviser. Overseas employment secretary Abdul Matin Chowdhury said recruiting agents had collected up to Tk 1.6 lakh for each worker heading to Malaysia in violation of a governmental limit of Tk 84,000. Many workers, however, allege that recruiting agents collect up to Tk 2.5 lakh to secure their jobs in Malaysia. Matin, also member of the investigative team, said the licences of four recruiting agents had been cancelled while deposit money from a further six agents was frozen. "The ministry will repay the money from anyone who is charged more than Tk 84,000 from a recruiting agent," Matin said. "The Malaysian government had assured us that local employers will receive Bangladeshi workers at the airport within 24 hours." "If the employer does not collect them they will be sent to a camp from where they will be returned to Bangladesh after 72 hours if no-one comes forward. In this case recruiting agents will repay their money," he added. The foreign adviser said: "About 700 workers, who could have been sent back from Malaysia, will not be deported as they have secured jobs in other companies." Malaysia agreed to import 3.37 lakh workers from Bangladesh in 2006 after suspending the policy in 1999. Since then 1.92 lakh workers have gone to Malaysia to work. Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia staged a series of hunger strikes in August and September at the Bangladesh High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. They complained of not being paid for months and being provided an unhealthy diet and substandard accommodation. In addition a large number of Bangladeshi workers were stranded at Kuala Lumpur Airport for long periods after their Malaysian employers failed to collect them. bdnews
