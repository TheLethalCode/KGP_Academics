 SINGAPORE, Oct 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Wednesday, cheered by a rally on Wall Street after talk the Federal Reserve might cut borrowing costs to stimulate economic growth in the United States, the region's largest export market. Stocks climbed on the coat-tails of minutes from the Federal Reserve's last policy meeting that showed inflation expectations were contained, keeping alive hopes of another US rate cut and signalling that the economy was in the pink. Both the Dow and wider S&P 500 index posted record closing highs, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 0.6 percent. "There is a lot of relief at the moment," said Simon Doyle, head of strategy at Schroder Investment Management. "The data in the US, most recently the payroll numbers, were better than people thought and the interpretation of the market is that the US economy is holding up better than some had feared." By 0234 GMT, MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan had risen 1 percent to a record high, lifting the world index to its highest ever too. Tokyo's Nikkei hit a near nine-week peak, led by Fast Retailing Co Ltd and other retail shares, as investors shifted money to domestic demand-reliant sectors from exporters on concerns about US personal consumption. Australia's S&P ASX 200 rose as much as 0.7 percent to hit an intraday record for the third day in a row as resources stocks, such as BHP Billiton Ltd received a boost from firmer metals and oil prices. Seoul shares rose 1.3 percent to another record, as exporters such as Hyundai Motor advanced after the Fed news. Singapore's Straits Times rose nearly 1 percent to a life-time high, while Hong Kong shares were up 1.1 percent. Taiwan markets were closed for a holiday. DOLLAR STEADY The dollar was steady against the euro, having retreated from a two-week high on the possibility of further US interest rate cuts. Traders said the US dollar would stay weak even after strong US jobs data released late last week scaled back some expectations for a Fed rate cut this month, as demand grows for riskier trades favouring higher-yielding currencies. They said Wall Street's rally was likely to trigger selling in the low-yielding yen for assets denominated in higher-yielding currencies. "It looks like selling in both the dollar and the yen is starting to pick up again," said Hiroshi Yoshida, a forex trader at Shinkin Central Bank. The euro was flat at $1.4104 recovering from a two-week low around $1.4015 but expectations of further gains were limted after European officials have voiced their displeasure with the strength of the single currency. "The euro may be vulnerable to verbal intervention from European policymakers," said Tomoko Fujii, senior economist and strategist at Bank of America in Tokyo, given the euro's climb to a record high around $1.4280 earlier this month. The dollar was steady at 117.15 yen. The Singapore dollar hit a new 10-year high as investors sold the US dollar after the island's central bank surprised markets with its tighter policy stance. The currency hit S$1.4625 per dollar in early trade, its strongest level since August 1997. Oil hovered around $80 a barrel on concerns about consumer-nation supplies ahead of the coming Northern Hemisphere winter. Gold rose to $738.70/$739.50 an ounce, from $736.60/$737.40 late in New York, due to a weaker dollar and firmer oil prices. Tokyo futures tracked bullion to hit a 22- year high. Japanese government bonds slipped, in sympathy with a slide in US Treasuries the previous session and firm stocks. December 10-year futures ended the morning session down 0.26 point at 134.27 nearing the two-month low of 134.14 hit on Tuesday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 2 basis points to 1.730 percent, not far from Tuesday's high of 1.745 percent. Bd
