 LONDON, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A British order freezing $35 million of assets belonging to a Nigerian former state governor suspected of corruption has been extended, the prosecutor said on Tuesday. The case against James Ibori, former governor of oil-producing Delta state, is being closely watched in Nigeria. He was one of the kingmakers behind President Umaru Yar'Adua, who took office in May, in a nation where having friends in high places has traditionally been a reliable shield from the law. The assets freeze was originally granted in August, but it was lifted by a lower court last week because the judge said prosecutors had failed to show Ibori benefited from crime within the two months stipulated in the original order. The Royal Courts of Justice on Monday granted prosecutors leave to appeal against the lifting, and the assets will remain frozen until the appeal process is finished. "I should think that appeal will be lodged imminently, but no date has yet been set. I would think that it would be a matter of weeks before it's heard," a Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman said. Ibori was one of a handful of key sponsors of Yar'Adua for the presidency during the election campaign earlier this year. He rarely left his side during the campaign, and bankrolled some of the costs, party sources say. Yar'Adua promised zero tolerance for corruption when he took office on May 29, after elections in April that were so badly rigged they were deemed not credible by international observers. Five former governors were charged with money laundering and embezzlement within a few weeks of his inauguration, raising hopes that the tide was turning against Nigeria's kleptocratic elite. But the main corruption-fighting agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has become bogged down in a row with Attorney-General Michael Aondoakaa, who has tried to assert his authority over it. The row has prompted anti-corruption campaigners to question Yar'Adua's real commitment to fighting graft. The presidency issued a statement on Wednesday saying Yar'Adua "remains resolute and unshakable in his commitment to waging a real war against corruption". "Contrary to suggestions that President Yar'Adua and his administration are wilfully shielding the former governor from prosecution by the EFCC and the British authorities, the president has in fact authorised a visit to Nigeria by officers of the Metropolitan Police who are conducting a criminal investigation of Mr Ibori," the statement said. Yar'Adua has told EFCC and the justice minister to give the British police their full cooperation, it added. Ibori's case also has special significance because endemic corruption in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's richest region, has fuelled an upsurge in violence and disrupted oil supplies from Africa's top producer, helping lift world prices. More than 200 foreign workers have been kidnapped and dozens of people killed in the vast wetlands region over the past two years. Militants behind some of the attacks say they are fighting against poverty and negle
