 COPENHAGEN, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili dismissed on Tuesday opposition allegations the authorities had pressured a leading opponent into making a televised confession while in police custody. Former defence minister Irakly Okruashvili was shown on Georgian television on Monday partially admitting to corruption charges and recanting accusations that Saakashvili plotted to murder a businessman. Okruashvili's lawyer, and opposition leaders, said they believed he made the statement under duress. The affair could dent pledges by Saakashvili, a close U.S. ally, that his administration is committed to democracy and human rights. "The whole thing was transparent.

Ex-Soviet Georgia aspires to join NATO and the European Union. It is at the centre of a power struggle between the West and Russia to control the Caucasus region, which forms a land bridge between Asia and Europe. Okruashvili was released from police custody on Monday after posting part of a $6 million bail bond. He had earlier alleged Saakashvili was corrupt and that he had discussed murdering tycoon Badri Patarkatsishvili. Saakashvili denied the allegations. Georgia's National Olympic Committee on Tuesday voted to remove Patarkatsishvili as its president because of his ties to Okruashvili, a spokesman for the committee sa
