 KARACHI, Oct 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa coach Mickey Arthur said he was proud of his players for forming a guard of honour for Pakistan's Inzamam-ul-Haq on Tuesday but expected them to stop him high-scoring on the third day of the second test. The former Pakistan captain, who is appearing in his final test, was given a warm welcome by the crowd and the South African players when he came out to bat on Tuesday's second day. At the close he had faced 28 balls to remain undefeated on 10 runs as Pakistan slumped to 140 for four in reply to South Africa's 357. "I heard the guys speaking about it in the dressing-room but I think it was a spontaneous thing when they saw him coming out," Arthur said. "I am proud of what they did which was the right way to do things and I am very happy with that," he said. Arthur said his team would be keen to get Inzamam out early, however. "Inzamam is a quality player and he is going to be really hard to get out. We have to execute our game plan well to remove him. We know what he can do and we know what he has achieved. Hopefully he wouldn't get more tomorrow." The Springboks coach said his team still had lot of work to do to take the series after winning the first test in Karachi by 160 runs. "I wouldn't say the series is wrapped up. We have done the right things. I hope we can continue in the right direction," he said. He defended the selection of fast bowler Makhaya Ntini who has struggled for wickets in recent months. "I am pretty sure he will contribute somewhere in this test. He seems to be in the right frame of mind. He just needs a little bit of luck.
