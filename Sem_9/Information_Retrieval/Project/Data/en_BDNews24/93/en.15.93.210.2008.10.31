 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has asked the members of the Election Commission to resign, claiming they were "not neutral". "The Election Commission activities are pretentious, with partialities. Commissioners have made controversial statements. They should resign and handover charge to non-partisans in order to facilitate a free, fair and credible election," Khaleda said in the city on Friday. She was addressing the leaders of pro-BNP Shikkhak-Kormochari Okyo Jote (Teacher-Employee Alliance) at the BNP chairperson's Gulshan office in the evening. She also reiterated the four-party alliance's seven-point charter of demands including lifting of the emergency and rescheduling of the Upazila election dates for smooth holding of parliamentary election. She asked the leaders to build public support for the four-party alliance. She said her party had always worked for the teachers and would make commitments also in the election manifesto. The BNP chief said the government agreed to accept six of the seven demands but implemented none. "The December 18 election must be held," she said, but the demands must be effectively met before that. She criticised the government for "driving the country 20 years back" and "crippling the economy" which is why their sole responsibility should be to hand over power to the elected representatives through elections. She alleged that people supported by "a party" were sneaking into the administration. She questioned the neutrality of the government when it was allowing such people in the administration. "Fair polls are impossible under the state of emergency. People will not give in to any plot centring the election." President of Shikkhak-Kormochari Okyo Jote Selim Bhuiyan led over a hundred leaders and members of the alliance from Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Barisal, Sylhet and Khulna to meet Khaleda. Present at the meeting among others were BNP standing committee member R A Gani, vice chairman Sarwari Rahman, ex-minister Abdul Moyeen Khan, alliance leaders M A Sattar, Shahidul Islam, Kanchan Sen, Nurul Basher, Faruk Talukder, Mahbubur Rahman Molla. bdnew
