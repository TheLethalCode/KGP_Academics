 BEIJING, Thu Oct 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Landmark talks between China and diplomatic rival Taiwan next week will avoid sensitive political issues and focus on economic cooperation, Beijing's top negotiator was quoted as saying on Thursday. The Chinese delegation led by Chen Yunlin expects to discuss tourism, food safety and a joint response to the global financial crisis during the five-day visit, Xinhua news agency quoted Chen as saying. "The mission of the visit is clear and well-defined," Chen was quoted as saying. "No political issues pertaining to cross-strait relations will be involved." China has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has vowed to bring the island back under mainland rule, by force if necessary. The Chinese side, meeting officials led by Chen's Taiwan counterpart, P.K. Chiang, will include a vice governor from China's central bank and a group of Chinese banking executives, a source told Reuters. The central bank official is expected to discuss currency exchange issues, while bankers are expected to pursue local investment projects. China and Taiwan are also expected to agree on direct shipping routes, ending a long and expensive ban for companies forced to detour through Hong Kong or Japan, Taiwanese media said this week. Cross-strait air transport and postal services were also on the agenda, said Chen, adding that delegates would sign agreements to increase air terminals and "realise" daily charter flights. The two sides launched direct Friday-through-Monday charter flights in July to allow China tourists to visit once-forbidden Taiwan, but tourist numbers have not met expectations. China rigorously screens citizens for proof they intend to return from the relatively well-off self-ruled island after their tours, which Taipei blames in part for keeping visitors down
