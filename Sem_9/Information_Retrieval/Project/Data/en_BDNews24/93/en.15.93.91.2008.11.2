 MADRID, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o was the victim of racist chanting during the second half of Saturday's 4-1 Primera Liga win at Malaga, Spanish media reported on Sunday. One section of the crowd made monkey noises when the Cameroon international touched the ball and whistled at him when he was substituted near the end, newspapers including El Pais and Marca reported. The referee's match report, published on the Spanish soccer federation's website (www.rfef.es), made no mention of abuse and described the behaviour of the crowd as "normal". Racism remains an issue at sporting events in Spain and Eto'o has been targeted before. In another incident earlier this season, Getafe's Ecuadorian forward Joffre Guerron was racially abused during a match at Sporting Gijon, according to the referee's report. Renault's Spanish Formula One driver Fernando Alonso condemned racist supporters on Friday after hate messages were posted on a Spanish website targeting his British McLaren rival Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton, the sport's first black driver, was also subjected to racial abuse from spectators at a test in Barcelona in February, after which Formula One's governing body launched an anti-racism campaign. There was no immediate mention of the incident at Malaga in the post-match reports and comments by Barcelona officials and players posted on the club's website (www.fcbarcelona.com)
