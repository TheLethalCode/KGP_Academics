 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Judicial Commission in its second ever session on Thursday brainstormed over guidelines on how ten judges will be appointed to the High Court, but the meeting ended inconclusively, a member said. The Commission is set to reconvene on Sunday. Presided over by chief justice M.M Ruhul Amin, the nine-member commission held the one-hour meeting from 2:30pm at the chamber of the chief justice with justice Md Abdul Kuddus remaining absent. "Ten judges will be appointed in the High Court division. The meeting has discussed the guideline on how they will be appointed. But no policy has been determined," Supreme Court Bar Association president and commission member, barrister Shafik Ahmed , told bdnews24.com. "The law adviser has not submitted his draft guideline.. No panel has been constituted for appointment of the ten judges. The matter is confined to discussion only." "Names for appointment of the judges will come from lawyers, judges and the law ministry. Names of twice the number of judges to be appointed will be proposed. Four names are sent for appointment of two judges in the Appellate Division." "Existing salary of judges is Tk 27,000. If their salary is not raised to Tk 1 lakh, efficient, competent and experienced judges will not be available. That's why salary of the judges should be raised," barrister Shafik observed. "In neighbouring countries, the salary of judges is nearly Tk 1 lakh. On October 16, the names of four senior judges were sent to the Supreme Judicial Commission for appointment of two judges to the Appellate Division." "The president will appoint two of them to the Appellate Division". In the past, the president would appoint judges in the High Court division as advised by the prime minister. The present government constituted the Supreme Judicial Commission for appointment of judges. The chief justice and barrister Shafik aside, the other members of the commission are law adviser AF Hassan Ariff, senior judges of the Appellate Division Md Fazlul Karim, Tofazzal Islam and Zainul Abedin, senior judges of the High Court Division Shah Abu Nayeem Mominur Rahman and Abdul Kuddus and attorney general Salauddin Ahmed. bdne
