 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League's highest decision-making body has finalised the procedure for selection of candidates from grassroots level for the national elections and asked the aspiring candidates to collect nomination form from Nov. 5 to 7. "We have decided in which ways the nomination recommendations for party candidates will come from grassroots level," AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters after the meeting of the Central Working Committee on Tuesday. "The aspiring candidates will have to collect forms from the central office for Tk 7, 500." Ashraful explained the nomination process. "Boxes will be kept according to divisions in the central office. The person who will collect form will drop it in the relevant box after filing it out." "People who will submit forms will be given receipts. They have to submit the copy of the receipts to the party presidents or general secretaries of their respective areas." "The grassroots leaders should be informed of the matter as well," he said. An extended meeting will be held between the district Awami League members and the presidents and general secretaries of wards, unions, Upazilas and municipalities of electoral constituencies. District AL president or general secretary will preside over the meeting and the grassroots leaders will select five candidates in the meeting. If the district presidents or general secretaries apply for candidacy, leaders junior to them will chair the extended meeting. The name of five prospective candidates has to be sent to the CWC secretary by Nov. 9. On the progress of the party on the decision of forging an 'grand alliance' the AL leader said: "We have talked to all parties about alliance except BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and war criminals." On relaxation of the state of emergency, he said: "The process has started. We hope the emergency will be fully lifted before the elections." Reiterating the demand for deferring the Upazila election to a "logical" time, he said, "We want to sit with the government and the Election Commission on Wednesday if necessary to discuss the matter." "We hope they will understand after listening to us why we are in favour of deferring the polls," Ashraful said. The CWC meeting had been adjourned until Nov. 7, he said. bdnew
