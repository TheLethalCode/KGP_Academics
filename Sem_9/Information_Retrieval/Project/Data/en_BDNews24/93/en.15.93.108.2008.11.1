 KATHMANDU, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged Nepal's political parties to sink differences over the rehabilitation of former Maoist fighters, seen as key to peace in the Himalayan nation. More than 19,000 former Maoist rebels are housed in 28 camps monitored by the U.N. under a 2006 peace deal that put an end to a decade of civil war which killed more than 13,000 people. After signing the landmark deal the Maoists emerged as the biggest political group in elections for a special assembly held in April, got the 239-year-old monarchy abolished and are now heading a coalition government in the world's youngest republic. "The most immediate challenge ahead is to integrate and rehabilitate Maoist combatants," Ban, on his first visit to Nepal as the U.N. chief, told reporters. The government formed a multi-party committee this week to decide the future of the ex-guerrillas but major political parties are divided over how to address the issue. The Maoists say their fighters should be integrated into the national army while some political parties oppose this and want them to join an industrial security force or police. Analysts say the future of the former Maoist fighters is crucial for lasting peace in Nepal. On a four-nation Asian tour, Ban urged the panel to begin the integration of the combatants as soon as possible asking political parties to narrow differences. "I also call on the government to move quickly on the formal discharge of minors and disqualified combatants," he said. Last year the U.N. estimated that there were nearly 3,000 "Maoist army members less than 18 years of age" when the peace process began. Maoists have said children were used in support services during the revolt that started in 1996. Ban arrived in Nepal on Thursday from India and met with Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda and other Nepali leaders. Earlier, in an address to a special assembly Ban said Nepal must also clarify the fate of hundreds of people who disappeared during the conflict, compensate war victims and enable the return of thousands of displaced people to their homes. Healing the wounds of the conflict also "means undertaking an honest and inevitably painful acknowledgement of the truth of past human rights violations, and to end impunity", Ban said before leaving Nepal for Bangladesh.
