<TITLE> Old lessons and new from Stanford 'prize fight' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Allen Stanford's Twenty20 $20 million challenge in the Caribbean was ridiculed as an event lacking genuine meaning but in the end it re-affirmed some of sport's oldest lessons and confirmed the confused state cricket finds itself in. The Stanford Superstars, the cheesy moniker given to the West Indian select XI for the game with England, proved on Saturday that an underdog can win if they prepare better, stay focused on the prize and, above all, want it more than their opponents. Chris Gayle's team, who had prepared for the Antigua match with a six-week training camp coming at the end of months of preparation, won with ease - all 10 wickets intact and seven overs to spare as they comfortably knocked off England's woeful 99 all out. In front of a delighted capacity 10,000 crowd, Gayle's team celebrated their sudden transformation into millionaires while England's far better paid players, reported to have been uncomfortable with the entire event, were left to fly home empty-handed. It was a miserable end to what must have been a bizarre week for England's players. They flew out to Antigua with their board having long ago agreed to be part of the one-match playoff for an unprecedented purse -- and were then faced with a volley of columns in their newspapers denouncing the event as a vulgar circus which had sold the soul of cricket. Captain Kevin Pietersen added to the impression of the player's discomfort when he said: "Yes, it's a lot of dosh but the longer this week goes on the more I want to get it over with". Stanford, the brash Texan billionaire who has put up $100 million over five years for the event, was ridiculed after he was captured on camera with an England player's wife on his knee and humiliated when even before the match the England and Wales Cricket Board intimated they would be reviewing their relationship with the American. The short and brutish nature of Twenty20 cricket and the big sum involved drew analogies with boxing yet it was as if an ageing heavyweight champion had agreed to fight a young, hungry challenger for a big pay-day but at the weigh-in wondered out loud if there was really any point in fighting at all. While the West Indian players will have little doubt about whether the event can be considered a success, for England the entire week was a public relations nightmare. But what about Stanford, who had his own PR problems, but who insisted people should wait until after the main event before pronouncing judgement? Stanford's stated aim is to help West Indian cricket get back to the state of dominance they enjoyed in the late seventies and early eighties. A single win in a Twenty20 game over a modest England side gives no clue at all as to whether he is assisting in that effort. The money he is providing, some of which should filter through to the various cricket bodies in the Caribbean is however sorely needed and the fresh confidence that a high-profile win over England has provided will be a boost - as will the images of a packed cricket ground in party mood. CONFUSED PICTURE But in terms of the politics behind the event - a quick-fix way to appease players who might be tempted to join the lucrative Indian Premier League - the picture is less clear. By losing, England's players have not matched the big-money made by those who have signed up to the IPL and with a potential opening to England players by the league there remains the possibility that the likes of Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff will be unable to resist a big-money deal in India. Stanford has broken out of his regional fiefdom and into the international cricket scene for the first time. England's participation in the tournament, not an official international, will make it easier for Stanford to attract others to join in any future jamborees he decides to put on but the lack of status does not yet make him a real alternative to the IPL. By setting a precedent that private teams can play national teams, there is the chance now that other wealthy men will try to put on 'prize fights' - adding to the already complex international cricket calendar and the increasingly fragmented power structures in the game. The big picture is that cricket is in a confused state - Twenty20's popularity threatens the traditional five-day test match that purists love and the money it generates is already creating a huge disequilibrium between the two forms of the game. Stanford's cash adds to both the confusion and the imbalance - with neither he nor the IPL showing any signs of going away, the game's governing global body, the International Cricket Council, has some tough choices ahead
