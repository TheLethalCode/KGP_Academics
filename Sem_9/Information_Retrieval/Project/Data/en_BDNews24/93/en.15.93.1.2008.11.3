<TITLE> Rescue cash could lure 1,800 institutions: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mon Nov 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - As many as 1,800 publicly held institutions could apply for US government investments in coming weeks, the Wall Street Journal said, citing Treasury and banking regulators. Depending upon conditions still being crafted by Treasury, thousands more private banks could apply for government capital as well, a Treasury spokeswoman told the paper on Sunday. The government's $700 billion rescue plan, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), has earmarked about $250 billion to recapitalize the troubled banking sector and spur lending. So far, nine of the largest banks are due to receive $125 billion and 16 regional banks have accepted more than $33 billion of government cash. The Treasury could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters
