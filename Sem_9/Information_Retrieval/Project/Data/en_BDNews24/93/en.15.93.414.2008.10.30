<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Libya will take in more Bangladeshi workers as the two countries are set to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on manpower, says an adviser. The MoU will be signed during Friday's Bangladesh-Libya bilateral talks at the state guesthouse. The visiting Libyan labour minister Maa'touq Mohammed Maa'touq, who arrived in the city Thursday morning, and foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury will lead their respective sides at the talks. "The MoU will not only facilitate the dispatch of more manpower, but will also protect the interest and promote the welfare of our workers," the foreign adviser told reporters Thursday at his office. According to the government, some 20,000 Bangladeshi workers have been working in Libya, a common stopover on the route for illegal movement of Asians and Africans to reach Italy and the European Union. "This 20,000 is likely to increase manifold after the signing of the new MoU. The understanding will open a new door for all categories of workers," said Iftekhar. bdn
