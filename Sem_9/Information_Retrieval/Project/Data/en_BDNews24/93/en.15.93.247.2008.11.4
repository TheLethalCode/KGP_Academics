 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP ministers Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury on Tuesday secured two months' bail in the high-profile Barapukuria coal mine graft case. The High Court bench of justices Md Mojammel Hossain and Afzal Hossain Ahmed granted their appeal and halted trial for the period. The court also ordered the government to explain in four weeks why the case should not be cancelled. Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq represented the defence while deputy attorney general Mohammad Ali Akhand stood for the state and Khurshid Alam Khan for the Anticorruption Commission. The ACC filed the case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of inflicting losses of Tk 158.71 crore on the state through an agreement with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC). ACC deputy director Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges on Oct 5 against 16 people, including the former prime minister Khaleda Zia. bdne
