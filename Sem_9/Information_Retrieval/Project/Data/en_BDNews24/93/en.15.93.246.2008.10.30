<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court has once more ordered the government to report to the court regarding arrangement of manpower, transport and other support for judicial magistrates. A SC bench adjourned proceedings to Nov 27, asking the government to report by then. The caretaker government officially announced separation of the judiciary from the executive branch on Nov 1, last year. The Supreme Court ordered the government on Dec 12 to provide judicial magistrates with all necessary support staff, vehicles and other requirements in line with an establishment ministry order. The government issued recruitment rules for support staff on March 3. Since then the government has missed several Supreme Court deadlines ordering it to complete all necessary measures to equip the magistrates "as soon as possible" and submit detailed reports. bdnews
