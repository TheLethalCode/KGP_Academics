 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Judicial Service Association on Tuesday protested the posting of an official from the administration cadre to the law ministry as additional secretary. According to a press statement, the members of the judges' association at a meeting alleged that the appointment of the home ministry additional secretary Hedayetullah Al Mamun as additional secretary to the law ministry was against the principles of separation of the judiciary and the verdict of Masdar Hossain case. They said the decision had been "taken skirting the rule of considering the Supreme Court's advice" in a bid to curb the independence of the judiciary. The meeting, held at Dhaka Metropolitan Judge's Court in the morning with the association's president, Dhaka district judge AKM Ishtiaq Hossain, demanded cancellation of the posting and appointment a judicial cadre to the post. bdnew
