 TAIPEI, Sun Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Taiwan activists sang protest songs and prepared "gifts" critical of China's animal rights record on Sunday ahead of a visit by a senior official from China, which claims the self-ruled island as its own. Taiwan affairs negotiator Chen Yunlin, the highest-level Chinese official to land on the island in decades, will visit Taipei from Nov. 3-7 to sign deals on cargo shipments, direct flights and global financial crisis cooperation. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's Communists won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's KMT fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary. Taiwan activists opposed to closer ties with China, which have improved since Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May, kicked off the weekend with protest songs in the central city of Taichung on Saturday. On Sunday, the Environment & Animal Society of Taiwan announced it would give Chen informational "gifts" about bear bile harvests in China and on what it sees as poor zoo conditions, including in Taipei, which is set to receive two donated giant pandas from China. Also on Sunday, a group of young activists set up a foundation to oppose "Communist China," while a professor from Taiwan's top university maintained a hunger strike for a ninth day. "Ma has squandered (his) political credibility by recklessly, hastily and secretly converting the country of Taiwan into a district of China," the Taiwan Association of University Professors said in a statement on the hunger strike. In a separate action and despite a police warning, the Taiwan North Society advocacy group said it would pay T$10,000 ($303) to anyone who could egg Chen in the head and T$2,000 for body hits. "We've gotten calls from quite a few people," said Michelle Wang, a leader in the group of 300 members, including academics. Chen is expected to reach Taiwan around noon local time on Monday
