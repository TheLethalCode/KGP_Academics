 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) - Former prime minister Khaleda Zia's calls for the resignation of election commissioners were made out of "personal frustration", but the issue is not irresolvable, an adviser said Saturday. "Some may make allegations out of personal frustration which can be resolved through discussion. It will not hinder the election process in any way," commerce and education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said. The BNP chairperson said on Friday that members of the EC should resign as they were "not neutral". "The Election Commission activities have shown partialities. Commissioners have made controversial statements. They should resign and hand over charge to non-partisans in order to facilitate a free, fair and credible election," Khaleda said. Adviser Hossain Zillur made his comments as he briefed reporters at his commerce ministry office after a meeting with Indian state minister for commerce and power Jairam Ramesh. "I think the Election Commission is focusing on the election schedule at the moment, instead of heeding the utterings of political parties," he said. "But there is no basis for calling them bias," he stressed. "We are heading towards a free, fair and neutral election. In this regard all processes will be properly completed." He said allegations may be raised over different issues; some may have personal frustrations. "If any allegation is raised from personal frustrations, it will not hinder the election process. Rather these problems will be solved though discussion." Asked whether the government would take any steps to reconstitute the EC, the adviser said: "We are going ahead with the aim of holding elections on December 18. Our eyes are on that now." "If any problem arises it will be solved through discussion so that all may be assured," he repeated. Regarding his meeting with the visiting Indian minister, the adviser said it was mainly a courtesy call. "We discussed development of bilateral trade relations between Bangladesh and India." Hossain Zillur said the huge trade imbalance between Bangladesh and India was also touched upon. "The Indian side tabled various other proposals," he said. "They included buying power from India's under-construction power project in Tripura to solve Bangladesh's power crisis," the commerce adviser said. The meeting also discussed the appointment of Bangladeshi experts and workers in India's booming information technology sector. Commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed and Indian High Commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty were among those present during the meeting. The visiting Sri Lankan trade minister Prof GL Peiris also met with the commerce adviser on Saturday. bdnew
