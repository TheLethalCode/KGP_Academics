<TITLE> McCain in final push in key state </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 America, Oct. 31 (BBC online)-- Republican US presidential hopeful John McCain has been campaigning across the state of Ohio, as he fights to reduce his rival Barack Obama's poll lead. Mr McCain must win Ohio to have any chance of winning Tuesday's election. Mr Obama held rallies in Virginia, Florida and Missouri, as he makes a final dash around swing states. The candidates accused each other of favouring oil companies over middle class Americans, as oil company Exxon Mobil reported record profits. Mr McCain said he would make a comeback in the last days of campaigning. "The pundits have written us off, just as they've done several times before," he said. "We're a few points down, but we're coming back." He was joined at one rally by Joe Wurzelbacher, known as "Joe the Plumber", adopted by the Republicans as a mascot after questioning Mr Obama's tax plan. Mr Wurzelbacher had failed to appear at a previous campaign stop, despite being called on stage. 'Giveaways' At one campaign event in the town of Defiance, Mr McCain criticised Mr Obama for voting in favour of a 2005 energy bill, which contained tax breaks for oil companies. "Senator Obama voted for billions in corporate giveaways to the oil companies," he said. McCain has no wiggle room - one failure and he's done for The BBC's Matthew Price, in Mentor, Ohio "I voted against it." And he restated his policy in favour of reducing America's reliance on foreign oil imports. "If I'm elected president, we're going to stop sending $700bn a year to pay for oil from countries that don't like us very much. We're going to drill off shore and we're going to drill now." Mr Obama has said that he backed the 2005 energy bill because it also contained tax breaks for renewable energy producers. And he has accused Mr McCain of supporting more tax breaks for oil firms, because the Republican candidate favours cutting corporate tax rates. 'Rear-view mirror' Please turn on JavaScript.

John McCain tries to introduce "Joe the plumber" Speaking in Florida, and later repeating the message in Virginia and Missouri, Mr Obama drew his supporters' attention to the news that US GDP had dropped by 0.3% in the third quarter of 2008, and blamed President Bush for the decrease. "Our falling GDP is a direct result of eight years of the trickle-down, Wall Street first/Main Street last policies that have driven our economy into a ditch," he said. "If you want to know where Senator McCain will drive this economy, just look in the rear-view mirror. Because when it comes to our economic policies, John McCain has stood with President Bush every step of the way." Former Democratic US Vice President Al Gore is scheduled on Friday to appear in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with his wife, Tipper. LATEST POLLS The state holds significance for Mr Gore because - during his 2000 presidential run - he lost there by just 537 votes, triggering a recount, which was controversially halted by the US Supreme Court. Had he won the state, he would have won the presidential election. Recent polls from CNN/Opinion Research suggest that Mr Obama leads Mr McCain by four points in Ohio, by six points in North Carolina and by seven points in Nevada, all states won by George W Bush in 2004. The latest Rasmussen poll has Mr Obama leading Mr McCain nationally by 51% to 46%
