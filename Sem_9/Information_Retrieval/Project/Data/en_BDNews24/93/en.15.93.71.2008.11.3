 Sumon Mahbub bdnews24.com senior political correspondent Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina will return home on Nov 6, the day her parole, extended on several occasions, comes to an end, according to the Awami League's Canada chapter president. Sarwar Hossain told bdnews24.com around Sunday midnight BdST that the AL chief would be arriving back four days early instead of Nov 10 She was arriving after nearly five months abroad to settle nomination issues and lead her party in election preparations, he said. Hossain added that she would be flying to London from Washington on Monday. Her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, herself facing graft charges, also confirmed to bdnews24.com by phone the former prime minister's early flight back home. "Apa (sister) will return earlier than planned," she said from her London home. Hasina's press secretary said on Saturday said the former prime minister was expected to return to Bangladesh on Nov 10, ahead of the Dec. 18 general elections. "[Hasina] is scheduled to take the flight back home by an Emirates plane on Nov 10," Abul Kalam Azad had told bdnews24.com. Hasina, facing five graft cases, flew to the United States on June 12 to seek medical treatment, a day after the government allowed her temporary release from special jail on parole. The parole, extended on several occasions, comes to an end on Nov 6. AL leaders were concerned on Thursday as the Supreme Court denied Hasina bail in one of the cases against her, prompting her counsel to say it was an unexpected ruling. But lawyers say if the government extends her parole she will not have to return to special jail on her return. Her rival, BNP chief and former prime minister Khaleda Zia was released from special jail in September after securing bail in all the graft cases against her. Hasina, meanwhile, has secured bail in two cases, the High Court has ordered 'no arrest or harassment' in a further two graft cases, and she was denied bail on Thursday in a fifth case. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year. bd
