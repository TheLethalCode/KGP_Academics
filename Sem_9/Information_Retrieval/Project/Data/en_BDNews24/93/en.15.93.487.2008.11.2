 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  As many as 57 nomination papers were sold on Sunday for 23 director posts for election to Bangladesh Cricket Board scheduled for Nov 12. Of 25 directors, 23 will come from three categories. Category A is for divisions and districts, category B for Dhaka clubs, and category C for former cricketers, cricket associations, different boards, educational institutions and Bangladesh Olympic Association. In line with the new constitution, 10 directors will be elected from category A, 12 from category B and one from category C. The government will select the board president while one director will be chosen by the National Sports Council. A total of 21 candidates from Category A bought nominations for 10 posts - two each from Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and Rajshahi divisions and one each from Sylhet and Barisal divisions. Some 69 voters will cast their votes for Category A. All six divisions have already nominated their candidates, but the rebel candidates from four divisions bought nomination papers to vie for election for the country's most affluent board. Dewan Shafiul Arefin Tutul and Abdullah Al Fuad Redwan were initially nominated from Dhaka Division, but the duo may have to compete with rivals Mozaffar Hossain Paltu and Sailab Hossain Tutul, who threw themselves in the fray by buying nomination papers. The Chittagong Division had provisionally nominated Sirajuddin M Alamgir and Moeenuddin Chowdhury, but Shaheen Aftabur Reza Chowdhury, Manjurul Karim and Nazmul Ahsan Romen collected nomination forms. In Rajshahi Division, Mahmud Jamil and Jainal Abedin were mainly nominated, but they will have to face challenge from Imtiaz Ahmed Shamsul Huda, Golam Nobi Dulal and Shahiduzzaman. Syed Jahid Hossain and Shahidul Islam were initially nominated from Khulna Division where Kazi Shamin Ahmed, Yaqub Kabir and Shafiqul Islam also declared their candidature. However, Asaduzzaman Khasru from Barisal Division and Imran Chowdhury from Sylhet Division are all set to be elected unopposed as there have no rival candidate from their division. In category B, a total of 30 nomination forms were sold with all big names like former general secretaries Aminul Haq Moni and Mahbub Anam, former chief selector Enayet Hossain Siraj, current ad-hoc committee members Ahmed Sajjadul Alam Bobby, Shafiqur Rahman Munna, former members Golam Dastagir, GM Hasan Chowdhury Tamim, Aziz Al Kaiser Tutu, Rafiqul Islam Babu, Miza Salman Ispahni and ASM Faruque obtaining nomination papers. Besides, former Bangladesh captains ASM Roqibul Hasan, Farque Ahmed and Gazi Ashraful Hossain Lipu, former development committee chairman Khandokar Jamiluddin, Abdul Quiyum Chowdhury and Nazma Shamim collected nomination papers for the lone post in category C.
