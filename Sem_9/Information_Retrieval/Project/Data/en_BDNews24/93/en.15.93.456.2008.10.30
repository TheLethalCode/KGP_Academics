 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed has sought an extension to the deadline for his surrender to court in the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case. He filed the petition seeking more time with High Court bench of Justice Md Mozammel Hossain and Justice Afzal Hossain Ahmed on Thursday. The hearing is likely to be held on Sunday. The same bench held a hearing on appeals for quashment of the case made by former BNP ministers M Saifur Rahman, Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and Altaf Hossain Chowdhury, Jamaat-e-Islami ameer and former minister Motiur Rahman Nizami and Mojaheed. The hearing was adjourned until Sunday. The High Court had twice in the past week refused to hear the appeals by the five. The High Court rejected Mojaheed's appeal for bail on Oct 19 and ordered him to surrender to the trial court within two weeks. The Anticorruption Commission pressed charges in the case against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia, on Oct 5. The commission filed the case on Feb 26 accusing the leaders of the past BNP-alliance government of incurring Tk 158.71 core losses to the state through irregularities in handling operations of the Barapukuria coalmine. bdnew
