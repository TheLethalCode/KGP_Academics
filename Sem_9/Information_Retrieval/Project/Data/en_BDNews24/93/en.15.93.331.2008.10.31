 JERUSALEM, Oct 31(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel's caretaker prime minister, Ehud Olmert, wants to renew indirect talks with Syria that were suspended some weeks ago when he resigned over a corruption scandal, Israeli officials said on Friday. Olmert will remain in office as caretaker until a new government is formed after a mid-February election. He wants to avoid a diplomatic vacuum for this period, officials added. "The prime minister believes in the importance of continuing the process of negotiations with Syria," said Mark Regev, a spokesman for Olmert. A source in Olmert's office said the Israeli leader had told Syria via European officials that he wanted to resume Turkish-mediated talks that took place earlier this year, and had "received a positive indication" from the Syrians. Direct Israeli negotiations with Syria broke down in 2000 in a dispute over the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured in the 1967 war and later annexed, and whose return Syria demands as part of a peace deal. Many analysts believe the forthcoming change in the U.S. administration may give new impetus to a change in relations with Syria on the part of both Washington and its Israeli ally.
