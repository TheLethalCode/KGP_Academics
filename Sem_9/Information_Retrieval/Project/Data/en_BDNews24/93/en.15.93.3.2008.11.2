 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Rony Talukdar hammered the league's third century as Barisal dominated the first day of the fourth round four-dayers of the National Cricket League against Chittagong at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium on Sunday. League leaders Barisal were 276 for five at stumps with Tariqul Islam (4 not out) and Abul Bashar (nought) resuming the second day Monday. Barisal lost their opener Uttam Kumar in the very first delivery of the day, but Rony and Imran Ahmed repaired the damage putting on 156 runs for the second wicket before the latter was trapped leg before by Kamrul for 49. Rony added another 112 runs for the third wicket with Nasir Hossain (32) before being caught by Salahuddin off Kamrul, who returned three for 49. The opener struck 176 off 224 studded with 21 fours and three six. Dhaka declared their first innings at 251 for nine against holders Khulna, with Nadif Chowdhy top-scoring 54 runs at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. Top-order batsmen Mahmudullah Riad and Shamsur Rahman Shuvo gave a solid foundation after making 53 and 44 respectively while Nazmul Hossain scored 36 to help Dhaka beyond the 250-mark. Robiul Islam was the pick of the attack with three for 44, while pacer Ziaur Rahman chipped in with two for 30. Khulna, in reply, were 18 for no loss when the bails were drawn for Day 1. Away at Sylhet Cricket Stadium, pacer Shubhashis Roy claimed five scalps as Rajshahi were bundled out for a paltry 117 in the first innings against Sylhet. Rashedur Rahman (3/52) ripped through Rajshahi's top order while Shubhashis (5/19) cleaned the middle and tail. Saikat and Monir Hossain chipped in with one wicket apiece. Opener Jahurul Islam was the top scorer with 38, followed by Anisur Rahman on 24. In reply, Sylhet were 97 for three with left-arm spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo removing the top two batsmen. bdn
