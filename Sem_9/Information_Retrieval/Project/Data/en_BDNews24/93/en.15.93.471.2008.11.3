<TITLE> Abbas sees no peace deal with Israel this year </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BUCHAREST, Mon Nov 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel and the Palestinians will not be able to reach a peace agreement before Washington's target date of the end of this year, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Monday. "I don't think it's possible to clear an accord by the end of this year as both the US and the Israeli administrations are now busy with other matters and the very short time does not allow for striking such a deal," said Abbas, who started a two-day visit to Romania on Monday. "I would like to say after the election processes are over, we will resume negotiations and contacts to clear all the oustanding files in discussion. We will try to close these files because up until now none have been closed," he said, speaking through an interpreter. Washington launched the latest peace drive at a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, last year with the hope of shepherding Israel and the Palestinians towards a peace deal before President George W. Bush leaves office in January. But Israel's failure to halt Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank, divisions among Palestinians and political instability in Israel have made the prospects of meeting Washington's deadline for a deal ever more elusive
