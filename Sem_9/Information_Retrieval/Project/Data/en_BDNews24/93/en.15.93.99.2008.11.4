<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has granted ASM Hannan Shah anticipatory bail in a case filed in Chandpur district for 'breaching of emergency rules'. The HC bench of justice Md Anowarul Haq and justice Sarah Mahbub, in a ruling Tuesday, also ordered the government to explain why Hannan should not be granted permanent bail. The case was filed against Hannan, who is adviser to BNP chairperson Kahleda Zia, on Nov 2 after an Oct 31 'rally' at Matlab Uttar in Chandpur. The gathering was held by a local NGO to distribute rickshaws, sewing machines, and wheelchairs among the poor. Hannan had made political statements at the event, calling on supporters at the rally to stay alert against "a conspiracy being plotted centring on the upcoming general elections." He also said many BNP leaders "were forced into hiding when the party chairperson and her sons were arrested, leaving the party in crisis". "Now it is time to evaluate the actions and contribution of those leaders to the party before nomination of candidates for the elections," he said at the gathering. He had said nominations would be awarded "to the leaders who braved the crisis". bdnews24.com
