<TEXT>
 SOFIA, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bulgaria captain Dimitar Berbatov should perform better and with more enthusiasm in the remaining World Cup qualifiers, coach Plamen Markov said on Monday. Bulgaria have recorded three successive draws in Group Eight leading to Markov and some leading players coming under heavy criticism from local media and fans. "Berbatov is an exceptional talent and I don't challenge his top class," Markov told a news conference. "But I expect more efforts and will to help the team." Manchester United striker Berbatov boasts an impressive international record of 41 goals in 65 appearances but is yet to score in the current World Cup campaign. "We don't have to forget that he's not alone in the national team and he can't win matches by himself but I expect more from him," he said." Last month, Bulgarian Football Union vice-president Yordan Letchkov criticised Berbatov's performances as well as Aston Villa's Stilian Petrov and Manchester City's Martin Petrov. Letchkov said that team leaders should give more after Berbatov ran only some 2,000 metres for the entirety of the goalless draw against world champions Italy last month. "We did well against Italy but we were apathetic at Georgia (0-0 draw), we were missing a fighting spirit," Markov said. "We will not achieve much with such performances," he said. "We have to be realistic, the year is not 1994 (when Bulgaria reached the World Cup semi-finals) after all." Italy top the group with 10 points from four matches, followed by Ireland with seven from three. Bulgaria are third with three points from three matches
