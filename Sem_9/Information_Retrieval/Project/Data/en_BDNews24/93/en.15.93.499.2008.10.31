 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed has called for a set of participatory and accountable, coherent and coordinated global institutions to achieve "our vision of sustainable growth" in the coming years. The interim government head launched the appeal on Friday from the inaugural session of the International Business Conference titled "Next 15 years: A Vision for Growth" marking the 50th anniversary of Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI). DCCI is organising the conference at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "The world economy has changed dramatically in the last five decades. As we stand on the threshold of the next 50 years, we need to pause and ponder," Fakhruddin said. "Like a huge chain, each of our country's economies, as a result of globalization, is linked to each other. Every country's economy matter and economic driver such as flow of manufacturers and commodities, investment and finance, human resources, migration and technology form the basis of the link of our great global chain." "We are now challenged to deliver with human face in an increasingly uncertain world. In the recent period we have witnessed a confluence of a diverse set of global factors which have precipitated food insecurity, emerging crisis, commodity price boom and, currently, financial meltdown. At the same time, he said, multilateral trade talks remain at bay and flow of overseas development assistance shows declining trends. "We may add to this the adverse impact of climate change as well as cross-border conflicts." Asian economies would have to confront these negative trends characterising the global stage, Fakhruddin continued. "I would also urge that we need to switch on the economic drivers that can bring about an inclusive economic order. "These drivers include innovative entrepreneurship, pragmatic business strategies, and non-pollution manufacturing processes, renewable sources of energy, productive labour and seamless flow of labour, technology and capital across the border." Commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam, DCCI president Hossain Khaled and International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman, Bangladesh's permanent representative to UN Geneva office Debapriya Bhattacharya, Indian state minister for commerce Jairam Ramesh and Sri Lankan export development and international trade minister GL Teiris were present. A memorial stamp on the 50th anniversary of DCCI was released at the inaugural function bdne
