<TITLE> Brown seeks IMF boost </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 London/New York, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for billions of dollars in extra funding for the International Monetary Fund on Sunday, after India cut its main short-term lending rate and China braced for slowdown. Russia moved 170 billion rubles ($6.41 billion) from a national fund to a state bank, boosting shares in a special session on Saturday, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel promised an "extensive" stimulus package. Brown, speaking in Riyadh, said oil-rich Gulf States and China should contribute money for the IMF to lend to countries at risk of financial collapse. "If we are to stop the spread of the financial crisis, we need a better global insurance policy to help distressed economies," Brown said. But in Shanghai on Saturday, a senior Bank of China executive said China had already started to feel the impact of the crisis, with a sharp slowdown in industrial profit growth and fiscal income. Bank Executive Vice President Zhu Min also said the global economy will likely enter recession next year with the United States, Europe and Japan posting negative growth. "That will have a huge impact on China," he said. Currency volatility is expected to add further pressure on China's banks, which have enjoyed robust profits for years as the country boomed, Zhu said. Earnings growth is now slowing as the economy cools from the impact of the crisis. "The uncertainties in the world's currency markets have exposed the Chinese banking sector to higher foreign asset risk," Zhu told a financial conference. In India -- like China, a magnet for foreign investment in recent years as their economies roared -- the central bank cut its main lending rate for the second time in as many weeks to ease a cash squeeze and spur economic growth. 'KNOCK-ON EFFECTS' IN ASIA Analysts said the surprise move showed Indian concern that strains on its economy were quickly becoming more severe. "These actions were necessary (and had) to be taken on the liquidity front ... the situation was getting worse," said Vikas Agarwal, a strategist at JP Morgan. The central bank cut the repo rate, its main short-term lending rate, by 0.5 percentage point to 7.5 percent and banks' cash reserve requirements by 1 percentage point to 5.5 percent. "The global financial turmoil has had knock-on effects on our financial markets; this has reinforced the importance of focusing on preserving financial stability," the bank said. Policymakers around the world have slashed interest rates in recent weeks and injected huge amounts into their banking systems to try to combat the spillover effects of the global crisis, which has caused credit markets to freeze up and threatens to plunge the world economy into recession. On Saturday, Russia's Finance Ministry said it placed 170 billion roubles from its National Wealth Fund with state bank VEB as part of a plan to allow for state purchases of shares and corporate bonds. The news of state share purchases helped Russian shares rise sharply, lifting them to a 50 percent gain for the week. Shares were trading on Saturday because Monday and Tuesday are public holidays. Also on Saturday, German's Merkel promised support for an "extensive" package to help ordinary Germans, which a government paper said would give the economy a 50 billion euro boost. Germany put together a 500 billion euro ($638.9 billion) rescue package for banks last month. Merkel and Brown will meet in London on Thursday. In Riyadh, Brown said he welcomed investment by foreign countries, after British bank Barclays tapped Abu Dhabi and Qatar for the bulk of a $12 billion investment on Friday. "As long as they play by our rules and operate in a commercial manner, we welcome investment from sovereign wealth funds in the UK," Brown said. Brown's tour of the Gulf precedes a global summit in Washington on November 15 at which he and some other world leaders will press for reform in the international financial system. WORRIES IN SWITZERLAND The global crisis has overshadowed the election to find a successor for U.S. President George W. Bush, who leaves office in January. Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama swept through battleground states on Saturday in a last-minute push before Tuesday's vote. Also on Saturday, the Swiss National Bank said it was growing more concerned over Switzerland's economy. "The situation has noticeably worsened because the financial crisis is clearly affecting the real economy," SNB Chairman Jean-Pierre Roth said in a newspaper interview. "We have two elements which are not pointing in the right direction -- the nominal development in the franc and the three-month LIBOR rate, which is above our target," Roth told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung. "This is a big challenge for us." The developments in the worst financial crisis in eight decades followed signs in the past week that world markets were stabilizing, with interbank rates falling and U.S. stocks posting their biggest weekly gain in 34 years, even as the business climate deteriorated. A U.S. Commerce Department report on Friday showed consumers cut monthly spending for the first time in two years in September, evidently bracing for hard times as jobs continue to disappear and credit conditions tighten. The Bank of Japan slashed interest rates on Friday and JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank, temporarily halted home foreclosures and offered to renegotiate mortgages. Japan's rate cut followed a cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are expected to do the same next week.
