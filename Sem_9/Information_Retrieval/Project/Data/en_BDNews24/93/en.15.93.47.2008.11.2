<TITLE> Global crisis may slow GDP growth: BB </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The current global economic crisis may slow GDP growth in FY 2008-9, a Bangladesh Bank quarterly report has forecast. The central bank said GDP growth would range between 6.2 to 6.5 percent in the current fiscal if favourable environment and growth-friendly policies remain uninterrupted. "But we cannot tell how long the global economy can withstand the current crisis," chief economist of the central bank Mustafa K Mujeri told a press briefing on the release of the quarterly report (July-September) at the bank's head office in the city on Sunday. Bangladesh Bank's policy analysis unit (PAU) is studying the trends, he said adding "data available were insufficient which is why the forecast was made cautiously." The targeted GDP growth rate in the current budget is 6.5 per cent, which was 6.2 per cent in the previous fiscal. Mustafa said owing to a downtrend in the prices of fuel and food in the international market, the country's price spiral would see a halt in future. He noted, however, that national elections in December would give rise to expenditures both in the public and private sectors leading to a jump in money circulation. "This could possibly raise prices again," he warned. Asked why, despite bumper production of Aman and Boro and falls in fuel prices in the world markets, local commodity prices witnessed no change, the economist said businessmen were hoarding low price commodities for higher profit. But he expressed confidence that "those hoarders will have to sell out the goods if the Boro output is higher and the falling trends in the international markets continue." In such a situation "prices would automatically go down," he added. On whether the government or the concerned department should intervene, Mustafa plainly admitted: "government measures in the past were not fruitful and decisions should base careful considerations." bdne
