<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court granted BNP leader Salauddin Quader Chowdhury three months bail on Sunday in a tax evasion case. The HC bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman stayed the case proceedings for the same period, on a petition by Chowdhury, the BNP chairperson's parliamentary affairs adviser. It also issued ordered the National Board of Revenue to explain why the case should not be thrown out. Chowdhury's lawyer, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq said in the hearing the NBR did not follow proper legal procedure in filing the case. Mentioning that Chowdhury was released from jail on Aug 29 after securing bail in all cases against him, the NBR case was filed at a time when he was preparing for elections, with a motive to harass him, Huq said. The NBR filed the case with Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Judge's Court against Chowdhury on Oct 26. Deputy attorney general Nahid Mahtab argued that there was no reason to allow him bail. bdnew
