 NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior South African judge Albie Sachs will hear Indian batsman Gautam Gambhir's appeal against a one-test ban for a breach of conduct during the third test against Australia, cricket's ruling body said on Saturday. Gambhir was penalised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) match referee for elbowing Shane Watson while taking a run. The Australian all rounder, who was bowling, was fined 10 percent of his match fee for his role in the incident. Sachs was appointed on Friday after the ban was announced and will hear the case within a week, an ICC statement said. The Indian Cricket Board lodged the appeal, pending which the opener, who has scored 104 and 206 in his last two innings, can continue playing. The match ends on Sunday and the fourth and final test starts in Nagpur on Nov. 6. Match referee Chris Broad had said Gambhir escaped facing a higher charge despite being fined for a similar incident in a one-day international against Pakistan last November due to the mild contact he made with Watson. India lead the four-match series 1-0
