<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered the government to explain why it would not observe November 7 as National Revolution and Solidarity Day. The High Court bench of Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and Justice Md Rezaul Haque on a writ petition by president of Swadhinata Forum Abu Naser Md Rahmatullah Monday gave the order. The court also asked the government to explain why the cancellation of public holiday on the day would not be declared illegal. The cabinet secretary, principal secretary to the chief adviser, establishment secretary, law secretary, education secretary and deputy secretary to the establishment ministry are to respond to the rule in four weeks. The government on Dec. 4, 2007 cancelled the public holiday on Nov. 7. Participating in the hearing on the writ petition Advocate Tajul Islam said after the liberation war in 1971 the country went through rough times in 1975. "Patriotic troops and people together saved the country on November 7 and established multi-party democracy, and freedom of speech and thought was restored." "So the day is important. Not observing the day amounts to ignoring the main spirit of the constitution," he argued. On another writ petition by former energy adviser Mahmudur Rahman, the High Court on Oct. 26 asked the government to explain why the cancellation of public holiday on Nov. 7 would not be declared illegal. bdne
