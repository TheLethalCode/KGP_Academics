 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has been petitioned on Sunday to overturn the High Court orders passed hours earlier that dismissed three writ petitions challenging the Election Commission's gazette on the demarcation of the parliamentary seats. The hearing will be held on Monday, a lawyer for the petitioners said. The High Court dismissed three separate writ petitions challenging the gazette on the re-demarcation of parliamentary seats, which lawyers said cleared the way for announcement of the election schedule. Barrister Nasiruddin Ashim, after filing the appeal, told bdnews24.com that they had sent a fax to the EC informing it of the appeal. Shahdin Malik, lawyer for the EC, earlier told bdnews24.com after the HC verdict that the court had ruled the commission's gazette legal. On voters being listed before the redrawing of 133 out of 300 constituenciesone of the main objections of the petitionersthe court said that one had no relation to the other. The ruling meant that the EC had no impediment to declaring the election schedule, Malik said, adding that the commission could announce the schedule any time it wished. Barrister ABM Nurul Islam, lawyer for the petitioners, also told bdnews24.com that the HC ruling meant the commission could declare the election schedule. "But the decision whether we (the petitioners) will appeal against the verdict will be taken after discussions on the matter," he said. The commission was originally set to declare the schedule on Nov 2 (Sunday), but had been awaiting the High Court verdict. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told bdnews24.com that the schedule for national elections would be declared on Sunday evening. The High Court stayed the effectiveness of the gazette on demarcation of 300 parliamentary constituencieswhich redrew the boundaries of 133 seatsfor three months, on Aug 7. The stay order came on a petition filed by former BNP lawmaker Abdul Mannan, one of three filed on Aug 6 challenging the EC's gazette. All three petitions were heard by the High Court simultaneously. The Election Commission primarily redrew the boundaries of 133 parliamentary seats on April 29. The gazette demarcating the boundaries of all 300 parliamentary constituencies was published on July 10. bdne
