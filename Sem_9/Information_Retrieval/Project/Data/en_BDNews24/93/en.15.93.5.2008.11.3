 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Monday ordered former state minister for energy AKM Mosharraf Hossain to surrender to trial court by Nov 9. The Appellate Division, meanwhile, stayed the High Court's bail order for former BNP lawmaker Mosaddek Ali Falu. The bench of justices Md Mozammel Hossain and Afjal Hossain rejected Mosharraf's appeal for anticipatory bail and ordered law-enforcing agencies not to arrest or harass him within the time. The Anticorruption Commission filed the Barapukuria coalmine corruption case with the Shahbagh Police Station on Feb. 26 against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia and her cabinet's 10 ministers. The full bench of the Appellate Division led by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin gave the order following the government's appeal to stay the bail of Falu,. The High Court granted Falu bail on Sep. 16 in a case of embezzlement of corrugated iron sheet reserved for relief. The full bench overturned the High Court's stay of proceedings of a case of earning illegal wealth against former Awami League lawmaker Kamal Ahmed. In another development, Appellate Division's chamber justice MA Matin halted for one month the High Court's bail of businessman Giasuddin Al Mamun in an arms case. bdnew
