 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The presence of melamine hazardous to health has been confirmed on reexamination in China-made Yashli-1, Yashli-2 and Sweet Baby-2 powdered milk, advisers said on Monday. Health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali and commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said at a press briefing further examinations were carried out in Thailand on samples which tested positive. Samples of powdered milk of eight brands were sent to three laboratories of the UN Food and Agricultural Organization's (FAO) Bangkok regional office for reexamination. The results of the tests reached authorities on Sunday. The FAO tests did not find melamine in the five other brands. Before the FAO tests, a test at Dhaka University had found melamine in those eight brands. Two other laboratory tests found melamine in only one brand, Yashli-1. The High Court on Oct. 23 ordered the government to immediately stop the sale, marketing and display of eight foreign brands powdered milk - Australia's Diploma and Red Cow, Denmark's Dano Full Cream, China's Yashili-1, Yashili-2, Sweet Baby-2 and New Zealand brands Nido Fortified Instant and Anlene. The government, accordingly, banned sales and marketing of those powdered milks. A high-level meeting at the health ministry decided on Monday to review the tests results. After the meeting the health adviser said, "As the results of the three tests conducted in the country laboratories varied, the samples of those eight brands were sent to FAO for reexamination. "Three more tests were conducted at the Bureau of Quality and Safety of Food, Department of Medical Science and Department of Public Health, Thailand." "Four out of six tests provided identical result -- 67.33 miligram melamine in per kilogram in Yashli-1, 0.02 mg per kg in Yashli-2 and 0.28 gm per kg in Sweet Baby-2 powdered milk." Shawkat Ali said melamine was not found in the five other Australia, New Zealand, Denmark-made brands. The governments of Australia, New Zealand and the European Union sent letter to Bangladesh government assuring it of no possibility of melamine presence in their brands, the health adviser said. Next step will be taken in line with the court directive and the government is taking preparation to submit a report through the attorney general in a day or two, the adviser added. About the rumour of having melamine in raw milk, the health adviser said, "The government has been keeping an eye on the issue. The government is putting more emphasis on local production of child food instead of import." Asked about the acceptable level of melamine in human body, he said there was no internationally determined level. Some countries fix the acceptable level of melamine on the basis of body's weight. "However, Bangladesh government wants to ensure zero level of melamine in child food." About the test conducted at the Dhaka University, Shawkat Ali said the equipment there was not capable enough to test the presence of melamine. The commerce adviser said the court would be informed of the presence of melamine in the three China-made powdered milks. "After the next directive of the court, import of these milks will be totally banned." Presided over by Shawkat Ali, chief adviser's special assistant Mahbub Jamil, health secretary AMM Nasiruddin, director general of health department SM Faiz and others were present at the meeting. Melamine is not soluble, but if it is very concentrated it forms into crystals. Permanent liver damage can be caused when crystals suddenly form into large numbers of tubules in the kidneys of children that have consumed melamine, causing chronic kidney failure and requiring dialysis and even kidney transplants later on in life. bdnews2
