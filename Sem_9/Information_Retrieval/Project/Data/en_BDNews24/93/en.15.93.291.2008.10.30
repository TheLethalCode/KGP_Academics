<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Thu Oct 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari has said he would write a letter to the Indian prime minister to remind him of a promise to settle a dispute over a river. Pakistan accuses India of violating a 1960 treaty by reducing the flow of water down the Chenab river, which flows from Indian side of Kashmir into Pakistan. India is building a dam on its part of the Chenab and Pakistan fears a shortage of water for irrigation as a result. Zardari said on Wednesday he would write to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, reminding him of a commitment Singh made during a meeting in New York last month. "A proactive approach should be adopted in this regard to compel India to give Pakistan its rightful share of water," Zardari said in a statement issued by his office. During talks on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, Singh assured Zardari that India was committed to a treaty under which the countries use several rivers draining into the Indus river basin, Zardari said earlier. Zardari has warned improving ties between the old rivals could be harmed by the brewing dispute over water. India has rejected Pakistan's contention that its dam project dam reduces the flow of water and says the project is crucial for power-starved Kashmir
