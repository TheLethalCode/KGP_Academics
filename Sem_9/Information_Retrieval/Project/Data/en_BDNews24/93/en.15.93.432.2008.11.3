 NEW DELHI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia's bowlers must find inspiration from their batting performance in the drawn third test against India to help square the series, skipper Ricky Ponting said on Sunday. Michael Clarke hit 112 after the top four batsmen scored fifties to amass 577 in reply to India's first innings 613 for seven declared before the bowlers led by Brett Lee reduced India to 93 for four at one stage in the second innings. India lead 1-0 after winning the second test in Mohali by 320 runs. The final test starts in Nagpur on Nov. 6. "Our batting is certainly up to scratch in these conditions," Ponting told reporters. "We had the worst of the batting conditions and we managed to play very, very well. "The challenge now lies in being able to take 20 wickets. "Our whole approach in the second innings with the ball was a lot better. That certainly played dividends for us early on." Lee, subdued and under fire in the series, bowled fast and swung the ball in the Indian second innings and bowled both opener Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid off the inside edge. "It is a really good sign from our bowlers they took that on in the second innings and did things a little bit differently," added Ponting. "They bowled reverse swing better. Brett Lee's intensity throughout this game was a lot better." Ponting urged his players to adapt quickly although India had the advantage of batting first after winning the toss in the last two tests after salvaging a draw in the first test in Bangalore. "If I happen to lose the toss again, hopefully there won't be 600 on the board and we set it up," he said
