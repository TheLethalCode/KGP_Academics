<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Title contenders Brothers Union came from behind to hold 10-man Mohammedan Sporting Club to a 1-1 draw in the crucial B. League encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Thursday. Mohammad Robin gave Mohammedan a 31-minute lead while Mehdi Hasan Tapu levelled the margin for Brothers Union, who have nine points from five outings. With second draw in four matches, last year's runners-up Mohammedan raised their point tally to eight, six points behind league leaders Sheikh Russel KC, who, however, played two matches more than the Black and White outfit. Rahmatganj MFS are in the second position with 10 points from seven matches, one point ahead of holders Abahani Limited, who will play their fifth match against Chittagong Abahani Limited Friday. Both the sides fought equally in the first half, but the Gopibagh-based outfit, Brothers Union, comparatively dominated the midfield in the second half and snatched one point from the Motijheel-based outfit, Mohammedan. The Black and White outfit, who demolished Muktijoddha Sangsad 7-0 in their previous match three weeks ago, got off to a fine start with Faisal Mahmud rattling the Brothers Union crossbar in the very fourth minute. Brothers Union almost came close to equalising the margin in the 16th minute, but Nigerian striker Micheal Oniya failed to convert a deflection from Tapu from a close range. National striker Robin finally broke the deadlock heading a Bukola Olaleken lob home in the 31st minute. After the resumption, winger Jahid Hasan hammered a powerful shot at the top of the box that floated narrow over the Mohammedan post four minutes into the second half. Goalkeeper Aminul Islam then salvaged Mohammedan to deny Tapu coming out from his cave in the 69th , but three minutes later, he had nothing to do as Tapu drove a rebounder past Aminul to bring a valuable point from the All Orange outfit. Olaleken should have then put Mohammedan ahead, but the Nigerian striker failed to beat Brothers keeper Ziaur Rahman in one-on-one situation. Just before the final whistle, Mohammedan were reduced to 10 men as Maruf Ahmed, who came in the field in the 81st minute, was sent off due to his offensive tackle.
