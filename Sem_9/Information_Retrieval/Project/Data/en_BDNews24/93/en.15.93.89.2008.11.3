 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  A brace from Awudu Ibrahim helped holders Abahani Limited regain the top of the table in the B. League when they handed a 2-0 defeat to Arambagh KS in their away match at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Monday. With five straight wins, Abahani secured 15 points from six outings, one point ahead of Sheikh Russel KC, and five points more than joint second-placed Brothers Union and Rahmatganj MFS. Arambagh KS remained on five points playing six matches, four points behind fourth-placed Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club. Title contenders Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club have eight points from four outings to remain at fifth position. Abahani began at a good pace, creating numerous chances in the first half but only converted two, with Ghanaian striker Ibrahim at the centre of almost every attack, giving the Dhanmondi-based outfit a deserved lead in the 32nd minute. Ibrahim, who frequently broke the fragile Arambagh backline, finally got the back of the net when the well-built striker, capitalising on a through pass from Wali Faisal, danced past goalkeeper Piaruzzaman Piru and two more defenders to drive from close range. Six minutes later, Ibrahim doubled the lead from a counterattack when he chased down a Wali Faisal cross to advance into the danger zone and lashed the ball past advancing goalkeeper Piru. Abahani could have gone ahead in the 28th minute, but Ibrahim squandered probably the easiest chance in the match by driving straight to keeper Piru instead of keeping his cool to beat him in a one-on-one attck. With a 2-0 cushion in the first half, it seemed Abahani eased the pressure over the minnows as the ball was mostly seen in the midfield, with no significant attack in the second half. bdn
