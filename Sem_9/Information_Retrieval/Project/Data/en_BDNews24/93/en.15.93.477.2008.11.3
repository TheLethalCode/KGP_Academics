"We have still to receive justice.

"Pro-liberation forces are now united. All of us will fight for justice," he said.

The Jail Killing Case was revived in 1996, but a verdict handed down by the court on Oct 20, 2004 was never carried out. Three former army officials were given the death penalty for their role in the custodial killings, 12 suspects were awarded life sentences, and five suspects were acquitted. The day started with families of the victims laying wreaths at the graves, with Bangabandhu Bhaban and all AL offices across the country flying the national flag at half-mast and raising black flags. AL central leaders including Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed and Syed Ashraful Islam also paid their respects at the portrait of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dhanmondi.
