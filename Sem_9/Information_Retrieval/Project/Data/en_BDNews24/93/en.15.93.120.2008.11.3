 BERLIN, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Borussia Dortmund lost ground in the race for European places when they had to fight for a 1-1 draw at home to struggling neighbours Bochum on Sunday. Bochum moved ahead midway through the first half with a great volley from captain Thomas Zdebel but they were denied a much needed victory when Egypt striker Mohamed Zidan equalised just before halftime. The draw saw Dortmund edge up to sixth place with 18 points from 11 matches, ahead of Hertha Berlin on goal difference and two points behind direct rivals Schalke 04 and Hamburg SV in fourth and fifth. Bochum climbed a place to 15th with eight points. In Sunday's other game Eintracht Frankfurt won 2-1 at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who are second from bottom on seven points. Hoffenheim continue to lead the table in their debut season in the top flight after a 4-1 win at home to Karlsruhe on Saturday. They have 25 points, one clear of Bayer Leverkusen after they won 2-0 at home to VfL Wolfsburg on Friday. Bayern Munich are third on 21 points thanks to their 3-1 success over Arminia Bielefeld on Saturday
