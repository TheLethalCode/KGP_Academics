<TITLE> No schedule before consensus: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  BNP says it would not be logical for the Election Commission to announce election schedule only on the basis of the High Court verdict without consensus with political parties. The High Court Sunday morning dismissed three separate writ petitions challenging the Election Commission's gazette on the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies. "Before the schedule is announcement, the government and the Election Commission should have unanimity of opinion with the political parties. It will not be right to announce election schedule hurriedly before that," joint secretary general Goyeshwar Chandra Roy said. "There is nothing to be happy about the verdict. Though it seems that the High Court verdict has settled matters, the plaintiff has the opportunity to appeal in the Appellate Division. "It is not logical in any way to take the next step towards the election before the matter is settled in the Appellate Division," he told bdnews24.com by telephone. He said it was the responsibility of the government and the Election Commission to implement the fundamental agreements they had reached with the political parties during the dialogues. Besides, he argued, the Election Commission was not done with the mandatory registration of the political parties. If the schedule is announced before the registration, there were chances of the whole process getting stuck in legal complexities. The Election Commission would also have to think again about the its right to cancel candidacy under the newly formulated code of conduct. Otherwise, no candidate would feel secure. "So, announcement of the schedule before settling these issues would not be right in any way," Goyeshwar asserted. bdne
