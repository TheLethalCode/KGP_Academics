 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has said it cannot announce the schedule for national elections on Nov. 2 because of the legal wrangle over the re-demarcation of electoral constituencies. "It will not be possible on our part to announce the election schedule on Nov 2 due to legal impediments," chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters before he met the chief adviser on Thursday. But he said the election date of Dec 18 is not going to be changed, even with the postponement of the schedule's declaration. The EC appealed to the Supreme Court on Thursday to overturn a stay on the redrawing of parliamentary constituencies. The High Court, meanwhile, concluded a seven-day hearing of three petitions challenging the EC's gazette on the demarcations. The hearing on the EC's appeal and a ruling on the petitions are set to be given on Sunday (Nov 2). The EC will announce the schedule as soon as possible after the appeal hearing, the CEC said. The EC and the government have declared the national election date for Dec. 18 and Upazila polls on Dec. 24 and 28. "If the schedule could be declared on Nov 2, we would get more time to prepare. Now we have less time, but it will not hamper the elections," Huda said. Election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammad Sohul Hussain hoped that they would be able to declare the schedule in the first week of November. On missing the 'deadline' for registering parties, the CEC said that the commission had a 'target' to complete the process by Oct 30. "But we never said that was the ultimate deadline for the process. The commission has decided on the parties worthy for registration in that time," he said. "The registration issue of the major political parties have already been finalised," Huda stressed. "Hearing on objections against Jamaat's registration has been decided. Ongoing scrutiny of registration applications by smaller parties will be completed soon." "There is no bar to working on registration after the announcement of the election schedule, up until the eve of submission of nominations," the CEC said. There was no relation between the announcement of the election schedule and registration of political parties, he added. bdnews
