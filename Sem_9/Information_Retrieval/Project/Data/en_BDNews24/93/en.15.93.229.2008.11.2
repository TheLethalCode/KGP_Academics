 REYKJAVIK, Sun Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iceland's ruling party, struggling to cope with a meltdown of the island's economy, is losing support from voters, according to a poll published in the daily Morgunbladid on Sunday. Prime Minister Geir Haarde's Independence Party, in power for 17 years, polled 22.3 percent in the survey by Gallup. Its coalition partner, the Social Democratic Alliance, registered at 36.9 percent.
