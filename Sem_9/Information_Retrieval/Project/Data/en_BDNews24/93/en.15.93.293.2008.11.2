 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner on Sunday said the general election would be held on Dec. 18, as announced earlier, but Upazila polls would take place in one go on Dec. 28. In an address to the nation over Bangladesh Television and Betar, ATM Shamsul Huda announced the parliamentary election will be held on Dec. 18 as announced earlier but Upazila polls taking place in one go on Dec. 28 instead of on Dec. 24 and 28. The last date for submission of nomination papers for the parliamentary polls is Nov 13. Scrutiny of the nomination papers will be carried out on Nov 16 and 17. The last date for withdrawal of the candidature is Nov 24. Huda urged all officials involved with conducting the Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila elections to discharge their responsibilities with full neutrality and efficiency. On the registration of the political parties, the CEC said one of the most import topics of legal reform is the registration of the political parties. The commission took initiatives for registration once in the past but failed. This time the registration was completed in a short time with the cooperation of the political parties. He said the aim of the registration was not to control the political parties but to lay out a framework for work between the Election Commission and the political parties. He said the registration would create a good relation between the EC and the political parties, and ensure transparency and accountability of the political parties. Huda said until October 2008 a total of 8,11, 30,973 voters have been registered across the country. However, the number was 9,24,41,868 in 2006. Apparently, 1,13,10,895 excess voters were registered in 2006 which has been corrected this year. On the dialogues with the political parties the electoral chief said the dialogues were held in completely open and cordial atmosphere. The political parties' opinions and recommendations on the commission's proposed amendments were pragmatic and timely. The commission accepted most of the logical recommendations of the political parties and incorporated those in laws concerned and rules, he added. The election chief said the success of fair elections depends on the full neutrality and efficiency of election officials and employees. Huda urged all those involved with conducting the Jatiya Sangsad and Upazila elections to discharge their responsibilities with full neutrality and efficiency and the conduct of competing candidates.. He said the government and the Election Commission would arrange all types of security for the election officials. "I want to say categorically: discharge the sacred duty vested on you remaining above all types of intimidation; ignore all unwanted influence and unjust demands," said the CEC. "We will do whatever is necessary to ensure that people can go to the polling centres, cast their votes and return home safely." He requested all candidates participating in the Jatiya Sangsad election to maintain a peaceful atmosphere "through being imbibed by the democratic ethos and showing respect to each other". He urged them to follow the electoral code of conduct and refrain from banned activities during election campaigns and on Election Day. The CEC warned that traditional "show downs" would not be tolerated in any way. He urged all to remain alert against such activities and trade in votes. Huda said the post offices will remain open late in night, if necessary, for sending result sheets from the polling centre. The CEC expressed the hope that with the sincere effort and participation of the political parties, intellectuals, journalists, students and people in general, the ninth parliamentary election and the third upazila election would be held peacefully on Dec 18 and 28 respectively. The election to the ninth parliament comes more than seven years after the eighth, held on Oct 1, 2001. The seventh was held on June 12, 1996, the highly controversial sixth on Feb 15, 1996, the fifth on Feb 27, 1991, the fourth on March 3, 1988, the third on May 7, 1986, the second on Feb 18, 1979. Elections to the parliament scheduled for Jan 22, 2007 were forestalled after days of political chaos and street violence leading to the state of emergency on Jan 11. The first parliamentary vote in independent Bangladesh took place on Mar 7, 1973. The last upazila polls were held on March 24 & 25 in 1990. The first such election of the country took place on May 16-20 in 1985. bdnews24.
