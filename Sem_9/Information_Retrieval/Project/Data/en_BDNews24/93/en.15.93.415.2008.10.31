 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and Libya on Friday reached an understanding under which Tripoli could possibly employ more than one lakh Bangladeshis in its booming construction sector. During Friday's bilateral meeting that preceded the deal, Libya showed interest in expanding Bangladesh's refinery capacities to process its crude petroleum here for export to the Southeast Asian countries. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury and the visiting Libyan labour minister Maa'touq Mohammed Maa'touq signed the memorandum of understanding (MoU) on recruitment of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers from Bangladesh in the city. Libya signs the MoU at a time when major Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Oman have been carrying out crackdown on Bangladeshi workers on charges of violating local laws. "We will employ one million foreign workers in five years for the construction of 300,000 flats, 10,000 km of roads and maintenance of 24,000 km highways," Maa'touq told journalists after the signing ceremony. "We will prefer workers from Bangladesh. We have asked the Libyan, Japanese, German and Italian companies working in Libya to recruit people from Bangladesh," Maa'touq said. "Libya needs huge number of professors and professionals as we will set up 27 new universities." "Definitely we will have some unskilled labourers," he said. The minister said the Libyan mission in Dhaka issued 6,000visas in the last one month and the number would increase in the coming days. Iftekhar told bdnews24.com, "Libya has assured us that a huge quantum of the one million jobs will be met from Bangladesh". "This is a historic day. We have been able to explore a new labour market in Libya," he said. "We have proposed Libya to invest here to enhance the capacities of our refineries. The minister has responded positively. "According to the proposal, the Libyan crude petroleum products will be refined in Bangladesh for exporting it to the South East Asian countries," Iftekhar said. On possible Libyan investment in Bangladesh, Maa'touq said, "We will, of course, invest in Bangladesh". According to government figures, there are 20,000 to 25,000 Bangladeshis in Libya. Maa'touq arrived in Bangladesh on Thursday morning and visited some pharmaceutical companies and the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). "The minister has also shown interest in importing pharmaceutical products from Bangladesh," the adviser said. bd
