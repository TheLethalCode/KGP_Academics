 LUSAKA, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rupiah Banda, a pro-business centrist, was sworn in as Zambia's president on Sunday after narrowly defeating opposition leader Michael Sata in a disputed election. "I declare today that I will maintain and uphold the Constitution and laws of Zambia, so help me God," Banda said as he took the oath of office in Lusaka. He won 40.1 percent of the vote versus 38.1 percent for Sata. Sata, the leader of the Patriotic Front, has accused officials of rigging the poll and vowed to contest the result.
