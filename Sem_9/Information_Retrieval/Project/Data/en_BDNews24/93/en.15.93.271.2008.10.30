 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank chief has sought the media's cooperation to press on with the bank's ongoing banking and financial sector reforms under the next elected government. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed met with editors of leading national dailies and heads of news of electronic media at Bangladesh Bank Bhaban in Motijheel on Thursday. "[The central bank] has taken up a number of reform programmes in recent years to build up a stable and disciplined banking and financial industry," he later told reporters. "These reform programmes are an ongoing process. If we can ensure their continuance, it will have a positive impact on the economy of the country for the next generation." "A new government will come to power through elections. My tenure as the governor will end. The central bank has sought cooperation of different national dailies and head of news of electronic media so that the reforms taken by us continue in the changed circumstances." Asked whether there was any particular apprehension of the reform process being hampered after the election, the governor said: "I think there is no such fear. I believe that whichever party goes to power it will continue with banking and financial reforms for the welfare of the people." The central bank chief said the cooperation of media heads was sought from the assumption that if they highlight the reform measures it would help their continuation. The governor said the meeting also discussed the global financial crisis. "In the present world context, not everything can be left up to the market. Supervision and up-to-date information is necessary. The monitoring of all government regulatory agencies has to be stepped up." He said media chiefs asked what kind of negative impact the global crisis could have on the country's economy. "The central bank assures them that the banking and financial sector will face little negative impact. They have also been given an idea about what measures the central bank has taken to face the situation," said Salehuddin. Asked whether rescheduling of loans by defaulters has increased on the eve of ensuing elections, the governor said: "No, the central bank does not have any such information. However, banks have been asked to prepare an up-to-date report on defaulted loans ahead of the election." The executive editor of Dainik Sangbad, Manzurul Ahsan Bulbul, told reporters: "We wanted to know whether the instability created in the banking sector after the declaration of the state of emergency is over." "The governor, providing statistics, informed us that any such instability has lessened. In 2006-07 fiscal year, the growth of loans in the private sector was 15.43 percent. At the end of 2007-08 it increased to 24.54 percent." "We also asked the governor about recent allegations of money laundering against Trust Bank. The governor said the central bank does not have any information on such allegations." "The governor told us that the central bank is keeping a cautious eye on the world economic crisis," he added. bdnews
