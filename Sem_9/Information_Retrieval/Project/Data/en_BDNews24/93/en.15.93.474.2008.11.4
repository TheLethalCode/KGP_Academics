The Univision/Reuters/Zogby poll released on Tuesday said that 78 percent of a sample of 1,016 Latino likely voters favored Sen. Obama, with 13 percent supporting McCain, an Arizona senator. The poll, which was conducted between Oct. 30 and Nov. 2, found that 54 percent of respondents said the economy and jobs were the most important issue in deciding who to vote for, followed by health care and immigration, with 12 percent and 11 percent respectively. Hispanics make up 15 percent of the US population and 9 percent of the electorate, and could be a critical swing voting bloc in battleground states in the US Southwest as well as Florida on Tuesday. In 2004, President George W. Bush won about 40 percent of the Latino vote -- a Republican record -- when he beat Democrat John Kerry.
