<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami has appealed to the Election Commission to defer by five days a hearing on objections against its registration, a party official has said. "We received the Election Commission's letter late. We have applied to defer the hearing date as we haven't had time to fully prepare," Jamaat legal affairs secretary Jashim Uddin Sarkar told reporters, after submitting the appeal to the EC Saturday morning. Representatives of some of the seven groups that have raised objections against Jamaat's registration were already present at the EC Secretariat. Harun-ur-Rashid, coordinator of Sector Commanders Forum, one of the main objectors, told bdnews24.com that they had appeared for the scheduled hearing. The Election Commission has received seven separate statements of objection against the registration of Jamaat as a party, by SCF and the War Crimes Facts Finding Committee among others. EC official Moeen Uddin confirmed Saturday morning that they had received Jamaat's letter seeking deferment of the hearing date, but the commission was yet to take any decision in this regard. EC joint secretary and chief of the scrutiny committee Nurul Islam Khan had earlier told bdnews24.com that there would be no further processing of Jamaat's application for registration until the hearing was conducted. bdnews
