 Rohan Ziad bdnews24.com business correspondent Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Bureaucratic red tape primarily discourages non-resident Bangladeshis from investing in Bangladesh, the president of the British Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce says. "Poor infrastructural support is also one of the prime obstacles to doing business in Bangladesh," Shahagir Bakht Faruk told bdnews24.com on Friday during the International Business Conference organised by Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The BBCC formed in 1991 aims to promote and strengthen bilateral trade and commerce between Bangladesh and the United Kingdom. "In addition to encouraging NRBs to invest in Bangladesh we are also working to encourage Bangladeshi entrepreneurs to invest in the UK," said Faruk. On investment opportunities in Bangladesh, he said the NRBs were eyeing putting their money in the ICT sector. "Especially, call centres have very good prospect in Bangladesh," said the BBCC chief. Moreover, he added, there are huge opportunities to invest in the tourism and food processing sector. Faruk said he felt that the caretaker government's policy was favourable to the NRBs. He, however, evaded a direct answer to a query on whether the 'favourable environment' would be there once an elected government takes over. "We are business people. All we want is a congenial atmosphere for investment, nothing else." A 40-member BBCC delegation will visit Bangladesh next month to view exchanges with chamber of commerce in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet for better investment prospects in the special economic zone in Sylhet, said Faruk. The delegation is also set to meet with commerce and finance advisers. "[In the meeting with advisers] we will also discuss how to safeguard investments already made by NRBs from extortion, terrorism and other sorts of hazards", said Faruk. The delegation will hold a seminar on Nov 11 in Dhaka to find out what role the British-Bangladeshis can play to make the special economic zone in Sylhet effective, he added. The outcomes of these series of discussions would then be sent to the government in the form of proposals, added Faruk. Saad Gazi, senior vice chairman of BBCC, was also present during the interview. bd
