<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission heard statements of objection on Saturday against the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami as a party, including "proof of war crimes" from the War Crimes Facts Finding Committee. Jamaat did not appear at the hearing, fearing "unpleasantness" and having earlier asked for a five-day deferral of the hearing to prepare its own statement in answer to the objectors. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda, and fellow election commissioners M Sakhawat Hussain and Muhammad Sohul Hussain, concluded the two-hour hearing at the EC Secretariat around 2pm. Other groups who spoke against the party were the Sector Commanders Forum, Sammilito Sangskritik Jote, Bangabandhu Sangskritik Jote, Ekatturer Ghatak Dalal Nirmul Committee, Supreme Court Bar Association, Bangladesh Muktijoddha Sangsad, Amra Muktijoddhar Santan and Ain O Salish Kendro. After the hearing, WCFFC convener MA Hassan said: "We have present proof of involvement in war crimes of top Jamaat leaders Motiur Rahman Nizami, Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojahid, M Kamaruzzaman and ATM Azharul Islam." He said an appeal has been made to the United Nations to try the war criminals in an international tribunal. "Jamaat-e-Islami has implemented a religion-based agenda in this country backed by foreign forces," he added. SCF convener AK Khandaker told reporters: "It is not acceptable in any way to allow Jamaat's registration. The commission has assured us they will consider our statement." "We have protested against their registration. We will move to the court if Jamaat gets registered," he said. "Jamaat cannot be registered if the rule of law truly exists in the country. Even if they get registered, they will be thwarted," said Ghatok-Dalal Nirmul Committee member, Muntasir Mamun. Earlier in the day, Jamaat-e-Islami appealed to the Election Commission to defer Saturday's hearing by five days. Jamaat said it did not think it compulsory and did not wish to participate in the hearing at the same time with the organisations which raised the objections, fearing "an unpleasant situation". Asked what decision has been taken regarding Jamaat's appeal, the CEC said "no decision has yet been taken". After conclusion of the hearing, election commissioner Sohul Hussain told bdnews24.com: "We have heard those who raised objections. After hearing the plaintiffs, it may no longer be necessary to hear the defendant Jamaat-e-Islam." "The EC will sit and take a final decision in this regard." Jamaat legal affairs secretary Jashim Uddin Sarkar told reporters, after submitting the appeal to the EC Saturday morning: "We received the Election Commission's letter late. We have applied to defer the hearing date as we haven't had time to fully prepare." In the letter, signed by Jamaat office secretary Majharul Islam, it was stated that the party had received the EC's notice on the hearing on Oct 30. Most of the central leaders were at present outside Dhaka, and would not be back before Nov 2, the party said. It was not possible to take part in the hearing at such short time notice and the EC should defer the hearing by five days, the letter said. The letter also quoted a statement of the CEC, made on Oct 23, that there were no major obstacles to the registration of Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Party and Jamaat-e-Islami, among others, as they had "fulfilled all registration conditions". Jamaat's letter further quoted the CEC as saying: "It is the legal responsibility of the commission to get them registered without delay". The party also claimed that the organisations that had raised objections against Jamaat's registration were either front or associated organisations of Awami League. Jamaat applied for registration to the EC on Oct 20, bringing a number of changes to its constitution and changing its name from Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh to Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. EC joint secretary, and chief of the registration scrutiny committee, Nurul Islam Khan had earlier told bdnews24.com that there would be no further processing of Jamaat's application for registration until the hearing was conducted. bdnews24.
