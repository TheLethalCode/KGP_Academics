 MILAN, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan will guarantee their place in the Champions League knockout stages if they win at Anorthosis Famagusta later on Tuesday, with Barcelona and Chelsea also hoping to qualify with two games to spare. The Serie A champions, who can reach the last 16 thanks to a superior head-to-head record with Group B rivals Famagusta, will be without Adriano after the striker was again left out by coach Jose Mourinho because of several incidents of indiscipline. The Brazilian scored the winner in Inter's 1-0 home victory over the Cypriots last time out when rivals Werder Bremen and Panathinaikos, who meet again in Germany later, drew 2-2. Barca, who won 5-0 at point-less Basel two weeks ago, will go through with a victory over the Swiss club and 12 points from four matches unless Shakhtar Donetsk win at Sporting Lisbon in the other Group C game. Group A leaders Chelsea, last season's beaten finalists, travel to struggling AS Roma knowing three points will seal their progress if second-placed CFR Cluj defeat Girondins Bordeaux in Romania. Liverpool hope striker Fernando Torres is fit to face his former club Atletico Madrid at Anfield, with the winners heading into the knockout stages unless PSV Eindhoven win at point-less Olympique Marseille in the other Group D match
