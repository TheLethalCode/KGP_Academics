 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam alleged on Saturday that complainants had been "forced to file cases" against AL president Sheikh Hasina. "We know how our leader has been charged. The plaintiffs have been oppressed, repressed and threatened to force them to file cases against her, said Ashraful. "There is no abuse which was not applied to them. Even their family members were threatened," claimed the AL leader. Ashraf was speaking at a rally, demanding permanent release of Hasina, at AL's central party office on Saturday. He alleged that the government was aware that the cases against Hasina were false, but is not taking any step. Aiming at the government policy makers, the AL leader said: "You have taken too much time, now withdraw the cases against Sheikh Hasina." He called upon the government and Election Commission to go forward for polls, rather than creating "undue delays". "Awami League is ready for polls. If the election is not held, chaos will emerge in the country." He said AL would decide on electoral matters, including selection of candidates, at the party's central working committee meeting on Nov 6. Demanding immediate lifting of the emergency, he said: "The government has to take the liability of any party boycotting the poll under emergency." Party leaders spoke Saturday at the rally organised by Dhaka Metropolitan Jubo League. bdnews24.
