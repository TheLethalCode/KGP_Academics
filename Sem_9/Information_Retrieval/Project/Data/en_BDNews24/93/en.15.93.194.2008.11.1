 KHARTOUM, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sudanese armed forces have found one surviving Chinese worker and the body of another who had been kidnapped along with seven colleagues from an oil field nearly two weeks ago, state media said on Friday. SUNA news agency quoted an armed forces spokesman as saying a security patrol found the last two missing Chinese men, as well as a Sudanese soldier suffering leg injuries. Gunmen kidnapped the nine workers in the volatile energy-producing state of South Kordofan on October 18.

The Sudanese government blamed the kidnapping and killing on the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a Darfur rebel group. The group has denied any involvement. Diplomatic and tribal sources familiar with the issue said the kidnappers were a group of disaffected locals who probably wanted oil money. The group of Chinese nationals were doing contract work for the Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC). The company is a consortium led by China National Petroleum Corp that also includes India's ONGC, Malaysia's Petronas and Sudan's state-owned Sudapet. The kidnapping was the third such incident in South Kordofan in the past year. Analysts say the region, which borders strife-torn Darfur, could become another violent flashpoint.
