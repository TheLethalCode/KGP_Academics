 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a high-powered advisory committee to tackle the impact of the world economic crisis, the finance adviser said on Sunday. Ministry officials have termed the eight-member committee 'technical'. "It will recommend our steps on ways to deal with the crisis," AB Mirza Azizul slam told reporters after a meeting at the ministry. The committee would watch the global economic trends and make recommendations to the government for implementation every 15 days, the adviser said. Headed by finance secretary Md Tareq, the committee include the chairman of National Board of Revenue, a deputy governor of Bangladesh Bank, chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission, the controller of insurance, the vice chairman of Export Promotion Bureau, an additional secretary of Economic Relations Division and a member of Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division from the finance ministry. Export and import, exchange rates, share market, condition of insurance and annual development programme are the areas the members would recommend steps about. "If the crisis does not prolong a major impact on our export or on the remittance from the expatriate Bangladeshis is unlikely," Mirza Aziz said. Economists, financial experts and business leaders at a seminar on Oct 25 had urged the government to take signs of worldwide recession "seriously", and immediately form a high-level taskforce to minimise the possible impact on Bangladesh. "The government must take immediate action to avert any impact. For that the formation of a taskforce is urgent," Debapriya Bhattacharya, former executive director of Centre for Policy Dialogue, said. "Only a taskforce formed with experts can analyse the most up-to-date information on the world economy and advise the government on what to do," said Debapriya. Central bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed said: "Bangladesh Bank is monitoring the overall situation, but a taskforce is necessary." "The impact of the global crisis may not cast direct shadow on the banking sector or share market, but a negative impact on other sectors including remittance is possible," the governor warned. Former finance minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhit echoed the calls for a taskforce. "The crisis will have a negative impact on our export earnings and remittance flow. Foreign aid and investment is also likely to fall. As a result GDP growth will slow down." bdnews24
