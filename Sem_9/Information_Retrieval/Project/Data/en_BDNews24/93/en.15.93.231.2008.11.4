 RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Striker Adriano, who has been left out of Inter Milan's last two games for indiscipline, was named in Brazil's squad on Monday for this month's friendly against Portugal. World Player of the Year Kaka was also included by coach Dunga but Ronaldinho, who missed last month's World Cup qualifiers against Venezuela and Colombia, was again overlooked. Adriano, who appeared to be on the way back to his best after a prolonged spell of fitness problems, was left out of Inter's matches against Fiorentina and Reggina amid media reports he had been sent home for arriving late for training. "I have to be faithful to my convictions," Dunga told reporters. "I don't even know if there is a problem and if there is, it's superficial. "The problem is with Inter but we're going to talk when he's here. Adriano's behaviour here has been excellent and he's getting back to his best form." Dunga named a full-strength squad for Portugal's first visit to Brazil since 1989, a decision likely to anger European club coaches because of the amount of travelling involved. The game in Brasilia takes place on Nov. 19. Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter Milan), Doni (AS Roma) Defenders: Maicon (Inter Milan), Daniel Alves (Barcelona), Lucio (Bayern Munich), Miranda (Sao Paulo), Thiago Silva (Fluminense), Luisao (Benfica), Kleber (Santos), Marcelo (Real Madrid) Midfielders: Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos), Elano (Manchester City), Anderson (Manchester United), Josue (VfL Wolfsburg), Kaka (AC Milan), Diego (Werder Bremen), Mancini (Inter Milan), Alex Meschini (Internacional) Forwards: Robinho (Manchester City), Luis Fabiano (Sevilla), Alexandre Pato (AC Milan), Adriano (Inter Milan)
