 BEIJING, Sun Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A mudslide in southwest China on Sunday killed at least 15 people, with another 34 missing in the hilly countryside, official media reported. The torrent of mud and rock hit near Chuxiong city in Yunnan province in the afternoon, Xinhua news agency reported. Those killed came from several villages in rural Xishelu Township there, it said. The brief report did not give a reason for the mudslide. "The disaster is still under further investigation," it said. Local media reported showers over the past few days in this region, which is dominated by the Yi ethnic minority. The official China News Service said at least 300 people were "seriously affected" by the mudslide, but gave no details. That report said it struck in the early hours of the morning. Yunnan is dominated by steep terrain, and many of its farmers live in villages perched on steep slopes. Mining takes place in some areas. In September, a mudslide triggered by dammed up tailings from an iron ore mine killed over 250 people in north China's Shanxi province
