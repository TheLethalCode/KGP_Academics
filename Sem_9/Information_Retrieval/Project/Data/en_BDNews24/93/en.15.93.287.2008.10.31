 NEW DELHI, Fri Oct 31,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Friday that Congolese rebel leader Laurent Nkunda should keep a ceasefire declaration and engage in dialogue. Nkunda threatened Thursday to occupy an eastern city unless U.N. peacekeepers guaranteed a ceasefire, while foreign envoys scrambled to secure peace on the Rwanda-Congo border. "This ceasefire should be kept," Ban told a news conference in New Delhi. Nkunda's threat followed an offensive by Nkunda's Tutsi rebels that sent tens of thousands of civilians fleeing in the Democratic Republic of Congo's North Kivu province, raising fears of a repeat of the 1998-2003 war in the African state. Nkunda declared a ceasefire late Wednesday after his forces advanced almost to the limits of Goma, the provincial capital. "I have been speaking with many leaders," Ban said, mentioning he had been in contact with Congo President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame. "The EU is trying to deploy more forces on an urgent basis but some reports say there has been some disagreement ... I sincerely hope to contain the situation." Nkunda, who has said he is fighting to protect the ethnic Tutsi minority in eastern Congo, has rejected any return to a broad peace deal signed in January in North Kivu, saying the process was dominated too much by Kabila's government. He has said he was ready to talk peace, but with a neutral mediator. As tension persisted in Goma, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States have lobbied Rwanda and Congo to end the rebellion on their common border, with EU presidency holder France pressing for deployment of an EU force.
