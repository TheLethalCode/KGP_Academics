 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh has strongly condemned a deadly serial bomb attack in the Indian state of Assam. Eleven bomb blasts in quick succession tore through Guwahati and three other towns in Assam on Thursday, killing at least 65 people and wounding 335, police said. No one has claimed responsibility for the blasts so far. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, in an immediate reaction Thursday night, termed the bomb attack an act of "cowardly terrorism". "We strongly condemn the bomb blast in the North Eastern India that led to so many deaths and injuries." The adviser told bdnews24.com: "It is a cowardly act of terrorism. Violence cannot be a tool for achievement of political objectives." He said that Bangladeshis stand solidly behind their Indian neighbours in opposition to such wanton terrorism. bdnews2
