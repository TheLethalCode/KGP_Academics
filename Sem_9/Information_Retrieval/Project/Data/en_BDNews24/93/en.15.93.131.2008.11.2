<TEXT>
 NEW YORK/LONDON, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Gold prices dropped 2 percent on Friday, concluding their worst month in a quarter century as a strong dollar and recession fears drove investors into less volatile assets. Gold bullion lost 17 percent in October, its biggest decline since February, 1983, when it finished the month 18.2 percent lower. Bullion is down 12 percent this year, well below the record high of $1,030.80 an ounce struck in March. "Gold's moves today are mainly currency driven," said Simon Weeks, director of precious metals at the Bank of Nova Scotia. "At the month-end, flows are in favor of the dollar." Gold was at $720.35 an ounce at 2:04 pm EDT (1804 GMT), 2.1 percent lower than Thursday's close of $735.50. The US dollar and yen posted sharp gains after bleak US economic reports heightened global recession fears. Gold tends to move opposite to the dollar, whose strength makes bullion more expensive for holders of other currencies. A sharp drop of the COMEX futures open interest this week signaled more unwinding of long positions as extreme price volatility has dented buying sentiment. "Another big-position account probably stepped to the sidelines," said FC Stone broker George Nickas, referring to the tumbling open interest, a measure of market liquidity. Nickas said, however, that gold in the future should be supported by strong physical buying. "The issue is that the futures are depressed, but the physical market still continues to remain tight, and buyers have to pay a premium to take possession," Nickas said. US gold futures for December delivery GCZ8 settled down $20.30, or 2.8 percent, at $718.20 an ounce on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Bullion hit a 13-month low of $680.80 last week after investors sold bullion to pay for margin calls. Signs of recovery in stock markets and firmer oil spurred a rebound in gold this week but technical selling emerged after gold did not sustain Thursday's high. DOLLAR THE DRIVER "The key driver for gold at the moment is the US dollar and it looks like it is going to strengthen again and that is definitely negative for gold," a London-based trader said. US data on Friday showed consumers in September cut spending for the first time in two years, evidently bracing for hard times. "In times of recession, the most likely scenario for gold is it goes down a lot, especially if it is trading at historically high levels," said Jesper Dannesboe, senior commodity strategist at Societe Generale. "Because the fears of inflation will be replaced by fears of disinflation and that is a killer for gold ... I think gold is going below $600 in this cycle." January platinum PLF9 ended down $1 at $831.60 after falling more than 5 percent during the session. Slowing economies around the globe and the credit crisis have forced auto companies to slash car production, hitting demand for platinum which is used in catalytic converters. Spot platinum traded at $813.50 ounce, after touching an intraday low of $770, down from $817.00 in New York. It has tumbled more than 60 percent since hitting a lifetime high of $2,290 in March. Palladium was at $193.50 from its previous close of $197.00, while spot silver was bucking the falling trend at at $9.83 an ounce, up 1.8 percent from Thursday close of $9.66
