<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov. 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has revoked clauses 5 and 6 of Emergency Powers Rules 2007, removing media restrictions and barriers to campaign rallies and processions, an announcement said Monday Parliamentary and Upazila candidates will now be able to assemble supporters and organise rallies in accordance with the Representation of the People Order 1972 and the 2008 Upazila law, a home ministry circular said. Clause 5 had imposed restrictions on the media, with clear instructions not to publish or broadcast reports on assemblies, public meetings, rallies, processions and statements. It also banned "provocative news stories, editorials and post-editorials, cartoons and talk shows." Clause 6 barred criticism of the government and its activities. The relaxation comes nearly 22 months after the Rules were put in force last year. President Iajuddin Ahmed declared the state of emergency on Jan. 11 last year, with an army-installed civilian caretaker government taking over and giving itself a two-year term until a general election, now slated for Dec. 18. Upazila polls have been scheduled just ten days after the parliamentary poll. Major political parties have been demanding a full withdrawal of emergency for elections, but the government has maintained that some of the extra-ordinary powers were needed to control 'rogue elements'. The Awami League has already launched itself into electioneering, saying it would not boycott any election though AL chief Sheikh Hasina has come out in favour of deferring Upazila polls. Rival party BNP, and its allies, have postponed a decision on their course of action until Wednesday. Filing of nomination papers closes Nov. 13 for both elections, with the last date of withdrawal for parliamentary candidates being on Nov. 24 and for Upazilas Nov. 27. Campaigning is allowed after the date of withdrawal, but not more than 21 days before polling day, and will close 32 hours ahead of voting that starts at 8am. bdnews2
