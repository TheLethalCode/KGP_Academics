 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League has expressed concern at the denial of bail to party chief Sheikh Hasina in a case and the delay in announcement of the Jatiya Sangsad election schedule. "The election has to be held on December 18. Without it the chaos in the country will not end," acting president Zillur Rahman on Thursday said. Zillur expressed frustration at the Appellate Division's rejection of Hasina's bail plea in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. "The court order is painful. We are frustrated. [Sheikh Hasina] is on parole, but it is not the case that bail cannot be secured in if she is on parole." In his reaction to the EC's decision to defer the Nov 2 announcement of the polls schedule, the AL leader said: "We have been frustrated again. The doubt people have over the elections has been intensified." Zillur spoke to reporters after a views exchange with labour leaders of Sramik Karmachari Oikya Parishad (SKOP), a national platform of labour organisations. Asked when Hasina would return home, he said: "We are hopeful that the leader will return home in the first week of November." Replying to the same question, AL presidium member Tofail Ahmed said: "We are very hopeful that Sheikh Hasina will return home by November 10." Tofail added: "There is no alternative to holding elections on December 18. If there is any obstacle, the caretaker government will have to remove it. If the election is not held, the country will plunge into deep political and economic crisis." He urged the EC to hold elections under the old constituency boundaries, if necessary. Leaders of SKOP asked the AL to incorporate labour issues in the party's election manifesto. They also urged the party to back candidates from different classes and professions including workers. bdnews
