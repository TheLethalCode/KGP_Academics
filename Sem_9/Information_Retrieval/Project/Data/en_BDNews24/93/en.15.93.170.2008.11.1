 LUSAKA, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambian opposition leader Michael Sata on Saturday held on to a slim lead in a presidential election that will determine who rules one of Africa's most stable and economically successful countries. Sata, who heads the Patriotic Front, had 650,605 votes versus 615,241 votes for acting President Rupiah Banda, the Election Commission of Zambia announced. The tally was based on results from 128 of 150 constituencies. Africa's biggest copper producer voted on Thursday to choose a successor to Levy Mwanawasa, who died in August after suffering a stroke. Some 3.9 million Zambians were registered to vote in the poll. Election officials said the release of the official count was proceeding slowly. "We are slow because we have to verify all the results," said Chris Akufuna, a spokeswoman for the electoral commission. Sata, a populist who narrowly lost a 2006 election to Mwanawasa, has received strong support from the capital Lusaka and the country's copper-producing region. Banda is counting on a heavy turnout in rural strongholds to overtake the challenger. The Zambian leader has pledged to maintain Mwanawasa's business-friendly policies if elected.
