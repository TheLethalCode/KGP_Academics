 LUSAKA,Sun Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Zambian acting President Rupiah Banda has widened his lead in the presidential election and preparations are being made to swear him in on Sunday as leader of the southern African nation. Banda, a pro-business centrist who took power after Levy Mwanawasa died of a stroke in August, has taken just over 40 percent of the 1.78 million votes cast in Thursday's election versus 38.2 percent for challenger Michael Sata. The latest tally, announced by the electoral commission in Lusaka, was based on preliminary results from 149 of 150 constituencies. Only votes from a remote area in western Zambia have not been counted. Florence Mumba, chairwoman of the electoral commission, said the final result would be released later on Sunday. Banda's ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy has said it is confident that Banda's lead is unassailable. Government officials told Reuters that Banda would be inaugurated on Sunday in the capital. Sata has said the election was rigged and his Patriotic Front party has vowed to challenge the result in court. The PF said the vote was marked by discrepancies between vote tallies and the number of voters on registration lists. Zambia is Africa's largest copper producer and any political turmoil could unsettle foreign investors, particularly those in the mining sector. Sata, a populist with strong support among workers and the poor, made the same charge two years ago when he lost the presidential election to Mwanawasa. VOTE COUNT WAS SLOW Authorities have said the army is ready to prevent unrest in the country, one of the most politically stable in Africa. Election officials said the count had proceeded slowly, but defended their actions. "The vast distances and poor terrain have created difficulties in delivery of election materials (ballots)," Mumba said. Independent election monitors have noted some irregularities in the poll but have stopped short of condemning the vote. About 45 percent of the 3.9 million registered voters cast ballots in the election. The winner faces the formidable task of matching Mwanawasa's strong record of fiscal discipline, praised by Western donors and investors, and fighting corruption, two rare successes in Africa. The vote is also seen as a test of Zambia's commitment to multi-party democracy, restored in 1990 after 18 years of one-party rule under Kenneth Kaunda, but neither Banda nor Sata is expected to reshape the political landscape dramatically. Banda had hoped to benefit from Zambia's relative prosperity as well as Mwanawasa's popularity. He pledged to maintain the government's pro-business policies if elected. Sata also promised to grow the economy while fighting unemployment
