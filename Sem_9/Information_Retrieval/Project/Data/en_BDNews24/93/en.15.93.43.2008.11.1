<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 01 (dbnews24.com) -- France has expressed its interest in helping Bangladesh generate nuclear power. "Bangladesh could benefit from France's expertise in preparing a nuclear power programme," French ambassador Charley Causseret told a seminar on Saturday. Franco-Bangladesh scholars organised the seminar on ''Power sector management: Bangladesh perspective" at the Sheraton Hotel in Dhaka. Causeret pointed out: "About 80 percent of the power generation capacity in the country is gas based. With the country's gas reserves reaching a critical point, alternatives have to be considered seriously." The chief adviser's special assistant in charge of energy, M Tamim said Bangladesh relied mainly on non-renewable fuels to generate power. "Only 4-5 percent are renewable energy resources, such as hydro-power and solar." "At this moment we have no alternative without coal. We need $10 billion to generate power and improvement transmission and distribution systems," said the special aide. Most important for energy policy is good political vision and assessment of need, he added. "We are going to be a middle income nation within ten years. So we need more energy. Political parties should have a shared view for the development of the country." "I hope France will cooperate us on this journey," Tamim added. Describing developments in power sector management, the special assistant said in recent years system loss had declined from 40 to 20 percent. "It is possible to reduce it further, to some 10 percent," he added. Power division secretary M Faozul Kabir Khan said the country first needed to update an ancient generation and transmission system. Causeret said: "Nuclear option can be a valid alternative to fossil fuels in Bangladesh. It is however a long term option; developing a nuclear industry requires a strong policy and institutional policy." The ambassador said France had a success story in nuclear power. "Today almost 80 percent of electricity in France is generated from nuclear power." bdn
