 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - The three-day 'DCCI Trade Fair 2008' kicked off in the capital Thursday with the aim of introducing Bangladeshi products to the overseas business community. "I hope the country's export sector will expand more with the exposition attracting overseas businessmen to Bangladeshi products," commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said while inaugurating the expo at the Bangladesh-China conference. The trade fair will also run alongside a two-day international trade conference, scheduled to begin on Friday, with the participation of business ambassadors from 17 countries, the DCCI information officer Mahbub Rabbani said. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to formally inaugurate the trade conference on Friday, being held by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries to mark its golden jubilee.
