 Dhaka, Nov 03 (bdnews24.com)  President of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Hossain Khaled has urged political parties to prioritise economic development in their manifestos. "Manifestos of all parties should also pledge not to use workers, hartals and strikes as political tools for the greater interest of country's economic development," Khaled said at a press conference at the DCCI office. The press was briefed on a declaration of the DCCI-hosted Dhaka International Trade Conference, or 'Dhaka Vision', a summary of recommendations and opinions on the country's economy by business experts from home and abroad. "To eliminate poverty and take the country forward to middle-income status, Bangladesh would need to achieve growth rates in excess of seven to eight percent with the help of investment in energy and improvement of physical infrastructure," the declaration said. The declaration places emphasis on developing human resources along with encouraging private sector initiatives, said Khaled. The Dhaka Vision predicted Asia would play a strong role in changing the global financial landscape in the future, with skilled and cost-effective labour. Inclusion of the region's youth, women and rural populations in economic activities is a must, it said. Khaled said the declaration would be sent to political parties and the government. "People want the election to be held on schedule after creating a level playing field for all," he observed. bdnews
