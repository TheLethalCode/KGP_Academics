 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Trial courts have suspended witness testimonies in two corruption cases against Sheikh Hasina until the High Court disposes of two separate petitions by the former prime minister to have the cases quashed. The High Court had earlier stayed two casesa Tk 3 crore extortion case and the barge-mounted power plant caseon the petitions by Hasina challenging their legality. Defence lawyers on Tuesday had submitted a copy of the High Court stay order on the extortion case to Judge Md Ashraf Hossain of the Special Sessions Judge's Court. Prime Bank chairman Azam J Chowdhury filed the case on June 13 last year with Gulshan Police Station that accuses Sheikh Hasina and her cousin former health minister Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim of extorting Tk 2.99 crore during Hasina's 1996-2001 stint as prime minister in return for allowing him to set up a power plant. The plaintiff later said in court that he had not sued Hasina and that he filed a case only against Selim for extorting the money from him in return for a promised deal. Chowdhury said he had no idea how Hasina's name surfaced in the case. Hasina was arrested at her Dhanmondi home on July 16, 2007, and named arrested in the case the following day after it was brought under Emergency Powers Rules. Charges were pressed against Hasina, Selim and Hasina's sister Sheikh Rehana on July 24 last year. The sessions judge's court framed charges on Jan 13. On Feb 6, the High Court quashed the case after ruling illegal its trial under emergency powers rules. On May 8, on a government appeal, the Supreme Court overturned the High Court order, allowing its trial to resume. Meanwhile, judge Md Feroz Alam of the Special Judge's Court-1 suspended trial proceedings on Tuesday in the barge-mounted power plant case and ordered defence lawyers to submit a copy of the High Court stay by Nov 23. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on Sept. 2 last year with Tejgaon Police Station against eight persons including Hasina, accusing them of illegally awarding contracts for setting up three barge-mounted power plants in exchange. Other accused in the case are former chairman of the Power Development Board Nuruddin Mahmud Kamal, directors of Summit Group Md Aziz Khan and Farid Khan, director of United Group Hasan Mahmud Raja, director of the group and curator of Bangababdhu Memorial Museum Syed Siddiqur Rahman. Charges were framed against all accused in the case on May 18. The court started taking witness testimonies on May 21. Hasina, facing five graft cases, was allowed temporary release from special jail on July 11. She left for the United States the next day, after being excused on medical grounds from personal appearance in all court proceedings against her. bdnews24
