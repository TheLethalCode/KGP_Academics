<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission has extended the deadline to Dec. 31 for government and private organisations involved with the trade of power, gas and petroleum products to apply for licence, its chairman says. "All organisations involved with the trade of power and gas generation, transmission and distribution and with the trade of petroleum products will have to take licences," Golam Rahman told bdnews24.com on Thursday. He said the deadline will not be stretched further. BERC sources said the deadline has been extended four times. The first deadline was April, which later was extended to June and October in two phases. The last date for application was extended for a fourth time as many government and private firms did not apply for licence by the previous deadline and the process of awarding licence could not be complete. A government regulation in 2006 asked all organisations involved with power and gas generation, transmission and distribution and the firms involved with trading in petroleum products to get licence. It said the licence has to be taken within 120 days of the publication of the regulation. However, as the BERC was not active at the time the order did not come into effect. BERC has given licence to more than 100 firms after taking fresh initiatives this year and 25 organisations were handed licence recently. It directed these organisations on Jan. 10 to take licence. Sources said many organisations producing captive power have not applied for licence while three firms producing electricity to meet their own need have applied to lower the licence fees. The chairman said a committee has been formed following their appeal and a decision would be made on the basis of the recommendations. BERC said Petrobangla, Power Development Board (PDB), Dhaka Power Distribution Company Limited, Dhaka Power Distribution Authority, Rural Electrification Board (REB) and some other organisations have taken licences. Other government organisations have already applied for licence. bdnew
