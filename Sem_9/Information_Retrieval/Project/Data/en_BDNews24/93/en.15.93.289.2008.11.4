 Chittagong, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The US ambassador in Dhaka has said the easing of the emergency is a "good start" on the way to the elections, which he hoped would not be held amid emergency. James F Moriarty said his government believed the emergency would be further relaxed. He took questions from reporters after a views-exchange meeting with the businessmen, organised by the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries (CCCI) at a city hotel on Tuesday. He said the Dec. 18 parliamentary polls and Dec. 28 Upazila election would take democracy in Bangladesh one step ahead. The US presidential election and Bangladesh's parliament election, he observed, were important for choosing leadership and running both countries. Many people had varied expectations about the two elections, Moriarty said and added Bangladeshis would have to decide on the future of the country and the type of democracy. The US envoy said the elected Upazila chairmen would play an important role in building democracy at grassroots level. The Upazila election will also be crucial to building up the next generation of leadership for Bangladesh, he noted. Moriarty said he believed the next elected government in Bangladesh would continue to take steps for development of democracy, and against the internal and international terrorists and terror networks. He also hoped the next government would work for decentralisation of power and administration. Moriarty said the local bodies in Bangladesh were weaker and underdeveloped compared to the central organisations. Decentralisation was an urgent need for institutionalising democracy. He urged the businessmen to play an effective role in development of democracy. The US envoy said the US would continue different programmes to strengthen local government in Bangladesh. His government has already welcomed the caretaker government's initiatives for the development of local government structure. They are interested to work with the next election government on the issue, he said. Moriarty expressed the hope that the global economic depression would be over soon and said the US would work to make sure the developing countries are not much affected by the meltdown. Terming Chittagong as the heartland of the country's economy, he said Chittagong port needs good management. He also hoped that the law-enforcement agencies would play an effective role to ensure security of maritime border of the country. Chittagong chamber president Saifuzzaman Chowdhury presided over the meeting, where former FBCCI president Yusuf Abdullah Harun, former mayor of Chittagong and Jatiya Party leader Mahmudul Islam, former CCCI president Ali Ahmed and BGMEA leader Mahbub Ali spoke. Saifuzzaman said there was no alternative to administrative decentralisation for development of the country, for good governance, and for expansion of trade and commerce. Earlier in the morning, Moriarty visited Ismailia Sukani Primary School in Patenga. bdnew
