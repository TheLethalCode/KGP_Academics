<TITLE> Media runs dubious Horlicks ad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  The advertisement of Horlicks, banned in Britain on false nutritional claims, was carried by local TV stations and largest-selling daily newspaper Prothom Alo on Friday, despite an adviser's recent suggestion that such adverts had better not be entertained. Britain's advertisement watchdog recently found the maker GlaxoSmithKline's claim that Horlicks makes babies "taller, stronger and sharper" false and banned the commercial made for Bangladesh but mistakenly aired in the UK. Food and health adviser AMM Shawkat Ali on Friday said the government could take no action against the advertiser in the absence of a law against such practices. He said the government would soon enact a law banning commercials on false claims such as Horlicks'. "How can we take action against such practices in absence of necessary law?," Shawkat told bdnews24.com. He said the government had already started framing such law. Nestl, maker of Maggi Noodles, and GSK, wrongly claimed their noodles and drinks would make children stronger, the Britain's Advertising Standards Authority said in separate rulings which throw unflattering light on the food and pharmaceutical giants' marketing in the developing world. The media watchdog ruled the adverts were misleading and inaccurate, and should not be repeated, the British media reported. The adverts were intended for broadcast in Bangladesh but was screened by mistake by Nepali TV, a satellite channel based in London, making them liable to investigation by the ASA. A professor of communication has suggested that people affected by false advertisements could go to the Press Council to seek compensation. "Anyone being affected by the wrong advertisement can go to Press Council for redress," Dr Sakhawat Ali Khan, a former Dhaka University journalism teacher, told bdnews24.com on Friday. "If proved right in the court, the media outlet concerned will have to pay compensation to the victims as per a previous verdict of the Press Council," the professor said. He said publication of false advertisements in Bangladesh was not new. "On ethical ground, no media should telecast or publish commercials made on false claim," said Dr Khan. He suggested the media policymakers sit together and adopt a resolution on advertisement. "The media outlets can make it mandatory for the advertiser to produce the clearance from the national certification authority before carrying any commercial," said Dr Khan. bd
