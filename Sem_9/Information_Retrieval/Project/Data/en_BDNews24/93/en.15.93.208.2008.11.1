 BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Africa crushed Kenya by 159 runs on Friday to go 1-0 up in their two-match series of one-dayers. JP Duminy's knock of 90, Jacques Kallis's 71 and Mark Boucher's 30-ball 57 not out led the hosts to 336 for seven after they won the toss. Alex Obanda (38) and David Obuya (35) were the only Kenyan batsmen to get past 30 as off-spinners Johan Botha (four for 19) and Duminy (three for 31) bowled the visitors out for 177 in 49.1 overs. Botha was captaining South Africa for the first time, standing in for the injured Graeme Smith. "We set ourselves goals for the match and we pretty much achieved them," Botha told reporters.
