 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  A meeting between BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and secretaries general of the four-party alliance, following the announcement of election schedules on Sunday, ran on late into the night, ending inconclusively. "BNP and alliance parties will meet soon to decide on our course of action," BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said after the two-hour meeting that ended shortly after 11pm. Islami Oikyo Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami told reporters: "Top alliance leaders will hold a summit meeting on Nov 5." Expressing frustration at Sunday's High Court verdict, on the Election Commission's demarcation of parliamentary seats, Delwar said: "Our lawyers will consider the matter." Earlier in the evening, BNP and its allies called an emergency secretary general meeting, immediately after the chief election commissioner's televised announcement of the schedule for general election. The secretaries general held the one and half hour emergency meeting at Delwar's NAM Flat residence, which ended inconclusively, before Delwar led them to the BNP chief's Gulshan office in the city. BNP office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told reporters that they would brief the press later. They were discussing the election schedule and the High Court verdict on the demarcation of parliamentary constituencies, among other issues, he said. BNP joint secretary general Selima Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and Bangladesh Jatiyo Party secretary general were among those present at the meeting at Delwar's residence. bdnew
