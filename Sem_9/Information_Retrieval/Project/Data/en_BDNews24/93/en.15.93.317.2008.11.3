<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 02 (bdnews24.com)UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that the global financial crisis could not be allowed to impede efforts to fight climate change, adding that Bangladesh set an example of "resilience" for the world. "A one-metre rise in sea level would displace 30 million Bangladeshis and deal a catastrophic blow to economic growth and development," Ban said, speaking to the press at the Sonargaon Hotel prior to leaving Dhaka. "Times of global crisis demand global solidarity. We cannot allow the financial crisis to turn into a prolonged human crisis." "For the same reason, we cannot allow the financial crisis to impede our efforts to fight climate change," he said. The UN chief lauded Bangladesh's development during the last three decades. "Bangladesh is an example to the world community on how a vulnerable developing country can strengthen its resilience against recurrent catastrophic events," said Ban. "Your best practices and lessons learned can help other countries, including others in the region prone to natural disasters," he said. He said he had made calls to developed countries to support the developing and poorest nations. "As UN secretary-general, I will have to be the voice of the voiceless and defender of the defenceless," he said. bdn
