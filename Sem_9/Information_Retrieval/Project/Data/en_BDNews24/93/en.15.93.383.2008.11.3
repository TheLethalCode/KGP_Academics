 KOLKATA, India, Mon Nov 3, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police arrested eight villagers in an West Bengal for possible links with Maoist insurgents who triggered a blast aimed at senior government ministers, police said on Monday. Six policemen travelling in the last car of a convoy escorting steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadev Bhattacharya were wounded in the landmine blast on Sunday. The ministers were not hurt. The ministers had gathered in the Salboni area of the state, where JSW Steel Ltd, India's third-largest producer, has decided to set up a steel plant. The attack struck at the heart of West Bengal's political machine, highlighting the growing reach of the Maoist insurgency that stretches across eastern, central and southern India. The plant in West Midnapore district will produce 10 million tonnes of steel by 2020, but Maoist insurgents in the region have vowed to stop the project. Many officials travelled to Salboni, a Maoist hotbed, as the government tried to woo back investors to the communist-run state after Tata Motors moved its small car plant from the state last month after violent protests over a land row. In West Midnapore, police found a 2.5-km long wire which had been attached to the landmine. They said it had been remotely detonated. "We are worried, since it occurred very close to Midnapore town," Anup Bhushan Vohra, the state police chief, said on Monday after visiting the spot about four hours' drive from Kolkata, the state capital. Security experts said Sunday's attack was an example of how Maoists are gradually making inroads into towns and cities. Maoist rebels have dropped pamphlets in the district in the past urging villagers not to give land for the project and some experts warned it could be a repeat of Singur, where Tata had set up a sprawling factory only to dismantle it later. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had earlier described the four-decade-old Maoist rebellion, which has killed thousands, as the single biggest threat to India's internal security. In September, Maoists killed four policemen with a landmine in a central Indian district where the country's president, Pratibha Patil, was holidaying, police said. Maoist rebels say they are fighting for the rights of poor farmers and landless labourers and regularly attack government property and policemen
