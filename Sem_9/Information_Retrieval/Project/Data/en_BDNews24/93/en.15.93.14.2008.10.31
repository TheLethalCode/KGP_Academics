<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Occasional off spinner Virender Sehwag grabbed three wickets but Ricky Ponting struck 87 as Australia reached 338 for four on the third day of the third test against India on Friday. Australian skipper Ponting led the top order fightback in reply to India's daunting first innings 613 for seven declared. Sehwag bowled Ponting and Mike Hussey (53) in the evening session after trapping opener Matthew Hayden (83). At stumps, Michael Clarke was on 21 with Shane Watson on four. Hayden raised 123 runs with fellow opener Simon Katich (64) before adding another 79 for the next wicket with Ponting. Sehwag took three for 66 to bolster a struggling Indian bowling attack already without injured off spinner Harbhajan Singh, with skipper Anil Kumble also forced off the field in the afternoon session. Leg spinner Kumble suffered a bad cut on his left hand after dropping Hayden on 70. PONTING FIFTY Hayden, who also added 79 runs for the second wicket with Ponting, struck 13 fours and a lofted Mishra for a six in his 154-ball effort. Ponting, who made 123 in the drawn first test in Bangalore, tackled the spin bowlers well before steering Sehwag to third man for three runs to reach his 41st test fifty. With skipper Kumble off the field, he used his feet well to negate the sharp turn which Mishra gained from the pitch which was still ideal for batting. Katich, who hit two centuries on his test comeback in the West Indies this year, looked good for another in the morning until he was bowled by Mishra, beaten by a sharp leg break. He cracked 10 fours, including fluent drives past mid-on against paceman Zaheer Khan and leg spinner Anil Kumble, to calm any dressing room nerves in the morning until he was out. Indian opener Gautam Gambhir had top-scored with 206 and Vangipurappu Laxman struck 200 not out in the Indian innings. Gambhir was handed a one-test ban for a code breach after being found guilty of deliberately elbowing Australian all rounder Shane Watson while taking a run on the first day. The batsman has appealed against the decision. India lead the four-match series 1-0 after winning the second test in Mohali by 320 runs. The fourth and final test starts in Nagpur on Nov.
