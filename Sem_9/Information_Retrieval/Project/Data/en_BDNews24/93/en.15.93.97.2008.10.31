<TITLE> Son of Liberian warlord convicted of torture in US </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MIAMI, Oct 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The son of former Liberian President Charles Taylor was found guilty by a US court on Thursday of torture in the first prosecution under a 14-year-old law that allows citizens to be prosecuted for such crimes committed abroad. The jury in Miami found Charles "Chuckie" Taylor Jr. guilty on all eight counts brought against him, including allegations he and his cohorts tortured victims in Liberia by applying electric shocks to their genitals, burning them with hot irons and melting plastic and rubbing salt in their open wounds. "It sends a very powerful message to human rights violators worldwide that they are not welcome here," said Sigal Mandelker, deputy assistant attorney general with the crime division of the US Department of Justice. Five victims testified during the five-week trial against Taylor Jr., whose father, once one of Africa's most feared warlords, is on trial in The Hague for suspected war crimes during the civil war in Liberia's neighbor, Sierra Leone. Some of the witnesses still carried the scars left by their torture, said south Florida Attorney General Alexander Acosta. "The acts of which he was convicted were horrific," Acosta said outside the Miami federal courthouse. "It's the first (case) of its kind but that doesn't mean it's the last of its kind." Sentencing is scheduled for January 9. The charges Taylor Jr. was convicted on, which cover acts of torture between 1999 and 2003, carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. The younger Taylor was born Charles Emmanuel, changed his name legally to Roy Belfast Jr. in 1990 and is commonly referred to by his nickname, Chuckie Taylor. Born in Boston, he was arrested at Miami International Airport in 2006 and pleaded guilty to a charge of lying about his father's identity on a passport application. He was later indicted for torturing victims when he was the commander of a paramilitary security force called the Antiterrorist Unit -- known as the "Demon Forces" -- that protected the elder Taylor while he was president of Liberia. "Today's verdict is a milestone in ensuring justice for atrocities," said Elise Keppler, senior counsel for Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program. Keppler called on the U.S. authorities to bring more such cases against accused human rights violators. The younger Taylor and his soldiers are accused of torturing captives by burning them with cigarettes, dripping molten wax or plastic on them and confining them naked in pits covered with iron bars and shoveling stinging ants on them. They poured boiling water into the cupped hands of one victim while holding a gun to his head, implying the victim would be killed if he let a drop of water spill to the ground, Acosta said. In one incident, the indictment alleges that Taylor stopped a group of suspected rebels near a checkpoint at the St. Paul River bridge at Gbalatuah, Liberia, picked out three people and "summarily shot them in front of others in the group." At the paramilitary unit's base, the indictment said, Taylor ordered his soldiers to cut off a captive's head. They held the victim's head over a bucket and severed it by slitting his throat from back to front after he begged for his life. Chuckie Taylor was the first person charged under a law passed in 1994 known as the extraterritorial torture statute, which allows prosecutors to charge a US citizen or someone present in the United States with acts of torture or conspiracy to torture outside the country
