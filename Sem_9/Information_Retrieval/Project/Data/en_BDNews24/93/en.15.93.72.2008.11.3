 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com energy correspondent Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)Cities and towns will have to endure more power cuts this irrigation season while 20,000 new connections have been planned for farms in rural Bangladesh. For another year, the struggling economy, with its heavy dependence on agriculture, will have to make do with the power deficiency and try to help the farmers, say senior officials. "The department of agriculture has asked for more power this time. That shouldn't be a problem considering our enhanced production capacity," said power secretary Dr M Fauzul Kabir Khan to bdnews24.com, after an inter-ministerial meeting Monday. "But it all depends on supply of gas," the secretary said, "as we will have our production capacity up by 600 megawatts by Feb-March." The meeting, at the power division, reviewed the power supply situation in the irrigation season. Like the past boro-season that gave a bumper output, he said, irrigation would continue to get priority and "will get more this time". According to the agriculture ministry, boro was cultivated in 45 lakh hectare of land, of which 10 lakh went to hybrid. Paddy fields across the country were fed by nearly 12 lakh diesel-powered machines and 1.61 lakh pumps run on electricity. Power production during this period averaged between 3400 and 3700 MW, according to Power Development Board. This time, the production target has been fixed at 3800 to 4000 MW. At present, the average power generation stands at 3500-3600 MW. Inadequate gas supply alone has caused a production loss of 600 MW. In addition, lower-than-normal water level at Kaptai Lake has been hampering generation.
