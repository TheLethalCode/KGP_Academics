<TITLE> Germany coach Loew to meet Frings over remarks </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BERLIN, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Germany coach Joachim Loew has agreed to meet Torsten Frings over the midfielder's controversial reaction at failing to start the last two World Cup qualifiers. Frings said last month that he was considering retiring from the national team after starting on the bench against Russia and Wales, but later retracted his statement. Monday's announcement follows similar clear-the-air talks held with captain Michael Ballack last week. "There will also be a conversation (with Frings) because there are a few things that have to be cleared up between him and me," Loew told German website Sport1 (www.sport1.de), without specifying a date for the meeting. The coach said that Frings's future with the team "will depend on the conversation we have and of course on his sporting performances." Ballack also publicly questioned Loew's selection policy but was kept on as Germany captain after apologising to the coach during Thursday's meeting in Frankfurt. "The most important thing for me was having the private meeting," Loew said of his get-together with Ballack. "I had the feeling that Michael had apologised and understood his mistakes, and had totally accepted everything that I said to him.
