 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Dhaka Warriors brightened their chance of qualifying for the semifinals of the breakaway Indian Cricket League with a convincing eight-wicket win over Chandigarh Lions at Tau Devi Lal Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh on Friday. With three wins in six matches, Dhaka Warriors raised their point tally to six, two points behind Chennai Superstar, Hyderabad Heroes and Bengal Tigers, who played a match more than the first two teams' five outings. Warriors raced to 138 for two in 17.5 overs in reply to Chandigarh's moderate total of 138 for nine in the stipulated 20 overs. Openers Shahriar Nafees and Nazimuddin gave Dhaka Warriors a fine start picking up 50 runs from 46 balls. The introduction of spinners made Warriors slow with Bipul Sharma striking double blow to reduce Warriors to 62 for two in 10.4 overs. Bipul had Nazimuddin caught by Uniyal for a 25-ball 23 studded with three boundaries before trapping Aftab Ahmed leg before for five. Alok Kapali, Warriors' best performer, came into the pitch and eased the pressure along with Nafees who initially seemed cautious, but later came out from his shield to strike his second fifty in the tournament. Nafees, adjudged man of the match, finally remained unbeaten on 72 off 60 balls studded with 10 fours and one six. Alok drove Andre Hall for winning four to take Dhaka Warriors home with his 17-ball 32 knock that included two sixes and three fours. Earlier, Chandigarh Lions, invited to bat first, could manage 137 for nine in 20 overs with Bipul topscoring 30 off 22 balls before the all-rounder was the third victim of Mohammad Rafique, who gave away 28 runs in his four-over spell. Mosharraf Hossain Rubel grabbed two wickets while Mohammad Sharif, Tapash Kumar Baisya and Alok Kapali chipped in with one wicket apiece. Dhaka Warriors will play their seventh match against Ahmedabad Rockets on Monday.
