 NEW DELHI, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Factbox on India test captain Anil Kumble who retired from test cricket after the third test against Australia in New Delhi on Sunday. Born on Oct 17, 1970 in Bangalore. Tests: 132 matches, 619 wickets at an average of 29.65. 2,506 runs with one century and five fifties. Switched from pace bowling to spin very early due to a jerky action and after his debut aged 19 in 1990 quickly became the pivot around which India began dominating home matches on spin-friendly pitches. Became only the second bowler in tests to claim all 10 wickets in a test innings in 1999, emulating England spinner Jim Laker, to bowl India to a series-levelling win over Pakistan in New Delhi. Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1996. Captain for one one-day match, a four-wicket win over England in 2002. The third highest wicket-taker in tests with 619 scalps, behind Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan and retired Australian Shane Warne. Retired from one-day cricket last year after India's first-round exit in the World Cup to finish with 337 wickets at 30.89 from 271 matches. Struck his maiden test hundred in the drawn third and final test against England at the Oval in August 2007, scoring 110 not out in his 118th test, the only hundred by an Indian during the 1-0 series win. Named test captain in November last year in the twilight of his career ahead of one-day captain and front-runner Mahendra Singh Dhoni to protect the wicketkeeper from the burden of handling too much too soon after Rahul Dravid abruptly quit captaincy. Announced his retirement on the final day of the third test against Australia in New Delhi on Sunday
