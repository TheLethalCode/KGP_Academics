 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  Troops are going to be recalled from the streets to barracks after president Iajuddin Ahmed signed a government order on Monday. A high official at the Bangabhaban, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the media, confirmed the development to bdnews24.com. The pullback order comes after the interim government eased restrictions on political gatherings and the media, a day after the Election Commission announced plans for general election on Dec. 18 and Upazila polls on Dec. 28. Earlier in the day, home adviser MA Matin told reporters at the Secretariat about the army withdrawal. Troops rolled into the streets on Jan. 19, 2007 to assist civil administration after the emergency was declared on Jan 11 that year. Asked whether troops were being withdrawn from emergency duties, the adviser replied in the affirmative and said, "It will be done soon." On whether the state of emergency was being withdrawn, he said, "A gazette is coming. You will see." Earlier in the day, he told journalists: "Law and order situation will not deterioate even after relaxation of the state of emergency. I'm sure about it." The adviser was asked now that the election schedule had been announced whether the government would relax the state of emergency, Matin said, "Work is going on it... I can say this far, you will now in time." bdnew
