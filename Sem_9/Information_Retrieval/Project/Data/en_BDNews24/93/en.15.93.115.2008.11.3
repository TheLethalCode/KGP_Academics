 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League's policymaking presidium has unanimously welcomed the announcement of schedule for general election but wants the Upazila election, scheduled for Dec. 28, pushed back. An emergency meeting of the presidium on Monday also decided that nomination forms would be sold from 10am to 5pm from Nov. 5 to 7 at the party's headquarters to choose aspirants candidates for 300 seats. Party chief Sheikh Hasina also wants the Upazila polls deferred, an aide said on Sunday. She welcomed the schedule for the general election in an instant reaction after chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda announced it in a televised address on Sunday. Each potential nominee would have to deposit Tk 7,500 for collecting and submitting the form, AL acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said after the meeting. The meeting started at acting president Zillur Rahman's Gulshan home at 10am with Zillur in the chair and ran through to 10:45am. Presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Motia Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Ashraful were present. The party's highest decision-making body, the Central Working Committee, will meet at 10am on Tuesday, Ashraful said. The meeting, to be held at the Awami League president's political office, would discuss preparations to welcome Sheikh Hasina on her return home and election issues. Later, an extended meeting will be held at the same venue, attended by Dhaka City AL, all associate organisations and leaders from Dhaka and adjoining districts. Ashraful said, "The state of emergency must be withdrawn before the election. The election will be tainted it is held amid a state of emergency." Demanding deferral of the Upazila election to a "logical" time he said, "If the process of both the elections continues simultaneously there is a possibility that both elections will be hindered and foiled." On whether they think arch political rival BNP will go to the election. "I don't see any sign of BNP not going to the polls. They will make the right decision and go to election." Ashraful hoped that Hasina would return home on Nov. 6. "The date of her return has not yet been finalised. [It] will be finalised after [she] arrives in London." bdnew
