<TITLE> Israeli security chief warns of armed Jewish right </TITLE>

 JERUSALEM, Sun Nov 2,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel's radical right-wing could resort to armed attacks to scupper any accord under which the occupied West Bank would be ceded to the Palestinians, the official in charge of Israeli leaders' security said on Sunday. "We discern a willingness among the far-right to resort to using guns in order to prevent progress in the diplomatic process," Yuval Diskin, head of the Shin Bet domestic intelligence agency, told Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's cabinet. A Shin Bet source who provided to Reuters quotes of Diskin's briefing said he stopped short of predicting settlers or their supporters would try to kill Israeli politicians. November 4 is the anniversary of the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew who said he carried out the killing to halt land-for-peace efforts with the Palestinians. In the occupied West Bank, settler violence against Palestinians and Israeli security forces has been on the increase. Olmert reiterated at the cabinet session that such attacks were "intolerable." Settler leaders have condemned the violence but have made no secret of their community's opposition to the evacuation of settlements -- which have been deemed illegal by the World Court -- to make way for a future Palestinian state. Olmert has said Israel would have to withdraw from almost all of the territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. But he is now serving in a caretaker capacity after resigning in September in a corruption scandal and the peace deal that Israel and the Palestinians had hoped to achieve this year appears out of reach in the coming months. Olmert remains prime minister until a new government is in place after an Israeli parliamentary election on February 10
