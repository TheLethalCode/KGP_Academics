<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com)Prison authorities have accused detained former Barisal mayor and BNP leader Mojibur Rahman Sarwar of faking illness in jail to get admitted to hospital. Inspector general of prisons Brig Gen Zakir Hasan told bdnews24.com Friday that the seizure of a letter from the former mayor's pocket scuttled his plans. The IG quoted the letter as saying: "Jail authorities will want to send you to Dhaka Medical College or Suhrawardi. You should no way go to those places. You should only come to 'PG'." "You will have to call the jail doctor five to six times a day, complaining of chest pain and breathing problems. You must ask for help from others when going to toilet. Slip once or twice," the letter said. According to the IG, the letter stated specifically: "Your ACC case is under 'stay and bail' with the chamber judge. It will be fixed with the full bench on 2/11/2008." Hasan said: "Sarwar's wife and sister visited him on Thursday evening. Their conversation seemed quite fishy. So, all of them were searched after the visit. And that was when we found the letter in Sarwar's pocket and also a cell phone from his wife." There was no name at the start or the end of the letter, the IG said, adding that he suspects "it may have been penned by a lawyer". Hasan also said, according to the jail code, a visitor must deposit his/her cell-phone at the jail gate. Sarwar's wife entered with her mobile, but she was given it back after its seizure, he said. Sarwar was arrested on May 28 last year on graft charges. bdnews24.c
