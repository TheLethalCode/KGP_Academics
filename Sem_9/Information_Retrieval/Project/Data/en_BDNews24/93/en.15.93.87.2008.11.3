 MOSCOW, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unfashionable Rubin Kazan beat Saturn Ramenskoye 2-1 on Sunday to seal their first Russian league title with three games remaining. Former Serbia striker Savo Milosevic, who joined Rubin this season, scored the 89th-minute winner from close range to give his team 60 points from 27 matches and an unassailable 10-point lead over second-placed CSKA Moscow. Kazan's title is especially sweet as the club from the Volga region celebrates its 50th anniversary this year. "Allah has listened to our prayers and given us the strength to fight for the title," Rubin's Turkmenistan-born coach Kurban Berdyev told Russian television. "We didn't want to wait another week, that's why we played to win," said former Ukraine international Serhiy Rebrov, who also joined Rubin this year. CSKA's slim title hopes disappeared on Saturday when the army club suffered a 1-0 defeat by city rivals Spartak in an ill-tempered Moscow derby in which CSKA winger Yuri Zhirkov was sent off for unsportsmanlike conduct late in the match. Police detained more than 200 fans and 40 others suffered various injuries, celebrating Spartak's first victory over their bitter rivals in over seven years
