 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  An international business conference in Dhaka has called for broader role of developing nations in trade negotiations and policymaking in a more inclusive, participatory and balanced globalisation in the wake of global financial storm. The three-day conference launched on Friday and titled 'Next Fifteen Years  A Vision of Growth' is organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (DCCI) to celebrate its 50th founding anniversary. The conference was moderated by Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, permanent representative of Bangladesh in UN mission and WTO in Geneva . UNCTAD secretary general Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi spoke at the conference as the keynote speaker. He said the world was now seeing how financial irresponsibility of one country can destroy economic prospects of another. Citing rising oil prices in 2005 and recent hike in food prices as the crises that exposed the weakness of international systems, Panitchpakdi added, "It was the crash of US subprime mortgage market and the ensuing global financial crises that finally brought worldwide expansion to a halt." In the wake of the crisis, he suggested, efforts should focus on the pre-empting effect on the real economy through fiscal expansion and international capital adequacy framework. Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the world needed a new kind of globalisation. "In this time of crisis, I believe globalisation will not come to a halt but the process will change. It would probably seek to be more inclusive." Refreeing to the last couple of days' uptrend in the US and European markets, Mirza Azizul hoped that the crisis would not further deepen. Sri Lankan export development and international trade minister GL Peiris told the conference that South Asia's greatest advantage is its unique high-calibre human resources. He stressed on the need for government interventions in certain sectors to enhance the role of the state in ensuring social security. Harshbardhan Singh, deputy director general of WTO, emphasised more participation of developing nations in the process of trade negotiations. Dr. Bhattacharya while summing up the session said there was an urgent need for a more participatory and balanced globalisation, and revisiting public policy framework. Earlier, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed inaugurated the session. bd
