 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) A probe committee has been formed after a bus and train collided at Malibagh rail crossing in the city on Saturday. No casualties were reported in the collision, but traffic movement was halted for over two hours from 7pm. Communications secretary Iqbal Mahmood told bdnews24.com: "The probe committee has been formed with the divisional engineer of railways as its head. It will submit a report within 24 hours." Officer-in-charge of Kamalapur Railway police Mahbubur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "The passenger train, Drutajan Express, that left Dinajpur in the morning for Kamalapur rail station, collided with a Dibanishi Paribahan No 27 bus on the Kuril-Dhanmondi route." "The accident occurred as the bus stalled and failed to restart while crossing Malibagh rail crossing." Ramna police sub-inspector Tariqul Islam said: "As the bus became stuck on the rail line at around 7pm Sabujbagh's assistant commissioner Maruf Hossain with the help of local people got the passengers off the bus." "They also tried to get the bus off the rail track. As the train was fast approaching they tried to stop it waving a piece of red cloth, but the attempt failed." The front part of the bus was twisted as it hit the train, which then came to a stop, said the SI. Tariqul added that panic spread among the disembarked passengers and bystanders as the train struck the bus as there were gas cylinders on board. The cylinders were removed from the bus before it was cut and removed from the rail line. Police said the vehicles resumed movement on the routes at around 9.30pm. bdnews24.com/lhm/
