 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon has termed the upcoming general election an opportunity for political parties in Bangladesh to bury "the politics of confrontation and violence". The visiting secretary-general said the country's immediate challenge was to return to a better democracy, and for the leadership of the two main political parties to engage in "constructive dialogue". In his banquet speech at the Sheraton Hotel Saturday, the UN chief did not touch on the issue of polls under a state of emergency, but said the responsibility of the next elected government would be to strengthen democracy and reforms. "The nation's most pressing need is to ensure a peaceful transition back to democracy, and for the incoming elected government to consolidate democracy and reform," he said at the banquet hosted by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. "This is an opportunity for the country, and in particular the political parties, to address the serious problems that have given rise to the politics of confrontation and violence," he said. "You now face the challenge of ensuring a smooth return to a better democracya democracy that is sustainable and responsive to the needs of the people." Fakhruddin, in his address, said his government was confident of free and fair polls in December. The head of the interim government said a "revamped" Election Commission to ensure its independence and neutrality, a fresh electoral roll of over 80 million eligible voters with photographs, and amendments to electoral rules, regulations and code of conduct would help ensure that the Dec. 18 election is "free, fair and acceptable to all". The UN secretary-general thanked Bangladesh for contributing to peace-keeping around the world when many countries had cut back on troops for UN peace missions. "At a time when many nations are reluctant to contribute troops to UN peacekeeping operations, Bangladesh steps forward again and again", he said. The secretary-general said Bangladesh faced many challenges such as climate change, food security, rising commodity, all in the backdrop of a global economic crisis. He said Bangladesh was on the frontline of climate change and sea levels rise could inundate fertile land displacing large number of people and risking food security. "Already, global warming has intensified the recurrent natural disasters to which the country is prone." "I salute the outstanding response of the government and people of Bangladesh to the two devastating floods of 2007, and to super cyclone Sidr," he said. "The speed and effectiveness of the response was an example to the world." He said he was impressed by the government's efforts to stimulate food production, and by other steps to cushion the blow on those least equipped to absorb the shock. He observed that Bangladesh as the LDC chair could contribute largely to UN reforms. "As current chair of the group of Least Developed Countries, you can play an important role in our efforts to achieve UN reform". The chief adviser, addressing his remarks to the UN chief, said: "As the head of the world organisation, your visit re-validates the unity of purpose that Bangladesh shares with the United Nations." "I am sure you will witness a Bangladesh that has made long strides and remains resolute, as ever, to build a society that respects freedom, equity and justice." The chief adviser said Bangladesh was one of the key architects of the "Culture of Peace" resolution at the General Assembly that seeks to promote understanding and engender hope for a peaceful world. "Our people are coping with climate change with unparalleled determination and ingenuity." He said: "Our troops in blue berets under the UN flag have served in most difficult missions to give peace a chance. As one of the largest troop contributing countries, we have consistently remained by the side of the UN." "With micro-finance, we have shown the world that the poor are credit-worthy and given a chance, and without much help, they can climb out of poverty," said Fakhruddin. "The nearly two years the caretaker government has been in office, we have attempted a series of reforms, and succeeded in many of them, in order to make democracy strong and sustainable through Bangladesh's future," the caretaker chief said of his term in office. "Most have involved institution-building and drives against corruption and mal-governance." "My government completely revamped the Election Commission to ensure its independence and neutrality." "The Bangladesh Election Commission, with assistance from UNDP and our development partners, and helped by our own Armed Forces who drew from their global experience, prepared a fresh electoral roll of over 80 million eligible voters with photographs." "The new voters list, we are confident, will help eliminate vote theft and other forms of electoral frauds. The voters list and amendments in the electoral rules, regulations and code of conduct will help ensure that the election on December 18 is free, fair and acceptable to all," said the CA "We have also dedicated our efforts to protect and promote human rights. Towards this end, we have established a National Human Rights Commission. The Commission will become operational at anytime now." "Our Rights to Information Ordinance will go a long-way in promoting fundamental rights and in making the government more transparent and accountable. "We are confident that Bangladesh will set a new standard of democracy and good governance in the developing world," Fakhruddin said. The UN secretary-general is scheduled to meet Iajuddin, Fakhruddin, and the AL and BNP leaders in the afternoon. Ban, a Korean national, will also attend a dinner at the residence of Korean ambassador in Dhaka during his stay. He will leave Bangladesh on Sunday night, for the UN headquarters in New York, after holding a press conference at the Sonargaon Hotel at 6pm. Previous UN heads that have visited the country were Kurt Waldheim, Javier Perez de Cuellar and Kofi Annan. bdnews
