 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Two BRAC officials, Md Shahjahan Ali and Akhter Ali, abducted in Afghanistan some ten days ago, have been released, the NGO said Sunday. "The abductors set them free in Ghazni province on Saturday night and they reached our Kabul office on Sunday morning," BRAC public relations director Anwarul Haque told bdnews24.com. Shahjahan and Akhter, area managers for BRAC Afghanistan, were kidnapped on Oct 23 from the Afghan province of Ghazni, where they both had been working for the past three years. "BRAC Bangladesh is making contact with them and they will be brought back home as early as possible," Haque said. One of the world's largest NGOs is moving to withdraw all of its 150 Bangladeshi staff from Afghanistan over the next five years, BRAC officials said after the recent abduction, which was the third such incident involving BRAC staff in Afghanistan in just over a year. Abdul Alim, a BRAC official, was killed on Sept 12 last year by unidentified gunmen. Just three days later, another BRAC executive, Nurul Islam, was abducted, being released after 83 days. "There were 392 Bangladeshi BRAC staff when the [abduction of Nur Islam] took place. We then reduced the number of Bangladeshi staff to 150," Aminul Alam, BRAC's executive director (overseas programmes), told bdnews24.com. bdnews
