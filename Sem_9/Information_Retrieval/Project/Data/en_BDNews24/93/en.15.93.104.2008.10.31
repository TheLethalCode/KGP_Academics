 Chandpur, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Adviser to BNP chairperson ASM Hannan Shah on Friday called on party supporters to stay alert against "a conspiracy being plotted centring the upcoming general elections." "The government will have to hold the elections on schedule, as the people of the country have been looking forward to it," Hannan said at a rally at Matlab Uttor Upazila of the district. He said many party leaders went into hiding when the party chairperson and her sons were arrested, leaving the party into crisis. They did not even bother to look into the affairs of the party members at grassroot levels. "Now it is time to evaluate their contribution to the party before nomination for the next elections." Nomination will be awarded to the leaders who braved the crisis, he added. Hannan also distributed 75 rickshaws, 20 vans, 200 sewing machines, and 20 wheel chairs among the poor on behalf of 'Ma Amena Foundation', an aid organisation founded by Dr Jalal Uddin Ahmed, honorary consular general of Spain in Bangladesh. Chairman of the foundation Dr Jalal Uddin, its chief adviser Ali Azam Khan, Upazila BNP joint convener Shahjahan Sarder also spoke. bdnews24
