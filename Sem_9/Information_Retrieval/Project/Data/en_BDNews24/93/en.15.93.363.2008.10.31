 TOKYO, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan will fire air force chief General Toshio Tamogami for saying that Tokyo was ensnared into World War Two by the United States and was not an aggressor, the country's defense minister said on Friday. Yasukazu Hamada said the general's views, expressed in an essay, ran counter to the government's position on Japan's role in World War Two, for which it had apologized to people in countries that came under Japanese colonial rule. "Therefore it is inappropriate for him to remain in this position and I will swiftly dismiss him," he told a hastily called news conference.
