<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League acting Zillur Rahman has said the party would not stay away from the general election scheduled for Dec. 18 and Upazila polls for Dec. 28. He said their request for deferral of the Upazila voting by a month was not entertained. "The electioneering for two polls will create complexity." "Though it would be hard we will not boycott any election." "We are very happy at the announcement of the schedule. With the announcement of the schedule the doubt over the election has been removed." Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda at televised address announced the dates, hours after the High Court dismissed petitions for a halt on the Election Commission's gazette on redrawing of electoral constituencies on Sunday. He repeated the call for withdrawal of the state of emergency. "Democracy cannot be established in a controlled situation." Zillur said a final decision on nomination and electoral alliance would be taken after party chief Sheikh Hasina returned home. Hasina, now in the United States on parole for treatment, also welcomed the announcement of the electoral schedule. bdnew
