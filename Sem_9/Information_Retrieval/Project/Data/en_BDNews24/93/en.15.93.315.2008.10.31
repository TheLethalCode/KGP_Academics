 SHAH ALAM, Malaysia, Fri Oct 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Friday freed a former top aide to Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak who had been charged with abetting two policemen in the murder of a Mongolian model. A judge ruled that Najib's former political aide, Abdul Razak Abdullah Baginda, did not have to enter a defence but said that two men from an elite police unit who have been charged with the murder will have to. "There is no prima facie case against Razak," said Judge Zaki Yasin. Altantuya Shaariibuu was shot in the head twice and her body blown up with explosives in a jungle outside the Malaysian capital in October 2006. The issue has dogged Najib, who is set to become prime minister in March. Najib has denied as "total lies" reports in online media that either he or his wife Rosmah Mansor were involved in the killing of 28-year old Altantuya Shaariibuu. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who was in a separate court facing charges of sodomy, accused the authorities of a cover-up in the Altantuya case. "The issue here revolves around the court procedure and the investigations and the growing perception the investigation is not done properly," he told reporters. "The prosecution here has of course failed to conduct the case professionally and we have seen from the beginning involving members of the prosecution, the changes made -- the court and the judge," he said. The court case has been going on for almost six months and earlier, a Malaysian detective who made and then retracted allegations linking Najib to the brutal murder, went missing. Razak refused to speak to reporters after his acquittal. "I just want to go home; get out of my way," he said on the way to his car after he was greeted with hugs and tears from waiting relatives. Altantuya's father, who has launched a 100 million ringgit ($28.33 million) civil suit against the Malaysian government, said the handling of the case had damaged Malaysia's international standing. "I am not satisfied. My daughter knows only one Malaysian and it is Razak Banginda. Now my daughter is dead and (Razak) Baginda is freed," Shaariibuu Setev told reporters after the ruling
