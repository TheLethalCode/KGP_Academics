<TITLE> Only Australia looking to win, says centurion Clarke </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Only Australia were keen to push for an unlikely win in the third test against India, vice-captain Michael Clarke said on Saturday after rallying the visitors with a chancy century. Clarke struck 112, his eighth test hundred, after he was dropped three times to rally Australia to 577 all out in reply to India's first innings 613-7 declared. The Australian bowlers then had India down to 43 for two, including the wicket of tail-ender Ishant Sharma, who was sent in as nightwatchman. India are 79 runs ahead with eight wickets left with draw looking the likely result on a slow pitch still good for batting. Clarke dubbed India as defensive for sending Sharma to bat. "We've seen this evening India sending a nightwatchman, they are pretty defensive," he told reporters. "I know Australia will certainly be the one team out there tomorrow trying to win. "We'll try and take a couple of wickets early, we'll be attacking," he said. "India won't set us any target tomorrow." The 27-year-old, who hit a match-winning 151 on test debut in 2004, was delighted to reach three figures after being dropped on 21, 90 and 94. "It is personally very rewarding to make another century in India," he told reporters. "I was certainly very lucky today I guess, especially during the 90s." Clarke joined four other senior batsmen who hit fifties to rally the team after their 320-run loss in the second test in Mohali. That defeat left them 1-0 behind in the four-match series. "After the second test we had a really good chat about the senior players standing up in this test match," he said. "I think we've done that so far." "Matthew Hayden (83) batted superbly, (skipper) Ricky Ponting (87) again, and good for me to finally chip in." India coach Gary Kirsten praised skipper Anil Kumble for his three-wicket haul despite a deep cut on his left little finger suffered while fielding on Friday that needed many stitches. "It was fantastic," he said of Kumble, 38, the third most prolific test wickettaker with a tally of 619 so far. "He is a chap who wants to do everything he can. He took wickets today and has got into the test match. He is an incredible asset to the team." Kumble braved a broken jaw on the 2002 West Indies tour, suffered after being hit by a Merv Dillon bouncer in the Antigua test, by coming on to bowl with a heavily bandaged face and dismissing Brian Lara before flying home for surgery
