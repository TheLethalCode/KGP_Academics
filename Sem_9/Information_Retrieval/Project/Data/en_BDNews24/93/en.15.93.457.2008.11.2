 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh may import a limited amount of electricity from India, after receiving a formal proposal from the neighbouring country, said a special aide on Sunday. "We have received verbal proposal from India. We will consider the matter after we get formal proposal." the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of power, energy and mineral resources M Tamim told bdnews24.com Sunday. Visiting Indian state minister for trade and power Jairam Ramesh at a bilateral meeting in Dhaka Saturday proposed Bangladesh could import 1,000 megawatts of power from India. Tamim said: "There is power deficiency in our country. In this regard India can be a good source for importing power. However, at the initial stage a limited amount will be imported." Power division officials told bdnews24.com there was no problem in principle in importing power from India. However, a decision regarding how much power would be imported could only be taken after considering everything: price of power, interconnectivity and transmission. In the first phase 150MW to 200MW power may be imported, they said. It would also have to be kept in mind how much Indian power could be commercially viable for Bangladesh. The visiting Indian minister said Saturday that India has taken an initiative to set up a 750MW power plant in it eastern state of Tripura, that borders Bangladesh. To meet its deficiency Bangladesh can import power from there, if it wants to. Besides, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka are planning to generate 30,000MW between them over the next 10 years. Prof Tamim along with Indian state minister for trade and power visited Siddhirganj power plant Saturday. Two under-construction 120MW units of Indian company BHEL at Siddhirganj will not go into operation on schedule. The two units were scheduled to generate power from November, one unit is likely to go into production by January next year. A gas turbine has reached Siddhirganj. Another gas turbine is yet to arrive there. Power Division secretary M Fauzul Kabir Khan told bdnews24.com that the construction firm has been urged to complete the work soon. According to the power division, in the next six months 1000 MW will be new;y generated, while 372MW has been added to the national grid so far this year. bdnews
