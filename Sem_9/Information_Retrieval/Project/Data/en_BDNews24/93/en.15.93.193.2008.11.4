<TITLE> Injured Kiwi Oram to miss tests in Australia </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - New Zealand all-rounder Jacob Oram is out of this month's two-test series in Australia after failing to recover from a lower back problem. "An MRI scan cleared Jacob of serious injury but he has not yet been able to resume full gym work," New Zealand Cricket said in a statement. "It is planned to have him start bowling again in about 10 days. He is expected to be fully fit for the West Indies tour of New Zealand starting in the middle of next month." Oram returned home early from the tour of Bangladesh last month after sustaining the injury during the first test which New Zealand won by three wickets. Pace bowler Michael Mason is also unlikely to be fit for the Australian series. He undergoes a hernia operation on Friday and will be unavailable for at least three weeks. The first test between New Zealand and Australia in Brisbane starts on Nov. 20, with the second in Adelaide from Nov. 28-Dec. 2
