 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  The list of war criminals will be made pubic soon, the chairman of Sector Commanders Forum said on Sunday. "The list of war criminals will be published soon and their trial will be held in this country one day," AK Khandaker said at a press conference while unveiling a book titled 'Bangladesh Genocide 1971-the Trial of War Criminals'. "We will continue our movement until their trial starts," he said at the Liberation War Museum auditorium. The book contains write-ups about war crime and crimes against humanity by different authors at different times, compiled by Harun Habib and ASM Shamsul Arefin. 1971 war sector commander and former army chief Harun-ur-Rashid said Jamaat-e-Islami could not get registered as a political party according to amended the Representation of People Order Ordinance and constitution. "We have asked the Election Commission about the matter. If the commission allows them to register, the people will look into it," he said. bdne
