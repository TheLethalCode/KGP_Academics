 HANOI, Mon Nov 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Vietnamese authorities warned on Monday of disease outbreaks, including cholera and dengue fever, after heavy rain triggered floods that have killed at least 65 people in northern and central Vietnam. At least 18 people were killed in Hanoi in what is believed to be the heaviest flooding in the capital since 1984, state media said. The Health Ministry alerted all clinics in flood-hit areas to be staffed around the clock to prepare for any outbreaks, state media reported on Monday. Much of Hanoi got a respite from heavy showers on Monday but the government warned that more downpours, flash floods and landslides could be in store in mountainous provinces in the country's north-central region this week. "Large-scale flash floods on the rivers, streams and landslides are expected in the mountainous areas from Thanh Hoa to Nghe An," the national weather forecast centre said in a flood report, referring to two provinces. Many streets in the downtown area of Hanoi and the city's outskirts remained submerged and the city ordered schools closed on Monday. Up to 500 mm (19.7 inches) of rain has fallen on Hanoi since Friday, halting traffic. Landslides have eroded many sections of the north-south Ho Chi Minh highway in Thua Thien-Hue province. The Vietnamese government has ordered the army to mend damaged river dykes in northern provinces and to help evacuate people from areas vulnerable to landslides and flash floods. State media said the lives of thousands were threatened after a dyke broke in Ninh Binh province. It gave no further details. Vietnam's main agricultural area, including the Central Highlands coffee belt and the Mekong Delta rice basket, have not been affected by the floods, although rain disrupted coffee harvesting last week. In southwestern China, the death toll from mudslides caused by heavy rain rose to at least 22 from 15, with 45 missing, Chinese state media reported. Torrents of mud and rocks hit near the city of Chuxiong in Yunnan province at the weekend, toppling or damaging nearly 1,000 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. Yunnan is dominated by steep terrain and many of its farmers live in villages on steep slopes. There is also mining in some areas. Mountain torrents triggered by heavy rain hit Pingguo county in Guangxi to the east of Yunnan, killing eight
