<TITLE> Hasina to return Nov 10: aide </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh on Nov 10, ahead of the December general elections and after nearly five months abroad, her press secretary said on Saturday. "Sheikh Hasina is scheduled to fly back home on an Emirates flight on Nov 10," Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. Hasina, facing five separate graft cases, flew to the US on June 12 to seek medical treatment, a day after the government allowed her temporary release from special jail on 'parole'. The parole, extended on several occasions, comes to an end on Nov 6. AL leaders were concerned on Thursday as the Supreme Court denied Hasina bail in one of the cases against her. But lawyers say if the government extends her parole she will not have to return to special jail on her arrival back in the country. Her rival, BNP chief and former PM, Khaleda Zia was released from special jail in September after securing bail in all the graft cases against her. Hasina, meanwhile, has secured bail in two cases, the High Court has ordered 'no arrest or harassment' in a further two graft cases, and she was denied bail on Thursday in a fifth case. Sheikh Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year. The 9th Jatiya Sangsad elections are scheduled for Dec 18. bdnews
