 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina arrived in the UK Tuesday morning local time, flying in from the US en route to Bangladesh, party leaders said. She was earlier seen off at Washington DC's Dulles Airport by her son Sajib Wazed Joy, among others. "She arrived at London's Heathrow around 10.45am, and was welcomed by local AL leaders," Hasina's special assistant Dr Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com. The former prime minister brought her return date forward by four days, to Nov 6 instead of Nov 10, following the Election Commission's announcement of parliamentary polls schedule earlier in the week. She is scheduled to return home at 8.30am on the 6th, with Awami League planning a massive gathering of supporters, to line the route from Zia International Airport to her Sudha Sadan residence, to welcome the AL chief home. The AL's central committee met on Tuesday with Dhaka City AL leaders, presidents of AL district units and associate organisations, among others, on plans for her homecoming. Hasina, facing five graft cases, flew to the United States on June 12 to seek medical treatment, a day after the government allowed her temporary release from special jail on parole. During her stay in the US, Hasina twice met US assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Richard Boucher. Hasina was arrested on July 16 last year. Her parole, extended on several occasions, comes to an end on Nov 6, the day of her return. She was granted bail in all cases against her, except an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. She was denied bail in the case by the Supreme Court on Oct 30, prompting concern among AL leaders. Her counsel calling it an "unexpected ruling". But lawyers say if the government extends her parole she will not have to return to special jail on her arrival back in Bangladesh. Her rival, BNP chief and former prime minister Khaleda Zia was released from special jail in September after securing bail in all the graft cases against her. bdnews24.c
