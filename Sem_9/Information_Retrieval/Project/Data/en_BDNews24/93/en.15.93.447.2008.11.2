 TORONTO, Sun Nov 2, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US vice presidential hopeful Sarah Palin fell prey to a Canadian prankster on Saturday when he called her impersonating French President Nicolas Sarkozy and got her to accept an invitation to hunt baby seals. In an over-the-top French accent, a member of the Quebec comedy duo "The Masked Avengers," famous for tricking celebrities and politicians including Sarkozy himself, asked if Palin would take him on a hunting trip by helicopter, and then in French said they could also go kill baby seals. An apparently oblivious Palin said she thought that would be fun. "We could have a lot of fun together as we're getting work done. We could kill two birds with one stone that way." The prankster also got Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election, to reveal a potential ambition for the top job in Washington. Asked if she would like to eventually become president, the Alaska governor responded, "Well, maybe in eight years." Palin's office quickly admitted they were hoodwinked. "Governor Palin was mildly amused to learn that she had joined the ranks of heads of state, including President Sarkozy, and other celebrities in being targeted by these pranksters. C'est la vie," Palin spokeswoman Tracy Schmitt said in an e-mail. Robert Gibbs, a senior advisor to Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama, told reporters in Springfield, Missouri: "I'm glad we check out our calls before we hand the phone to Barack Obama." During the phone call, which was played for a Montreal radio program, Palin complimented the fake Sarkozy on his beautiful wife, Carla Bruni, and asked him to give her a "big hug" for her. "You added a lot of energy to your country with that beautiful family of yours," Palin said. The prankster responded by complimenting Palin on a notorious Hustler porn film "Nailin' Paylin," which he said was a documentary of her life. "Oh good, thank you," Palin said. Palin also reassured the fake Sarkozy when he said he would not want to bring Vice President Dick Cheney on a hunting trip. Cheney once accidentally shot a hunting partner. "I'll be a careful shot," she promised
