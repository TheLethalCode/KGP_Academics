 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Cultural activists and artistes on Friday demanded an environment that enables art and culture and protested the removal of the Baul (mystic singers) sculptures from the airport area. They took out a procession under the banner of Swachetan Shilpi Shomaj (SSS) from the Fine Arts Faculty and held a rally. The participants sang patriotic songs. The SSS, a platform of artistes from all disciplines of art and culture, said they were neither defending Mrinal Haque, sculptor of the Baul statues, nor opposing the so-called Idol Resistance Committee, nor condoning the government actions. All they wanted is a free environment for art and culture in the country. Cultural activists at the rally wore muskrats and carried different types of dolls that reflect the culture and history of the country. They reiterated their demand for forming a specialised committee comprising painters, sculptors, urban planners, architects, archaeologists, and historians that would recommend policies on installation of statues in the city. Prominent singers Momotaj, Anusheh, Krishnokoli, actor Shahidul Alam Shachchu and hundreds of other cultural activists, painters and fine arts students participated in the rally. Talking to journalists Momotaj said, "I could not hold concerts at some places as there were threats from the local radical forces though I had obtained prior permission from the administration. "If this trend continues, musical soirees and other cultural activities in the country would cease," she feared Anusheh said, "The country got its independence through a bloody war but still we are facing the same communal problems we faced during the Pakistan period." She suggested another 'liberation war' to fight these forces and foil their conspiracy to make Bangladesh a Taliban state. The daylong programmes included protest painting and performing art in the morning and the afternoon, and a cultural programme in the evening at the Fine Arts Faculty. Meanwhile, Kendrio Khelaghar Asar, an organisation that works for children, held another rally at Central Shaheed Minar in the evening demanding immediate reinstatement of the sculpture in front of Zia International Airport. They also demanded that the government took steps to name the square as Lalon Chottor (Lalon intersection)
