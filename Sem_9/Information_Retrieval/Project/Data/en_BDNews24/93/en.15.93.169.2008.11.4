 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  Myanmar authorities have been going ahead with oil and gas exploration activities in disputed waters in the Bay of Bengal despite Bangladesh's repeated protests. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury, however, on Tuesday reiterated Dhaka's position on resolving crisis through diplomatic means, not by conflict. He said he hoped that the high-powered delegation, scheduled to start for Myanmar early Wednesday, would be able to "try and defuse the current situation". Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com that he would meet his Myanmar counterpart and tell him to remove all structures from the disputed waters until sea boundary was demarcated. Hossain will lead a delegation which includes retired commodore M Khurshed Alam and commodore Md Habibur Rahman Bhuiyan of Bangladesh Navy. "Bangladesh has so far refrained from energy exploration in disputed waters. It is our hope Myanmar will do the same," Chowdhury told journalists at his office. "It will be our endeavour to settle the issue diplomatically, for Bangladesh is a peace-loving country. "But let it also be understood that we will do all that it takes to protect our sovereignty," the adviser asserted. "I will meet my Myanmar counterpart and other senior officials to convey that Dhaka wants immediate withdrawal of the vessels and infrastructures from the disputed waters," Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com at his office. Additional foreign secretary M A K Mahmood, who led the last Bangladesh-Myanmar maritime border delimitation talks in Dhaka, told bdnews24.com, "We hope the problem can be resolved through dialogue." Myanmar last week started offshore oil and gas exploration activities in the disputed waters of the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island. Bangladesh Navy sent ships near the disputed waters to patrol. The Myanmar ambassador in Bangladesh has been summoned twice in as many days to the foreign office and spoken to about Dhaka's sentiment. According to a verbal agreement, the two countries pledged not to carry out oil and gas exploration in the waters they both claim. But, Myanmar awarded contract to a South Korean company to explore gas and oil in the disputed waters, according to foreign ministry officials. The company, escorted by Myanmar vessels, has been setting up rigs in the area believed to be rich in gas. bd
