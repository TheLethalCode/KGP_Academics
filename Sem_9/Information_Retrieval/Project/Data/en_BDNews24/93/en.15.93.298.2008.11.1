 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a roundtable of a two-day international business conference have underscored the need for more investment between South Asian countries to create a favourable global economic shift toward the region. The region requires faster investment for steady economy growth, speakers said at the seminar on 'The global economic shift to Asia-regional synergies' on Saturday. The seminar, held at the China-Bangladesh Friendship Conference Centre, was part of the international conference of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, marking its 50th anniversary. "Investment is key to strengthening relationships between South Asian countries," said visiting Indian state minister for trade, Jai Ram Ramesh. South Asian countries should focus on investment as well as trade, "because trade is a one way street while investment is two-way," he said. On investment ties between Bangladeshi and India, he said his country had removed barriers to Bangladeshi investment in India and looked forward to more trade and investment between the neighboring countries. On a global economic shift to Asia, he said massive investment was still required for manpower development, education and ICT sectors. Visiting Sri Lankan trade minister, GL Peiris said South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, India and Sri Lanka, have huge potential in its youth. CPD chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan said South Asia needs greater integration as it becomes a major growing market. Sixty percent of foreign exchange reserves are located in the Asia, he pointed out. He hoped that within the next fifteen years, South Asia would be the major goods supplier for the world. President of Saarc's Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Tariq Sayeed said port and cargo handling of member countries need to be streamlined and simplified to enable greater inter-regional investment.
