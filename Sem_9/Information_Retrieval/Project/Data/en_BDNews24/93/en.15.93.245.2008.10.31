<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has ragged the chief election commissioner for his comment that the polls officials were ready to stage an election like that of 1970 and said the comments were "unexpected and unwanted". "It is the biggest question in the minds of the people whether by saying that he wanted to hold a 1970-like election the chief election commissioner actually slipped out a secret plan of making a certain party victorious," Delwar said in a statement on Friday. ATM Shamsul Huda in his concluding speech at a training course for the deputy commissioners on Thursday said the Election Commission wanted to hold an election like that of 1970. "The chief election commissioner and his colleagues in the Election Commission through their uttering were unmasking their real face and gradually losing people's trust. "If the chief election commissioner and his colleagues continue to express their bias the people's doubt about next election will grow." He also said Huda's statement that no fair election was ever held in the past was a lie. "The chief election commissioner made this sweeping comment to make the free and fair elections held in the past controversial. "His statement created a smokescreen among the people. If (he says) past elections were not fair he has to publish the real information. Otherwise, his statement will create confusion among the people." bdne
