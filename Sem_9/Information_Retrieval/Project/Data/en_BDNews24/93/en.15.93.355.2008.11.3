 CAIRO, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two early goals handed Egypt's Al Ahli a handy 2-0 win over Coton Sport of Cameroon in the first leg of the African Champions League final on Sunday. It took veteran defender Wael Gomaa just three minutes to open the scoring and striker Flavio added a second on the quarter-hour mark to ensure Al Ahli are well set for the return leg in Garoua, Cameroon on Nov. 16. But the Egyptians, seeking a record sixth Champions League triumph, missed out on the chance to effectively kill off the tie, squandering chances in a high tempo match played in front of a crowd of around 50,000 at the Cairo International Stadium. Gomaa swooped in with a diving header from Mohamed Aboutrika's free kick to open the score as Al Ahli started the game at a furious pace. Flavio scored the second also from a free kick, this time a chip up the middle from Ahmed Hassan finding the Angolan international unmarked and with time to twist in mid-air and force a glancing header wide of goalkeeper Kassali Daouda. Flavio, who should have had a hat-trick, came close with a header at the back post just before halftime and shot over the bar near the end. Coton Sport, in their first Champions League final, were restricted to tame long-range efforts but are expected to be a much tougher proposition when they host the return leg
