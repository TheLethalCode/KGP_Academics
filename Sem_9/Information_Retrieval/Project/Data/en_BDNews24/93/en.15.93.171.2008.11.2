 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said Sunday Bangladesh's military leadership had assured him that there would be no intervention in holding the Dec 18 parliamentary polls in free and fair way. "They will not interfere or intervene in any political processthis is what I was assured from the military leadership," the secretary general said. He said he was also encouraged by assurances from the government. "I was assured by the caretaker government that they will put their best effort to ensure fair and credible and free election. They will try to ensure the atmosphere and security and everything so that there can be free and credible elections", said Ban. The secretary-general said the UN would send a polls observation mission. He also said the UN could not assist in the trial of war criminals unless the government made an official request in this regard. Talking to reporters at the wrap up press conference of his two-day visit, at the Sonargaon Hotel, Ban said the caretaker government and political parties should hold talks over the withdrawal of the state of emergency. "I am aware of the concerns and demands by the major stakeholders demanding the lifting of the state of emergency before this election is held," he said. "I have discussed this issue with the chief of the caretaker authorities, also with the political party leaders. And I have asked them to resolve the issue through dialogue between the government authorities and the political party leaders. "This is an election of Bangladeshi people. I hope this will be solved through the authorities and the political parties." Ban Ki-moon met the leaders of the BNP and the Awami League at his hotel suit in the afternoon. He had a breakfast meeting with army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed earlier Sunday. Gen Moeen told reporters after the meeting: "With the cooperation of all, we will be able to hold the Dec 18 polls in a free, fair and credible way.". Ban said: "There was a brief discussion on forthcoming election and again I was assured by the military leadership that they will ensure that this forthcoming election will be fair, free and credible," he said. The UN chief said his meeting with Gen Moeen was mainly on strengthening Bangladesh-UN partnership in the field of peacekeeping operation. He lauded the country's role for their contribution to peace around the world, and said Bangladesh could do more by sending more troops.
