<TITLE> New court appeal lodged by Bali bombers </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Jakarta, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lawyers for relatives of the Bali bombers have filed a new appeal against their imminent execution, an Indonesian court official and a lawyer said on Monday. Imam Samudra, 38, Mukhlas, 48, and Amrozi, 46, members of the militant Islamist group Jemaah Islamiah, were sentenced to death for their role in attacks on two nightclubs in Kuta in 2002 that killed 202 people, including Indonesians and foreign tourists. The Attorney General's office said Saturday that the execution of the men, who have been on death row since 2003, was "very close." Authorities have previously said that all legal appeals have been exhausted. "We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions," said Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family. Indonesia's Supreme Court has previously thrown out requests for a judicial review, while the constitutional court also overruled a petition from the bombers arguing the country's method of execution by firing squad was inhumane. Separately, Bachmid said the latest appeal, which was filed on behalf of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, should be addressed by courts before the executions could go ahead. Denpasar court official Nengah Sanjaya also said by telephone that the three-page appeal had been lodged and would be sent to a court in Cilacap, central Java, close to the prison island housing the three men. Another lawyer for the family, who declined to be identified, also said that the family had been given permission to visit the Bali bombers Monday. Security has been increased across Indonesia in the last few days ahead of the expected executions, including in Bali and parts of the main island of Java, particularly around the prison. Three small bombs exploded in Indonesia's Moluccas islands early Monday morning but there were no casualties, local police said. The bombs went off in Ternate, in North Maluku, damaging the governor's office and house, police said. The area has previously seen fighting between Muslims and Christians, but it was unclear if there was any link to the Bali executions. Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith Sunday urged Australians to reconsider travel plans to Indonesia because of concerns about reprisals from supporters of the bombers. The 2002 bombings killed 88 Australians. However, security analysts such as Sidney Jones of International Crisis Group, have said it was unlikely that the executions would spark another bomb attack as Jemaah Islamiah has been severely weakened.
