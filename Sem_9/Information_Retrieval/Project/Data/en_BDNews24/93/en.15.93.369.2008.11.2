 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina wants the Upazila polls, now due on Dec. 28, pushed back, an aide said. She welcomed the schedule for the general election in an instant reaction after chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda announced it in a televised address on Sunday. "The Awami League president welcomed the announcement of the schedule and said the people's long wait has ended. She said the doubt in the public mind about the polls has been removed by the announcement of the election schedule," her information secretary Abul Kalam Azad told bdnews24.com. The former prime minister said the Upazila polls date on Dec. 28 has not been right and should be deferred. It would be difficult to implement the process of two elections simultaneously. There is much doubt whether the EC would be able to implement this process properly, she observed. Now in the United States for treatment on parole, Hasina said the provision for "no" vote was not right. Keeping the provision for "no" vote would make many votes invalid and give rise to complexity, Azad further quoted her as saying. Hasina said her party's election preparations were at the final stages and the nomination forms were ready. Awami League has welcomed the announcement of schedules for national elections. However the party thinks there will be confusion over the Upazila polls. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "We welcome announcement of the schedule for national election. With this announcement he has taken another step towards the election. I urge the people to participate in the election process spontaneously." "However, we think some confusion will be there over the Upazila election set for December 28. If the process of both the elections continue simultaneously both the national and Upazila elections will be hampered." He said a an elaborate response would come from the presidium and central working committee meetings. bdnew
