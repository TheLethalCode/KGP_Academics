<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Public university teachers on Friday staged a human-chain protest at the foot of Dhaka University's Aprajeyo Bangla demanding a stop to leasing of oil and gas resources, and suspension of the final approval of the national coal policy. The teachers in brief speeches urged the unelected government not to make such crucial policy decision. "We want a free and fair election from this government. This is the job of an unelected government. But they have no constitutional jurisdiction to make policy-making decisions," former president of Dhaka University Teachers Association (DUTA) Prof AAMS Arefin Siddique said. "An elected government will make a decision on how the national resources will be utilised. The constitution of the country has not given the right to any other government to do this." DU teachers MM Akash, AKM Saad Uddin, Ajoy Roy and Anwar Hossain, Rajshahi University's Moloy Bhowmik, SM Abu Bakar, Mohammad Naser, Chittagong University's Moeenul Islam and Mir Mosharraf Hossain, Jahangirnagar University's Anu Muhammad, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology's Muhammd Zafar Iqbal and Yasmin Haque, Khulna University's teacher Mahbubul Haque and Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology teacher M Shamsul Alam and about 30 other teachers participated in the protest programme. bdnews24
