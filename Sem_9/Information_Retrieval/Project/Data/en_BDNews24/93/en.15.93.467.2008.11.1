<TITLE> Tigers set sights on 'consistency' in S Africa </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) - The national cricket team left Saturday night for South Africa to play a series of three one-day internationals, two Tests and one Tewenty20 match against the hosts with the hopes of putting up a "consistent performance". It will be the Tigers' second tour in South Africa, since their first in 2002, beginning with a lone Twenty20 match at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Nov 5 before the one-day and Test series kick off. Bangladesh, largely tagged an 'inconsistent team", recently showed more consistent play against Australia in an away series and a home series against New Zealand, where they came close to winning the one-day series alongside a Test match victory in Chittagong. "In the last four one-day matches we played against Australia and New Zealand, our performance curve was upward and we created opportunities in those matches and won one out of the four," Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful told reporters at Zia International Airport Saturday. "We will try to avail the opportunities we get against South Africa," said Ashraful, who had a bad patch in the recent home series against the Black Caps. The main concern of the Tigers lies over their top-order batsmen, who failed to justify themselves in the recent series, and Ashraful hoped to overcome the problem during their month-long tour of South Africa. "We are not thinking of the Test series now," said the 24-year old batsman. "If we can do better in the ODI series and the lone Twenty20 match, then there will certainly be a knock on effect in the Test series." Most of the individual players have experienced South African conditions, though it is the first time the national team led by Mohammad Ashraful will be playing a full series with not a single player surviving from the 2002 South Africa tour. "It is the first Test series for all of us in South Africa. We had the experience of playing there individually but Tests are a different ball game," said Ashraful. Bangladesh has played 11 one-dayers against South Africa, and thrashed them only once, when the Tigers handed a 67-run defeat the Proteas in the ICC World Cup in West Indies in 2007. Besides, Bangladesh went down in all six Test matches they have previously played against South Africa. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Mushfiqur Rahim, Naeem Islam, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Mahbubul Alam, Roqibul Hasan and Imrul Kayes. bdn
