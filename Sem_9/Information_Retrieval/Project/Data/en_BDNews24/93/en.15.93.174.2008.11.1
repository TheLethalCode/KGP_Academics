 MADRID, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Atletico Madrid will take their case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to dispute UEFA's decision to reduce their stadium ban to one match played behind closed doors, the Primera Liga club said on Friday. In response to an appeal from Atletico earlier in the day, European soccer's governing body cut a two-match stadium ban to one played without spectators in the Champions League, but the Spanish club was not happy with the new ruling or the process. "Atletico will fight for their innocence until the very end. There has been a reduction (in the punishment) but we don't agree with the manner in which the process has been conducted," director Clemente Villaverde told the club's website (www.clubatleticodemadrid.com). "We will fight on to the next stage, CAS. They haven't given us the detailed legal basis for their decision yet. But there seems to be a change of emphasis with the committee now giving more importance to the racist chants." Atletico had originally been ordered to play their next two European fixtures at least 300km outside Madrid, with a home stadium ban for a third game if there was further trouble. Atletico were punished after crowd problems marred their Champions League home match with Olympique Marseille on Oct 1, when UEFA said failures in the club's organisation of the event led to confrontations between visiting fans and Spanish police. RACIST CHANTING The appeals body said Atletico would now have to play their next Group D home Champions League game, against PSV Eindhoven on Nov. 26, behind closed doors. A further match without spectators will be imposed for any further incidents that take place in the next two years. The original sanctions were handed down following crowd trouble during their 2-1 win over Marseille, including alleged racist chanting by the Madrid fans. The club has denied charges of racism. The appeals body upheld the two-match ban on Atletico coach Javier Aguirre, who was accused of insulting a Marseille player. Aguirre will be barred from coaching his team during their Champions League game at Liverpool on Nov. 4 and the closed doors home game against PSV. The original fine of 150,000 euros ($191,700) against the club will also stand. The appeals body said it had taken its decision "after careful consideration of all the evidence presented, and after hearing the parties and several witnesses". It said Atletico would have 10 days after receiving the full written explanation in which to lodge an appeal with CA
