<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has called for complete withdrawal of the state of emergency before the upcoming election, alleging that the government was "plotting selection through election amid emergency." "The election is looming large whereas the government has failed to create a congenial atmosphere," Khaleda said, while exchanging views with senior leaders of Jatiyotabadi Sramik Dal at her Gulshan office on Saturday. "People cannot go to the polls with an emergency is in force. The emergency must be lifted fully before the election." The BNP chaiorperson demanded the four-party alliance's seven-point charter of demands be met for the sake of a proper election atmosphere. Alleging that a "deep conspiracy is going on to create anarchy so that a properly elected government cannot be established", she added that "certain powers are backing the government." She also echoed her party leaders' previous complaints that the interim government over the last two years had put the country back 20 years. "A vested quarter behind the government does not want an elected government taking over. The plotters want the country to remain backward," the former PM said. Khaleda asked party leaders and workers to prepare for "movement" in the face of such a situation. The BNP chief at the same time, however, urged party members to prepare for election: "BNP is a pro-election party and we should be ready." "But people will not accept any election unless the four-party demands are met," she warned. Highlighting the need for a 'level playing field', Khaleda claimed: "Our party people are put behind bars and taken into detention after getting bail from the court. On the other hand, leaders of other political parties are allowed to participate in the polls. This is unfair and we want an election that lets all parties aboard." She asked leaders of BNP's associate body, Sramik Dal, to set aside differences and strengthen the organisation. JSD president and BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan, Sramik Dal general secretary Zafrul Hasan and joint secretary Anwar Hossain were among those that also spoke. bdnews24.
