 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)A top level delegation from Dhaka will leave for Yangon on Wednesday, to address the recent dispute over Myanmar's entry into Bangladesh waters, the foreign adviser has said. "A delegation from Myanmar will also visit here Nov 16-17," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said Monday. The foreign advsier had earlier briefed reporters after an inter-ministerial meeting on bi-lateral relations with Myanmar. The meeting touched on all aspects of mutual ties including General Maung Aye's visit in September, maritime borders and the recent developments in the Bay of Bengal, he said. In light of the recent events in the Bay of Bengal, a top-level delegation from Dhaka will visit Myanmar and a delegation from Yangon will be arrive in Bangladesh mid-Nov, he said. When asked if the entry of Myanmar's vessels into disputed Bay waters would impact relations, he replied in the negative. "There are many facets to relations with neighbours. We will resolve the dispute through discussions," he said. Bangladesh has rushed a naval patrol to the disputed waters of the Bay of Bengal where Myanmar has begun oil and gas exploration activities, foreign ministry officials have said. "We have lodged a strong protest with the government of Myanmar for entry of its vessels into territorial waters of Bangladesh," foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Sunday. "We summoned the Myanmar ambassador in Dhaka to hand over the protest letter," he said at his foreign ministry office. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com: "There may be this sort of incident between neighbours. We want that the dispute can be resolved through dialogue as Bangladesh has very good relations with Myanmar." Foreign ministry officials say Myanmar sent vessels and exploration equipment along with engineers within the past few days to carry out the exploration works, some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island. One official, not wanting to be named, said the Bangladesh Navy had reached the spot and "seen off the Myanmar vessels" late Saturday, but the vessels had returned on Sunday morning. The area is claimed by both Bangladesh and Myanmar. But Myanmar has awarded a contract of exploration work to a South Korean company, ministry officials confirmed to bdnews24.com. Bangladesh and Myanmar have been holding on-off talks for years to demarcate their borders in the Bay of Bengal, considered rich in gas reserves. bdnews
