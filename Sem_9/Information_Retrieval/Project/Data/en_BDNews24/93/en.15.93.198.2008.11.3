<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The central bank has asked state-owned commercial banks (SOCB) to move swiftly to bar bank loan defaulters from running in the upcoming general and Upazila elections. Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com that he gave the directive to the four SOCBs in an emergency meeting with their CEOs at his office on Monday. "Banks have been directed to ready the latest update of the classified loans" so that the central bank or the Election Commission (EC) can get offhand information on demand, the governor said. "These measures are meant to stop the loan defaulters from running the elections," he said. Borrowers usually reschedule their classified loans before elections through partial repayment and on mutual understanding with the bank officials. On the performance of the SOCBs, previously known as NCBs (nationalised commercial banks), Salehuddin said "little progress" had been made in the recovery of their classified loans. The banks failed to realise loans from the "top 20 defaulters", a target the Bangladesh Bank had set them, he added. After the meeting managing director and CEO of Agrani Bank Syed Abu Naser Bakhtiar told bdnews24.com, "We will prepare classified loan update as of Oct. 30." After Sonali Bank, Janata Bank and Agrani Bank were made limited companies, and are now called SOCBs. These banks and Rupali Bank Ltd, another SOCB, signed a memorandum of understanding with the central bank in January on loan recovery and were given a target which they had missed. Monday's meeting reviewed the progress in January-June period and rated Sonali, Agrani and Rupali banks as "kind of problem banks" while Janata Bank was considered "a little better." Sonali Bank tops the list of classified loans with a whopping Tk 8,547 crore, or 44 percent of the bank's total disbursement. Agrani Bank ranks second with a total classified loan of Tk 2,965 crore or 30 pc of disbursement, followed by Janata Bank with Tk 1,965 crore amounting to 16 pc of disbursement and Rupali Bank with Tk 1,785 crore or 39 pc of the bank's total disbursement bdnew
