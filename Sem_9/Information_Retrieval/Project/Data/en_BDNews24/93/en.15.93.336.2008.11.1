 Chittagong, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com) - National Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Abul Mazid continues to be frustrated with the low return of income tax this year, despite the recently announced extension to the deadline for individual returns. "A big per centage of tax payers who hold tax identification numbers did not submit their tax returns this year," he said at a views exchange meeting with Chittagong's taxpayers at the port city's Institution of Engineers on Saturday "At least four crore people throughout the country pay 200 million dollars in cell phone bills every month." "Against such a reality, it is not normal that only 22-23 lakh people would hold TINs. And submission of tax returns by just 6.5 lakh people out of these 23 lakh TIN holders is very frustrating," the NBR chairman said. . The Chittagong income tax department organised Saturday's exchange as part of NBR's programme to identify new taxpayers in the large and medium towns and to motivate tax officials. Mazid said the programme will be held in the five other divisional towns in phases. The top taxman said the process of netting new tax payers was underway, reiterating the NBR's recent provision that those who come forward to pay tax voluntarily would not be asked any questions for the next three years. Mazid also stressed that to cut foreign aid dependence, revenue from internal resources has to be raised to Tk 90,000 crore from Tk 70,000 crore. Chittagong tax officials and business leaders were present. bdnews
