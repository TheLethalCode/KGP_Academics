 Dhaka, Nov 01 (bdnews24.com)UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon hopes "fair, objective and credible" polls in December will guarantee Bangladesh's peaceful return to democracy. After holding bilateral talks with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the Sonargaon Hotel, Ban said the caretaker government and political parties should cooperate in holding the parliamentary elections. "We discussed the forthcoming parliamentary election," he told reporters following the talks. "I have expressed my sincere hope and wish that this parliamentary election will be held in a most fair, objective and credible way so that Bangladesh can have a very smooth and peaceful transition towards full democracy." "I am convinced that the leadership of Bangladesh's government and the political parties will have closer cooperation in this matter," the UN chief said. The secretary-general said he was very much impressed by Bangladesh's development in the socio-economic and political arena. "I am very much grateful again for a strong partnership between the United Nations and Bangladesh, particularly in the area of peace keeping operations," he said. The UN chief assured Dhaka of accommodating more Bangladeshi troops in peace-keeping missions. Bangladesh is the second largest troop-contributing country with 9,000 soldiers. "We have again discussed how Bangladesh can contribute more to the peace and stability of the world," Ban said. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Chowdhury said: "We have had very fruitful talks. "During the talks, I also sought UN help for the rescue of the two BRAC workers recently abducted in Afghanistan." The UN secretary-general went on to the Dhaka Sheraton to attend a banquet hosted by chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed. Ban is scheduled to meet the president, chief adviser and the leaders of the two major parties, BNP and the Awami League, during his stay. Ban Ki-moon, on a regional tour starting from Manila last week, arrived in Dhaka Saturday afternoon from Kathmandu. He will leave Dhaka Sunday night. bdn
