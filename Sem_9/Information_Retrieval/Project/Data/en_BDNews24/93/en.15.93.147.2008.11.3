"The authority of a government department to probe the charges brought against its chief and the prima facie of the charges has to be looked into," ACC director general (admin) Colonel Hanif Iqbal said at a regular press briefing on Monday. Iqbal said they were also "probing whether there is any interest of the individual or of the state in the allegation, or if the complainant is aggrieved with ACC activities." Asked if they were attaching special importance to this particular case, Hanif said the commission was treating the matter in its usual decorum. He, however, avoided a question about the reason for the haste in resolving the case. On Oct. 25 Mahmudur Rahman made an abortive attempt to file a case with the police who declined to entertain the case on "legal complicacies." The allegations say that "Hasan Mashud Chowdhury during his tenure as chairman of Trust Bank Ltd. laundered a sum of Tk 22.41 crore in the name of losses in foreign exchange transactions of the bank."
