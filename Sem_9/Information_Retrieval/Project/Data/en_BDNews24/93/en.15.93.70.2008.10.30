 Dhaka, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com) - The first flight carrying Hajj pilgrims will take off on Friday for Saudi Arabia, officials overseeing Hajj management said. This year a total of 48,876 pilgrims will perform Hajj, of which 7,618 will go under government management. National carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines will carry a total of 28,561 pilgrims, while the rest will fly by Saudi Arabian Airlines. Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed is expected to formally inaugurate the first Hajj flight on Friday. A Boeing 747, rented by Biman Bangladesh from Orient Thai Airlines, will fly the first 512 ballottee pilgrims, Biman's spokesman and planning director Nafiz Ahmed Imtiaz said. "The first flight was scheduled to be conducted by a Boeing 747 plane rented from Cebu Pacific Air with 540 pilgrims, but the plane did not reach Dhaka on schedule. So we have to manage the 512-passenger capacity Orient Thai Airlines plane." "The remaining 30 or so pilgrims of each flight will be shifted to regular flights." Nafiz said the Orient Thai plane will operate a total of 41 flights, with 33 more Biman regular flights. "The Cebu Pacific plane will also run Hajj flights when it reaches here," said Imtiaz. Hajj officer Md Bazlul Haq Biswas said everything essential for all pilgrims reaching Saudi Arabia, including housing and medical services, has been managed. The ministry of religious affairs has directed government and non-government Hajj management to provide one guide for each group of 50 pilgrims. bdnews
