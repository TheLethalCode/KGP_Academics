 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission, in its regular briefing Monday, said final investigation reports submitted in October against 54 people in 36 cases had failed to substantiate allegations against the accused. To date, the ACC has failed to prove allegations against some 350 graft suspects, among them top politicians, in more than 200 cases. ACC director general (admin) Col Hanif Iqbal handed reporters a list of the latest 36 cases, which included those against former environment and forest minister Tariqul Islam and Jamaat-e-Islami leader Kazi Nazrul Islam. Other accused included union parishad chairmen, officials and employees of government and private agencies. "The commission was forced to submit final reports in 36 cases in October, mainly due to lack of evidence." Hanif Iqbal said. Among the ACC's earlier failed cases were those filed against 16 former ministers, state ministers and MPs, including Chittagong city mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury, former ministers Dr Khandker Mosharraf Hossain and Motia Chowdhury, ex-lawmakers Asadul Habib Dulu, Salahuddin Ahmed and Shah Md Abu Zafar, Dr Abdullah Mohammad Taher and Md Abdus Sobhan. The ACC has also failed to prove a case against 10 people including Beximco Group vice chairman Salman F Rahman on charges of embezzling about Tk 200 crore of Arab Bangladesh Bank funds. bdnew
