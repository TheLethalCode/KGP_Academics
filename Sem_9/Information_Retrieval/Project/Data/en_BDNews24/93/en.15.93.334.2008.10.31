<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Regulatory Reforms Commission chairman Akbar Ali Khan has warned that the country risks a catastrophe if it fails to go to general election on Dec. 18. He said the nation was teetering on the brink of being governed by an illegitimate government. The former caretaker government adviser sounded the warning on Friday after the launch of his book at BRAC Centre in the city. Shamunnay published the book, "People's Participation in Budgetary Process in Bangladesh: In Search of Some Policy Reforms"in cooperation with NGO Manusher Jonno Foundation. It would be suicidal for the political parties if they opt not to go to parliamentary elections after intensive discussion with the government And if the government fails to hold the election, an illegal government would run the country for a long time. "The consequences would not be good. A great disaster would befall the nation," he told reporters.. The RRC chief agreed to suggestions that the common people have doubts about December 18 election. "I also have my doubts. A rickshawalla has doubt. For that reason the Election Commission should immediately announce the election schedule. "If the verdict on the Election Commission's appeal against the High court stay order on re-demarcation of the Jatiya Sangsad constituencies does not go in favour of the commission, they should go ahead with elections according to the old demarcation." Akbar Ali continued: "The government has pledged to hold national elections by December 31. Accordingly with the opinion of the Election Commission the government has set the election date for December 18. "If the government fails to hold elections by the time the government would be considered by the people as an illegal government." He urged the caretaker administration to complete the national election through meaningful dialogue with the political parties to hand over power to a political government. Akbar Ali also called on the political parties to take part in the election by engaging in intensive dialogue with the government. "We have no alternative to election. The government and the political parties will have to take decision keeping the fact in mind." Former caretaker government adviser Prof Wahiduddin Mahmud also attended the book-launch ceremony and spoke to journalists. "An environment of uncertainty will be created in the country if the election is not held on December 18. However, for any special reason the election can be deferred by one or two weeks, not more than that," he said. It is in no way possible for a non-political government to cope with crises, including the global financial turmoil, the country is facing, he said.. Chairman of the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) Prof Rehman Sobhan, Prof Nurul Islam, Prof Ali Ashraf and Mushfiqur Rahman, former MPs GM Quader and Shagufta Yasmin Emily, finance secretary Mohammad Tareque, Shamunnay chairman Dr Atiur Rahman and executive director of Manusher Jonno Foundation Shaheen Anam spoke. bdnew
