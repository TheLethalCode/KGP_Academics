 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  BNP has said it will decide with the allies about whether to go to the general elections. "BNP wants to go to the elections. But the government has not fulfilled any of the demands that we placed for a free and fair election," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said Monday. The reporters asked him why the leader of the four-party alliance did not make any comment after the Election Commission announced schedules for general and Upazila elections on Sunday. "Under the circumstances we are looking into the whole matter. We will decide in consultation with the party and the allies," he said at his NAM flat home. On whether the party was ready for elections Delwar said: "We are ready. We are discussing organisational and electoral issues with leaders and activists every day." "But we have to look at the issue of the level playing field. The atmosphere for a proper election is yet to be made." "UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon during his visit to Bangladesh also said that a level playing ground should be prepared for the parties for the sake of a free and fair election. We want the same," the BNP leader said. b
