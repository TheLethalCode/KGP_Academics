<TITLE> Japan poised to join global round of rate cuts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 TOKYO/HONG KONG, Oct 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan is expected to cut interest rates on Friday, joining a growing wave of central banks that are shifting from stabilizing credit markets to slashing borrowing costs to cushion their economies against the threat of a global recession. Policymakers have been struggling to get ahead of a rapid slowdown in the global economy that has hurt corporate profits and which sparked a record freefall in global stock markets in October. There were some signs rate cuts from Beijing to Washington and massive doses of liquidity were unlocking short-term financing for banks and improving investor sentiment. A top Australian policy maker on Friday said there were signs the Federal Reserve's massive expansion of US dollar swaps with other central banks seemed to be working to ease pressures in global markets. A rate cut from the Bank of Japan, widely anticipated after reports such a move was under consideration, was expected to hammer home a message that policymakers worldwide were willing to do whatever it took to shelter their economies from the worst financial storm in 80 years. "They want to send a message of coordinated international action about the poor economy, a message that is extremely important for markets," said Yutaka Miura, a senior technical analyst at Shinko Securities in Tokyo. The Bank of Japan may halve its key interest rate to 0.25 percent, which would be its first cut in more than 7 years, as the world's second-biggest economy feels the effect of the crisis spreading through its key export markets. It may also announce other measures to support financial markets. The economies of Britain, Europe, Japan and the United States are contracting. The latest date on gross domestic product showed the U.S. economy shrank in the third quarter, three months that ended with the dismantling of Wall Street in September. Policy maker efforts were showing some signs of turning investor sentiment. The MSCI all-country world equities index is set for its biggest weekly rise since the gauge started 20 years ago. China reduced its benchmark rate for the third time in two months earlier this week and the U.S. Federal Reserve eased its rate on Wednesday to the lowest level since June 2004. Australia, Britain and the euro zone were expected to cut rates next week. Along with central banks, governments around the world were waging an all-out battle to contain the fallout from the financial crisis, including tax cuts, taking equity in banks and backing bank deposits. On Thursday, Japan unveiled a $50 billion economic stimulus package and German cabinet minister Michael Glos said the European country planned to introduce a range of steps worth up to $39 billion. The Fed alone has made available through swap lines a sea of US dollars to central banks globally so they can meet financing demands. "Overall, it appears this has had some success with conditions in the US dollar swap markets improving over the last few weeks, and the cost of US dollar funding declining to more normal rates," said Reserve Bank of Australia Assistant Governor Guy Debelle at a conference. The US economy shrank at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter, the sharpest contraction in the United States in seven years. US consumers slashed spending at the fastest rate in 28 years in the third quarter
