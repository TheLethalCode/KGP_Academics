 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  Political parties have hailed the government's withdrawal of ban on electoral procession and rallies by relaxing the Emergency Powers Rules but they all sought total recall of the state of emergency, not just easing. Awami League acting president Zillur Rahman Monday evening told bdnews24.com, "We want complete withdrawal of the state of emergency before the election. Not just relaxation of the state of emergency, it would be better if it was completely lifted." The home ministry in a circular on Monday revoked clauses 5 and 6 of the Emergency Powers Rules 2007, removing media restrictions and barriers to campaign rallies and processions. Candidates for parliamentary and Upazila elections will now be able to assemble supporters and organise rallies in accordance with the Representation of the People Order 1972 and the 2008 Upazila law, the home ministry circular said. The Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) general secretary, Mujahidul Islam Selim, told bdnews24.com, "Relaxation of the Emergency Powers Rules is a positive step. But we want complete withdrawal of the state of emergency." Workers Party of Bangladesh general secretary Bimal Biswas said, "Through this decision, the state of emergency stays on. Practicing democracy is not possible under Emergency Powers Rules. So we want full withdrawal of the state of emergency." When attempt was made to get Jamaat-e-Islami's reaction to the government decision, theparty chief's press secretary Khorshed Alam told bdnews24.com, "A reaction will be given from the meeting of the party Majlish-e-Shura on Tuesday." bdnews24.co
