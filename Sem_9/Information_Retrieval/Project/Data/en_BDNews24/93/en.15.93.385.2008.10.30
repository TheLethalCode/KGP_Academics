 MILAN, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Napoli love to attack and deservedly lie joint-top of Serie A but they will struggle to stay there when visiting AC Milan on Sunday (1930 GMT). Their fluent style has won fans far from Naples and Wednesday's 3-0 home win over struggling Reggina showed what Edy Reja's side are all about. Argentine close-season signing German Denis burst onto the scene with a hat-trick but in truth it was again the skill of compatriot Ezequiel Lavezzi and Slovakia's Marek Hamsik which sealed victory. The attacking pair are two of the most exciting young prospects in Serie A and ensured Napoli finished eighth last season, their first back in the top flight since 2001. The club from Italy's third biggest city went bankrupt in 2004 and it took the wealth of film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis to resurrect the name and drag them back up to the top flight from the third division. Their two Serie A titles in 1987 and 1990 were inspired by Diego Maradona and thanks to Lavezzi and Denis the Argentina connections remain strong. They now stand joint top with Udinese on 20 points from nine games and Lavezzi is excited for the trip to Milan, who lie a point behind in third after Wednesday's 2-1 win over Siena. "We are improving well and this 3-0 is the perfect way to prepare for Milan, who are very strong opponents," he told reporters. "It will be a difficult game but we will go to play like always." Reja was equally confident. "They have an extraordinary attack but we have great forwards too. Everyone must fear Napoli," he said. However, his side's chances of being clear at the top at the end of the weekend look remote. A win at Milan would have to be combined with confident Udinese dropping points at home to Genoa (Sunday 1400), while fourth-placed Inter Milan go to bottom side Reggina on Saturday (1700). The champions are two points behind the leaders after recording two goalless draws in a row, when coach Jose Mourinho's tactics came under scrutiny, but another failure at Reggina is unlikely. Improving Juventus will still have an extensive injury list for Saturday's home game (1930) with AS Roma, whose match on Wednesday with Sampdoria was abandoned because of torrential rainat least giving them some respite from a dreadful run
