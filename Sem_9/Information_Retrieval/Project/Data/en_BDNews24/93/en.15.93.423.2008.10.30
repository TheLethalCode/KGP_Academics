 MUMBAI, Oct 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh spinner Abdur Razzak has been reported for a suspect bowling action after the drawn second test against New Zealand, the International Cricket Council said on Thursday. Umpires Daryl Harper and Asoka de Silva said they had concerns over the left-arm spinner's faster ball and decided it was appropriate that the delivery be scrutinised further after monitoring it during the two-test series won 1-0 by New Zealand. Razzak is required to submit an independent analysis of his action by a member of the ICC's panel of human movement specialists under the authority's bowling review and can continue to play until the study in done. Razzak will be suspended from bowling that particular delivery in international cricket with immediate effect if found to have been bowling with an illegal action. If his action itself is proved suspect during the analysis, he faces a ban and will have to undertake remedial measures. The 26-year-old has taken seven wickets in five test matches and has claimed 110 victims in 79 one-day internationals
