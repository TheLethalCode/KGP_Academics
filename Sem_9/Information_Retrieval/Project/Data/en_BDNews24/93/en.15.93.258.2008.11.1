 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)  The chief adviser, marking National Youth Day on Saturday, said securing the future of all youngsters, who together make up one third of the population, was key to development efforts. "We have many responsibilities towards the young. To transform them into an organised and disciplined work force is one of the main issues of national priority," the CA said, in a speech to mark the day at the Osmani Memorial Auditorium. "The country lacks manpower in industries, factories and a number of specialised professions, for want of updated education and training. Such shortages are hampering production and economic development," he said. Fakhruddin laid emphasis on partnership between the government and private training organisations in this regard. "Preparations for training programmes according to the demands and standards of the labour market are underway," he said. "I believe we will be able to remove unemployment and develop manpower by providing skilled human resources in the local and foreign labour markets through these programmes." In his speech, Fakhruddin also stressed refurbishment of existing training schools by prioritising technological and specialised curricula. The CA handed National Youth Awards to 10 youth volunteers for their contributions to organising young people in various fields. Among others, the chief adviser's special assistant in charge of youth and sports Mahbub Jamil, and youth and sports secretary Golam Mostafa Talukder also spoke. bdnew
