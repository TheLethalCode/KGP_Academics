 GUWAHATI, India Thu Oct 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Eleven bomb blasts in quick succession ripped through Guwahati and three other towns in Assam, killing at least 65 people and wounding 335, police said. No one has so far claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts, which security analysts said appeared to be coordinated. Assam has been a focus of a separatist insurgency for decades, but it has also recently suffered bomb attacks blamed on Islamist militants from neighbouring Bangladesh. Many of Thursday's blasts were in crowded markets in the state and many bombs were hidden in motorcycles or scooters. Firefighters doused the smouldering remains of cars and motorcycles at one of the blast sites in Guwahati. One of the blasts targeted a high-security zone with a court as well as offices and the homes of senior police officials. Television channels showed some people lying on the streets, their clothes soaked in blood. Some of the walking wounded were helped into ambulances by local people and police. "Immediately after the blast there was complete darkness for a while and I later saw several bodies and severed limbs all around," said Bikash Goyal, a witness in Guwahati. A spokesman at Assam's chief minister's office said 33 people were killed in four blasts in Guwahati. The other 32 people were killed in three other towns in the state. Security analysts and military intelligence officials said the Assam blasts bore hallmarks of strikes by Islamist militants. "These blasts look like the handiwork of terrorist groups from Bangladesh, as you need sophisticated militant groups to carry out such coordinated attacks," Major General Ashok Mehta, a security analyst, told Reuters in New Delhi. "It is quite possible that separatist groups are not involved at all," Mehta added. The United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), Assam's major separatist group often blamed for attacks, denied involvement. The attacks were condemned across South Asia. "I am confident that the people of India will rise unitedly against these attempts to disturb peace and harmony and to destroy our social fabric," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a statement. Pakistan, often blamed by New Delhi for fomenting trouble in neighbouring India, condemned the attacks and called for international cooperation to tackle strikes by militants
