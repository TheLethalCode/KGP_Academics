 Dhaka, Nov 2 (bdnews24.com)  Restrictions on the political parties will go immediately after the schedules for the general election are announced, an adviser has said. The move would facilitate free exercise of their political rights, commerce adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said at a press briefing at the communications ministry on Sunday. He and communications adviser Ghulam Quader, local government adviser Anwarul Iqbal, and law adviser AF Hassan Ariff  who have been entrusted with the dialogue with political parties  had a brief meeting before the briefing. Preparations to hold the election participated by all the parties were going ahead, he said. "The political parties have issues about their preparations, which came up during the dialogue with the Awami League and the BNP on October 23," Zillur said. He admitted that the government was resolving the issues 'at a slow pace though', which he promised would get faster. The adviser said the dialogue with the political parties fetched agreement on several issues but there might be some rational discomfort about the implementation of these issues. "Discussion to resolve this problem will be initiated soon," he emphasised, adding, "Parties want quick solution, but all the pros and cons had to be considered. It will be a milestone if all parties take part in the polls to make it a success." He stressed that all stakeholders need to be patient to get to the goal and added political leaders would have to play more pro-active role. "Mistakes might come along the way, but we must ignore them and move ahead," Hossain Zillur said. On the demand for lifting the state of emergency, the adviser said the government was 'actively considering' it. "Steps will be taken at the right and quickest possible time. Efforts are on for creating an environment of trust for the political parties and the people." Asked to comment on the court verdict on demarcation, he said the government would "play its role in creating proper election atmosphere soon after the election schedule is announced. "The restriction concerned would be lifted to help create a fully free political atmosphere." bdne
