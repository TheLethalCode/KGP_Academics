 Dhaka, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com)  The government has realised Tk 102 crore in tax on the undisclosed income that was legalised in four months to October, the NBR chief says. According to the NBR, some 15,000 people declared previously undisclosed income during the period, up to 5pm on Monday. Last year the government received a total of Tk 802 crore. Chairman of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) Mohammad Abdul Mazid told bdnews24.com on Monday the opportunity ended on Oct. 31. But as Oct. 31 was Friday the deadline was stretched to Nov. 2. Figures from across the country are yet to reach the NBR, Mazid said and added the amount of tax would increase when the complete statistics would be available. The finance adviser, in his budget speech in June, gave the July 1-Oct 31 window of opportunity to those who failed to "disclose" their "legally earned" income in their tax statements. Last year, the response had been much better to a similar government gesture. The NBR boss explained that last year the government initially gave two months and then extended the time by two more months. But this time, he said, many people used their income tax returns to show the undisclosed money as they got four months together. Mazid said normally the income tax return has to be filed in September. Last year those who had undisclosed income got those legalised before September. The 2008-09 budget allowed those who have not paid income tax could pay tax on their legally earned undisclosed income by paying seven percent fine until Oct. 31. bdnew
