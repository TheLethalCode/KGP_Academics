 NAGPUR, India, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Australia must adapt quickly to the conditions in Nagpur in the final test this week if they are avoid their first series defeat in three years, batsman Michael Hussey said on Tuesday. Australia trail 1-0 in the four-test series after losing the second test in Mohali by 320 runs. The other two tests, in Bangalore and New Delhi, were drawn. "A new pitch, so who knows what the conditions will hold," the left-handed batsman told reporters. "In the past, it's been one of the strengths in the Australian team, whatever the conditions are we just had to adapt as quickly as possible. "Hopefully we can adapt as quickly if not quicker than the Indian team. I think that's going to be the important thing, adapting to those conditions whatever they may be." The world's top-ranked team have not lost a test series home or away since the 2005 Ashes in England. The final test starting on Thursday will be played at a new stadium in the city where Australia won their first series in India in 35 years in 2004. The visitors practised at the old stadium on Tuesday and have yet to get a feel of the new venue. BRAVE BATTING Hussey said Australia will draw inspiration from their brave batting performance in the last test. Michael Clarke scored a century and four other top-order batsmen, including Hussey, hit fifties to help the side post 577 in reply to India's 613 for seven declared to effectively save the test. "No matter what the pitch is like, even if it is a little flat batting pitch, which I don't think Delhi was, when the opponent gets 600 in the first innings, to get so close it takes a lot of perseverance, a lot of application," said Hussey. "I think we can definitely take a lot of confidence out of that." Hussey, who scored a century in the first test, dismissed talk that Australia were not a confident outfit following the retirement of a number of high-profile players. "I wouldn't necessarily agree we are a defensive team," he said. "We have to play according to the situation of the game. "I am sure if the situation presents itself we will be very attacking. "We need to win this last test so we've got to make sure we play very well in the first innings of the game whether we bowl or bat first, and get ourselves into a position where we can then attack the Indians.
