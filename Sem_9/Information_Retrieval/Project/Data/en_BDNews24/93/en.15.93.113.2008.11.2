Dr Zafar Iqbal, of the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, said: "Autism is a big problem across the globe. One out of 150 children is affected with autism in the United States but there are no available statistics here." "There needs a special initiative for autistic children to develop their potential," he said. Iqbalwas speaking at a cultural programme with the participation of autistic children held at BIAM auditorium in the city. The function was organised on the occasion of third anniversary of student-run voluntary organisation, HANS (HELLO'S Association of Neophyte-Students).
