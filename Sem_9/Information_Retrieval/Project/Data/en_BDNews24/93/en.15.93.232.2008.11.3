 MUMBAI, Mon Nov 3,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Indian shares climbed 5.62 percent on Monday, taking their gains from last week's three-year low to more than a third, with sentiment boosted after the central bank cut interest rates and reserve requirements to shore up growth. Leading property firm DLF Ltd, which reported a dip in quarterly profit on Friday, rose 14.9 percent, Tata Motors, which posted a dip in October sales, rose 11.1 percent and top bank State Bank of India put on 11.2 percent. Infrastructure firms also jumped on hopes that lower interest rates would keep order flows strong and aid project funding. Leading infrastructure firm Larsen & Toubro rose 10.8 percent, Reliance Infrastructure jumped 17.2 percent, and Jaiprakash Associates put on 13.4 percent. Analysts said despite four straight sessions of gains, there was still a lot of concern about the market outlook. "Sustainability is doubtful because there can't be immediate changes in the fundamentals. The liquidity situation is still not happy, and there is still plenty of global uncertainty," said Jigar Shah, senior vice president at Kim Eng Securities. The 30-share benchmark index rose 549.62 points to 10,337.68, its highest close since Oct 21, with 28 stocks rising. The index is up more than 34 percent from a three-year low of 7,697.39 hit last Monday. In the broader market gainers led losers 1,977 to 639 on volume of 299 million shares. "We should see a brief correction in the next few days. But till the U.S. presidential election gets over, everybody is on wait-and-watch," an institutional trader at a Mumbai-based brokerage said. Banking stocks rose on hopes credit would flow more freely after the central bank cut its key lending rate by 50 basis points and cut banks' cash and bond reserve requirements. ICICI Bank rose 7.9 percent to 430.95 rupees, and the sector index rose 7.5 percent. Bucking the market trend, software services exporters Infosys Technologies and Satyam Computer lost ground as the rupee extended a recovery from last week's record low. The 50-share NSE index rose 5.48 percent to 3,043.85. Elsewhere, Asian stocks rose for the fifth straight day on hopes policy efforts to dampen the impact of financial crisis would take hold. STOCKS THAT MOVED IVRCL Infrastructures & Projects rose 22.85 percent to 104.05 rupees, after it reported a 62 percent jump in September quarter net profit to 571 million rupees. Top motorbike maker Hero Honda Motors fell 3.1 percent to 725.40 rupees after its October despatches dipped 3.4 percent year-on-year.
