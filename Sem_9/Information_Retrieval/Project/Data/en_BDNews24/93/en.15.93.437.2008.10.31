 Dhaka, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League on Friday repeated its warning they would not go to the polls until party president Sheikh Hasina, now out on parole, was unconditionally released. "We will not go to the ensuing general election without Sheikh Hasina's unconditional release. And we want to see how the election is held without Awami League," acting president Zillur Rahman. Said. He made the remarks while exchanging views with the leaders of 'Shaheed Noor Hossain Sangsad' at his Gulshan residence. Hasina was freed on parole on June 11 and is now abroad to receive treatment. Zillur said the government did not live up to any of the promises it had made to AL. "We want to get back our political rights that the government took away after the Jan 11." "BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was bailed out in nine cases in a single day, but Sheikh Hasina was denied bail," Zillur said, referring to the Appellate Division's rejection of her bail appeal in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali on Thursday. He doubted that the election would be held on Dec. 18 following the Election Commission's decision to delay announcement of the election schedule over legal tangle. bdnews
