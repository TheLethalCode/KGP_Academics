 LONDON, Oct 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief team news ahead of this weekend's Premier League matches (all times GMT): Arsenal could be without William Gallas and Emmanuel Eboue for the visit to Stoke City on Saturday (1500). Captain Gallas is suffering from a recurrence of a hamstring problem while utility player Eboue has a knee strain.
