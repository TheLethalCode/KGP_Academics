 RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sao Paulo, attempting to win their third successive Brazilian title, went top of the standings on Sunday after a stunning individual goal from Dagoberto helped them beat Internacional 3-0. Dagoberto won possession inside his own half, raced between three defenders, burst into the area and slipped the ball past goalkeeper Lauro in the 52nd minute to score his side's second goal. Borges put Sao Paulo ahead after a scramble in the 29th minute and Hugo headed the third near the end, scoring at the second attempt after his first shot hit the crossbar. With five matches to play, Sao Paulo, top for the first time this year, have 62 points from 33 games. Palmeiras stayed one point behind and moved into second spot after a last minute goal from Leo Lima gave them a 2-1 win at Santos. Kleber side footed Palmeiras ahead in the first minute but Santos equalised at the start of the second half with a controversial goal scored by Kleber Pereira. The linesman signalled for handball but was overruled by the referee, sparking angry protests from Palmeiras who had coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo sent off for dissent. Gremio dropped from first to third after drawing 1-1 at home with relegation-threatened Figueirense after another controversial refereeing decision. Marquinho put the visitors ahead in the seventh minute but Gremio were awarded a free kick in first-half injury-time after Figueirense goalkeeper Wilson was judged to have held onto the ball for too long. Reinaldo scored from a rebound after Paulo Sergio's free kick hit the wall and furious Figueirense players surrounded the referee to protest at halftime. Cruzeiro, 3-0 winners over Gremio on Wednesday, lost by the same score at Goias and dropped to fourth with 58 points. The goals came in the first 20 minutes with Paulo Baier scoring twice and defender Henrique heading the third. Fluminense, who came within a penalty shootout of winning the South American Libertadores Cup in July, dropped into the relegation zone after losing 1-0 to local rivals Vasco da Gama. Wagner Diniz scored a second-half winner for Vasco, whose coach Renato Portaluppi led Fluminense in the Libertadores. Fluminense, now under former Jamaica coach Rene Simoes, dropped to 19th in the 20-team table with 34 points, behind Vasco on games won. The bottom four are relegated
