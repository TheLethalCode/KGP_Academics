 Dhaka, Nov 1 (bdnews24.com)An international business conference in Dhaka has called for unprecedented level of economic cooperation between South Asian states to cope with climate change. "Climate change will affect this region like no other part in the world," said Dr Razendra Kumar Pauchari, president of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). Pauchari was the keynote speaker at Saturday's concluding session of the two-day conference, titled 'Next Fifteen Years  A Way Forward to Growth', organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries to mark its 50th founding anniversary. The IPCC president said that Shanghai, Dhaka and Kolkata are the most risk-prone cities as sea-levels rise. On the impact of climate change in agriculture, Dr Pauchari said that temperature rises were affecting farm output, especially in case of staples such as rice and wheat. "Food security will suffer most and the poorest nations will be hit hardest," he said. Mentioning the huge disparity and rapid depletion of natural resources in the region, the IPCC chief called on South Asian nations to come up with collective measures to cope with climate change challenges. The session was moderated by Mahbubur Rahman, president of the International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh. The closing session also heard from economist Rehman Sobhan and FBCCI president Annisul Huq among others. bdn
