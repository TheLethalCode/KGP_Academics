 KARACHI, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senior Pakistan batsman Mohammad Yousuf has flown to India to join the rebel Indian Cricket League (ICL) despite his selection on Monday in the national team for three one-day internationals. "He didn't tell us he was going to India. We heard about it ourselves two hours back. We called up his home and his wife has confirmed he has gone to India to play in the ICL," Pakistan Cricket Board operations director Zakir Khan told a news conference on Monday. Earlier Yousuf was named in a squad to play three one-day matches against West Indies in Abu Dhabi this month. Zakir said Yousuf would be banned from all cricket in Pakistan if he played in the Twenty20 competition. The ICL filed a legal case against Yousuf with an arbitrator in Mumbai for breach of contract after he first signed for them in August, 2007 and then returned his advance payment and decided to get a contract in the officially approved Indian Premier League. The case is still pending
