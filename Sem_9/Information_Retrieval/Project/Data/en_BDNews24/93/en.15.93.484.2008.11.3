<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Nov 3 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newell's Old Boys beat arch-rivals Rosario Central 1-0 on Sunday in an Argentine championship match remarkable for an amazing missed open goal late in the game. Newell's striker Cristian Fabbiani was the guilty party as he weaved his way through the Central defence in a move worthy of Diego Maradona, only to fire over the crossbar from six metres with the goal at his mercy. Fabbiani won possession from a defender who had intercepted a long ball upfield, charged forward, jinked his way past goalkeeper Jorge Broun and then left another defender on the ground. He took another two steps forward and, with only a helpless defender between himself and glory, fired high into the disbelieving crowd behind the goal. Defender Rolando Schiavi scored the winner from a penalty in the 22nd minute after Diego Braghieri had upended Gaston Machin in the Rosario derby which features one of the fiercest rivalries in Argentina. There was trouble outside the stadium as television pictures showed police firing rubber bullets to disperse supporters. The DyN news agency said 40 people were detained and two policemen were injured. The win kept Newell's fourth in the Apertura championship with 23 points from 13 games, three behind leading trio San Lorenzo, Tigre and Boca Juniors. Boca threw the title race wide open with six matches to play by beating San Lorenzo with a seventh-minute goal from playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme, whose free kick found its way through a forest of legs. Riquelme was then booked for a tribute to the late club president Pedro Pompilio, who died of a heart attack on Thursday at the age of 55. In celebrating the goal, Riquelme lifted up his shirt to show a tee-shirt bearing a message which read: "Thanks for everything Pedro". Boca dominated the rest of the first half, missing a hatful of chances to extend their lead. Walter Acevedo wasted San Lorenzo's best chance in the second half when he headed over from an unmarked position. San Lorenzo, who have taken only one point from their last nine, still lead on goal difference. Tigre lost 2-0 to lowly Argentinos Juniors on Saturday
