 Dhaka, Nov 4 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami to surrender to the trial court by Nov 10 in the Barapukuria coalmine graft case. The bench of justices Md Mojammel Hossain and Afzal Hossain Ahmed gave the order after hearing Nizami's petition for bail and quashing the case on Tuesday. It set Nov 11 for a follow-up hearing. The court will give an order on Wednesday on similar petitions by Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mohammad Mojaheed and BNP leader Saifur Rahman. The ACC filed the Barapukuria case on Feb 26, accusing the immediate past BNP-led government of causing Tk 158.71 crore in losses to the state through irregularities in management of the coalmine. ACC deputy director Abul Kashem Fakir pressed charges on Oct 5 against 16 people, including former prime minister Khaleda Zia. bdnew
