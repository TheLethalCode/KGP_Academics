State minister for Chittagong Hill Tract affairs Dipankar Talukdar said the government would recast the councils in Khagrachari, Rangamati and Bandarban districts in line with 1997 peace accord. "We are actively considering recasting of the hill district councils as per the provisions of the peace accord," the state minister told parliament while responding to a call attention notice by Jatindra Lal Tripura of Khagrachhari constituency. Tripura asked the state minister whether elections to the hill district councils would take place as the tenure of all the councils have expired much earlier.
