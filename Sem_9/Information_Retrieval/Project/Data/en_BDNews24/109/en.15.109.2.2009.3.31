 Liton Haider bdnews24.com Senior Correspondent Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com) Authorities closed Dhaka Medical College indefinitely Tuesday after recurrent bouts of overnight clashes between two groups of pro-Awami League Bangladesh Chhatra League. The scheduled exmaninations have been postponed and the students told to leave halls of residence by 4pm to prevent further violence on the campus. The two factions of the ruling AL's student wing clashed at Dr Fazle Rabbi Hall compound, leaving no fewer than two dozens injured, DMC principal Dr Kazi Deen Mohammad told bdnews24.com. The reason behind the violence was not clear, he said. The DMC academic council at a rushed meeting in the morning decided to postpone all MBBS classes and exams, the principal said. The postgraduate exams, however, would be held as scheduled, Mohammad added. The foreign students can stay in the halls, Mohammad said. Of the injured, the condition of the general secretary of the BCL's college unit, Abul Kalam Asad Rajib, was critical, the principal said. He had undergone surgery several times and was kept under intensive care in the morning. Fifteen more students were admitted to the hospital, the college head further said. Authorities have formed a three-member committee with professor Muhiuddin Ahmed as the head to investigate the incident. The other members are Dr Abdul Al Mamun and Dr Mohamad Belal Alam. The committee has 10 working days to report the finds, the principal said. The faction led by Rajib alleged that the outsiders carried out the attack. Additional police have been deployed on the campus. Common students alleged that factions led Rajib and Bidyut Barua had been involved in clashes for long over gaining control of the campus. bdnews24.com/lh/ff/su/bd/1351h. bd
