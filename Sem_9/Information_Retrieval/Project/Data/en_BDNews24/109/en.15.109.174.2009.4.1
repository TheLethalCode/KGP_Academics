 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com) Prime minister Sheikh Hasina distributed BAB-donated cheques to the wives of slain army officers at her office Wednesday. The Bangladesh Association of Banks will give Tk 40,000 a month for ten years to each of the families of the army officers killed in the Feb 25-26 BDR mutiny. The two officers who were killed in a separate helicopter crash just days after the BDR incident will also be included among the recipients. The BAB said its members would also offer jobs to eligible members of the bereaved families. The prime minister once again deplored the tragic BDR incident in the strongest term and said the killers must be given exemplary punishment. She said she realised the pain of losing loved ones in such a manner as she had also faced a similar situation back in Aug 15, 1975. "It is not possible for anyone to bring the martyrs back but the government will always be beside the victims' families," Hasina added. She personally inquired about the situation of the families and affectionately petted a newborn baby of major Maksumul Hakim, killed at Peelkhana. Earlier, a BAB delegation led by its president Nazrul Islam Mojumder handed over the cheques to the prime minister. The BAB president praised the government for its prudence and foresight in resolving the BDR crisis quickly and without bloodshed. He also announced the decision of the association to provide jobs in their banks to the eligible members of the dead officers' families. The association will also extend all out support for higher education of their children, Nazrul Islam said. He said the association would, in addition, arrange special treatment for those officers who were seriously wounded in the incident. Finance minister AMA Muhith, military adviser to the prime minister Tarique Ahmed Siddique, state minister for liberation war affairs A B Tajul Islam, chiefs of the three services, and top civil and military officials were present.
