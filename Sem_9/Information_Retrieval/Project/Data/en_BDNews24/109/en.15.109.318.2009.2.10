 BEIJING, Tue Feb 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An unapproved fireworks display by China's state broadcaster caused a blaze that swept through part of Central China Television's hypermodern complex in Beijing, a fire brigade spokesman said on Tuesday. A fireman died after inhaling toxic gases when fighting the fire at the still unopened 30-storey building, Xinhua news agency said. Seven people were injured, including six of about 600 firefighters at the scene. CCTV apologized for the fire on its official website. "We feel very hurt that the fire caused a big loss of national wealth," it said. "We apologize to the nearby people for the traffic jams and inconvenience caused by the fire." The blaze started on Monday evening and was put out at 2 a.m. on Tuesday. Flames 20-30 feet high shot out of the building, just north of the spectacular, gravity-defying CCTV tower designed by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas. The flames were reflected in the tower, which itself appeared to be untouched. "CCTV hired staff from a fireworks company to ignite several hundred large festive firecrackers" in an open space outside the near-completed Mandarin Oriental Hotel, part of the CCTV tower complex, Xinhua said, quoting a fire brigade spokesman. He said these fireworks, set off to celebrate the Lantern Festival, were "much more powerful and explosive" than those available at roadside stalls during the Chinese New Year holiday and needed approval from the municipal government. "Owners of the property ignored policemen's warnings that such fireworks were not allowed," spokesman Luo Yuan was quoted as saying. The people who ignited the fireworks were being questioned by police, Luo said. Mandarin Oriental said its property, which had been due to open this year, employed 60 staff, all of whom work in pre-opening offices near the hotel which were empty at the time. "Mandarin Oriental has signed a long-term contract to manage the hotel and has no ownership interest in the building," it said in a statement. Fireworks are set off throughout the Lunar New Year period, even in downtown Beijing, with the highest number and most spectacular saved for the eve of the holiday and on Lantern Festival at the end
