<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  Labour and employment minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain has said a positive decision about the tens of thousands of Bangladeshi workers, who were denied visas by Kuala Lumpur last month, will come after a new government comes to power in Malaysia. "The (visa) crisis is not solved yet. But there is a high demand for Bangladeshi workers in Malaysia," the minister told a briefing on Wednesday after his return from Malaysia. A Bangladesh delegation, headed by foreign minister Dipu Moni, went to Malaysia on Mar 25 after Kuala Lumpur cancelled the visas on March 11. "The Malaysian government is positive on the matter. We will see a positive decision after the new government there convenes parliament," said Mosharraf. He said his delegation had discussed the issue with the Malaysian home and labour ministers. "Malaysia will take more workers, but the numbers will not be so high due to the ongoing economic slowdown." "But they have asked us to be alert so that illegal workers do not go to Malaysia from Bangladesh," said Mosharraf. Bangladeshi workers are in high demand in construction, agriculture and plantation projects, he said. 'No direct result', says BAIRA The BAIRA president, in a separate press conference on Wednesday, said the visit brought "no direct result". "The visa crisis will be solved. But it might take one month to one and a half months," said head of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies, Golam Mostafa, who was part of the Dhaka delegation to Malaysia. The visit was successful, said Mostafa. "But it brought no direct result." "The Malaysian ministers indicated that the government would consider the matter after some stability in economy and politics was secured in their country," said Mostafa. The BAIRA president said they had so far received confirmation on Kuala Lumpur's cancellation of some 45,894 visas to Bangladeshi workers last month. 'No need for alarm' The labour minister, meanwhile, told reporters Bangladesh had not seen any alarming numbers of overseas workers returning home so far. He also said no Bangladeshi workers had lost their jobs directly because of the recession so far. Some 8,000 workers returned to the country in February but as many as 43,000 workers left for jobs abroad, said Mosharraf. "We received remittance of Tk 5,690 crore in January this year, which is 20 percent more than the previous year. In February we received remittance of Tk 5,409 crore, 15 percent more than the previous year," he said. On whether the government would take any initiative for the workers who were returning home, Mosharraf said they would be given assistance from the expatriates' welfare fund. If the workers were ill-treated by the recruiting agencies, the agencies would provide the compensation, he said. The government has procured as much as Tk 9 crore in the past as compensation from the recruiting agencies. Among others, state minister for labour and employment Munnuzan Sufian and secretary Ilias Ahmed attended the press briefing at the labour ministry. b
