<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)The Myanmar ambassador explained to the government Tuesday Yangon's move to fence along the no-man's land along the border with Bangladesh . Phae Thann Oo, the envoy, met with state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmud after the foreign ministry summoned the envoy Monday for a "detailed explanation". "It's not a defence structure. It is for prevention of narcotics and human trafficking," the ambassador told reporters afterwards. "We have verbally informed the minister. We will not give any written explanation." He said the fencing would be "between 50 and 1000 yards" from the zero line at different points, and the total length would be 40 miles. The state minister declined to comment. He authorised a foreign ministry director general, Enayet Hossain, to brief reporters about the meeting. "Myanmar is constructing the fence by informing us through diplomatic channels. They are maintaining a considerable distance of 50 yards to 1000 yards from the zero line," Hossain told bdnews24.com. "There is nothing wrong with it," he said. The construction of the barbed-wire fence will not worsen relations, he added. He said the fencing was going on in some sensitive areas, known as Golden Triangle. "They ( Myanmar ) are really cautious about the 'golden triangle'," Quoting the envoy, Hossain said the fencing was aimed at stopping human tyrafficking and narcotics peddling. Myanmar's foreign minister also informed Bangladesh ambassador about the fencing, he said. According to Bangladesh officials, on Mar 15, Myanmar 's border force Na Sa Ka began mobilising fencing equipment at Kyin Gun village just across the bordering river Naaf in Cox's Bazar district. Bangladesh has a 207-kilometre border with neighbour Myanmar . Mahmud told bdnews24.com Monday that Yangon had previously informed Dhaka about its fencing move, but it gave "different figures" on the distance of the structure from the zero line. He said he wanted a "detailed explanation" from the envoy. This is at least the second time since November last year the ambassador was summoned by the foreign ministry for clarification on disputed issues. The envoy was called to the foreign ministry on Nov. 2 last year as Myanmar intruded into Bangladesh water territory for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal . bdn
