 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)The Supreme Court Tuesday refused to reverse the High Court orders that granted Jama'at-e-Islami assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak anticipatory bail in the Peelkhana carnage case up to April 5 and ordered the government not to harass or arrest him up to that date. The chamber judge of the Appellate Division vacation bench, Justice Shah Abu Nayyim Mominur Rahman, Tuesday turned down the government petition for a deferment of the HC orders issued Sunday. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam and additional attorney general MK Rahman argued for the government petition in the hearing. Razzak, himself a Supreme Court lawyer, was represented by Mainul Hossain and Rafiqul Islam Mian. Immediately after the SC orders were out, additional attorney general MK Rahman told bdnews24.com, "The Appellate Division chamber judge's court has turned down the government's appeal to stay the HC order asking the government not to harass or arrest him up to April 5." Miah said the government quizzed Razzak about the Peelkhana killings only to harass him. Razzak said the attorney general attempted to mislead the court in the hearing. "The attorney general alleged that I had paid heed to the CID summons as I had spoken to the BDR personnel during the February killings," he said. "On leaving the CID office Monday, I told reporters that the CID had not asked me any such questions. "The CID asked me if I had spoken to the BDR personnel on mobile phone on the occasion, and if I had, they asked me for the numbers of those I had spoken to. "The seniormost law officer should refrain from such actions as might mislead the court." Attorney general Alam said Razzak said Monday that phone calls were made from his cellular phone to Peelkhana to enquire about what all were happening there. "He, however, totally denied that he had asked the mutineers not to surrender. Since phone calls were made from his set, he may be called again for quizzing. "He may be required to face the accused already arrested in the case." On Razzak's allegations against him, the attorney general said he had only apprised the court of what he had read in newspapers. "The Peelkhana killings case is a crucial case of mass murder, which may call for arresting people. The (Mar 29) High Court orders will hinder the investigation. The carnage might very much have outsiders involved." Peelkhana case investigation officer CID ASP Abdul Qahhar Akhand asked Razzak in writing on Mar28 to be present at the CID headquarters on Mar 30 for quizzing. Razzak, meanwhile, on Mar 29 filed a peition with the High Court challenging the validity of the CID summons and simultaneously sought bail in anticipation to avoid arrest or harassment. The court did not halt the CID summons. b
