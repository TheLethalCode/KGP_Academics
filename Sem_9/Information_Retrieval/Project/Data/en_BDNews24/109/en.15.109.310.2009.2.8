<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Trade, security and water issues will top the agenda during Pranab Mukherjee's visit, and "all options are open", said the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka a day ahead of his foreign minister's visit on Monday. "We discussed the visit of our foreign minister who is coming tomorrow," Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty told reporters Sunday, after a meeting with home minister advocate Sahara Khatun. Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee will arrive in Bangladesh on Feb. 9 for a day-long tour. "So far we are looking at two agreements," said Chakravarty. "One is the trade agreement, the other is the bilateral investment promotion and protection agreement," he said. Sheikh Hasina's cabinet gave clearance on Thursday for signing two trade and economic deals with India. The foreign office told bdnews24.com on the day that Dhaka and Delhi were set to sign them during the Indian foreign minister's visit. A new agreement on mutual investment promotion and protection will give most favoured nation (MFN) status to each other. The other will be a renewal of an old deal, originally signed in 1980, which includes a clause dealing with water, rail and road transit. India has for long enjoyed water transport facility through the Bangladesh territory, but the part on road and rail transit has never been activated. On objections and controversy raised by some quarters to a transit deal with India, Chakravarty said on Sunday, "It will be under discussion by both governments. There are people in both governments who understand what are the facts." "Opposing something is sometimes just a political stand," he said. "There are so many other pending issues. I have briefed the minister on those issues, and sought her co-operation in moving some of those issues," said Chakravarty. The Indian envoy mentioned water, border management and security issues as some of those pending issues. "We are looking at a whole range of issues, nothing is excluded, we have no fixed agenda." In reply to a question, Chakravarty said he did not discuss maritime borders with the home minister on Sunday. "That was not on our agenda today," he said. One new issue to be addressed is Bangladesh's proposal for a regional anti-terror task force, said the Indian envoy. "On the taskforce, of course, more discussion will be held." "Ultimately the goal is to cooperate in eliminating or at least fighting, opposing terrorism and militancy," said Chakravarty. "Because these are a common enemy for all of us ... This is the enemy of our society, our progress and all other human social activities." Replying to a question on India's latest communications with Pakistan on those wanted for the Mumbai terror attacks, the high commissioner said, "There is nothing official from Pakistan, there is nothing officially communicated to government of India. They say they will provide some information, some responses to the dossier we have given them which clearly state that these people came from Pakistan." bdn
