 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Foreign minister Dipu Moni said Monday she and Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had discussed Dhaka's proposal for a regional anti-terror taskforce. "We will discuss modalities with other countries in the region," she said. The Indian foreign minister said he had signed two scheduled trade deals with Bangladesh after meeting with Dipu Moni and home minister Sahara Khatun during a tightly-scheduled daylong visit. The two foreign ministers gave a joint press conference at Dhaka Sheraton, after three-hour talks at Padma State Guest House. Dipu Moni said Bangladesh had assured India that its territory would not be used for terrorism against any country. Mukherjee arrived in Dhaka Monday morning to discuss "the entire gamut" of bilateral ties just a month into Sheikh Hasina's new administration. His plane touched down around 10:30am. After a press briefing at the airport, he went straight to the Padma State Guest House and met with foreign minister Dipu Moni. "Allow me at the outset to convey warm greetings and congratulations to the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of a free, fair and peaceful election," Mukherjee told reporters at the airport. "I hope to cover ... the entire gamut of our relations including security, connectivity, trade and investment and other important areas," he said of his visit. "We'll also be signing the agreements relating to bilateral trade and investment promotion to further strengthen the framework for investors of both countries." The Indian foreign minister is scheduled to sit with prime minister Sheikh Hasina later in the afternoon. Mukherjee is also expected to unveil the foundation plaque of a new theatre and music department at Dhaka Univesity's arts faculty. He will wrap up his 11-hour trip by attending a dinner at the Indian High Commission in Gulshan before departing Dhaka around 9pm. Hasina's cabinet gave clearance last week for signing two trade and economic deals with India. A new agreement on mutual investment promotion and protection gives the most favoured nation (MFN) status to each country. The other is a renewal of an old deal, originally signed in 1980, which includes a clause dealing with water, rail and road transit. India has for long enjoyed water transport facility through the Bangladesh territory, but the part on road and rail transit had never previously been activated. bdnews24.
