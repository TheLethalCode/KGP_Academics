 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Students of the Patuakhali and Dinajpur polytechnic institutes took to the streets in the morning demanding the cancellation of the referred system of exams, according to Patuakhali and Dinajpur correspondents. In Patuakhali, the agitating students clashed with the police, leaving 50 people, including 10 policemen, injured. The students also damaged three college buses, two police pick-up vans and 20 shops. In Dinajpur, students vandalised the institute but no clashes occurred. "Students brought out a procession at 10am demanding the cancellation of the referred system of exams. But clashes broke out when police blocked the demonstrators trying to lay siege to the Dhaka-Patuakhali highway," said Kazi Ahsan Habib, officer in charge of Patuakhali Sadar Police Station. The police resorted to baton charge and fired tear-gas shells to bring the situation under control, he added. After assurances from the administration, students lifted the siege, added police sources. In Dinajpur, agitated students took out a procession and pelted stones at the residence of the principal. He further said the students calmed down after the principal assured them that the Technical Education Board would be notified of their demands. "The students got angry due to the non-cooperation of the principal. When the students tried to talk to him, the principal left his office," said Lipon Chandra Das, a third-year student of the institute. Professor Sadrul Amin, the principal, told bdnews24.com, "Students are angry because of the error-strewn results of the exams held a month earlier." The institute has nothing to do with the errors and the responsibility lies with the Technical Education Board, he added. bdnews24.com
