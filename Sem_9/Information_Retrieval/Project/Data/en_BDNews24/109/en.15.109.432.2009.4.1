 WASHINGTON,Apr 1,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Congress can fight the epidemic of childhood obesity by getting "junk" food out of school stores and snack machines, a parent-teacher group and the American Dietetic Association said on Tuesday. They backed an overhaul of federal rules so all food sold in schools must meet nutritional standards similar to school lunches. High-fat, high-sugar or high-calorie "competitive" foods now can be sold anytime outside of school cafeterias. Roughly 17 percent of school-age children are obese, triple the rate in 1980 rate and "an epidemic in the United States," says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sens Richard Lugar and Amy Klobuchar spoke in favor of national standards during the hearing. Sen. Mike Johanns said he disliked heavy-handed regulation and Sen. Saxby Chambliss said physical exercise should be part of the school day. Reginald Felton of the National School Boards Association noted that some schools rely on snack sales to help cover costs. He contended that students would buy snack food outside school if it was unavailable inside the building. Susan Neely of the American Beverage Association said that under a 2006 voluntary guideline, "there has been a 58 percent decrease in beverage calories shipped to schools." She said the guideline should become mandatory.
