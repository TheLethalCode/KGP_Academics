 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The national hockey players have continued to skip the preparation camp for the SAFF Games for a second day on Tuesday, demanding a solution to their residential problems, increase of daily allowances and improvement of food. As on the first day, the players passed their training time playing cricket and football as no coaching staff turned up at the Moulana Bhasani National Hockey Stadium. Some 46 players joined the camp as it began on Jan 10 , with as many as 34 players being accommodated in just six rooms at the dormitory of the hockey stadium. Bangladesh Hockey Federation joint secretary Abdur Rashid Shikdar sat with the players on Tuesday and assured them of solving the accommodation and other problems immediately, but the players rejected his assurances and skipped camp. BHF general secretary Khandokar Jamiluddin sat with the players later in the evening and sought five days to solve the problems, saying otherwise he would suspend the camp. The players were seemingly convinced and they said they would rejoin the camp on Wednesday. "He (Jamil) has sought some time till Monday next and promised to solve the problems after talking to the Bangladesh Olympic Association, who is running the camp ahead of the SAFF Games," hockey player Shidullah Titu told bdnews24.com after emerging from the meeting. The midfielder also said that the general secretary would suspend the camp if he failed to meet the problem after Monday. "After having talked with him, we are convinced and have decided to rejoin the camp from Wednesday," said Titu. Shamsuddin Tuhin had earlier demanded announcement of a date for the players' transfers immediately as they had been out of action for the last 11 months. BHF joint secretary Abdur Rashid Shikdar said that the transfers would take place soon after the completion of the second division hockey league. bd
