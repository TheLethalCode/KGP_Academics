 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)The foreign ministry has summoned Myanmar's ambassador for an "explanation" on Yangon's move to fence along the no-man's land along the border with Bangladesh. The ambassador, Phae Thann Oo, will meet the state minister for foreign affairs, Hasan Mahmud, Tuesday, officials said. The state minister will seek clarification from the Myanmar envoy as foreign minister Dipu Moni and foreign secretary are outside the country, they said. "I have called the ambassador for a meeting tomorrow," Hasan Mahmud told bdnews24.com on Monday. The minister said Myanmar had informed Dhaka about its fencing move, but it gave different figures on the distance of the fencing from the zero line. "They have informed us that the fencing will be 100 metres from the demarcation line. But earlier they gave us another figure," said Mahmud. Mahmud said he would seek a "detailed explanation" from the envoy. This is the second time since November last year the ambassador was summoned by the foreign ministry for clarification on disputed issues. The envoy was called to the foreign ministry on Nov. 2 last year as Myanmar intruded into Bangladesh water territory for oil and gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal. On Mar 15, according to Bangladesh officials, Myanmar's border force Na Sa Ka began mobilising fencing equipment at Kyin Gun village just across the bordering river Naaf in Cox's Bazar district. A senior home ministry official told bdnews24.com at the time that Myanmar was erecting fencing along Maungdaw township to Paletwa township. Yangon also mobilised a contingent of troops as back up of its border force.
