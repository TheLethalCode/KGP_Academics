 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)The ruling Awami League supporters are doling out money to buy votes and intimidating supporters of other candidates in Bogra on the eve of the by-election, a senior BNP leader alleged Wednesday. "They are trying to steal our certain victory and are violating the election code of conduct," the BNP chairperson's advisor ASM Hannan Shah told reporters in the capital. By-elections to six constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the Dec. 29 general election, are set to be held in Bogra-6 and -7, Kishorganj-6, Kurigram-2, Rangpur-3 and -6 on Thursday (Apr 2). BNP candidates Mohammad Jamiruddin Sircar and Moudud Ahmed are running for the party strongholds Bogra-6 and -7 respectively. Opposition leader and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia vacated the seats before taking oath as MP. Hannan Shah demanded that the Election Commission strengthen its supervision to punish those violating the election code of conduct and prevent further violations. "The BNP doubts that the ruling party's activities will allow the by-election to be a free and fair one," said Hannan. bdn
