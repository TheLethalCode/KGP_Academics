 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The countrywide serial bomb explosions on Aug. 17 2005, the Aug 21 2004 grenade attack on Awami League, the uprising of militancy during those years and the infamous '10 truckloads of weapons' case are all interlinked, the minister of state for home said on Sunday. "Orders have been passed to probe afresh the details of the case," Tanjim Ahmed Sohel told reporters after Indian high commissioner Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty met home minister Sahara Khatun at the ministry. The 10 truckloads of rifles and grenades were seized on April 1 2004, as they were being unloaded at the Urea Fertiliser Ghat in Anwara Upazila, Chittagong. Two separate cases were filed at the time, under the arms act and on smuggling charges. The state minister said, "We've ordered relevant departments to dig again into the source of the truckloads of arms and explosives seized in Bogra and Dinajpur." "We'll go wherever it takes to find out the source. We'll get to the bottom." "Investigators will exact information on whether the original inquiries were done properly, or influenced by any quarters," said the state minister. "A team could be formed and all options are open. Our main target is to uncover how the 10 truck-loads of weapons arrived here, who were behind them, what was the port of loading, what was the destination, who gave the money for the weapons." "Why these issues were not previously disclosed to the nation should also be unearthed," he said. Of the meeting, Sohel said: "It was a courtesy meeting that discussed Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee's visit scheduled for tomorrow." "We have different bilateral issues to be resolved through dialogue in phases." bdnews
