 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)Parliament passed Monday Bangladesh Biman Corporation (Amendment) Bill, 2009, and the Dhaka Electric Supply Authority (Amendment) Bill, 2009, giving retroactive effect to the decisions to convert Bangladesh Biman Corporation and Dhaka Electric Supply Authority into limited companies. The two bills will ensure continuity of the decisions of the military-installed interim government converting the bodies into limited companies. MPs belonging to the main opposition BNP, who walked out of House Sunday, returned and opposed the passage of the bills. Civil aviation and tourism minister GM Quader proposed the passage of the bill on Biman's corporatisation. State minister for power, energy and mineral resources Shamsul Haque Tuku moved the bill on DESA. According to the bills, the employees, businesses, projects, schemes, assets, rights, powers, authorities and privileges, their movable and immovable property, reserve funds, investments, deposits, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the organisations have been transferred to the limited companies. BNP MPs Jainal Abdin Farrouque, Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, AM Mahbub Uddin Khokan and Nazim Uddin Ahmed opposed ratification of the bills. "An elected parliament cannot validate illegal activities of an unelected and unconstitutional government," Jafrul Islam Chowdhury said. Khokan demanded investigation into alleged corruption in procurement of aircraft during the tenure of the interim government. Mismanagement and huge corruption in Biman made the national flag carrier into a losing concern, Quader said, replying to the opposition allegations. "We will do everything possible to make Biman a profitable organisation." Hasanul Haq Inu, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunication ministry, submitted a report to the House, suggesting passage of the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (Amendment) Bill, 2009. The bill includes provisions for converting the Board into two limited companies in line with the ordinance made by military-installed interim government. According to the bill, the employees, businesses, projects, schemes, assets, rights, powers, authorities and privileges, movable and immovable assets, reserve funds, investment, deposits, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the organisation has been transferred to the limited companies. bdnews
