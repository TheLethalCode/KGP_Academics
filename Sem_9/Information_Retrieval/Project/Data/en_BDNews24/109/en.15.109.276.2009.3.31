Chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the information ministry said the independence leader had already won the hearts of 150 million people through his contribution to the nation. "He needs no new portrayal in television and radio," said Obaidul Quader on Tuesday. "So, the committee has asked Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar not to be over enthusiastic in their publicity of Bangabandhu," he told journalists after its meeting at parliament building. "We have warned the heads of television and radio not to practice excessive praise". Directors general of BTV and Betar were present at the meeting.
