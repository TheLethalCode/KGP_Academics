 Gaza, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli air strike on Tuesday killed two Palestinians militants in the central Gaza Strip close to the border fence with Israel, medical workers said. Residents of Maghazi refugee camp, near the scene of the incident, said a helicopter fired two missiles at militants who had launched a rocket-propelled grenade at an Israeli force. The medical workers said two militants were killed and two other gunmen were wounded. An Israeli security source said Israeli fire was directed against militants who tried to plant explosive devices along the border fence. The clash was the first confirmed confrontation in the Gaza Strip this month in which militants have been killed in action with Israeli forces. Israel ended a 22-day offensive in the territory, ruled by Hamas Islamists, on January 18.
