<TEXT>
 LONDON, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England are hopeful Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff will be fit for Friday's decisive fifth one-day international against West Indies in St Lucia. Pietersen suffered a back spasm during the nine-wicket victory in Sunday's rain-affected fourth match, which tied up the series at 2-2, while Flintoff injured his thumb. "He will have to work on it but we are very hopeful he will be fine for Friday," captain Andrew Strauss, who hit an unbeaten 79 on Sunday, told the BBC. All rounder Flintoff had an ultra-sound scan on his thumb, which he injured when trying to take a hard caught-and-bowled chance. "It's very badly bruised but hopefully if it's just bruising he will be okay for Friday," said Strauss. "We will see how he reacts to treatment over the next 48 hours or so." Strauss also played down Pietersen's remarks in a newspaper interview last week that he was at the "end of his tether" and was ready to go home. "KP knows it's an England tour and we all stick at it together," Strauss said. "As I said, he has been nothing but supportive on this tour and very professional with the way he has gone about his business. "It's not worth dwelling on his comments too much and now we move to St Lucia. It's over, I had a chat with him about it and we move on from there." After a disappointing test series defeat, Strauss said Friday's final one-day international was a chance to raise morale with an Ashes series looming against Australia. "Friday is an opportunity to go home with some silverware which would be very satisfying for the lads and give us some momentum going into the summer," he said. "We need to get rid of that Jekyll and Hyde nature and back to back wins would be a fitting end to the winter.
