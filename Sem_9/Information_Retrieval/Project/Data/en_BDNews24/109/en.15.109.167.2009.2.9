 Pabna, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  At least five people were killed and 20 injured in fights between "two Awami League groups" over the occupation of char lands in Ishwardi, Pabna, police said on Monday. "Clashes involving gunfire broke out between two AL factions of the younger brother of Shamsu Rahman Dilu (AL's member of parliament for Pabna-4), and Anisur Rahman (AL's upazila unit joint president)," said Ishwardi police station officer-in-charge Rezaul Karim. The dead were identified as Ayub Pramanik (40), Adbur Rashid Pramanik (55), Amin Pramanik (40) and 'Sirjan' (40) of Char Kamalpur and Moslem Uddin of Char Goykunda. Ayat and Rashid died on the spot, while Amin and Sirjan succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital, medics said. The injured were sent to different medical centres at Pabna, Ishwardi and Rajshahi. The fight broke out over occupation of the Upazila's Charkamalpur, Chargargar, Charmadhia and Lakshmikundar areas, Rezaul said. Pabna police superintendent Jamil Ahmed earlier confirmed three deaths to bdnews24.com, but said the toll may rise further. He, however, said the fighting was a "non-political incident". bdnews24.c
