 NEW YORK, Mon Mar 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Blood-clot preventer Integrilin was equally effective when given 12 hours or more before angiography -- X-ray views of coronary arteries -- or after the imaging procedures, researchers said on Monday. Researchers said optimal timing for starting treatment with Schering-Plough Corp's Integrilin (eptifibatide), which prevents clots by keeping sticky blood cells called platelets from clumping together, had not previously been determined. "The study should give (doctors) a comfort level that they don't have to give Integrilin immediately after the patient arrives, but can wait until they know the results of the angiogram," said Dr. Kristin Newby, a Duke University cardiologist who helped lead the study. The results suggest that neither timing approach, early or later, is clearly preferable. The medicine, which had sales last year of $314 million, is often given to chest-pain patients when they receive angiograms -- invasive tests that tell doctors whether arteries are clogged and blocking blood flow to the heart. In angiograms, interventional cardiologists thread a long thin tube called a catheter into an artery, such as in the groin or arm, and the tip is then advanced into the major coronary arteries. If arteries are clogged, cardiologists wedge the blood vessels open with an inflated balloon and then keep the vessels propped open with tiny scaffold-like devices called stents. Researchers on Monday described a trial of 9,492 patients who had complained of chest pains or who had small heart attacks. One group of patients was given intravenous Integrilin 12 hours or more before angiography, while the other received it after angiography, and outcomes were similar for both sets of patients. There were no significant differences between the study groups in the rate of death from any cause, researchers said in findings simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Orlando. Moreover, researchers said there were no significant differences between the two groups in a combination of outcomes that included death, heart attack or continuing blocked blood flow requiring procedures to clear arteries, or in the rate of heart attack alone or in the need for repeat artery-clearing procedures alone. Newby noted that a similar anti-platelet medicine called Aggrastat (tirofiban) is also used during angiograms, but cautioned that findings for Integrilin cannot automatically be assumed for the rival medicine. Even so, she said many doctors will likely "extrapolate," and assume that the findings apply to both drugs. Aggrastat, given by injection, is sold in the United States by Medicure
