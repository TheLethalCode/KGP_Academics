 MUMBAI,Feb 9(bdnews24.com/Reuters)- An Indian Airlines plane with about 150 passengers on board avoided a collision with an army helicopter that was part of the president's entourage in Mumbai on Monday, a spokesman for the airport said. The helicopter, one of three on duty for Indian President Pratibha Patil during a visit to Mumbai, was on the same runway as the passenger flight, forcing the aircraft's pilot to abort take-off, the spokesman said. President Patil was not in the helicopter at the time. "The pilot applied the emergency brakes to abort take-off, and fire trucks were rushed to the spot, but the flight was able to taxi off the runway," said spokesman Manish Kalghatgi. Passengers on board were put on another flight to Delhi, he said, adding the Indian Airlines aircraft was still grounded. An inquiry had been ordered into the incident, a spokesman for the Indian Air Force told news channel CNN-IBN. "These are no ordinary pilots, these are highly qualified pilots. They were following the ATC's (Air Traffic Control) instructions meticulously," Mahesh Upasani told the channel. Mumbai's airport, the country's busiest, handles an average of more than 300 flights daily at its domestic terminal.
