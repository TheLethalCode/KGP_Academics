 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)Parliament began business on Monday with main opposition BNP joining the questions and answers session despite the party announcing a "boycott" the day before. Monday's sitting began at around 5.07 pm, around 22 minutes behind the scheduled time, with speaker Abdul Hamid in the chair. Zafrul Islam Chowdhury was attending with nine fellow BNP MPs. A Jamaat-e-Islami MP also joined the session. The main opposition came out of the House on Sunday protesting speaker's alleged violation of the rules of procedure over Sheikh Selim's 'derogatory' remarks on BNP's founder President Ziaur Rahman. Senior MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury told bdnews24.com Sunday night that the BNP central command would discuss the situation after Selim's comments and decide whether the party would rejoin parliament the next day. He had said his party was unlikely to join Monday's sitting. Order of the day The Bangladesh Biman Corporation (amendment) Bill 2009 and DESA (amendment) Bill 2009 are likely to be passed on Monday, according to the order of the day. Hasanul Haq Inu, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on post and telecommunications, is also set to present its report on the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (Amendment) bill 2009, according to the order.
