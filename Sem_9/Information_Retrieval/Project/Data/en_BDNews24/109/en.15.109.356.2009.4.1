 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  The cancellation of Malaysian visas for Bangladeshi workers may be solved in coming months, though a just-concluded visit to Kuala Lampur brought "no direct result", said the BAIRA president on Wednesday. "The visa crisis will be solved. But it might take one month to one and a half months," head of the Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies, Golam Mostafa, told a briefing after returning from Malaysia. A Dhaka delegation, led by the foreign minister and labour minister, went to Malaysia on Mar 25 after Kuala Lumpur cancelled the visas of Bangladeshi workers on Mar 11. The visit did not bring any direct result, said Mostafa. "But it was successful," he added. The delegation had discussions with the Malaysian labour minister and home minister, he said. "The ministers indicated that the Malaysian government will consider the matter after they secure some stability in economy and politics," said Mostafa. The BAIRA president said they had so far received confirmation on cancellation of visas of some 45,894 workers last month. Of them some 18,041 had been waiting for flights on confirmation of their visas and tickets. And some 13,303 others had submitted their documents for visas, 5,126 given their fingerprints and 9,424 had received approval but were awaiting final scrutiny. Replying to a query, Mostafa said the workers would get their money back if the visas remained cancelled. "But we are not concerned about that now. We are concentrating on sending the workers on to Malaysia," Mostafa said. Some 400,000 Bangladeshi workers are living and working in Malaysia at present, he said. b
