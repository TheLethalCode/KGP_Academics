 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) Speaker Abdul Hamid, for the first time in parliament, called for BNP to return to the House for an effective opposition and to avert a 'quorum crisis'. But two ruling party lawmakersSheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and Suranjit Sengutacame down heavily on the outgoing speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar and the BNP. "I humbly urge the opposition to return to the House. This (seating arrangement) is not a factor," Hamid told parliament after an unscheduled debate. Independent MP from Naokhali Fazlul Azim, who was a former BNP lawmaker, standing on a point of order urged the speaker to give eight front row seats to bring BNP back to House. "The Jatiya Sangsad cannot be made effective owing to absence of the main opposition. You pledged in the election manifesto that parliament will be the centre of all discussions. "The MPs are losing interest. If this situation continues, within a short span of time parliament will see a quorum crisis. Seating arrangement is not a problem. You and the leader of the House can resolve the issue," said the MP. "Give them eight seats if necessary to get them back," Azim urged. As speaker Abdul Hamid gave floor to Sheikh Selim, the Awami League MP said the speaker was the authority to finalise the seating arrangement. "We have not made parliament ineffective. Their secretary-general is talking against parliament and the election. They did not win enough seats. They have received seats proportionately." "They don't believe in democracy  It is their duty to come to the House and play their role. Front row or back benches are not factors to represent the people's cause," said Selim. Suranjit Sengupta followed Selim and blamed the outgoing speaker for creating a deadlock over the seating arrangement. "The outgoing Speaker Jamiruddin Sircar is the main person responsible for the trouble over seating arrangement," he said. Referring to the UK's House of Commons, Suranjit said the British parliament had around 400 plus seat for 646 MPs. "Backbenchers have glorious positions in parliament  Please return to the House and talk as long as you can as per the constitution and the rules of procedure," said Suranjit. Meanwhile, chief whip Abdus Shahid on Tuesday told bdnews24.com that the main opposition must come to the House first, as the speaker had assured them of more front row seats. "Now, they should come to House to prove their dedication to the parliamentary process," said Shahid. The BNP and its allies have been staying away from the House since Jan. 28 since speaker Abdul Hamid reshuffled the seating order of the House. Hamid gave the BNP four front row seats, contrary to Sircar's arrangement in which the BNP got nine front bench seats. bdn
