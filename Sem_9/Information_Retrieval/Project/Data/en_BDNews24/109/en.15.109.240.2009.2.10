<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League spokesman Syed Ashraful Islam termed "unrealistic and ridiculous" an Indian journalist's comment that Pakistan was using Bangladesh as a 'buffer state' to export terrorists to India. In a Bangladesh-India joint press conference on Monday, reporter Jayonto Ghoshal of the Indian Bangla-language 'Anandabazar Patrika', saying Pakistan was using Bangladesh as a buffer state to carry out anti-Indian activities, asked for foreign minister Dipu Moni's comment. Dipu Moni refused to reply at the time. Ashraful, replying to a query after an AL working committee meeting, said on Tuesday: "How can Bangladesh be a buffer state? Bangladesh was born through the Liberation War with Pakistan." "This is ridiculous and unrealistic." "How can Bangladesh be a buffer state?" Ashraf asked again. "We don't believe in that." "We've earned our freedom through a liberation struggle, not through someone's charity. And we'll protect our independence and sovereignty," said the AL leader and cabinet minister. bdnews2
