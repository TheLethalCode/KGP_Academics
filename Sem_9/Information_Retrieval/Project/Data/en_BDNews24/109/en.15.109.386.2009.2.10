 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Students of Graphics Art Institute blocked the Sat Masjid Road in the city Tuesday morning and damaged cars to demand a change in the examination system, an official said. The blockade created a huge rush-hour traffic snarl-up on busy road and nearby roads, added Sheikh Mofizur Rahman, chief trainer of the offset department of the institute. "A few days ago, the board made a rule stating that students who fail a referred test would have to be admit themselves again," said Masud, a fifth-year student of the institute, who gave only one name. He explained that since the referred test was held after one year, a student stood to lose two years, which was why the students protested and demanded a correction to the rule. Another student, Rashed, said, "We discussed the problem with the teachers in the past but that did not work. That's why we have taken to the streets." However, when teachers promised to discuss the matter with the Technical Education Board, students left the street. "After getting the complaints of the students, we came to the polytechnic institute and local member of parliament Asaduzzaman Khan promised necessary steps," said Mofizur Rahman "We will have a meeting with the chairman of the Technical Education Board at 4pm and hopefully the problem will be resolved then." bd
