 KINGSTON, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - For the past decade Viv Richards watched in anguish as West Indies cricket plummeted from the position of dominance he helped place them in. But after the crushing innings and 23 run victory over England, who were skittled for just 51 on Saturday, the 'Master Blaster' had a smile on his face again. "That was damn good, 100 percent West Indies," Richards, one of the most dashingly aggressive batsmen the game has seen, told Reuters. In the 1980s when Richards, who averaged 50.23 in an illustrious 121-test career, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes dominated bowling attacks and the Caribbean team had a barrage of pace bowlers that struck fear into their opponents; West Indies were the undisputed champions of the world. These days they find themselves ranked seventh, above only New Zealand and Bangladesh among test nations, but the victory over England suggests a turning point may have been reached. "I said before the game that we now had to turn the corner and now I am hoping that this win could be that turn," said Richards. POOR TOUR The past two years, since the appointment of Chris Gayle as captain and Australian John Dyson as head coach, has been a period of occasional promise frequently interrupted by a return to disappointment. A test win over South Africa in Port Elizabeth in December 2007, hinted at progress but the series was lost 2-1 and then a poor tour of England, lost 3-0, followed. Back in the Caribbean, West Indies had an encouraging two test, 1-1, drawn series against Sri Lanka before hosting Australia. West Indies had sessions where they troubled the world's top ranked side and they were increasingly competitive but still lost the three-test series 2-0. Most recently they were more resilient in their rain-afflicted, drawn two tests in New Zealand but this series is the key test of just how far Dyson and Gayle have taken the team. "It is like (US president Barack) Obama, you set up your administration, you get a certain honeymoon period but then you have to get down to work and there comes a time when you want to see results," said Richards. West Indians have grown accustomed to false dawns but Saturday's win over England was so emphatic and so comprehensive, with the host's superior with both bat and ball, that it has created a new mood in the Caribbean. During Saturday's devastating session, when Jerome Taylor ripped open England's batting with a superb spell of 5-11 and spinner Sulieman Benn picked up four wickets at the other end, the DJ at Sabina Park played soul singer Sam Cooke's "A change is gonna' come". The crowd roared in appreciation and there were more than a few wry grins in the stands as the lyric "Its been a long, a long time coming" echoed across the field. WORLD'S BEST Certainly, it has been a good while since a fast bowler of the quality of Taylor has worn the maroon cap - not since Curtley Ambrose and Courtney Walsh retired at the turn of the century have West Indies had a paceman who counts among the world's best. Slow left-armer Benn's performance indicated that at long last, West Indies may have a decent spin option - the last time they had a slow bowler take eight wickets in a test was Lance Gibbs back in 1975. Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul are three world class batsmen - all with more than 5,000 test runs and averaging over 40. The Australian-born Brendan Nash, with three half-centuries in four test innings, has instilled some much needed stability below Chanderpaul in the middle order and if wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin can repeat his stylish 35 from this test more often, the far too frequent batting collapses that have plagued the team in recent years could be lessened significantly. Skipper Gayle believes that the win is a decisive moment but whether it truly marks a major change in fortunes will be determined during the rest of England's tour of the Caribbean. "Its definitely a turning point, " he said, "We don't know how big yet, we will wait until the series finishes and we will see just how big a turning point it was," he said. For now though, a rare optimism surrounds Caribbean cricket, well illustrated by a sign held up in the crowd, also referencing an Obama campaign theme - "Yes, W.I can
