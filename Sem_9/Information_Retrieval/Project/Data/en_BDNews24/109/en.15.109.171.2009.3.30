 KARACHI, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former test captain Javed Miandad has been reinstated as director general cricket affairs of the Pakistan Cricket Board after resigning in January. "I met with chairman Ejaz Butt who told me he does not accept my resignation and I should start working again as DG cricket affairs," Miandad told Reuters on Monday. Miandad, who played in 124 tests, quit the post saying at the time he was unhappy with the responsibilities and area of work assigned to him in his contract. However, Miandad, who has been given additional responsibility as advisor to the chairman, said he had sorted out all matters with the board and would resume working this week. "We now need to work together for the betterment of Pakistan cricket. There is a lot of work to be done," he said. "Pakistan cricket is facing big challenges. The biggest being to ensure that we get the support of the ICC (International Cricket Council) and other nations at a time when foreign teams are refusing to tour our country for security reasons.
