 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)  The IFIC Bank National Shooting Championship will get underway on Wednesday at the BKSP Shooting Range. "We hope shooters from the national level will produce their best performance in the meet ahead of the 2010 SA Games in Bangladesh," said National Shooting Federation general secretary AN Istiaq Ahmed at a press conference on Monday at the NSC conference room. As many as 218 shooters from 23 clubs will compete in 10 events  six for men's and the rest for women's. "Only those shooters who have the match arms will be eligible to compete in the meet," said the NSF general secretary adding that the match arms were being upgraded day-by-day. The men's events include air rifle, three position, 50m prone, air pistol, standard pistol and pre-pistol while the women's events feature air rifle, three position prone, air pistol and sports pistol. BSF president Major General Mohammad Ashab Uddin will declare the five-day meet open while BSKP director general Brigadier General M Shawkat Hossain and sponsor IFIC Bank chairman Lutfar Rahman will be present as special guest. The federation has also planned to hold the 5th SA Shooting Championship from July 3 to 9 with the participation of hosts Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal and Sri Lanka as the government has already given the go-ahead. "We are now waiting for confirmation from India as without them the tournament will lose its attraction," said the NSF general secretary. Describing the recent activities of the federation, Ahmed said that the Tk 6.41 crore extension and modernization of the national shooting complex would be completed by April next and the Tk 5 crore second-phase would begin immediate after sanctioning. He hoped that after completion of both phases, the national shooting complex would turn into a modern facility and host the shooting event of the 11th SA Games in 2010. Ahmed also said that the BSF was now earning net Tk 90 lakh renting the federation's community centre and hoped to increase the income to Tk 3 crore within a year by improving facilities. "If the federation's income increases, we will start paying the allowances for shooters regularly and import modern arms and cartridges. Besides, we will try to import match arms for 59 clubs in a bid to spread shooting across the country," said Ahmed. Ahmed also said that the players had been training for the SA Games and they were aiming to win at least four gold medals in the SA Games in Bangladesh. Mosharraf Hossain, MD of IFIC, said that they would continue to assist the federation in its bid to take shooting to world standard. NSF vice-president Kutubuddin Ahmed Akshir, treasurer Kashem Humayun and BOA vice-president Mizanur Rahman were also present. bd
