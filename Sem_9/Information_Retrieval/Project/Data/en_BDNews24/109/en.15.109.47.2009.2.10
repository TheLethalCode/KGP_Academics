<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has said party committees would be revamped through elections. She also announced a plan to hold a convention against repressions on the opposition leaders and workers at a meeting with Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal leaders of the 1980s at the party's Gulshan office in the city on Monday evening. "BNP sees 2009 as a year of organisation and will hold elections to reconstitute the committees at all levels starting from the grassroots." "The party must be strengthened by setting aside the differences," the former prime minister said. "We want to go back to parliament but the treasury bench has created obstacles to the opposition playing their due role in the House." She also complained that BNP was defeated in the Dec. 29 elections through a plot. Khaleda said BNP would launch vigorous efforts to materialise the government's promises to provide what she claimed "rice at Tk 10 a kg, salt at Tk 5 a kg and fertilisers for free." Some 50 leaders under the banner of "Student leaders of '80s" attended the three-hour meeting chaired by Ferdous Ahmed Khokan. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, leaders Shahjahan Mia Samrat, Sarwar Azam Khan and Tapas Pathan also spoke at the meeting. bd
