<TITLE> China tells United Nations it protects human rights </TITLE>

 Geneva, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - China on Monday stoutly defended its human rights record, rejecting suggestions from Western countries that it uses torture and jails dissidents and insisting its policies are guided by the rule of law. Backed by a range of Asian and African nations, it told the U.N. Human Rights Council that allegations it oppressed ethnic groups in Tibet and other parts of the country were political propaganda aimed at denigrating China's achievements. "Ours is a state where the rule of law prevails," a top official of China's Supreme Court told the 47-nation Council, while the chief Beijing delegate said: "China is fully committed to the promotion and protection of human rights." Officials from various government ministries took the podium to declare that the Chinese people enjoy free speech and a free press, that all ethnic minorities enjoy full rights, and that the country lives in peace and harmony. They denied reports that the ruling Communist party runs "black jails" -- secret prisons where, Chinese dissidents say, it tortures opponents -- that any restrictions are placed on religious groups, or that China allows child labor. The discussion came in a newly launched process called the "Universal Periodic Review," or UPR, under which all members of the United Nations are expected to submit themselves every four years to scrutiny of their human rights record. China has avoided having its overall rights practices discussed in any detail in major U.N. bodies for over a decade, and its strong reaction clearly showed deep sensitivity on the issues involved, observers said. LOW TOLERANCE "This was a display of very low tolerance of critical comments," Sharon Hom, a Hong Kong-born lawyer who was a law professor in Beijing and now heads a U.S.-based monitoring group, Human Rights in China, told a news conference. In the UPR, delegations are given two minutes to pose questions and make recommendations to the country presenting a report, and are expected to avoid making accusations in the interests of constructive dialogue. Western, and some Latin American, countries raised the issues of Tibet and treatment of the Muslim minority of Xinjiang province in a generally oblique fashion, with only the once communist-run Czech Republic detailing alleged repression. But China's delegation chief Li Baodong accused them of abusing the Council to launch "ill-founded attempts to politicize" the debate -- a charge echoed by Iran, Pakistan, Cuba, Sudan, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Myanmar. Sri Lanka -- itself under fire even in the U.N. for its treatment of its Tamil minority -- denounced what it called "malign criticism of China," while Zimbabwe and Egypt hailed Beijing for major efforts to protect human rights. Several countries saluted Beijing's economic performance as well as its rights record, and suggested China offered them an example and beacon for their own development. However, Li, Beijing's envoy to the U.N. in Geneva, wrapped up the session with an offer to critics of "talks through other channels" on human rights in China. But he said such exchanges had to be "on the basis of equality and mutual respect." The United States said it had sent officials to observe the sessions on China and other nations but they remained silent because the Obama administration was reviewing its policy on the Human Rights Council. That stance drew criticism from Representative Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican. "I was shocked and disappointed to learn that for the last week, the U.S. delegation has been silent. How can America say nothing about four of the worst offenders of human rights and religious freedom in the world?" Wolf said in a statement, referring to reviews on China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia and Russia.
