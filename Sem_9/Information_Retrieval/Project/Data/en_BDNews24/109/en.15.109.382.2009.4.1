 SEOUL, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Korea beat North Korea 1-0 with a late goal on Wednesday in a World Cup qualifier clouded by Pyongyang's plans to shoot off a rocket that Seoul says is a disguised long-range missile test. With the win South Korea leap-frogged North Korea to take top spot in Asia's Group 2. North Korea are trying for their first World Cup finals since their surprise run to the final eight in 1966. South Korea's goal came in the 87th minute when a left-footed free kick from substitute Kim Chi-woo slid off the hand of North Korean goalkeeper Ri Myong-guk into the net. South Korea dominated play but failed to break through despite numerous chances including two close-range shots from Lee Keun-ho. Prior to the game, South Korea's coach said he would like to see both Koreas, still technically at war, advance for the first time together to the World Cup finals, which will be played in South Africa next year. The South Korean fans stood for the anthem of rival North Korea prior to the start of the game at Seoul's World Cup Stadium and politely cheered the opposing side. Tensions on the divided peninsula have been raised by North Korea's plans to launch the rocket from April 4-8 and threats from Pyongyang that any interference from South Korea or its allies would be seen as a declaration of war. South Korea, the United States and Japan, have said the launch is a disguised test of the North's long-range Taepodong-2 missile that violates U.N. resolutions put in place after North Korea last fired the missile in July 2006 and conducted its first and only nuclear test a few months later. North Korea said it was launching a satellite and had the right to do so as part of a peaceful space programme
