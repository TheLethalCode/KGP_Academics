<TITLE> Publish draft on anti-terror taskforce: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The main opposition BNP, which is against a proposed South Asian anti-terrorism taskforce, Sunday asked the government to publish the draft. "The proposal for this kind of regional taskforce is against the spirit of country's independence and sovereignty," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said at a press briefing at the party chairperson's Gulshan office in the city. "We think all the agreements like TIFA with the United States, transit facilities to India and the anti-terrorism taskforce are inter-woven," he said. Such taskforce might give rise to foreign influence and violence in the country, Delwar contended. He criticised the government saying that it had been talking of forming the taskforce keeping people in the dark and did not ask for their opinions. "It seems like they are doing this out of a sense of paying back debt to someone," Delwar said. "We've come to know that the taskforce is being formed following international suggestion." Delwar urged the government to not move to form the taskforce and yet, he asked it to publish the draft of the taskforce. He spoke of his party's stand against terrorism and militancy, and said the BNP-led coalition government had tackled these threats and Islamist leaders 'Bangla Bhai' and Shaikh Abdur Rahman were brought to book. It is possible to combat militancy with the military and law-enforcing agencies; there is no need for a regional taskforce, Delwar observed. "Sri Lanka did not need a regional taskforce to deal with its internal terrorism," he pointed out. bdnew
