 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Bank governor has called for easy terms and low interest for credit facilities to women entrepreneurs. "Women entrepreuners must be integrated into the mainstream of growth by extending credit facilities to them at low interest rates and easy terms," Salehuddin Ahmed told the opening session of a workshop on women in the SME sector. The central bank and the SME Foundation jointly organised the workshop at the Bangladesh Bank Training Academy at Mirpur in the city on Monday. The governor said, "A central bank study shows loans disbursed to small and medium enterprises hardly see defaulters whereas many big borrowers turn out to be big defaulters." "The SME loans have been effectively utilised and recovery rate is also sound." The central bank chief said SMEs were playing a significant role in the country's economy. Earlier in the week, the industries minister had said priority was being given to develop the SME sector. Vibrant SMEs could cushion the long-term economic impact of the worldwide recession, Dilip Barua had said. He said priority was being given to develop small and medium enterprises as part of a comprehensive industrial policy. bdnews
