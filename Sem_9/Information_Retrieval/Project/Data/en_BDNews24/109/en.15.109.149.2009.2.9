 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has sought Indian cooperation in forming a regional anti-terror taskforce as proposed by Bangladesh, and preventing terrorist activities in the region, her press secretary said on Monday. "The Indian foreign minister has said that there needed to be uniform initiatives to form the taskforce," Abul Kalam Azad told reporters quoting visiting Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in talks with the PM. Answering a query, Azad said there was no discussion on the structure of the proposed taskforce. Mukherjee, who stood in as Indian prime minister in absence of Manmohan Singh, met with Hasina at her official Hair Road residence Monday evening. Earlier in the day, he signed two deals to boost trade with Bangladesh but said the huge trade gap tilting heavily in India's favour could not be offset. He arrived Monday morning by a special flight, meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni, home minister Shahara Khatun before seeing the PM. He was scheduled to wrap up his trip with a dinner at the Indian high commission in Gulshan, and leave Dhaka around 9.30 pm. Azad quoted the PM as telling the Indian foreign that "all will have to work together to prevent terrorist activities, smuggling and entry of illegal arms in the region". The PM in the hour-long meeting, ending around 6pm, also vowed to eradicate poverty from the region. Hasina thanked the Indian government and its foreign minister for signing the bilateral trade and investment deals with Bangladesh. Highlighting the friendly relationship with India, she said Bangladesh wants to maintain friendly relations with neighbouring countries. Foreign minister Dipu Moni, state minister for foreign affairs Hasan Mahmood, state minister for home Tanjim Ahmed Sohel, and foreign secretary Touhid Hossain attended the meeting for Bangladesh. Pranab Mukherjee was accompanied by Indian external affairs secretary Shivshankar Menon, Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty and deputy high commissioner Mukta D Tomar. The PM's family members including her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, daughter Sayema Wazed Putul and son-in-law Khandker Mashrur Hossain also attended. bdnews24.co
