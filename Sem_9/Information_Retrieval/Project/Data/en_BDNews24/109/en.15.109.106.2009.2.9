<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Anticorruption Commission officials were not involved in political oppression during the state of emergency, and ACC laws do not allow the Commission to hold people in custody, said a top anti-graft official on Monday. Refuting allegations by a number of MPs that the Commission held politicians in custody under emergency rule, ACC director general Col Hanif Iqbal told reporters his colleagues had no involvement in such actions. "A national coordination committee on prevention of serious crime was constituted through the state's executive orders," Hanif told a regular press briefing. "A special anti-graft task force was a part of the committee, and did not operate under the Anticorruption Commission." "A Commission official was assigned to investigate into related allegations only," he explained. The ACC director general said, "But the Commission will certainly probe specific allegations against its officials, if there are any." The ACC on Feb 18 2007, published a list of 50 people including politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats and gave them 72 hours to submit their wealth statements. Former minister Mirza Abbas, Awami League leader Engr. Mosharraf Hossain, former BNP MP Hafiz Ibrahim, former power division secretary ANH Akhter Hossain and Dhaka City Corporation councillor M Abdul Quayum were detained while submitting accounts of their assets at the ACC's offices on Feb 25 2007. Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury took over as the new ACC chairman on that day. bdnew
