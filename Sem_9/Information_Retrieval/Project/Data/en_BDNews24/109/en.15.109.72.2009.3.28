 GAZA, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Hamas Islamists in the Gaza Strip on Saturday arrested three leaders from the rival Fatah faction of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Fatah officials said. The arrests could cloud a new round of Egyptian-brokered unity talks set to begin on April 1 aimed at reconciling the rival factions. Among those held was Abdel-Rahman Hamad, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority, who had been meeting fellow Fatah members in the city of Gaza, Fatah officials said. The Hamas-run Interior Ministry in the Gaza Strip said the Fatah men were detained for questioning after holding an "illegal factional meeting." Hamas Islamists seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 from forces loyal to Abbas, who later set up a new administration in the West Bank, where Fatah holds sway.
