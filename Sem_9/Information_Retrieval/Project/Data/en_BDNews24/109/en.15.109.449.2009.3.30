<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)A parliamentary body has asked the law secretary to clarify why fixtures of the special courts, set up by the past caretaker government within the Jatiya Sangsad complex, had still not been dismantled. "The committee has asked the law secretary to clarify why the fixtures are still taking up space within here," said Suranjit Sengupta, head of the parliamentary standing committee on law, after a meeting on Monday. The meeting decided to set a seven-day deadline for the Supreme Court Registrar to remove them, Suranjit told bdnews24.com. He said they were occupying space and obstructing activities now parliament was in session. "None has the right to obstruct the activities of the sovereign parliament," he said. "As the ministry of law established the courts, it must remove them". The past caretaker government, headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed, set up 10 special courts within the Jatiya Sangsad premises on May 6 2007, to try high-profile corruption suspects including the current prime minister Sheikh Hasina and leader of the opposition Khaleda Zia. The courts' activities within the parliament premises have been halted, but the fixtures of five special courts remain in rooms allocated to the chairmen of different parliamentary standing committees. The courts were supposed to be removed from the Jatiya Sangsad premises before the Dec 29 general elections. The caretaker government transferred five of the 10 to old Dhaka. The law ministry decided to shift the remaining courts to the five divisional headquarters. But the courts are yet to be moved. State minister for law Quamrul Islam, Rahmat Ali, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Fazle Rabbi Mian, Abdul Matin Khasru, Nurul Islam Sujan and Fazle Noor Taposh attended Monday's meeting.
