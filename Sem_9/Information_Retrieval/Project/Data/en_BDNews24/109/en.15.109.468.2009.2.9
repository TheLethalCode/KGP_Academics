<TITLE> New kilns could cut brickfield emissions </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, February 09 (bdnews24.com)  Energy efficient kilns could reduce the brick industry's fuel consumption and carbon emissions up to 60 percent, according to a model brick factory being piloted in Dhaka. Brick field owners, however, say the technology on offer is an expensive one. The United Nation Development Programme is piloting the model brick factory in Dhamrai Upazila, Dhaka, facilitating the technology and training. "No pollution is taking place, there is no visible smoke stack in this brick factory," UNDP country director Stefan Priesner told reporters who accompanied him to the site on Monday. "Our plan is to upscale the current pilot project." Upscaling through a global environmental project (GEP) UNDP hopes for other entrepreneurs to see the benefits of moving to the new technology, said Priesner. "As you know climate change is one of the key areas of support of UNDP. Bangladesh is one of the first victims of climate change." "Certainly, the priority is adaptation. But a country that gives priority to adaptation can make that a lot more credible if it also focuses on mitigation," he said. "That you do through reduction of emissions. We are here today to demonstrate how this can be done in this particular industry." Hans Faisal, adviser of the Bangladesh Brick Fields Association, however, told reporters: "The cost of this kind of brick kiln is 14-15 times higher than the traditional." "If you want to make profit from it, you have to produce 10-15 million bricks a year. However, where is the market? Our sales are local. It is a problem." "You would have to invest Tk 45-50 million," he added. Local MP Benzir Ahmed said the initiative could help the industry free itself from pollution and reduce fuel consumption. The estimated cost of the entire project would be about $25 million. The GEF will contribute only an incremental cost of $3 million and the remaining $22 million would be from co-financing sources. The project will be implemented by public-private partnership. There are over 4,000 brick factories across the country, with an annual production of about 12 billion bricks and a growth rate of more than 5 percent. The industry is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions in Bangladesh, producing over 3 million tonnes of CO2 per year and contributing to land degradation and deforestation. Estimates indicate that in Bangladesh it takes about 23 tonnes of coal to produce 100,000 bricks where as in China it takes just 8 tonnes. China produces bricks using kilns similar to the ones in the pilot project. bdn
