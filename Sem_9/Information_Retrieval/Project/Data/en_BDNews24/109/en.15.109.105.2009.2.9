 PARIS, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jean Makoun netted a double as Olympique Lyon tightened their grip on Ligue 1 with a 3-1 win at Nice while Girondins Bordeaux went down 1-0 at Olympique Marseille on Sunday. Lyon, with 46 points from 23 matches, are four points ahead of Bordeaux, who squandered the opportunity to keep a tight rein on the leaders in Sunday's late game at the Stade Velodrome.

The hosts were lucky to pull one back in first half added time when Apam netted from close range from a Chaouki Ben Saada corner kick. However, Lyon kept their composure in the second half as Nice, who had only lost once at home in Ligue 1 this season, gradually lost their temper - and had two players sent off. Midfielder Julien Sable was the first go, shown a straight red card for a violent tackle on Ederson just before the hour. Brazilian striker Adeilson, who came on as a 69th-minute substitute for his first Ligue 1 game, also received a straight red card six minutes from time for slapping Jean-Alain Boumsong in the face. Lyon had a penalty after Ospina fouled Ederson but the Nice keeper parried Benzema's attempt. Makoun headed home 10 minutes from time to wrap up the wi
