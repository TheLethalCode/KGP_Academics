 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The United States will help Bangladesh to hold war crimes trial, a senior government official said. "The US has assured Bangladesh of assistance in the trial of war criminals," the prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad told reporters after visiting US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs Richard Boucher met with Sheikh Hasina at her office Sunday. "The trial of war criminals is not a political issue, it's a demand of the citizens. Our parliament has taken a unanimous resolution on the issue," Azad quoted prime minister Hasina as telling Boucher. At the meeting, she sought US cooperation in making the country's democracy stable and the parliament effective. "Corruption will not be tolerated in any way. The Anticorruption Commission will be strengthened and the judiciary will be made free," Azad said, quoting Hasina. She urged the US government to continue with its investigation into corruption by some Bangladeshi citizens, he said. Observing that terrorists have no boundary, Hasina said her government's efforts to prevent terrorism and establish peace in the South Asia would be on. Bangladesh wants to contribute in the fight against terrorism in the South Asian region, and that's why the government has proposed formation of an anti-terrorism taskforce, she said. Hasina thanked Boucher for providing assistance to Rapid Action Battalion, police and Bangladesh Rifles to prevent terrorism. She told the senior US official her government was determined to safeguard human rights. She thanked the US government for expanding GSP facilities and urged it to allow Bangladesh-made ready-made garments tariff-free access to the US market. She said her government was also committed to ensuring freedom of speech and the media. "As a Muslim country", the prime minister invited US president Barack Obama to visit Bangladesh. Obama had announced to deliver speech to the Muslim world from the capital of a Muslim country to earn confidence of the Muslims. Replying to a query, Kalam said there was no discussion on trade and investment framework agreement (TIFA) between the two countries during the 80-minute meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, Boucher congratulated the premier on her alliance's victory in the Dec. 29 general elections and conveyed the message of former US president George W Bush. Welcoming Boucher to Bangladesh, Hasina praised the positive role the US had played in the Bangladesh's election. bdnews2
