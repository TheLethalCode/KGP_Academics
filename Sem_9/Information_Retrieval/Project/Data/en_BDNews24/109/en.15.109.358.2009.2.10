<TEXT>
 COLOMBO, Tue Feb 10,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tamil Tiger rebels gunned down 19 people fleeing Sri Lanka's war zone and the bodies were carried among the more than 1,000 civilians who reported to army-held areas on Tuesday, the military said. The rate of people fleeing fighting between Sri Lanka's army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has picked up sharply in the past week, with the separatist rebels now confined to less than 175 square km (67 sq miles). The military said the flow of people streaming out was unabated despite a suicide blast it blamed on the LTTE which killed 29 civilians and soldiers and wounded 90 at a refugee registration centre on Monday. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said those who reached army-held areas had told authorities that the LTTE had shot at dozens of fleeing people. "A total of 1,057 civilians arrived today. The LTTE terrorists had fired on them, killing 19 and injuring 69 others," Nanayakkara said. He said those fleeing the fighting carried the bodies with them. The government, rights groups and aid agencies have accused the LTTE of forcing civilians to stay in the war zone. The Tigers could not be reached for comment, because most communication to the war zone has been cut off. The pro-rebel web site www.TamilNet.com on Tuesday again accused the military of shelling civilian areas, including a military-demarcated no-fire zone, killing at least 36 and wounding 76. The military denies striking that area or targeting civilians
