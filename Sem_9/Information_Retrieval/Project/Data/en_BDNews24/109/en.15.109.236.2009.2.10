<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said Monday the government's proposal for a South Asian anti-terror taskforce was a plot to allow the Indian forces free access into Bangladesh territory. "The government has come to power with a 'special mission' and within a month of its rule, they have moved to sacrifice the country's sovereignty in the name of transit to India," the BNP leader said. "The people of Bangladesh will not accept this suicidal decision." Khan was addressing a reception for newly-elected BNP-backed Upazila chairmen, vice chairmen and vice chairwomen in Dinajpur. He called for a nationwide movement to press home BNP's demand for Special Security Force protection to be restored for party chairperson and opposition leader Khaleda Zia. bdnews2
