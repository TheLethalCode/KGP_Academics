<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The US would assist Bangladesh in securing its unprotected maritime boundary if Dhaka desired, US assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs Richard Boucher said on Sunday. "I think there is some interest in maritime patrol so that you can protect your sea areas better," Boucher told journalists at the Zia International Airport prior to leaving for India. "We can help their (border security agencies) activities but the modalities will depend on what Bangladesh wants," he said at the end of a two-day visit. The senior US official, who left Dhaka, supported the proposed South Asian Regional Task Force on Terrorism and efforts to curb corruption in the region. He said Washington had cooperation with many governments in the region. He also said his country had cooperation with the military agencies of Bangladesh but ruled out a US military base here. "We are not looking at any base here. We have a lot of cooperation with different countries, different governments and agencies. "You have a number of different agencies involved in providing security for the people here. Some of those are civilian agencies like the police who we work with. "Some of those are military agencies. We have cooperation with them on things like maritime security and any areas we have opportunities," said Boucher who met prime minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni and home minister Shahara Khatun. Two US generals had come to Bangladesh before Boucher's visit. Bangladesh has maritime disputes with both Myanmar and India. The anti-US military regime in Myanmar on Nov. 3 last year tried to set up rigs in the Bay of Bengal to extract oil and gas from Bangladesh's claimed area defying Dhaka's diplomatic and military protests. Both the countries mobilised forces along the border as all diplomatic efforts failed to defuse tension in the Bay. Boucher said the South Asian countries should cooperate with each other to eliminate terrorism. He said whoever carried out Mumbai attack should be investigated and the countries of the region should cooperate with each other so that this kind of horrible attacks did not take place in future.
