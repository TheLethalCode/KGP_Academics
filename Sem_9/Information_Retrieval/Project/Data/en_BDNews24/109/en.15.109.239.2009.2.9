 ROME, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brazil are cursing Italians after being deprived of two of their forwards for Tuesday's friendly against Italy in London (1945 GMT). While the world champions are spoilt for choice for strikers, Brazil are counting the cost of Kaka's injury playing for AC Milan and the refusal of Juventus to allow Amauri to go on international duty. Kaka suffered a foot injury in Milan's 1-1 home draw with Reggina on Saturday and is out of the game at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium along with next Sunday's derby against Inter Milan.

Luca Toni and Alberto Gilardino are likely to be in contention for a starting berth as the lone frontman. Villarreal's Giuseppe Rossi is hoping for another chance on the right of a three-pronged attack ahead of March's World Cup qualifier in Montenegro and April's home game with Ireland. Given Brazil's problems in attack, Milan's Alexandre Pato could get another chance. The 19-year-old burst onto the international scene when he scored after only 12 minutes of his debut against Sweden at the same stadium last March. However, he has been a disappointment for Brazil since. His Milan team mate Ronaldinho was recalled to the Brazil squad for this game but the playmaker has failed to impress in Serie A of lat
