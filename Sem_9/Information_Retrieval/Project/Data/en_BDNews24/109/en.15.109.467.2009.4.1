 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com) Faisal Hossain Dickens struck an unbeaten fifty to guide Mohammedan Sporting Club to a four-wicket win over Gazi Tank in a super league encounter of the Premier Division Cricket League on Wednesday. Mohammedan reached 224-6 in 48.2 overs after restricting Gazi Tank to 221 in 49.54 overs at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Mohammedan were reduced to 36-2 inside nine overs before Shamsur Rahman Shuvo and Farhad Hossain rescued the side putting on 48 runs for the third wicket. Both Mintu (28) and Nasiruddin (36) were dismissed by left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Jr, causing a middle-order slump with Mohammedan wobbling at 101-5 in 22.1 overs. Faisal Hossain Dickens and captain Suhrawardi Shuvo provided resistance to take Mohammedan home, adding 72 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket. Dickens' 52 run off 74 balls was studded with two sixes and as many fours while Shuvo made 32 not out that included one six and one four. Gazi Tank had earlier made a brilliant start with a swashbuckling knock from captain Mohammedan Ashraful, who smashed 78 off 84 balls featuring seven fours and one six. Opener Imrul Kayes (26) and one-down Anwar Hossain (30) laid the foundation from where Mohammad Ashraful propelled the side to a modest total. However, the dismissal of Ashraful saw Gazi Tank lose their way and were all out 221 with a ball to go as pace duo Sajidul Islam (3/32) and Dollar Mahmud (3/61) shared six wickets. bd
