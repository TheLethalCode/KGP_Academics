<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)Jamaat-e-Islami's assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak Tuesday urged political parties to stop maligning each other over the Peelkhana massacre. "Mudslinging in the name of probing BDR killings has to be stopped. We all should stay united and ensure that the perpetrators are punished," Razzak, a lawyer, said at a press briefing in his Naya Paltan chamber Tuesday. He said, the Supreme Court upheld Tuesday the High Court order granting him anticipatory bail in the Peelkhana carnage case up to April 5 and ordering the government not to harass or arrest me up to that date. "I never spoke to any BDR personnel or officer on February 25-26 or prior to or after the carnage. The CID did not ask me anything about that," said Razzak. "They did not show me any list of phone numbers either. Yet some newspapers have purposively raised questions of my involvement in the BDR killings by publishing baseless and false stories, which I've no knowledge of. He said the CID questioned him about his studies, phone numbers of his wife and self, family, bank accounts, whereabouts on Feb 25-26 mutiny, foreign travel. Asked why the CID did not ask him about Peelkhana killings, Razzak said, "I told the CID what whatever they wanted to know. Please go ask them why they [did not ask]." He said the CID can interrogate any citizen as a witness to any public incident. He cited the example of the British prime minister Tony Blair after the 9/11 disaster. "We have to unite on this issue today. If it's possible for cricket, why not for this crucial happenings? This involves the independence and sovereignty of the country!" He said it was 'mysterious' for the CID to question him while two cases involving embargo on his going abroad were on trial. b
