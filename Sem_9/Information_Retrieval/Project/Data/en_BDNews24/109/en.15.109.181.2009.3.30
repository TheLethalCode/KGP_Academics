 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)Only nine of 39 political parties have submitted election expense returns with the deadline for submission expiring on Tuesday, said an election official on Monday. "The major political parties, including Awami League, BNP, JP and Jamaat, have yet to submit returns," Farhad Khan, EC senior secretary, told bdnews24.com. Article 44 of RPO states all political parties contesting in national polls elections shall submit their expense returns within 90 days of the election date. The EC posted letters on Jan 27 to all parties asking them to submit their returns within the deadline. Khan said that the non-complying parties would be sent one more month's notice after the Mar 31 deadline. "After that they will be fined Tk 10,000 and have just 15 days to submit or face cancellation of party registration in line with electoral law," warned Khan. bdnews
