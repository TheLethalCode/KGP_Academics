 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)Authorities were forced to close Dhaka Medical College indefinitely and a Bangladesh Chhatra League leader was left dead on Tuesday after overnight clashes between two factions of the pro-Awami League student body. The two BCL factions fought at Fazle Rabbi Hall, leaving no fewer than two dozen injured, DMC principal Dr Kazi Deen Mohammad told bdnews24.com. The violence had left general secretary of college's BCL unit, Abul Kalam Asad Rajib, critically injured. He succumbed to his injuries in hospital later in the day. At least fifteen other students were admitted to hospital, the college head said. The college's scheduled examinations have been postponed and students were told to leave halls of residence by 4pm to prevent further violence on the campus. "The reason behind the violence was not clear," the principal said. The DMC academic council at a rushed meeting in the morning decided to postpone all MBBS classes and exams. The postgraduate exams, however, would be held as scheduled, Deen Mohammad said. The foreign students may remain in the halls, he added. BCL leader left dead Rajib's cousin Shabhan Haider told bdnews24.com that the BCL leader had died at around 6.30pm at Dhaka Combined Military Hospital. "His father and brother are here. We are all here with the body," he said. Rajib had undergone surgery several times and was kept under intensive care from morning. Maksudur Rahman, resident of Fazle Rabbi Hall told reporters that Rajib had lain unconscious for nearly three hours after being dropped from the third floor before being admitted to DMCH. He was later shifted to CMH. The BCL faction led by Rajib alleged that the outsiders carried out the attack, but regular students said the Chhatra League factions led Rajib and Bidyut Barua had been involved in clashes for weeks over control of the campus . Authorities have formed a three-member committee with professor Muhiuddin Ahmed as the head to investigate the incident. The other members are Dr Abdul Al Mamun and Dr Mohamad Belal Alam. The committee has 10 working days to report the finds, the DMC principal said. Additional police have been deployed on the campus. bdnews24.com/lh
