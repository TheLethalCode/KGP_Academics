 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh vice-captain Mashrafee Bin Mortaza leaves Dhaka for Kolkata on Thursday to join Indian Premier League side the Kolkata Knights Riders. The second edition of the IPL will get underway from April 18 in South Africa and the Kolkata Knights Riders are expected to leave India on April 4. Prior to his departure, the Bangladesh pace spearhead expressed concern over his mother's health. Mashrafee was dramatically sold for $ 600,000 (nearly Tk 4.2 crore) in the Indian Premier League auction to Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders in early February. Despite a back pain, the 25-year-old cricketer led Abahani in the Dhaka Premier League and took the Dhanmondi-based outfit near to the hat-trick title. With two matches in hand, it is almost certain Abahani will finish top of the 12-team league. Mashrafee is the first Bangladeshi pacer, who will play in IPL after left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak played for Bangalore Royal Challengers last year. Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful will also play for Mumbai Indians this season, but his schedule is yet to be finalised. bd
