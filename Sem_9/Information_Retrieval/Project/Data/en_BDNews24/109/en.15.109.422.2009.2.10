<TITLE> Security tops agenda for Holbrooke in Pakistan </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, Tue Feb 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's under-pressure civilian leaders sought on Tuesday to reassure the new US special envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan on a range of security issues tied to growing Islamist militancy. Richard Holbrooke's priorities are turning the tide against a Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, crushing al Qaeda and making sure neither country is again used as a base for followers of Osama bin Laden's global jihad. Holbrooke, is best known for his role in negotiating an end to the war in the former Yugoslavia more than 15 years ago, but is a relative novice in terms of South Asia. On Tuesday, he met Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and was later due to meet Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. He was expected to also meet President Asif Ali Zardari and army chief General Ashfaq Kayani among others before leaving on Thursday. Known for his bulldozing style, the veteran diplomat is expected to stake out US interests, but listen carefully to the differing viewpoints as he goes from Islamabad to Kabul, and finally to India. "I am here to listen and learn the ground realities of this critically important country," Holbrooke said upon arriving late on Monday. The United States wants priority given to its security concerns, and needs Pakistan on side to support a U.S.-led surge in troops in Afghanistan. But Pakistan, Afghanistan and India have their own set of concerns. Tension arising from an attack by Pakistani militants on the Indian city of Mumbai in November, when 179 people were killed, has magnified the neighbours chronic lack of trust. And Pakistan has let the United States know that any confrontation with India will force it to drop fighting the war on terrorism down its list of priorities. Islamabad believes that the $11 billion it has received from the United States for joining the war on terrorism is poor reward given the insecurity it has suffered as a result. Not only have the militants destabilised almost the whole of North West Frontier Province, inflicting heavy casualties on the army, but rival India has gained influence in Kabul at its expense. MULTIPLE FEARS Pakistan has multiple fears, perhaps the greatest of all being whether the Muslim nation created just over 60 years ago will hold together. Pakistan fears it could be torn apart by a combination of the Islamist insurgency, a secessionist movement in western Baluchistan province egged on by hostile neighbours, and a crashing economy. Security forces have lost control of the Swat valley, just 130 km (80 miles) northwest of the capital, and Islamist fighters have established Taliban style rule and laws, blown up girls schools and threatened to kill lawyers and judges. Chaos in a nuclear weapons state under siege from within by jihadi militants is the stuff of nightmares for the West. Afghanistan fears Pakistan secretly backs the Taliban in the hope of eventually regaining influence in Kabul, despite having publicly abandoned support for the Islamist militia in 2001. India fears Pakistani jihadis will launch more attacks on its cities, and there will be repeated scares of a war between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan has a long wish list ready for Holbrooke, but the new US administration has already signalled its intention to continue missile attacks by drone aircraft against militant targets on Pakistani soil. Pakistan also wants money and trade concessions to shore up its economy. It also wants military hardware like helicopters for counter-insurgency operations and US diplomatic support to persuade India to settle the dispute over Kashmir faster
