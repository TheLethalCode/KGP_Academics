 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com) - The Open Market Sale scheme to resume on April 1 in six divisional cities and five industrial towns can be operated "as long as needed", said the food secretary on Tuesday. "The amount which is stored in food godowns dictate that it may be kept going as long as needed," food secretary Mokhlesur Rahman told bdnews24.com. "However, it has been initially decided to keep the scheme on through Aprilthe interim period before the Boro harvest," he said. The government is initially running the schememeant to keep prices of the staple rice within the reach of commonersin the divisional hubs and the labour-intensive towns of Narayanganj, Narsingdhi, Gazipur, and Khalishpur in Khulna, said ministry officials. Savar would also be brought under the scheme later, they said. It depended on the OMS demand in the selected areas whether the scheme will be included in other parts of the country, they added. The food secretary said the government had recruited 790 dealers to run the scheme through April. "The programme has set an initial sale target of 43,000 metric tonnes of rice. However, it can be doubled or more if necessary," said Mokhlesur. "The government has adequate store of food crops," he added. Rice will sell at Tk 18. Each family can procure five kilos of rice a day, but only three days in a week, said food officals. The scheme will run six days a week. b
