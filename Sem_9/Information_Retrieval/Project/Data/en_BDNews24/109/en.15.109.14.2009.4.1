 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Association of International Recruiting Agencies said on Wednesday they had so far confirmed the cancellation of 45,894 Bangladeshi workers' visas by Kuala Lumpur last month. Of them some 18,041 had been waiting for flights on confirmation of their visas and tickets, said BAIRA president Golam Mostafa. Some 13,303 had submitted their documents for visas, 5,126 given their fingerprints and 9,424 had received approval but were awaiting final scrutiny, he added. The cancellation of the visas may be solved in coming months, though a just-concluded visit to Kuala Lampur brought "no direct result", said Mostafa. "The visa crisis will be solved. But it might take one month to one and a half months," he told a briefing after returning from Malaysia. A Dhaka delegation, led by the foreign minister and labour minister, went to Malaysia on Mar 25 after Kuala Lumpur cancelled the visas of Bangladeshi workers on Mar 11. "The visit was successful, but it did not bring any direct result," said Mostafa. The delegation had discussions with the Malaysian labour minister and home minister, he said. "They indicated that the Malaysian government will consider our matter after they secure some stability in economy and politics," said Mostafa. Replying to a query, Mostafa said the workers would get their money back if the visas remained cancelled. "But we are not concerned about that now. We are concentrating on sending the workers on to Malaysia," Mostafa said. Some 400,000 Bangladeshi workers are living and working in Malaysia at present, he said. b
