<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)On the eve of by-elections to six constituencies, the chief election commissioner says there is no scope for vote-rigging. "I don't see any sign of possible rigging in the elections, there is no such scope," said ATM Shamsul Huda Wednesday. "We're determined to make the elections free and fair," he told reporters after visiting five of six constituencies. The by-elections to six constituencies, vacated by MPs who won more than one seat in the Dec. 29 general elections, are set to be held in Bogra-6 and -7, Kishorganj-6, Kurigram-2, Rangpur-3 and -6. The elections chief predicted a comparatively low turnout compared to the Dec 29 general election. "Voters may be a bit reluctance to go to polling stations, as this is the third occasion after parliamentary and Upazila elections, within a relatively short period," he said. "Besides, farmers are busy with irrigation," said Huda. He again asked ministers and MPs not to visit election areas. The Election Commission will conduct the by-elections with its own officials, a first for any parliamentary election in Bangladesh. bdne
