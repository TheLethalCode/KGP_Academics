 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said a special police unit will be formed to fight militancy and terrorism. She said the government would also extend all possible support including financial allocation to form the special unit, as she formally launched this year's Police Week at her office Tuesday. The prime minister said curbing terrorism, militancy and religious fanaticism has now become a key issue in the existing regional and global context and the police can play a pivotal role to face the challenges. Bangladesh has to attach highest importance to this end so that the country can uphold a respectful place in the global community, she added. Hasina said the police had a social commitment to raise public awareness against terrorism, militancy, drug traffickers and their patrons. But she also asked the police to see to it they do not harass the innocent in their efforts to curb crime. Sheikh Hasina said the baseline of work of the police has to be curbing criminals but also protecting the innocent. Keeping this in mind, she said, the police force is there to serve the people, not be their master. Hasina said the new government, formed by a huge public mandate, has started its democratic journey, overcoming a long critical juncture of the country. The prime minister said her administration aimed to turn Bangladesh into a modern, developed and mid-income country by 2021 to reach the fruits of the independence war to the common men. Uninterrupted democracy, social stability and good governance are indispensable and the police can also help achieve that goal, she said. The must work neutrally and sincerely rising above all differences for the interest of the people, she said. The prime minister lauded the impartial role of the police, who worked with high professionalism and neutrality, she said, during the last general election and the Upazila polls. Hasina also said the Bangladesh Police was earning praise from all quarters for their tremendous role in strengthening law and order despite their limitations in manpower and materials. She called upon the police force to be more active and industrious to ensure security to life and property to the common people. Recalling the formation of Community Policing System during Awami League's previous 1996-2001 term, Hasina said her government wants to further consolidate this system for maintaining social peace and discipline. Pointing to a number of demands of the police, including professional problems, increasing man power, risk allowance, housing and training, the prime minister assured them of necessary steps. She issued a note of caution to provide exemplary punitive measures against those police personnel who will be involved in corruption, oppression and suppression derailing from their professionalism. Home minister Sahara Khatun, the cabinet secretary, home secretary, inspector general of police and other senior police officials also spoke on the occasion. bdn
