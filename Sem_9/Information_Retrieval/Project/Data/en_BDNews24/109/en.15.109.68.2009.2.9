 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Food minister Abdur Razzak has complained of massive irregularities and corruption in the running of the 100-day employment programme that began operating last year. "These cases of corruption have broken all past records," he told reporters at the ministry. "So far, Tk 200 crore has been spent on the programme and there has been widespread corruption involving local government bodies," said the minister. Razzak also said that Tk 800 crore allotted for the project remained unused. "The government is thinking about ways to best utilise the money," he said. He added that, if reports of corruption in the food ministry are published in papers with evidence, then immediate steps will be taken. The food minister also said that food for work, open market sale of rice, and vulnerable group programmes would be re-introduced soon. Over 5.6 million VGF cards were in the hands of the poor, the minister said. The present government proposed a 50 percent increase in their allotment, and approval was given for 25 percent, he said. On plans to counter food deficits, Abdur Razzak said, "If there is no natural disaster then we shall not have a deficit. But everything depends on production." He said the country has 10 lakh tonnes of food stores, ahead of the Boro harvest, to face possible natural disasters. "The government has thought about preserving potatoes in cold storage and the Japanese government has pledged $30 million for the construction of a warehouse to store food in the north of the country," the minister said. He also said private initiatives to construct cold storages need to be given low interest, easy condition loans. Talking about global food crises, the minister said that as global production has not been up to the mark, a crisis has taken shape and therefore assistance from WFP was required around the world. "Spain needed to take aid once upon a time but today she is a major donor for Bangladesh and this year Spain's aid to Africa and other countries will be around $200 million." bdnews24
