 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)The parliamentary probe body against former speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar will also investigate the corrupt practices of former chief whip and former deputy speaker, if necessary, its chairman said on Monday. Following the first meeting, its chairman Fazle Rabbi Mian said the probe body would carry out its investigation in an "unbiased" way. He said the investigation report could be complete by April 30 if all necessary documents could be procured in that time. "As per the terms of reference of the committee, we will probe corruption, if found, against the former chief whip or deputy speaker in course of our investigation," Fazle Rabbi Mia told journalists after the committee's first meeting at parliament building. Speaker Abdul Hamid, in the face of some MPs' demands, formed an 11-member committee to investigate whether his predecessor Sircar appointed employees in violation of the rules, wasted public funds or misused his authority as speaker. The committee was also authorised to investigate corruption of any other persons facing corruption allegations from any quarters. The chairman said corruption charges against the former chief whip Khandaker Delwar Hossain, now BNP secretary-general, who allegedly extorted money from the parliament's cafeteria, would be looked into if necessary. The committee will sit again on April 12 and 13 to review documents on appointments at the parliament secretariat and Sircar's withdrawal of Tk 40 lakh from the speaker's medical fund. "The committee will scrutinise the papers on medical allowances of the speaker," said Rabbi. "We have also summoned the officials of the public works department, which implemented grass planting and swan rearing projects. "Every record will be thoroughly examined," said Rabbi. Since 2003, the PWD under the office of deputy speaker has looked after the swan release programme to beautify the Jatiya Sangsad lake. Media has published reports in the past on corruption in the swan project. The committee chairman brushed aside BNP's allegation that the probe body was formed to influence the by-election in Bogra on April 2. "The committee will disclose if it finds Sircar guilty. We will also say if he is not guilty," said Awami League MP Shajahan Khan, a committee member. The other members of the all-party committee are: chief whip of the opposition Zainul Abdin Farroque (BNP), Mujibul Haq Chunnu (Jatiya Party), Mainuddin Khan Badal (Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal), and AL MPs Mozaharul Haq Prodhan, ASM Feroze, Shajahan Khan, Habibur Rahman, SK Baker, Abdul Mannan and ABM Anwarul Haq. The BNP has already made it clear that its representative will not join the meetings. "If he does not attend, we will assume that he and his party are not cooperating with the investigation," said the committee chairman.
