 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  The government will take measures public servants who confessed to corruption in exchange for clemency from the Truth and Accountability Commission, the law minister said Tuesday. "No corrupt government employees or officials will be allowed to remain in service," Shafiq Ahmed told reporters at the secretariat, citing the Government Servants (Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1975. "A committee to probe the charges will be formed and departmental measures will be taken against those who confessed to corruption to receive clemency from the Truth Commission." The commission awarded certificates of clemency to around 351 government employees in total after TAC hearings last year. The rules of the commission do not allow any legal measures against those who received clemency, said the minister. "But there are no rules against departmental measures. There is no legal bar to terminating their jobs," he said. The commission, formed under the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2007 and headed by justice Habibur Rahman Khan, began its five-month run on Aug 3 last year under the past caretaker regime. On Nov 13, the High Court ruled the voluntary disclosure law illegal and unconstitutional. But three days later, the Appellate Division stayed the ruling, allowing the Truth Commission to resume its work. The commission wound up its operations on Dec. 31, awarding clemency in a total of 451 out of 491 cases. bdn
