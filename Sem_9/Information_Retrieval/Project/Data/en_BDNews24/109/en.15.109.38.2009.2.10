<TITLE> Top booters to be out of action for 6 months </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Jan 10 (bdnews24.com)  The country's top level footballers will remain virtually out of action for six months this season as the 2009 BFF calendar has no domestic tournament or league for them from April to September. The top booters mean those who have been playing the ongoing professional football league but are apparently ineligible to play in the National Club championship and the National Championship, which comprises district teams. The newly-installed Super Cup will run from March 6-24 and the curtain-raiser of the next season will open with the Federation Cup in October, according to the calendar, which was revealed on Tuesday. The national team and Abahani Limited, however, will be engaged in international tournaments, the AFC Challenge Cup and AFC President's Cup respectively, in May that means the other top footballers will remain out of action until the season starts in October. Besides, the two-nation football series between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka is not likely to be staged in March as there was no room in BFF's calendar for the two-match home and away series. Sri Lanka are scheduled to play two-match series against Bangladesh after the completion of the Prime Minister Cup (May 4-14) in Nepal and Bangladesh are scheduled to go Sri Lanka after. "We were forced to drop the bilateral series because we will not be able to organise it in May due to the newly-installed Super Cup," said BFF member Anwarul Haq Helal. "Sri Lanka will also not be available after May as they will gear up for the AFC Challenge Cup in April." Helal, however, said they would try to host the series at a time when both teams would be available. According to the calendar, the BFF has kept November for hosting an international tournament, which might be comprised of clubs or countries depending on the available teams. "We will try to host the tournament featuring Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore in November before the SAFF Championship in December and I think it will be a good preparation for us before being engaged in the SAFF Championship. But it depends on the availability of the teams," said Helal. Women footballers, however, are seemingly getting more play as those who have been playing the national women's championship, will also play the national women's super championship, women's corporate league and divisional women's football champio
