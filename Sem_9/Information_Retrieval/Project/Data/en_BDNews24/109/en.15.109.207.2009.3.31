<TITLE> ADB sees economy grow lowest in 5 years </TITLE>

 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh's economy is expected to grow its lowest in five years and slow down in FY 2009 as the global financial meltdown will create pressures on exports, remittances and revenues, says the Asian Development Bank. The 'Asian Development Outlook 2009', the annual publication of the multilateral lending agency, reports that GDP growth would fall down to 5.6 percent in FY 09 from 6.2 percent in the current fiscal. The ADB report, released Tuesday, also projects a further decline in GDP growth to 5.2 percent in FY 10. ADB country director Paul J Heytens told a press briefing that Bangladesh was largely unaffected by the first phase of the global slowdown crisis due to its limited exposure to the international financial market system. He pointed toward returned migrant workers and a slowing number of workers leaving the country along with a drop in overseas shipments. Heytens warned the second-round effects would come through reduced export earnings and remittances. The report notes that a slowdown in remittance is inevitable as the global financial crisis is spreading beyond the credit markets to the real economy. ADB expects that remittance growth to fall to 20 percent after a rise of over 32 percent in FY 08. "In FY 2010, growth will further slip to 15 percent," the report reads. It also says government revenues have dropped in recent months and a "crisis-induced slowdown" on the private sector has fuelled it. The ADB study adds that the agreed cut in customs duties for the next budget and lower international commodity prices will weigh on import receipts. Meanwhile, the fall in commodity prices along with fuel price induced expectations of inflation to fall to 7 percent in the next fiscal year, much lower than the earlier projected 9 percent. "These factors should persist in the period ahead and the inflation rate is expected to fall further to 6.5 percent in FY 2010," Heytens said. The most critical challenge for the government , according to the official, would be to take steps to improve the annual development program (ADP) implementation. "It [the rate of ADP implementation] has been low in the recent years." He also said that the ADB was in the process to triple their resource base which meant more fund for development projects. Addressing climate change would be a top priority along with infrastructure, education and social sector for the ADB's Bangladesh chapter, said Zahid Hossain, senior economist at the ADB. The ADB report says the key challenges in tackling the effects of climate change are ensuring food and water security, protecting infrastructure and managing disaster risks. The donor agency has suggested incorporating climate change adaptation in development planning as climate changes may threaten the significant gains made in poverty reduction over the past 20 years. It recommends raising infrastructure investments and improve the enabling environment for private sector activity. It specifically suggests addressing power and gas shortages to boost growth prospects and steps to encourage private investments, both local and foreign. Identifying food security as a major development challenge, ADB says there is a need to raise farm output for affordable food prices and provide fiscally sustainable incentives to farmers. The report says that the improved crop harvest is expected to boost agricultural growth to 4 percent from 3.6 percent in FY 08 and to 4.1 percent in FY 10.
