 LONDON, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur unveiled revised plans for their new stadium on Wednesday which now include a hotel and public spaces built alongside it. The new ground, to be built almost exactly on the site where White Hart Lane now stands, will have a capacity of 58,000, the club said in a statement. It will include a dedicated space for community events, such as street markets, performers, an ice rink or educational activities and a second smaller, quieter space. The development now also includes a hotel, which "will provide a further economic boost for the area," the club said. The plans will be shown to the public between April 2 and 7. Club chairman Daniel Levy said: "Too often new stadiums are surrounded by empty, dead space and we did not want that in Tottenham. Insteadwe have embraced the opportunity to create something truly special for local people. "In respect of the stadium, we have been urging our architects to push the boundaries on technical design aspects in order to create a tighter bowl and an unbeatable match-day atmosphere." The club also said that spectators would be closer to the pitch than at any other comparable stadium. Spurs have played at White Hart Lane since 1899, but the new stadium will instead be known by the name of whichever sponsor eventually buys the naming rights
