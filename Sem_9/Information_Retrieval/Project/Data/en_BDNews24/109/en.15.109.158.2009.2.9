 PARIS, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - St Etienne defender Mouhamadou Dabo has been called up to the France squad to face Argentina in a friendly on Wednesday (2000 GMT) in Marseille, the French federation (FFF) said on Monday. France coach Raymond Domenech called up Olympique Lyon defender Jean-Alain Boumsong on Sunday after Arsenal's Gael Clichy and Sevilla's Julien Escude pulled out. The FFF did not elaborate on Escude and Clichy's withdrawals. However, Clichy clashed heads with Tottenham's Darren Bent as both went for a header and left the field with blood pouring from his head in a Premier League goalless draw at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said the injury was not too serious, but he would need stitches. Revised squad: Goalkeepers: Steve Mandanda (Olympique Marseille), Hugo Lloris (Olympique Lyon), Cedric Carrasso (Toulouse). Defenders: Eric Abidal (Barcelona), William Gallas (Arsenal), Philippe Mexes (AS Roma), Bacary Sagna (Arsenal), Mouhamadou Dabo (St Etienne), Rod Fanni (Stade Rennes), Sebastien Squillaci (Sevilla), Jean-Alain Boumsong (Olympique Lyon). Midfielders: Jeremy Toulalan (Olympique Lyon), Alou Diarra (Girondins Bordeaux), Lassana Diarra (Real Madrid), Samir Nasri (Arsenal), Yoann Gourcuff (Girondins Bordeaux) Forwards: Thierry Henry (Barcelona), Karim Benzema (Olympique Lyon), Franck Ribery (Bayern Munich), Nicolas Anelka (Chelsea), Jimmy Briand (Stade Rennes)
