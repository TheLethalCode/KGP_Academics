<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee landed in Dhaka Monday for a tightly scheduled daylong visit that includes signing of two trade deals and talks on "the entire gamut" of bilateral ties just a month into Sheikh Hasina's new administration. Mukherjee's plane touched down around 10.30am. After a press briefing at the airport, he went straight to the Padma State Guest House for a meeting with foreign minister Dipu Moni that began at 11.30am. "Allow me at the outset to convey warm greetings and congratulations to the people of Bangladesh for the successful conduct of a free, fair and peaceful election," Mukherjee told reporters at the airport. "I hope to cover ... the entire gamut of our relations including security, connectivity, trade and investment and other important areas," he said of his visit. "We'll also be signing the agreements relating to bilateral trade and investment promotion to further strengthen the framework for investors of both countries." The Indian foreign minister will sit with home minister Sahara Khatun before meeting prime minister Sheikh Hasina in the afternoon. Mukherjee is also expected to unveil the foundation plaque of a new theatre and music department at Dhaka Univesity's arts faculty. He will wrap up his 11-hour trip by attending a dinner at the Indian High Commission in Gulshan before departing Dhaka around 9pm. Hasina's cabinet gave clearance last week for signing two trade and economic deals with India. A new agreement on mutual investment promotion and protection will give the most favoured nation (MFN) status to each country. The other will be a renewal of an old deal, originally signed in 1980, which includes a clause dealing with water, rail and road transit. India has for long enjoyed water transport facility through the Bangladesh territory, but the part on road and rail transit has never been activated. bdnews24.c
