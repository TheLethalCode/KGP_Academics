 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  The government has promised immediate, effective measures to safeguard the interests of the textiles sector. Textiles minister Abdul Latif Biswas launched the Sixth Dhaka International Textiles and Garments Machinery Exposition 2009 Sunday at the Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre Sunday. "In the backdrop of global economic recession, we've asked the sectoral components to draw up a prioritised list of 'must' issues to be addressed immediately to achieve an overall facelift in the textile sector," said Biswas. "We have promised to implement their recommendations and findings within a week of receiving the same. The sector's components were asked to forward their proposals keeping the nation's interests above all other considerations and taking care not to stifle or choke their peers." Abdul Hye Sarker, president, Bangladesh Textiles Mills Association, told bdnews24.com, "We've just finished discussion with the different sectoral components. We'll forward the recommendations to the ministry by Sunday (today)." About the fair, Hye said, "Starting with the industrialists, everyone concerned will be benefited from this fair. A wide range of textiles and garment machinery put on display here will afford both entrepreneurs and handlers an understanding of what tools they might look for to survive in the competitive and successful world today." Jointly organised by BTMA and Malaysia-based concern Event Management, the four-day exhibition will be open from 12 noon to 8pm through Wednesday. Outside Bangladesh, about 300 participants from 30 countries including China, Belgium, France, Germany, India, Pakistan, Italy, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan have joined the expo. b
