 Chittagong, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong court has ordered former chairman of Khagrachhari hill district council, Manindralal Tripura, to jail in a murder case. Judge Shafiqul Karim of Chittagong Speedy Trial Court also ordered another accused Mrinal Chakma to jail on Monday, canceling bail orders of both Mrinal and Monindra. Monindralal was picked up from Dhaka on Oct. 31 last year following the statements of four other accused linking him to the July 2008 murder of Khagrachhari hill district council member, Anupam Tripura. A Khagrachhari court granted Monindra bail on Nov. 16. He was suspended from his post after being accused in the case. Khagrachhari hill district council member Ruithi Karbari is now acting as chairman. Public prosecutor Mohammad Aiyub Khan said the court has determined Apr. 5 for the next hearing to frame charges in the case. The other accused in the case, already detained in Khagrachhari District Jail, are Parendralal Tripura, Shantipriyo Chakma, Mosharraf Hossain Arif, Kolnath Baishnav, Humayun Kabir and Md Awal Gazi. Police pressed charges against the eight accused on Feb. 22 with Khagrachhari Judges Court. The case was later transferred to the Chittagong Speedy Trial Court. bdnews2
