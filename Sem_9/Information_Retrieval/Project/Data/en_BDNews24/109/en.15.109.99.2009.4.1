 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com) - Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has revealed a list of 448 people who confessed to corruption before the Truth and Accountability Commission last year in exchange for clemency. Hasina gave the names in parliament Wednesday in reply to a scheduled question by Muhibur Rahman Manik MP. The law minister said the day before that government would take measures against public servants who had confessed to graft. 'No corrupt official to remain in public service' "No corrupt government employees or officials will be allowed to remain in public service," Shafiq Ahmed said on Tuesday. "A committee to probe the charges will be formed and departmental measures will be taken against those who confessed to corruption in exchange for clemency," said the minister. The commission awarded certificates of clemency to 448 people after TAC hearings last year, 351 of them being government employees. The rules of the commission do not allow any legal measures against those who received clemency, said the minister. "But there are no rules against departmental measures. There is no legal bar to terminating their jobs," he said. The commission, formed under the Voluntary Information Disclosure Ordinance 2007 and headed by justice Habibur Rahman Khan, began its five-month run on Aug 3 last year under the past caretaker regime. The commission wound up its operations on Dec. 31 after hearing 491 pleas for clemency. >>Click here to see names of graft confessors bdn
