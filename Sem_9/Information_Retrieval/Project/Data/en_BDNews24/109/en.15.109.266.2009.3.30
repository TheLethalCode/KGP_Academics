 JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spin bowling all-rounder Roelof van der Merwe has been added to South Africa's squad for the first two one-day internationals against Australia. Van der Merwe, 24, impressed in the Twenty20 victory over the tourists at Centurion on Sunday, top-scoring with 48 off 30 balls and taking one for 30 in his four overs. Selection convenor Mike Procter, in a statement released by Cricket South Africa on Monday, said Van der Merwe would enter into consideration for the one-dayers in Durban on Friday and Centurion on Sunday if all-rounder Jacques Kallis is not fit. Kallis suffered a grade one tear of his groin on the final day of the third test against Australia in Cape Town on March 22 and was initially expected to be out of action for 10 days to two weeks. "Roelof as an all-rounder provides us with cover for Jacques Kallis, who is recovering from a groin injury. Jacques' fitness will be assessed by our medical team when the squad assembles in Durban," Procter said
