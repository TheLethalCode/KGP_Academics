 Gazipur, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) - At least 12 people were injured as workers of a garment factory clashed with police in Gazipur on Sunday. Workers and police said the clashes erupted as the ready-made garment factory, La Belle Apparels, was distributing piece-rate payment among the workers. The workers alleged that they were being given less than the actual rate. "Police fired rubber bullets when a group of workers tried to loot the cash of the factory," said officer-in-charge of Joydevpur police station Abdur Rashid. One rubber-bullet shot worker, knitting machinist Naimul, was sent to Gazipur Sadar Hospital and later transferred to Dhaka Pangu Hospital. At one stage, they locked horns with on-duty law enforcers. A sub-inspector of Joydevpur police station, Sajib Dutt, fired rubber-bullets at the workers injuring Naimul. "The workers retaliated by pelting brickbats to police, injuring the SI," said Rashid. bdnews24.com
