<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)Opposition Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami chief Matiur Rahman Nizami has offered the help of religious leaders in the fight against militancy, saying the attempt to label madrasas as miltant hives was regretful. "If the government takes Islamic parties and clerics into confidence in the fight against militancy, we'll give all support to the effort," the Jamaat chief said Wednesday. "Islam does not support militancy, but attempts to label madrasas as the source of militancy are regretful," he said. Nizami also expressed concerned over the violent politics of the ruling Awami League-backed student body Bangladesh Chhatra League. "The government has totally failed to control the factional clashes of its student front at different public universities and colleges," he said a day after a BCL leader was killed in violence that caused Dhaka Medical College to shut indefinitely. On the occasion of Jamaat's public relations month, Nizami said the current country situation was a "transitional period" and called on all Islamic bodies to unite. He also said having failed to prevent the BDR mutiny, the government was trying to divert the flow to cover up its failure. The CID's questioning of a Jamaat leader, assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak, in the BDR mutiny case had made this clear, Nizami added. bd
