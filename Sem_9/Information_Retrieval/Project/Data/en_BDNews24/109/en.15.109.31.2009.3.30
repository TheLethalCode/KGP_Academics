<TITLE> CID grilling was to smear me: Razzak </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)  Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Abdur Razzak has alleged that the CID summoned him to taint his political image. CID investigators quizzed him Monday for three and a half hours from 10am Monday in the BDR mutiny case at their headquarters. "They summoned me to tarnish my political image. I don't have any connection with the BDR carnage," the Jamaat leader told reporters after emerging from the CID headquarters. He said he was in the High Court on Feb 25, the day the BDR mutiny erupted. On whether the CID charged him for his suspected links to the mutiny, he said: "The question does not arise." Unconfirmed reports say he had spoken to some BDR members on Feb 25 morning. On whether the CID interrogated him, Razzak replied in the negative. "CID questioned me in accordance with the High Court directives," he said. As a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court, he was shown due respect during the interview, Razzak said. "They had asked me about my education, family and overseas travel. They also asked me where I was on Feb 25 and 26." "They wanted to see my passport but did not seize it," he said. On his being barred from going abroad, he said: "It is illogical and illegal. I was stopped twice in the airport to harass me. I had appealed to the High Court for that. But the government did not comply with the order." On Mar 7, the Zia International Airport immigration police barred him from going abroad. The High Court on Mar 8 ordered the government not to bar him from leaving the country, but on Mar 18 he and his wife were again barred at the airport. Summons, but 'no arrest' "I am here because they summoned me," was all Razzak had to say to the crowd of reporters gathered at the entrance, before he entered the CID headquarters Monday morning. A CID official told bdnews24.com that he was taken to the second floor of the five-storey building to be questioned by investigation officer in the case, Abdul Qahar Akhand. Qahar sent a letter of summons to the Jamaat leader Saturday asking him to appear in his office Monday for questioning. Razzak, saying the summons was sent to "harrass" him, had filed a petition Sunday challenging its legality and seeking a stay on it. The High Court, on hearing the petition, granted Razzak anticipatory bail in the proceedings up to Apr 5 and ordered the government not to harass or arrest him up to that date. But the order allowed him to be questioned, the court said. The Jamaat leader told reporters after Sunday's order: "I was summoned for questioning by the CID as harassment." Razzak said he had filed a contempt of court case against the government and airport police after he was barred from flying out of the country despite previous High Court orders telling the government not to prevent his going abroad. "I was sent the summons for questioning immediately after I filed the contempt charge," said the barrister. bdnew
