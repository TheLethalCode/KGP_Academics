 Abdur Rahim Harmachi bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)The government will build over 200 'eco-villages' across the country to provide homes and livelihoods for some 10,650 families who have been hit by climate-related disasters. An ECNEC meeting chaired by prime minister Sheikh Hasina approved the project Tuesday. Acting planning secretary Habib Ullah Majumder briefed the press after the meeting. The land ministry is expected to implement the Tk 187.29 crore 'Climate Victims Rehabilitation Project' by June 2012. The Japan Debt Cancellation Fund will fund the project, which will follow the principle of the Guchchogram Project 1972 that was targeted at displaced familes. The eco-villages will be built on khas or government-owned lands. The project papers say the new homes will be allotted among families made landless and homeless due to river-erosion, floods, cyclone and other environmental disasters, by deed of agreement. The deed of agreement will be issued in both husband's and wife's names to ensure women's rights. Under the project, rehabilitated families will also get access to education, pure drinking water, health and sanitation services. All family members will come under the coverage of micro credit and training programmes on how they to boost their income. The Guchchogram Project, initiated by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's government, rehabilitated some 1,470 families on khas lands in the greater Noakhali district. These families had originally lost homes due to river erosion in Laksmipur district. ECNEC also approved two more projects on Tuesday, one of which was a Tk 54 crore project for diesel-run generators to pump more water in the capital. The other was Tk 50 crore project to strengthen the prison department. bdne
