<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com) - Some 67 former employees of the Dhaka Sheraton, sacked during the two-year caretaker government's tenure, have sought government intervention in getting back their jobs. A representative team of the sacked staff on Sunday claimed that managing director of Bangladesh Services Limited, air commodore (retd) Lutfor Rahman and Sheraton's manager Trevor McDonald were behind their unjust removal. The allegations were articulated at a press conference at the National Press Club in the city, where the hotel's former receptionist Monjur Rashid, supervisor Ahsanullah, and house keeping supervisor Afzalur Rahman were among those who spoke. They alleged the officials were either forced to sign resignation letters or sacked directly, without any compensation package. bdnews2
