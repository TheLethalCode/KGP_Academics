<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 08 (bdnews24.com) Army chief Gen Moeen U Ahmed and military spy outfit DGFI came under heavy fire on Sunday from yet another MP who demanded a parliamentary probe into allegations of torture brought by fellow politicians. "Following in the footsteps of Pakistan's ISI (Inter Services Intelligence), the DGFI created an information wing through which it controlled the TV stations and other news organisations," Workers Party's Rashed Khan Menon told parliament. "Through its political wing, DGFI tried to control politics; tried to form (new) political parties; tried to form a king's party; sought to create division within political parties in the name of reform," Menon said. "Has Bangladesh been turned into Pakistan?" Menon did not spare Gen Moeen. "The army chief wrote in his book that the people wanted to see the army in power. The army took over with a civilian faade. Their real face was exposed a few days later. "That it was an army-controlled government has never been disputed by anyone. "We have seen poor people suffer. We have seen prices of commodities soar. They wanted us to change our food habit. (Former BNP finance minister) Saifur Rahman told us to eat cabbages. And the army chief wanted us to eat potatoes," Menon said. He said the DGFI tortured Abdul Jalil, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim, Obaidul Quader and M K Alamgir in its custody. Speaking in parliament last week, Jalil and Alamgir both alleged torture in the DGFI custody. They later appeared on TV talk shows to charge the spy agency with mistreatment of politicians. Alamgir was particularly scathing about the agency, and even named senior army officers who were allegedly involved. "We must form a parliamentary committee and take action against DGFI now," Menon told deputy speaker retired colonel Shawkat Ali, who was in the chair when the MP spoke. "They carried out activities against politics in the guise of an anti-corruption drive," he said. "We don't want to keep validating such activities in future on the ground of the 'doctrine of necessity'. Parliament will decide how the country will be run," Menon said, referring to the law minister's recent remarks. Shafiq Ahmed said Thursday the so-called doctrine of necessity would force parliament to validate the military-installed government's actions. Menon said he backed the minister, but for one last time. Home minister Shahara Khatun, Ruhul Amin Hawlader, Mostofa Jalal Mohiuddin, Nazrul Islam Babu, Golam Moula Roni, K M Khalid, Sadhan Chandra Majumder and Moazzem Hossain Ratan also spoke on the president's speech. bdne
