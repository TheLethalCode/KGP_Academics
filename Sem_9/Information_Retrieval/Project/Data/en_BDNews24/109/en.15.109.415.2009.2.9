 KINGSTON, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies have dropped batsman Xavier Marshall for Friday's second test against England in Antigua and drafted in Lendl Simmons. Marshall, who had a poor tour of New Zealand, made a second ball duck in the first test win over England at Sabina Park . Simmons earns his call-up, for potentially his first test appearance, after scoring 282 for West Indies A against England in a tour match in St. Kitts before the first test. The 24-year-old nephew of former West Indies test batsman Phil Simmons, is likely to go straight into Marshall's slot at number four. All-rounder Ryan Hinds, a left-arm spinner and middle-order batsman from Barbados who has played in 10 tests, is recalled to the squad in place of injured batsman Dale Richards. The 13-man squad also includes fast bowler Lionel Baker, the first test player from Montserrat, who did not play in the innings and 23 run victory in Jamaica. West Indies: Chris Gayle (captain), Devon Smith, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Lendl Simmons, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Brendan Nash, Ryan Hinds, Denesh Ramdin, Jerome Taylor, Sulieman Benn, Daren Powell, Fidel Edwards, Lionel Bake
