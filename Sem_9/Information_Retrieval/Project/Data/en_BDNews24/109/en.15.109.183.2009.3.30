 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)Power crisis now poses the biggest challenge for Bangladesh, says the finance minister as his efforts to prepare a balanced budget for 2009-10 are constrained by dwindling aid, exports, remittance and tax revenue. "The export sector will have to be given financial assistances due to the global recession," AMA Muhith said during meeting with economic journalists Monday. "The spending on safety net and subsidies will also be up significantly." Said the minister of his new budget challenges: "The coverage of social safety network will be expanded, initiatives will be taken to create more jobs and the government employees will be given salaries under new pay-scale," The Pay Commission report, due soon, will raise civil servants' pay and perks substantially. In the face of the acute power crisis, he said, the power sector will get the top priority in the coming budget. "I thought we'd be able to overcome the (power) crisis in three years, but now I think that's not possible. It needs more time," the minister said. "Electric poles have been lining up, but no electricity has been added to the grid in the last seven years," said Muhith. Global meltdown aside, the minister said, the ruling Awami League's polls pledges would also dictate his budget terms. Agriculture, railways, public works and human development are going to get special importance, Muhith said. Muhith must finalise his budget plans by the end of May and be ready for the parliamentary speech in the first-half of June. "I've already said that the coming year is going to be very difficult for our economy. Slim growth in remittance and exports will strain our efforts," the minister said. The minister said he still expected the economy to grow at 6 percent, down from the targetted 6.5 in 2008-9. He was, however, hoping for an increased foreign assistance. The economy was on right track in the first six months (Jul-Dec) of the current fiscal, Muhith said, but then the global economic downturn began casting its spell on exports and revenue. Revenue from import duty dipped with the drop of prices of all kinds of products including fuel and food. The size of the current 2008-09 budget is Tk 99962 crore. "This is why the current budget may be revised down to Tk 95000 crore or Tk 96000 crore and the Tk 25600 crore ADP slashed by 10 percent," he said. On the proposed black money scheme, the minister did not give a direct answer. "The decision time is yet to come. There will be more discussions before a final decision is made." In line with the recession taskforce recommendations, the minister said, Tk 243 crore in cash export incentives was released Monday. More money will be doled out to the exporters soon, Muhith said.
