<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com) - High Court on Monday ordered the government and telecoms regulator to explain why the cancellation of private television channel CSB's broadcast and frequency licence should not be declared illegal. A two-judge bench of justices Syed Mahmud Hossain and Kamrul Islam Siddiqui asked the information secretary and Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission chairman to reply to the rule nisi within four weeks. The court issued the rule following a writ petition filed by Focus Multimedia Company's managing director Fazlul Quader Chowdhury, son of BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Fazlul filed the writ petition with the High Court after the government's decision to cancel CSB's broadcast and frequency licence on Sept. 6 2007. At the hearing, Barrister Omar Sadat said the outgoing caretaker government cancelled the channel's licence after its live broadcast of Dhaka University's campus violence in August 2007 and Sheikh Hasina's arrest earlier the same year. He said the telecoms regulator cancelled the licence, without issuing any show-cause notice, although the commission has not such authority. Barrister Sadat, mentioning the licence was cancelled on the ground of a fake no objection certificate submitted by the channel on Oct. 17, 2006, said the NOC was not fake. He said a fresh NOC was submitted on Oct. 19, as the Oct. 17 one had "some errors". After the hearing, Barrister Sadat was asked about the reasons behind the petition so long after the shutdown of broadcasting. He said it had not been possible to appeal during the caretaker government's tenure. bdnews
