 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The ruling Awami League's Central Working Committee at a meeting on Tuesday warned against self-satisfaction or indulgence over the victories in the general and local government elections. The vote of thanks officially drawn at the ALCWC meeting and meant for the AL and grand alliance workers mentioned: "There's no scope or space for. It has only enhanced the responsibilities manifold." The Central Working Committee met in the morning through felicitating people on their voting the party to a thumping victory in the national polls in December. Simultaneously, the meeting felicitated elderly AL leader Zillur Rahman on his contesting the presidential polls unopposed. Presided over by party president Sheikh Hasina, the first-ever meeting of the ALCWC after the polls began at 10am to last through 11:30am, when a half-hour recess was announced. After the meeting, at 1:30pm, party spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam at a press conference briefed reporters on the meeting highlights. He said, in the first session of the meeting, Zillur was given a crest and bouquets on behalf of the party. At that time, AL presidium members Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury, Amir Hossain Amu, Abdur Razzak, Tofail Ahmed, Suranjit Sengupta, Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim and other central leaders spoke and congratulated Zillur. "To begin with, the meeting congratulated veteran Awami League leader Zillur Rahman as he is set to take the oath as the president of the republic on February 12," Ashraful told reporters during the break. "In its long 60 years of existence, the Awami League for the first time has congratulated a president today (Tuesday). "During the crucial days following the emergency rule proclamation, when the caretaker government suspended all politics with an iron fist, Zillur Rahman shepherded the party most ably and confidently. "We hope he will discharge his presidential duties gracefully and skillfully, maintaining a perfectly neutral stance. Zillur Rahman will continue to guide us in the future." "[Party president] Sheikh Hasina said, 'we could never dream of such grand victories in the elections countrywide if our party was not in one piece'. The AL president called upon all present to work together and implement our election manifesto," Ashraful added. Decisions on celebrating and observing various historic days, such as independence architect Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's 's birth anniversary on March 17, Independence Day on March 26, Mujibnagar Day on April 17 have been finalised, said Ashraful. Asked when the conference of the AL's central committee would be held, he said, "The future meetings of the Central Working Committee will discuss specified subject matters as per circulars issued earlier. One of those meetings will decide about the conference date." On whether the party programmes and the government ones would be run separately, Ashraful said, "The party and the government should complement each other, as necessary. But the two entities will be self-propelled." "It is always the political party from where everybody will be elected. People have witnessed what depoliticisation means during the past years," he said in an indirect reference to the military-installed caretaker government's 'political reforms' that had drawn howls of protests from the AL and other major parties. The AL spokesperson said the expulsions at the party's district chapters over the irregularities at the Upazila polls had been done in contradiction of the party constitution. The meeting also thanked the security agencies, Election Commission and civil servants engaged in the polls duties across the country. The Central Working Committee thanked the freedom fighters and the Sector Commanders' Forum on the occasion. Ashraful said Hasina too was felicitated in the morning session. Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, said, "The prime minister herself was overwhelmed with emotion while congratulating the president-designate Zillur Rahman this morning." "With tears brimming her eyes, Hasina offered flowers to Zillur Rahman as most of the Central Working Committee members were felicitating the senior AL leader on the occasion." badnew
