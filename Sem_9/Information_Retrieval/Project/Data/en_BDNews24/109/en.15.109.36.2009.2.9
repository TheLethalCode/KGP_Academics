<TITLE> Shocked England ponder pressure, reliance on Pietersen </TITLE>

 KINGSTON, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - England's humiliating first test defeat to West Indies has raised the question of whether the team can handle pressure and particularly if they can cope when top batsman Kevin Pietersen fails. West Indies won the series opener on Saturday by an innings and 23 runs after England were skittled for just 51 in their second innings, their third lowest total in all tests. Captain Andrew Strauss and interim coach Andy Flower have dismissed any suggestion that last month's row between their predecessors, Pietersen and Peter Moores, which led to the former resigning and the coach being sacked, had any impact on the dismal display. Flower, talking to reporters on Sunday, when England should have still been batting rather than having a day off, rejected talk of the team being 'rudderless' with no permanent head coach and was dismissive suggestions of disunity in the camp. But the former Zimbabwe test player, who formally is still England's assistant coach, conceded that the dispute along with other distractions, such as the huge contracts being offered by Twenty20 cricket, may have had a cumulative effect. "There might be an element of truth in that but in the end sportsmen have to deal with the challenge we're given and we have been given the challenge of a four-Test tour in West Indies. "We failed the test in the first test but there are three tests left and we can do something about it," he said. What exactly they can do about it is much harder to answer however. Dealing with pressure is something cricketers learn over time and it should not suddenly depart them, and that is surely the most worrying aspect of England's capitulation. "I don't think we handled pressure very well," said Flower, "It was a great spell of bowling on a wearing pitch, they exploited that very well and probably better than we did at any time. The bottom line is that the players have to take responsibility for not handling the pressure. SHOCKING START "It's a very individual thing, how you handle pressure. They have all responded under pressure before but yesterday none of them did. I could go through a list of when they have done it at different times," he said. England batted reasonably to make 318 in the first innings but were heavily reliant on Pietersen's 97 with the supporting role of Andrew Flintoff and Matt Prior. When Pietersen was dismissed on Saturday, beaten by a dream delivery from five-wicket Jerome Taylor, England collapsed and there are some who fear that when the South-African born batsman fails, England might fear they will fail too. "I'd hope that isn't the case," said Flower who noted that batsmen such as Ian Bell and Strauss have had plenty of success at test level. The reaction of the West Indies players to the dismissal of Pietersen though indicated more than just delight at removing a potential threat, they clearly felt that with the number four gone, England were wobbling - and they were proved right. England are ranked fifth in the world in tests while their opponents have just climbed up to seventh but looking at their batting line-ups, West Indies could make a strong claim to have more genuinely world class batsmen. Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan, who both made centuries in this test, along with the prolific Shivnarine Chanderpaul are three batsmen who could be considered for any team in the world. England have only Pietersen in that category and their ability to come back from this shocking start on the tour depends heavily on whether the likes of openers Strauss and Alastair Cook, Bell, or Owais Shah if he replaces him, can step up a level. Before England get too despondent they might care to remind themselves of what happened the last time they crumbled in the Caribbean. In 1994, in the third test at Port of Spain, Trinidad, England, captained by Michael Atherton, were skittled for just 46 in their second innings when Curtly Ambrose ran amok with six wickets. But in the next test in Barbados, England scored 355 and 394 to win by a margin of 208 runs. The coming challenge for England is in Antigua, starting on Friday, where the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground, has, in its short life, offered very flat batting tracks, the perfect conditions for a shell-shocked batting line-up to regain confidence and composure. But their opponents have seen England wilt under pressure and there is no better motivator in cricket than to know that a few quick wickets and can turn the heat on a team that on Saturday looked incapable of copin
