 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  BNP MP Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury has said the opposition, which had walked out of the parliament, wants to rejoin the ongoing maiden session. "We refrained from taking part in the session in protest against the seat rearrangements by the speaker. We are willing to go back to this session. "But before that, the speaker will have to give a clear decision on the reinstatement of our previous seat arrangements," the BNP leader told bdnews24.com. BNP and its allies has been boycotting the session after the new speaker rearranged the seats in proportion to the constituencies won by the parties in the Dec. 29 general elections.

Chowdhury also said the BNP's parliamentary party would meet at 4pm on Monday in the parliament room of the deputy leader of the opposition. Meanwhile, chief whip of parliament Abdus Shahid has welcomed the observation of the speaker. Shahid told bdnews24.com the opposition chief whip had met him on Monday morning and expressed the desire to come back to parliament on certain assurances. "I told him that I appreciated the promise made the speaker," he said. On Jan. 28, the speaker re-arranged the seats of the opposition and gave BNP 4 seats in the first, second and third rows. Earlier on Jan. 25, the opening day of the ninth parliament, departing speaker Jamiruddin Sircar gave nine seats out of ten to BNP in the opposition bench. bdnews24
