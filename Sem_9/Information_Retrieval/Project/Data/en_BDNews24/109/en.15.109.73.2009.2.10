 KATHMANDU, Tue Feb 10, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal authorities have deployed extra police across the capital and detained five people after a close aide to Nepal's Maoist prime minister was shot by unknown assailants outside his apartment, police said on Tuesday. "We have not been able to catch the culprit yet," Ramesh Shrestha, the Kathmandu police chief, told Reuters. Shakti Bahadur Basnet, Prime Minister Prachanda's personal secretary and a central committee member of the ruling Maoist party, was shot late on Monday as he was going home in a Kathmandu suburb, the prime minister's spokesman Om Sharma said. "He was rushed to the hospital with leg injuries and is out of danger," Sharma said. No one has claimed responsibility. Maoists blamed "elements" opposed to a two-year-old peace process for the attack. The Maoists waged a decade-long civil war from 1996 before entering the political mainstream under a 2006 peace deal. Prachanda was elected the impoverished Himalayan nation's prime minister after the former guerrilla group won the election for a constituent assembly in April last year. Several small armed groups are fighting for regional autonomy
