 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  The government has formed a six-member committee to retrieve 12 residential halls of Jagannath University from illegal occupants, officials said on Tuesday. The committee, to submit a report with recommendations to the education ministry within one month, was formed at an inter-ministerial meeting at the Secretariat with home, law and education secretaries, UGC officials and the university vice-chancellor Abu Hossain Siddique among those present. "We have had a successful meeting. We hope the halls will be recovered soon," Siddique told bdnews24.com on his return to the university. The VC also said he hoped to reopen the university shortly. Jagannath University students have held on-off protests and demonstrations over the past month to demand their halls back from the hold of 'local influentials'. Recent clashes with police led to indefinite closure of the university. Tuesday's meeting also decided that the home ministry would take measures to hand over two halls of the university, Abdur Rahman Hall and Tibet Hall, which are now under police occupation. Over 500 students, with faces covered in black cloths, staged a human-chain protest midday Tuesday in front of Bangladesh Bank's Sadarghat branch to press a charter of demands. Bakul Munshi, the convener of a student group leading the movement for the recovery of the residential halls, told bdnews24.com that they would continue with their demonstrations until the demands were met. They would announce their next move on Feb. 12 at a news conference, he said. bdnews24.com/c
