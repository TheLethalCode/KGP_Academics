Setton recalled specific lots of bulk roasted shelled pistachios and roasted unshelled pistachios in 2,000-pound, 1,800-pound, 1,700-pound and 1,000-pound bags sold to wholesale customers after learning that a small amount of shelled pistachios it sold in late 2008 tested positive for salmonella. Setton is also recalling its Setton Farms brand roasted salted shelled pistachios in 9-ounce bags with a "Best Before" date between January 6, 2010 and January 19, 2010, distributed in seven Southeastern states. Grocery chain Kroger Co recalled its Private Selection shelled pistachios on Friday due to potential salmonella contamination.
