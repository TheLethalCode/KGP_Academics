 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)Import duties on luxury products will be hiked in the new budget to safeguard local industry, the National Board of Revenue chairman said Wednesday. "The coming budget will be prepared considering the national interest in the face of global recession, putting aside all foreign suggestion," Muhammad Abdul Mazid said in a pre-budget discussion with chamber leaders in the capital. "There is no reason to panic, however. We're optimistic about fighting recession with concerted efforts." Chamber leaders stressed energy needs above all. Bangladesh Chamber of Industries president Shahedur Rahman said considering the power and gas crises, the government should lower the diesel and furnace oil cost. President of the Foreign Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Waliur Rahman, also said the government prioritise power and gas. International Chamber of Commerce, Bangladesh president Mahbubur Rahman said he did not back further chances for whitening of black money.
