 ANTANANARIVO, Feb 08 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Madagascar's opposition leader vowed on Sunday to continue protests against President Marc Ravalomanana a day after security forces killed at least 25 anti-government demonstrators. Heavily armed security forces patrolled the streets around the presidential palace where thousands of demonstrators clashed with riot police on Saturday. A senior police officer said up to 25 people were killed when security forces opened fire on protesters. The main hospital in Antananarivo, capital of the Indian Ocean island, was crowded with hundreds of injured supporters of opposition leader Andry Rajoelina, who was sacked as the capital's mayor five days ago. People filled the wards and corridors. "I condemn you Mr Ravalomanana. Was there a life in the palace to protect? Did the defense of these offices require the spilling of all this blood?" Rajoelina said in a statement aired on his private television station on Sunday. He said the fight would continue until the "final victory." Michelle Ratsivalaka, who the opposition named as the capital's mayor after Rajoelina sacking, said the bodies of those killed on Saturday would be taken to a gymnasium for a mass service. The government has appointed a caretaker administration at the city hall. Some 125 people have died in two weeks of civil unrest stoked by a power struggle between Ravalomanana and Rajoelina. The president blamed the opposition for Saturday's deaths and described the events as scandalous and intolerable. Ravalomanana, who founded his dairy empire selling yoghurt off the back of a bicycle, denies opposition accusations that he is a dictator. He called for a return to order while his government extended a nightly curfew in the capital for another week. Ravalomanana has presided over a period of sustained economic growth since he came to power in 2002, but critics say he has lost touch with the people and failed to tackle poverty. Rajoelina, a former DJ and a charismatic businessman, has filed a case with the two houses of parliament and the constitutional court to impeach Ravalomanana. The court has said it cannot rule on the matter. Madagascar's main foreign donors have suspended budgetary aid due to concerns over the management of funds. The head of the European Union delegation, Jean-Claude Boidin, has said the suspension is unrelated to the political crisis. Major foreign investors are targeting Madagascar's vast natural resources which include oil, nickel, cobalt, gold, uranium and ilmenite.
