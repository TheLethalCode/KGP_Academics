 NEW DELHI, Tue Mar 31,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India has little room for more fiscal measures to stimulate a slowing economy, but low inflation has created space for further monetary easing, a senior official of the Asian Development Bank said on Tuesday. In its outlook for 2009, the ADB forecast a slower 5 percent economic expansion for India in the fiscal year that starts from April, compared with an estimated 7.1 percent growth in 2008/09. "India has undertaken timely and decisive stimulus and this will arrest the decline in GDP growth," Bruno Carrasco, a director at ADB's South Asia department, told reporters. "Right now there is limited or no fiscal space for more stimulus," he said, adding the country needs to get back to fiscal consolidation path soon after an economic rebound. Since December, the government has slashed excise duties and service tax rates and pledged higher spending in 2008/09 and for next fiscal year to protect growth and jobs. Indian policy makers are now debating the need for more fiscal stimulus in the wake as global economy worsens. But they are also concerned over a widening of fiscal deficit estimated at 6 percent of GDP in 2008/09, that prompted the government to overshoot its borrowing target. Last week, the government said it plans to sell 2.41 trillion rupees of bonds, or two-third of the annual target, in the first half of next fiscal year. ADB expects the Indian economy to rebound and expand 6.5 percent in 2010/11, but said prolonged recessions at major industrial economies could hamper India's recovery. LOW INFLATION, MONETARY SPACE ADB also said inflation could average 3.5 percent in Asia's third largest economy in 2009/10. "We don't expect a deflation in India," Carrasco said, adding wholesale price inflation could slip to negative for a brief period. He said India's real interest rate, or the policy rates adjusted for inflation, are still high and the central bank has space for more monetary easing. "If Reserve Bank of India (RBI) feels that there is some degree of further stimulus possible through easing of the policy rates without undermining the inflation prospects and taking into consideration strong reserve positions and significant liquidity, then of course the RBI should consider it," he said. Since October, the RBI has aggressively cut its key lending rate or repo rate by 400 basis points in five steps to revive demand in a slowing economy. The next monetary policy review by the central bank is due Apri
