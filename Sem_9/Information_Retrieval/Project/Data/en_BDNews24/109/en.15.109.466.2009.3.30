The weather office has forecast more rain in few places of Punjab later this week, potentially delaying the harvest further. Punjab Agriculture Department officials said there were reports of flattening of wheat due to winds in many parts of the state but the losses would be insignificant. "The losses won't be higher as the crop has already matured. There may be delay in both mechanical and manual harvesting of the crop due to wet soil surface and higher moisture content in grains," said a farm department official in Ludhiana.
