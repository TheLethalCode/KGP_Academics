 ISLAMABAD, Mon Mar 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari lifted the central rule in the key province of Punjab on Monday, in an effort to mend fences with his main rival Nawaz Sharif. The end of central rule, known as governor rule, will pave the way for Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party, or PML-N, to reinstall its government in Punjab. Zardari plunged Pakistan into a political crisis a month ago by dismissing the government in Punjab following a Supreme Court ruling that barred Sharif and his brother from holding any elected offices. Sharif said Zardari was behind the ruling, but Zardari has made clear that he wants a reconciliation with the former prime minister. "Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani advised the president last night to lift governor rule in Punjab and formal notification was issued today," Ashfaq Gondal, a government spokesman, said. Pakistani stocks ended 2.76 percent higher as investors took heart from moves by the government to lower the political temperature. The market's optimism appeared to ignore a militant attack on a police training centre in Lahore on Monday. The latest brazen attack will heighten fears about mounting insecurity in nuclear-armed Pakistan. The one-year-old civilian government, led by Zardari's Pakistan's Peoples' Party (PPP), appeared shaky earlier this month as Sharif drove through Punjab at the head of mass protest that raised fears of a violent climax in Islamabad. The government placed barricades round the capital and put the army on alert as Sharif led a so-called "Long March" from the eastern city of Lahore. Fearful of instability in a nuclear-armed nation already under threat from al Qaeda and Taliban militants, Western governments and the Pakistan army persuaded Zardari to defuse the crisis by submitting to Sharif's demand for the reinstatement of a top judge. Having reluctantly restored Iftikhar Chaudhry as Supreme Court Chief Justice, Zardari said on Saturday he would let Sharif's party take power again in Pakistan's largest and most politically influential province. The government had already asked the Supreme Court to suspend its ruling about disqualification of Sharif brothers and then also review it. The court began an initial hearing into the case on Monday. Sharif's younger brother, Shahbaz, was the chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous and politically influential province before he was disqualified. Once the Supreme Court suspends its ruling the PML-N government will be reformed, with a temporary chief minister in place until Shahbaz Sharif is cleared to retake his old post. Zardari, widower of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, said his party could sit in opposition in Punjab but would not bring down Sharif's government in the prov
