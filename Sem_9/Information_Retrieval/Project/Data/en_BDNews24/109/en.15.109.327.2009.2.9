 MADRID, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The return of David Beckham and Fabio Capello to Spain for Wednesday's friendly international could be a reminder to the locals of what they have been missing since the pair left Real Madrid in the summer of 2007. Beckham, who turns 34 in May, has been in fine form during his loan spell at AC Milan and could equal Bobby Moore's record of 108 caps for an outfield player by playing some part against the European champions in Seville (2100 GMT). The midfielder, due to remain at Milan until next month before returning to Los Angeles Galaxy, has said he wants to stay on but the Major League Soccer club have rejected a first offer from the Italians. Capello was sacked after leading Real to the Primera Liga title but the Italian has overseen four England wins out of four in World Cup 2010 qualifying group six since taking charge in late 2007. "He is a very important player and I've watched him in one game in Milan and (deputies) Italo Galbiati and Franco Baldini saw his other games," Capello said of Beckham. "He is getting better and better with each game." Wednesday's match is the first between the two nations in Spain since a notorious encounter at the Bernabeu in Madrid in November 2004 that was marred by the racist abuse of some of England's black players. Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos apologised after large sections of the 55,000-strong crowd made monkey chants and FIFA fined the Spanish soccer federation (RFEF) 100,000 Swiss francs ($87,000). Spain coach Vicente del Bosque said he does not expect a repeat performance in Seville. "If we have to talk about a country where immigrants are well integrated then it's Spain," the former Real Madrid boss said at a news conference on Friday. REGULARS MISSING Del Bosque named Barcelona youngsters Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets in the national squad for the first time, part of a four-strong contingent from the Primera Liga leaders that also includes regulars Xavi and Andres Iniesta. Carles Puyol was a late withdrawal on Sunday after the Barcelona captain picked up a muscle problem in the Primera Liga leaders' 3-1 win over Sporting Gijon. Former Manchester United defender Pique, 22, could replace Puyol in central defence alongside Valencia's Raul Albiol and 20-year-old midfielder Busquets comes in for Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas, who damaged knee ligaments in December. Liverpool have five players in the squad, with in-form striker Fernando Torres selected alongside number two goalkeeper Pepe Reina, defender Alvaro Arbeloa and midfielders Xabi Alonso and Albert Riera. Capello is without several regulars, including injured midfielders Steven Gerrard and Joe Cole, and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney is recovering from a hamstring strain. Spain have won their last two matches against England 1-0, friendlies in Manchester in February 2007 and the 2004 encounter in the Spanish capital. The last England victory was the match before that, a friendly in Birmingham in February 2001 which they won 3-
