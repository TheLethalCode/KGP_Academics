 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  The government has taken a firm stand to prevent militancy and terrorism, the home minister said in parliament on Monday. "Police are giving top priority to prevent militancy and terrorism and a counter-terrorism cell has been formed," Sahara Khatun said. "Initiatives have also been taken to improve the quality of investigation into militancy- related cases through creation of an updated database," she said replying to a question of Comilla MP Md Tajul Islam. Four Islamist organisations have already been banned and such other organisations have been kept under strict surveillance by the country's intelligence and security agencies, the minister said. She said the government had directed Bangladesh Rifles and Bangladesh Coastguards to remain on guard so that "terrorists and militants cannot cross into the border to carry out their activities". The government is mulling over industrial, tourist and marine police to ensure security in industrial areas, tourist spots and coastal areas. Replying to a supplementary query, Sahara said the government had a plan to appoint one assistant superintendent of police to each Upazila or police station. In primary phase, ASPs will be posted as officer-in-charge at all metropolitan cities, district headquarters and some important police stations near Dhaka. In the rest of the Upazilas, Upazila police officer, equivalent to ASP, will be created. The plan will be executed through creating 358 positions of ASP by the year 2011, the minister said. Sahara said a committee had been formed to oversee the issue of cancellation of cases against Awami League and its associate organisations' leaders and activists, which were filed during the four-party alliance government. Measures will be taken immediately after getting report from the committee, she said. The government has formed a five-member committee headed by the law minister to review cases the BNP-led government had withdrawn, she added. The minister said the government had moved to form new committees cancelling and replacing community policing committees formed during the alliance government, as those were marred by partisan allegations. bdnews
