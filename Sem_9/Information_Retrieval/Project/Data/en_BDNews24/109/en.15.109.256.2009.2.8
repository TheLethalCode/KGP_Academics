 QUITO, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa ordered a US Embassy official expelled on Saturday after accusing him of interfering in the country's affairs, a move that will test ties with Washington. Correa, a leftist, has generally kept good relations with the United States as his socialist allies in Bolivia and Venezuela often clash with Washington over what they say is US "imperialism" in Latin America. "Foreign minister, give this gentleman 48 hours to pack up his suitcases and get out of the country," Correa said during his weekly media address. "We're not going to let anyone treat us as if we were a colony here." A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in Quito said the official already left Ecuador last month as part of a regular staff rotation. "We hope to continue cooperation with Ecuador," spokeswoman Marta Youth said. She did not comment on Correa's charges. Correa said US official Armando Astorga had abruptly ended a financing agreement with local police after authorities rejected his attempts to handpick officers he wanted to manage the US aid projects. "Mr. Astorga, keep your dirty money. We don't need it. We have dignity in this country," Correa said. "Ecuador doesn't need charity from anyone." The United States is Ecuador's main trading partner and the destination for much of its petroleum and banana exports. Correa, a US-trained economist who faces re-election in April, has bolstered his strong popularity in the past by taking a tough stance against what he deems to be interference from neighboring governments or multinational companies. There has been tension with Washington since Correa vowed not to renew a lease ending this year on a coastal air base used by US forces for counter-narcotics missions. Correa said on Saturday he would allow US Coast Guard planes to land there if needed, but only if Ecuador was allowed to approve of the pilots. The former college professor is known for his quick temper, ejecting a journalist from a live interview and ordering the arrests of people he charged had hurled insults or made offensive gestures at his presidential motorcade. Correa has been tough on foreign companies by repeatedly threatening to expel them over contractual disagreements or legal disputes. Last year, he kicked out Brazilian building firm Odebrecht and sent troops to seize its projects in Ecuador. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, a standard-bearer for anti-US sentiment, last year expelled the US ambassador to Caracas and Bolivian President Evo Morales kicked out the US envoy in September after accusing him of fanning civil unrest
