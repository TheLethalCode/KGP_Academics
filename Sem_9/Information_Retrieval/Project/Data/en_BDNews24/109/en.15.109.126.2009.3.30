<TITLE> Thaksin trying to provoke govt: Thai deputy PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Mon Mar 30, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Protesters laying siege to Thailand's seat of government are trying to provoke a violent incident to force negotiations with ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a deputy prime minister said on Monday. Suthep Thaugsuban said the government would "try not to fall into his trap" and avoid a fight with demonstrators who have surrounded Government House since Thursday in a bid to push Prime Minister Abhisit Vejajjiva from power. "The Thaksin camp is trying to incite people who listen to him to rise up. Their objective is to provoke clashes and violent incidents," Suthep told Reuters in an interview. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and lives in exile, used phone-in speeches to the red-shirted demonstrators at the weekend to step up attacks on the government and those he blamed for the coup. The former telecoms billionaire, who is believed to be living in Dubai, urged his supporters to stage rallies across the country to "bring back democracy". Police reported that small groups of protesters from the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), which is leading the rally at Government House in Bangkok, staged peaceful protests on Monday in central and northern parts of Thailand. Suthep said he believed Thaksin was trying to engineer a "May Incident", refering to the bloody May 1992 street clashes that forced then Prime Minister Suchinda Kraprayoon from power. "We will avoid creating conditions in their favour. We will exercise restraint as much as possible," Suthep said, although he warned police would arrest those who damaged government property. The prime minister's compound was occupied for three months last year by the anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), which also seized Bangkok's main airport for a week in a bid to force out the previous government, loyal to Thaksin. RECONCILIATION? No PAD leader has been charged in connection with the Government House or airport occupations. But 21 leaders of the group reported to police on Monday to hear charges of public disorder related to their street protest that paralysed parliament last October. They denied the charges. PAD leaders said on Monday the Abhisit government was too soft on Thaksin and his supporters, but they denied reports that their "yellow shirts" would take to the streets again. The PAD has denounced a draft national reconciliation bill proposed by the pro-Thaksin Puea Thai Party, a view echoed by Suthep, who said it would mean an amnesty for Thaksin, who was convicted on conflict of interest charges, and his allies banned from politics after the coup. "We have sufficient votes to stop the draft," said Suthep, who brokered the Democrat-led coalition last December. His own attempts to talk with Thaksin had been rebuffed. "I don't think Thaksin wants to negotiate. He would rather put pressure on us," he said. Abhisit and his ministers have avoided their offices at Government House during the protests, and economists are worried that the government is being distracted at a time when it should be focused on the economy. Suthep said the UDD campaign had not slowed the government roll-out of stimulus measures to offset a global slump that has hit Thailand's key export and tourist sectors. "The results will be tangible and evident in the coming months," Suthep said, promising the government would prop up commodity prices "to give rural folks more buying po
