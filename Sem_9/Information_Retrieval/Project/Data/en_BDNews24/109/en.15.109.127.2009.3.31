 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com) - At least six students were injured in a clash between two BCL factions of Dhaka University's Shamsunnahar Hall just after midnight Monday, over control of the hall, said residents. Dhaka University's proctor Saiful Islam Khan told bdnews24.com at around 1:15am that university authorities were yet to confirm how the clash was sparked. "We don't know who brought the hockey sticks into the hall," he said. Asked about the number of injured, he said, "It appears to me that one or two students may be taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital." The clash broke out at around 12:15am, as two factions of Chhatra League came at each other with hockey sticks, said the hall's residents. The hall's BCL unit organising secretary Sharna alleged: "A rival faction led by the hall's BCL unit general secretary attacked us." She said seven or eight students as well as a house tutor were injured. "They used hockey sticks to attack us." None of the other group, however, was available for comment. b
