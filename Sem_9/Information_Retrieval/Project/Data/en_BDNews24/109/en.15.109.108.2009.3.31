<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said work is progressing fast to set up a Probashi (Expatriate) Bank to give loans facilities for agency fees and other expenditures of overseas workers. Bangladeshi workers going abroad would be able to repay their loan through overseas earnings, avoiding financial risk on both sides, Hasina told a DCCI delegation led by its president Jafar Osman at her office on Tuesday. She called upon the chamber leaders to boost exports of rare and organic food items saying demands for such foods are increasing day by day. Sheikh Hasina said construction of Padma Bridge will be complete as soon as possible while steps will be made for dredging of rivers and water lands including Mongla port. The DCCI delegation apprised the prime minister about their needs and problems and put forward a number of recommendations to this end. They demanded their inclusion in the National Task Force to face the global economic recession. They also called for uninterrupted power supply to their industrial units and creation of more income generation and investment opportunities. The prime minister said her government will work toward a congenial atmosphere in the country for both foreign and local investors for overall development of the national economy. Hasina said the government would give equal priority to both public and private sectors in realising the country's huge possibilities. She sought cooperation of the business community for the government's efforts to secure economic emancipation of the people through an uninterrupted democratic process. bdn
