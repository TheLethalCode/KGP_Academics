 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh will return to five-year plans, as part of strategy to pursue longer-term developmental goals, instead of the present three-year Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), a high-level policy meeting decided Wednesday. "Reaching the developmental objectives is difficult in such a short period," AMA Muhith said of the soon-to-be-discarded PRSP. "From 2011, there will be no more PRSP," AMA Muhith told reporters emerging from the meeting at the planning ministry. "The second PRSP (2009-11) will be (officially) in effect until 2011, but it'll be thoroughly revised," he said, adding some work had already been done, and the review should be complete by May. "Without five-year plans (FYP), it's like navigating without radar. There are no goals. And without goals and vision, you cannot reach your destination." And not only five-year plans, the finance minister said, the government will prepare a "Vision for Development" until 2035. Two five-year plans will form the basis for all development work from 2011 to 2021, the year Bangladesh celebrates its 50 years of independence. The first five-year plan (1973-78) was followed, until 2002, by four more, with two two-year short-term plans in between. In July 2005, the BNP-led government launched the three-year strategy paper in line with recommendations from multilateral lenders and bilateral donors. Asked if doing away with the donor-prescribed PRSP would threaten much-needed aid into Bangladesh, the planning minister came up with an emphatic 'no'. "We have had discussions with all development partners. They have responded positively. "It is there in the constitution that we pursue our development goals according to a plan," A K Khandoker said. Those who also attended included Dr Mashiur Rahman, prime minister's adviser on economic affairs, and secretaries.
