 JERUSALEM, Mon Mar 30,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Monday to make every effort to achieve peace with Israel's neighbors and the Arab world, but again made no mention of Palestinian aspirations to statehood. "The government I am forming will do its utmost to achieve a just and lasting peace with all our neighbors and the Arab world in general," Netanyahu said in a speech to parliament, a day before his administration was to be sworn in. Israelis, Netanyahu said during a session marking the 30th anniversary of Israel's peace treaty with Egypt, "recognize genuine real peace when they see it," and the Jewish state would "answer the call" of any peace-seeking Arab leader. Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, has said he would negotiate with the Palestinians but wanted to focus on shoring up their economy rather than on territorial issues that have blocked progress in negotiations that are currently frozen. He has shied away from a direct commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, the main goal of U.S.-backed peace efforts. Palestinian officials have said peacemaking stood no chance without an explicit Israeli commitment to statehood. In parliament, Netanyahu listened without expression as outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert urged him to endorse clearly the creation of a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. "Two states for two peoples. There is no alternative. There is no trying to be clever about it," Olmert said, also calling on Netanyahu to follow-up on the previous government's indirect peace talks with Syria, Israel's northern neighbor. EUROPEAN CONCERNS Earlier in Prague, Israeli President Shimon Peres attempted to ease European concerns over Netanyahu's right-leaning government, noting that its guidelines included a pledge to respect all of Israel's international agreements -- a formula that includes accords envisaging a Palestinian state. "They ... say they are going to respect the previous government's commitment so I think that is a very reasonable and promising beginning," Peres, an architect of interim Palestinian self rule deals in the 1990s, told reporters. Netanyahu handed out cabinet posts in Jerusalem to Likud members, putting the finishing touches to a government dominated by right-wing and Orthodox Jewish factions, but which also includes the center-left Labor Party. It is due to be sworn in at a parliamentary session starting at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) Tuesday. The goal of Palestinian statehood was reaffirmed last week by U.S. President Barack Obama. Israeli political sources said Netanyahu was trying to arrange a meeting with Obama in early May in Washington. Peres's state visit to the Czech Republic, which holds the EU presidency, came a week after the country's deputy prime minister, Alexandr Vondra, said he expected "a bit of a rough start" with Netanyahu as Israel's leader. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, has cautioned that upgrading EU ties with Israel depended on the Netanyahu government's commitment to Palestinian statehood. International concern also has been raised by Netanyahu's appointment of Avigdor Lieberman as foreign minister. Lieberman, leader of the ultranationalist Yisrael Beitenu party, advocates trading parts of Israel where many of its 1.5 million Arab citizens live to a future Palestinian state in return for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. On paper, Netanyahu commands up to 69 seats -- 13 of them held by Labor -- in the 120-member parliament. The margin could be cut if Labor legislators opposed to its coalition deal with Likud vote with the opposi
