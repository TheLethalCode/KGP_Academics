 LONDON, Tue Mar 31, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - World Bank President Robert Zoellick announced a $50 billion global trade liquidity program on Tuesday and urged G20 leaders to support the effort to reverse a sharp drop in trade due to the global economic crisis. In a Newsmaker speech at Reuters ahead of the Group of 20 summit in London, Zoellick said the World Bank expects world trade volumes to fall by 6 percent this year, the largest decline in 80 years.

They should do this by endorsing a WTO monitoring system to prevent a further build up of trade restrictions even if the measures do not necessarily violate WTO rules, and should accept the "moral suasion" of public reviews that name and shame countries. "No one should want isolated infringements to become a pattern, eroding one of the most important bulwarks between this crisis and the 1930's," said Zoellick, the US's former trade representa
