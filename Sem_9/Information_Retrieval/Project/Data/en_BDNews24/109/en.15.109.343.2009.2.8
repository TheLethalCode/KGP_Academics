 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has warned the prosecution of the August 21 grenade attack case about their frequent time-extension appeals. Speedy Trial Tribunal-1 judge Mazder Hossain told chief pubic prosecutor Syed Rezaur Rahman that the trial proceedings in the case were to be finished within 135 working days. Ninety days have already gone with only one witness testifying, the judge said, adding; "If it continues, the trial proceedings will not end within the time." The prosecution promised to present the second witness in the next hearing on Feb. 12. Tareque Ahmed Siddique and Shoeb Ahmed Toriqullah were set to testify in the two cases  the murder case and the explosives case on Sunday. But they did not show up in the court. The earlier date was set on Feb 2, but as the prosecution failed to bring any witness that day, the judge set a fresh date. Some 14 accused in the case including former deputy minister Abdus Salam Pintu, Harkat-ul Jihad leader Mufti Abdul Hannan were taken to the court from jail on Feb. 2. The court finished the deposition of the first witness on Jan 27. The Criminal Investigation Department submitted two separate charge sheets accusing 22 people in the two cases following the Aug. 21 grenade attack on an Awami League rally on Bangabandhu Avenue in 2004. Some eight people remained fugitive in the case. b
