 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Holders Abahani Limited and runners-up Biman Bangladesh Airlines got off to winning start while Twenty20 champions Mohammedan Sporting Club stumbled in the opening day of the Premier Division Cricket League Sunday. Openers Rony Talukdar struck 116 and Tamim Iqbal smashed 98 as Abahani easily handed a 57-run defeat to newcomers Cricket Coaching School (CCS) at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Fifties from Jahurul Islam and Sanwar Hossain powered Biman to a convincing five-wicket win over star-studded promotees Gazi Tank Cricketers at Narayanganj Osmani Stadium. Mohammedan tied their opening match against Young Pegasus as both sides ended their innings at 192 all out at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. Abahani vs CCS Tamim and Rony gave Abahani, who finished fourth in the T20 tournament, a blistering start, putting on 203 runs for the opening stand before Tamim fell just two runs short of what would have been a deserved century. The left-handed opener, who missed the entire T20, struck eight fours and three sixes in his 118-ball knock before Elias Sunny had him caught by Nazmul Hossain. Rony soon holed out to Sharful Haq off Nazmul Hossain, but not before completing his century. The opener struck 116 off 124 balls studded with 11 fours and three sixes. Shahagir Hossain hammered a quick 45 off 26 balls including five fours and two sixes while Imran Ahmed hit a fine 26 off 27 balls to help Abahani post a huge 320 for four in 50 overs. CCS, in reply, also made a good start as openers Uttam Sarkar and Ilias Sunny put on 76 runs before Nadif Chowdhury broke the stand. Uttam slammed 58 off 61 balls while Muvogoto Mom hit 63, but their efforts were not enough to stage an upset. The newcomers finished 263 for seven in the stipulated 50 overs, with Rezaul Karim taking three for 47. Biman vs Gazi Tank Opting to bat first, Mohammad Ashraful's Gazi Tank made a moderate 235 for nine in 50 overs, thanks to half centuries from Imrul Kayes and Pravanjan Mullick. Opener M Mithun fell to Mahbubul Alam Robin for 19, but Imrul and Nafis Iqbal repaired the damage to take their side to 112 for two in 24.5 overs before Imrul was caught by Jahurul Islam off Robin for 51 off 72 balls that included nine fours. Jahurul ran Nafis out for 39 off 60 balls with a direct throw and Ashraful was trapped leg before by Shahadat Hossain for 19, leaving the side 154 for four in 34.3 overs. With the tail-enders falling in regular intervals, number five batsman Mullick stuck to one end to make 50 off 53 without scoring any boundary to help Gazi Tank go beyond the 200-mark. Biman, in reply, made a shaky start and were 48 for three inside 11 overs as openers Javed Omar (0), Nazmus Sadat (8) and Rahul Dev (8) returned cheaply. But, one-down Jahurul and Shakib Al Hasan steadied the innings and took Biman to 108 for four in 21.1 overs before Ashraful bowled Shakib for 44 off 36 balls. Jahurul then added another 48 runs for the fifth wicket with Sanwar Hossain before falling to Naeem Islam for 58 off 81 balls, featuring eight fours and one six. Sanwar paring with Mushfiqur Rahim put on 71 runs to propel Biman to 237 for five with 19 balls to spare. Sanwar struck an unbeaten 73 off 80 balls, hitting eight fours while Mushfiqur made 25 not out. MSC vs Young Pegasus Put in to bat first, Pegasus were 192 all out in 47.3 overs in the face of some tight bowling from spin duo Murad Khan (4/37) and Suhrawardi Shuvo (3/39), who together shared seven wickets. Opener Rahat Sadek topscored with 63, followed by his opening partner Arif Reza (31). Tail-ender Jubaer Ahmed chipped in with 34 to give their bowlers something to bowl at. Chasing a seemingly easy target, Mohammedan lost two wickets for 17 runs. Opener Shamsur Rahman and Marshal Ayub repaired the damage to take the team to 84 for three in 25.3 overs. Shamsur fell for 46 off 81 balls, triggering collapse in the middle. Mohammedan soon slipped to 95 for five, but Faisal Hossain and Suhrawardi rescued the side by adding 67 runs for the sixth wicket. Faisal departed for 36, prompting an unbelievable slump to 192 for nine in 49 overs. Needing just one run in the final over, Nobin Peiris dismissed last batsman Tareq Aziz in the second delivery to snatch an incredible point from Mohammedan
