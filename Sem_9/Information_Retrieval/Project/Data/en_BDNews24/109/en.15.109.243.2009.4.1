<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh may sign an agreement with Russia on installation of a nuclear power plant by this month if the ongoing negotiations end successfully, an official told bdnews24.com Wednesday. The talks that started Tuesday in Dhaka will have concluded Thursday, M M Neazuddin, joint secretary at the science ministry who is heading the Bangladesh team, said. Once the deal is signed, Bangladesh will ask for bid documents in a short time, he added. "We would discuss financial involvement on Thursday. We briefed them about our power situation, transmission capacity and work force," he said. A high-level team of Russian nuclear experts by Vladimir Averkiev, head of international co-operation of Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation, is currently in talks. Nikolay Poznyakov, head of external affairs of International relations department, is the other delegate. The ministry will make a final decision after consulting the prime minister, an official who wanted to remain unnamed said. "Before the final deal, we have to sign a bilateral treaty," the official, with direct knowledge of the matter, said. Bangladesh has the International Atomic Energy Agency's approval to set up a nuclear power plant, he added. "We already have fulfilled all the necessary condition. If necessary, they will provide us technical assistance." Bangladesh needed to review the power generation act, he said. Ministry sources said Russia was interested to provide loan, probably o easy terms, rather than grant. The Economic Relation Division will settle the conditions. Russia supplied 10 nuclear power plants last year and have supplied as many as 65 plants to Iran, India, China, Armenia, Ukraine, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Finland, Bulgaria and Germany. Currently it is constructing 11 power plants in countries.
