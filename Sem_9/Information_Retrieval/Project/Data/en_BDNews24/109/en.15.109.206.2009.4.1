 Dhaka, Apr 1 (bdnews24.com)  The government is thinking of bringing Kawmi madrasas under the education ministry, the law minister said following a workshop on a proposed anti-terrorism law on Wednesday. Shafiq Ahmed was replying to questions by reporters on what moves the government was taking over alleged militant activities originating from such madrasas, in the wake of last month's arms haul at a Bhola madrasa-cum-orphanage. "If Kawmi madrasas are brought under the education ministry they will get government facilities," said Shafiq in reply. He said the government was also considering a rethink of money laundering laws to curb funding of militant organisations. Shafiq also said: "If we go back to 1972 constitution there will not be any religion-based political organisations." The minister added that the 1972 constitution had been disrupted by the military rule of 1975. Shafiq had earlier told the workshop that "exclusion of secularism from the constitution" was the reason behind the rise of Islamist militancy in Bangladesh. He also said about 122 militant organisations were active in different parts of the country. The session's keynote presenter Asif Nazrul said the proposed Anti-Terrorism Act 2009 lacks provisions for review and if required, withdrawal. "Even TADA and POTA of India, now widely discredited as ineffective, were only temporary, emergency legal frameworks," said Nazrul who teaches law at Dhaka University. Supreme Court lawyer Shirin S Chaudhury said the existence of anti-terror law alone was not enough to root out terrorism. She said the law was a comprehensive legislation, however, as it addresses issues like terror-financing and cross-border terrorism. "It also identifies support for prohibited organisations as offence and gives power to the central bank to take steps to prevent and detect transaction meant for terrorism." Many good recommendations might come out from the workshops that might help the government in handling militancy, the law minister told the workshop organised by Bangladesh Enterprise Institute. Former caretaker government adviser ASM Shahjahan and BEI president Faruk Sobhan, among others, spoke. bdnew
