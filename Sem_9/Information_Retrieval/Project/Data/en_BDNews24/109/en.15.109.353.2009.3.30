 Dhaka, Mar 30 (bdnews24.com)Markets shrugged off a losing streak over three trading days to close higher Monday. Dhaka Stock Exchange's (DSE) general index fell 72 points on Sunday, the biggest single day drop in six weeks, and so did bank shares. Almost all the sectors saw a price hike Monday, though banks failed to recover, said brokerage house officials. "Prices started to fall in the opening hours. Buying in the midday helped the bourse to end up," an official of Latif Securities told bdnews24.com, asking not to be named. Market experts say investor confidence is at the lowest ebb on negative forecasts from the global economic recession. Former chief executive of DSE, Salahuddin Ahmed, told bdnews24.com that investors were wary of depressing economic forecast by the policymakers. "Banks, which account for 52 percent of the market capitalisation, are the most affected due to the trend," he added. Investors are not opting for banks despite good dividend declarations, said Ahmed, who teaches finance at the Dhaka University. The DSE general index opened the day with a fall followed by an upward curve from midday sessions. The DGEN or general index ended up by 25.98 points or 1.06 percent on 2476.81.
