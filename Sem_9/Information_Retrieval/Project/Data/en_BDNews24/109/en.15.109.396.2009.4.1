 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Hockey Federation general secretary Khondoker Jamiluddin smells a rat behind the skipping of the national camp by the hockey players. The hockey players skipped training for two sessions in the last two days, demanding immediate inter-club players' transfer, holding a promised reception for the players after their triumphant Asia Cup qualifiers as well as increasing their daily allowance. The players, however, returned to action on Tuesday afternoon under the supervision coach German Gerhard Peter Rach. "I am sure that someone or a specific group is instigating the other players, who know very well why we are not declaring the players' transfer and holding their reception," Jamil told reporters at his office Wednesday. Asked who was behind it, the BHF secretary said, "I don't want to mention as everyone knows who is prompting the players." Explaining reasons behind not to announce players' bourse, Jamil said that Premier League would be held in June instead of May as the national players would be busy in the Asia Cup Hockey in May. He also said that the league committee would decide whether the players' transfer takes place and the committee would sit on April 5. Jamail said that they were forced to postpone their planned reception on March 28 or 29 following the mutiny at the Bangladesh Rifles Headquarters and that they had earlier taken initiative, but could not hold due to unavailability of the players. He also said that the federation had no powers to increase the allowance as the Bangladesh Olympic Association deals with the matter. However, they would try to increase it after a board meeting. The BHF general secretary said that the national team would play a few practice matches in either India, Singapore or Germany before the Asia Cup, scheduled for May 9-16 in Malaysia. bd
