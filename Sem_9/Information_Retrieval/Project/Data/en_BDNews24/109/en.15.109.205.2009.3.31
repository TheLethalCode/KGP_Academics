 NEW DELHI, Tue Mar 31,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rahul Gandhi, scion of India's most powerful family dynasty and touted as a future prime minister, hit the campaign trail on Tuesday with a populist message to boost the Congress party's efforts to regain power. The 38-year-old Gandhi, whose father, grandmother and great grandfather were all prime ministers, is not the party's main candidate but he has become a key tool of Congress to win over youth as well as millions of poor villagers. In his first campaign speech for the April/May general election against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he criticised the opposition for focusing too much on economic growth and pro-market reforms. "If you go to a village and ask what 'India Shining' means, the villagers are unable to understand what it means," Gandhi told supporters in Maharashtra, referring to the slogan of the BJP's last 1998-2004 government. "This thinking is that of rich people. They fight for privatisation, they fight for the stock market but do not reach your homes." Gandhi's boyish appearance and his emphasis on tech-savvy blogging and texting may be crucial in a country where there will be 100 million first-time voters aged between 18 and 24. His youth also contrasts in an election where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is 76 and BJP leader L.K Advani is 81. For the next few weeks, he will be criss-crossing India in helicopter and plane to spots identified by election strategists as crucial in a vote that is difficult to predict. A CROWD PULLER While he is just general secretary of the Congress with responsibility for the youth wing, his face has adorned many election posters throughout the country and he is seen as one of the party's main crowd pullers. Over the last year, Gandhi has made well-publicised visits to poor villagers, often staying the night in farmers' homes under the glare of camera lights. The bachelor is also often a hit among college students. Critics say he is politically inexperienced and a member of an elite family, often compared with the Kennedys, that is disconnected from much of India. Gandhi's only major political achievement so far has been to try and modernise the youth wing of the party by introducing more transparent elections and bring in fresh faces to a political class dominated by elderly figures like Singh and Advani. "He is a proxy prime ministerial candidate," said pro-BJP political analyst Swapan Dasgupta. "He can say what he wants without being held accountable." The opposition says he would be incapable of leading this country of 1.1 billion, facing the massive challenges of an economic slowdown, a rising fiscal deficit and tension with neighbouring Pakistan over last year's Mumbai attacks. His mother Sonia Gandhi -- Congress party head and India's most powerful politician -- has made it clear that Manmohan Singh is Congress's prime ministerial candidate. But after the election, many Indians say Rahul Gandhi could be prime minister-in-waiting if Singh, who underwent heart surgery this year, has to step down. Others say he could first take a ministerial post, perhaps in education which has been one of his major political inter
