 BUCHAREST, April 1 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Fiorentina striker Adrian Mutu needs surgery on his injured knee and will miss Wednesday's World Cup qualifier against Austria, the Romanian soccer federation (FRF) said. "This morning  we found out that Adrian Mutu will not be able to play. After he returns to Florence, he will undergo surgery," the FRF said in a statement. However, Fiorentina were more cautious in their assertion. "He will come back to Florence tomorrow. On his arrival he will undergo tests with the club's medical staff and the condition of Adrian Mutu will then be announced officially," the Serie A side said in a statement. "Up to that point any rumours about the type of injury are without foundation." Mutu captained his country during Saturday's 3-2 home qualifying defeat by Serbia as regular captain Cristian Chivu was sidelined with a thigh injury. Romania are fifth in Group Seven with four points from four matches
