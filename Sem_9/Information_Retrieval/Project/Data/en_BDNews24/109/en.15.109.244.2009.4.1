 Dhaka, Mar 31 (bdnews24.com) - As frequent power cuts cause headaches for water authorities and millions of Dhaka residents, the government has said it will provide 200 diesel-run generators to boost the capital's water supply by another 15 crore litres a daybut not until next year. An ECNEC meeting, chaired by the prime minister, approved the Tk 54.16 crore project on Tuesday for Dhaka WASA to set up the generators by June 2010, said acting planning secretary Habib Ullah Majumdar. According to a project report presented at Tuesday's meeting, areas under WASA coverage currently have a demand of 225 crore (22.5 billion) litres of water a day. The water authority is able to supply 187 crore litres, leaving a shortfall of 38 crore litres a day With a growing urban population demand is projected to rise to 287 crore litres by 2010, with a shortfall of 100 crore litres a day if supply is not bolstered. Water supply was seriously hampered because of the power crisis, the report pointed out, adding that WASA runs 504 tube-wells, but has only 274 back-up generators. WASA's headache Summer 'load-shedding' months cause acute water shortages for millions of Dhaka residents every year. Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority has unreservedly blamed the power shortages for disruptions in water supply, as electric pumps draw water from the city's deep tube-wells. "There are seven to eight power cuts a day; how we can pull up water?" asks WASA managing director Raihanul Abedin. The government has already said it sees no immediate solution. The state minister for local government Jahangir Kabir Nanak met with WASA authorities earlier this month, but said despite all efforts the water crisis would remain this year. Of the 504 electric-run deep tube-wells, 233 have permanent alternate power generators to lift and purify waters with 41 more mobile generators for emergency. In the face of frequent power cuts, the agency has said it is setting up 10 more deep tube-wells this year and replacing older pumps in five deep tube-wells, which will draw another 5.60 crore litre water a day. Outburst feared over water crunch Dhaka's MPs have said they fear a violent public outburst if the government does not ease the severe water crisis in the capital, with the spectre of water and power crises deepening in the coming hot months. MPs from Dhaka-16, 15, 14, 12, 10, 6, 4 constituencies, led by local government minister Syed Ashraful Islam, met on Mar 11 to come up with emergency measures to address the water crisis. Raihanul Abedin, among others, also attended the meeting. The MPs put the crisis down to insufficient deep tube-wells, land crunch for new ones, rundown pumps and a lack of alternate power generators at the pumps. Ashraf said the government would issue executive orders directing MPs of the densely populated Dhaka metropolitan as well as Narayanganj constituencies to coordinate the services of utility agencies, including water, power. bd
