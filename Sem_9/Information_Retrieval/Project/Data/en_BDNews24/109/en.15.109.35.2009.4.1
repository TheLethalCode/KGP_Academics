Khan said people of every walk have demanded enactment of such a law to protect their rights. The new law, with similar content to the caretaker government's ordinance of the same name, sets up to 3 years in jail and fines of up to Tk 2 lakh for selling adulterated or fake products, tampering with measurements or overpricing. Failure to display price lists will cost one year behind bars, a fine of Tk 50,000 or both. The bill, passed by voice vote, also fixes the same penalty for cheating consumers through false advertising.

Post and telecommunications minister Raziuddin Ahmed Razu proposed the passage of the billalmost identical to the caretaker government's ordinance. Passage of the bill will ensure continuity of BTCL and the BSCCL which started operating during the interim period. Opposition MPs Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, Joynal Abdin, Mosharaf Hossain, AHM Hamidur Rahman Azad, Syeda Ashrafi Ashrafi Papiya had proposed some amendments to the bill urging the government not to pass it at this moment. They also proposed eliciting public opinion on the bill. But the proposals were rejected by voice vote. "The caretaker government had no authority to make the BTTB into companies.
