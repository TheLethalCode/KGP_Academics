 Dhaka, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com)  Local government and rural development minister Syed Ashraful Islam, venting resentment over "city corporation activities", said Sunday they must change their mode of operation. "The city corporations, which have been continuing with their usual activities for the last 7/8 years, must change," he said this while responding to a query in parliament on Sunday. Ashraful, promising quick elections to Dhaka City Corporation, said, "DCC has been riddles with corruption and irregularities." Referring to DCC's corruption and irregularities cited in a recent book by army chief Moeen U Ahmed, he said "I am at one with him." "But despite army's knowledge about corruption in DCC, no drive was launched there. All the mayors were arrested. But the DCC mayor has remained untouched. It is extremely pitiful." The minister said DCC had not carried out its duty to exterminate mosquitoes on time. "Unfortunately, for the time being, it will not be possible to launch any extermination programme against mosquitoes until the mayor and commissioners are elected anew," he said. bdnews
