<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 9 (bdnews24.com)  Indian external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee on Monday signed two deals to boost trade with Bangladesh but said the huge trade gap tilting heavily in India's favour could not be offset. Following talks with Mukherjee, foreign minister Dipu Moni assured New Delhi that its territory must not be used against India. Both ministers said they discussed the formation of the proposed South Asian taskforce to combat terrorism and religious extremism. They also explored possibilities to connect Bangladesh with India in more ways. 'Today we also signed two agreements, one on bilateral trade and the other on bilateral trade promotion and protection. These will further strengthen the framework on trade and investment between both the countries,' Mukherjee said at a joint news conference at Hotel Sheraton. Before the media conference, the minister signed the deals at the hotel. The agreement on promotion and protection of bilateral trade is new, while the other deal, signed in 1980, was renewed for three more years. "Being a former foreign trade minister I can most respectfully tell you there is no mechanism through which bilateral trade between two countries in respect of each and every country could be balanced. It is not possible," said the Indian minister, who came to Dhaka in the morning for about 12 hours. "But surely it is possible to reduce the gap and to keep it within the managable limit." Bangladesh and India have a huge trade gap of about $2 billion a year. However, the minister said India had taken some measures to reduce the yawning gap. "We also categorically assured Mr Pranab Mukherjee that Bangladesh will not countenance any anti-Indian activities by elements inimical to the interests of India using Bangladesh territory," Dipu Moni said at the press conference. "Similarly we have also sought India's cooperation against elements who are trying to harm Bangladesh", she said. Dipu Moni said prime minister Sheikh Hasina had proposed a taskforce to combat terrorism and she had discussed the issue with Mukherjee. "I have discussed [it] with the foreign minister of India this morning and we will be discussing this having dialogues with other regional neighbours and we will find out the modalities of how best we can cooperate in combating terrorism," said the Bangladesh foreign minister. "All the countries have national mechanism. In addition to that, terrorism is a problem which is not contained by any borders, so combating terrorism also needs cross-border or regional cooperation to be effective. "That is why, this proposal has been made and we will be holding talks with other neighbours to find out the best modalities on how to do it," she said. The Indian minister said he had talks with Dipu Moni on India's connectivity with Bangladesh. "In a globalised world it is important for both countries to enhance connectivity, linkages and boost our trade which would bring prosperity to the region," Mukherjee said. He also praised the launch of the Dhaka-Kolkata direct passenger trains last year. 'Initiative like this generate synergy and results in a mutually benefited relations,' he noted. Earlier, Mukherjee, who stood in as Indian prime minister in absence of Manmohan Singh, reached Dhaka by a special flight. He had talks with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, foreign minister Dipu Moni, home minister Shahara Khatun and other leaders in Bangladesh during a tightly scheduled 12-hour visit. His plane touched down around 10:30am in the morning, he left Dhaka around 10.30pm at night.
