<TEXT>
 Dhaka, March 30 (bdnews24.com)Emphasis on creating Bangladesh as a powerful brand by showcasing the nation's strengths and positive aspects came on the final day of the Bangladesh Brand Forum's seminar. The two-day high-profile gathering came to an end Sunday at a city hotel with the theme of 'Surviving Hyper Competition'. The seminar agreed that brands have to offer more than just product promises and functional benefits in the wake of today's hyper competition in the global economy. The concluding panel discussion on building Bangladesh as a brand, focused on a collective dream, respect to local culture, corporate ethics and values in brand-building. The panellists also stressed financial transparency of business houses, alongside their investment in corporate social responsibility programmes to augment low-income groups' purchasing power. One of the panellists, Munawar Misbah Moin, director of Rahimafrooz Group said the country's strength was entrepreneurship in the face of different problems and hopelessness. "Bangladeshi entrepreneurs are good at digging up opportunities." Grameenphone Communications Director Rubaba Dowla, Kazi & Kazi Tea Estates Chief Executive Officer Kazi Anis Ahmed and The Daily Star's editor Mahfuz Anam were the other panellists. Business houses need to invest at the lower rung of the pyramid to enhance the purchasing power of lower income group so that they can share the benefits of economic progress, they said. The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam pointed out that microcredit and social businesses would be an effective tool to reach the needy portion of the society. GP director Rubaba Dowla said branding of Bangladesh would allow local businesses to move in a global arena with their products. "We need to talk about the positives of Bangladesh to emerge as a powerful brand. We also need to be transparent." The discussion moderated by BBF's chief adviser Syed Ferhat Anwar, also focused on weaknesses such as inferiority complex and low self-esteem that crowd out the strengths of Bangladeshi corporations. The two-day seminar saw several international and local speakers provide inspiration to Bangladeshi corporate executives on how to build strong emotional connections with customers. All enduring and powerful brands offer unique emotional value in addition to the defined functional benefits of their category. But in Bangladesh, the majority of local brands play only through the functional facet, leaving the emotional part silent, according to a statement by Bangladesh Brand Forum.
