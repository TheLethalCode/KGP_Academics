<TITLE> Pakistan's Zardari backs Sharif govt return in Punjab </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ISLAMABAD, March 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari said on Saturday he would recommend the ending of central rule in Punjab and support the return of a government led by rival Nawaz Sharif's party in the province. Zardari precipitated a political crisis in late February by imposing central government rule, known as governor's rule, in Pakistan's largest province after the Supreme Court disqualified Sharif and his younger brother, Shahbaz, from holding elected office. But the two sides have since withdrawn from confrontation after Zardari agreed to reinstate Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry earlier this month.
