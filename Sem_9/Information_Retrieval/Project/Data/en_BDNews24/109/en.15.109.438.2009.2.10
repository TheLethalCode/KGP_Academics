<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  BGMEA president Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez has rejected allegations that the BGMEA Bhaban erected on land chalked out for the Tk 1,481 crore (Tk 14.8 billion) Begunbari-Hatirjheel project is "unauthorised". Parvez told reporters Tuesday the building was not just a private concern, but "a national asset constructed in accordance with a RAJUK approved plan". "Those who allege that this building is unuathorised are perhaps uninformed about its history," he said after talks with state minister for works and housing Abdul Mannan Khan. "The government will take a decision on the matter after due consideration," said Parvez. We have told the government that the the building in Hatirjheel has all the official documents, he added. The state minister, after his meeting with a BGMEA team led by Parvez, said, "If any corrupt means were adopted in constructing the building then the government will take necessary steps." "If no irregularities are found, the government will not interfere", he said. "We have heard BGMEA's version as well as that of officials and specialists and now a decision on the building will be taken after careful scrutiny of the documents and papers," said the state minister. The state minister, earlier in the month, met with officials and experts who say the Bhaban, built on the Begunbari canal, is one of the major hindrances to the completion of the Begunbari-Hatirjheel development project in the city. BUET professor Mujibur Rahman, housing and public works secretary ASM Rashidul Hye and Rajuk chairman Shafiqul Islam briefed the new state minister on the project's progress on Feb 3. Asked by reporters at the time if the building would be demolished to complete the development project, Khan said all angles would be scrutinised and if necessary, "laws will be amended to remove the hindrances to the Begunbari-Hatirjheel project". Asked about the reason for Tuesday's talks with the state minister, Parvez said that his association wanted to meet the state minister and inform him about the problems surrounding BGMEA Bhaban. 'We also talked about various problems facing the garment industry," he said. bdnew
