 COLOMBO, Feb 8 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Sri Lanka clinched a consolation 68-run victory against India in the fifth and final one-day international on Sunday to avoid a series whitewash. Sri Lanka piled up 320 for eight with opener Tillakaratne Dilshan top-scoring with 97, then bowled out India for 252. India won the series 4-1. Sri Lanka's bowlers, led by Nuwan Kulasekara (two for 42) and Muttiah Muralitharan (two for 41), produced their best display of the series. In-form Yuvraj Singh provided some resistance with a powerful 73 but the Indian innings eventually ran out of steam. Thilina Thushara struck first as Virender Sehwag (six) mishit a straight drive. Kulasekara then followed up with the wicket of Suresh Raina, who was brilliantly caught by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara standing up to the stumps. Sangakkara also caught Gautam Gambhir (13) off Kulasekara to leave India in early trouble on 52 for three. Yuvraj still attacked and the run rate remained high, but he was unable to build partnerships. Muralitharan swung the game decisively Sri Lanka's way as Yuvraj top-edged a sweep to be caught and bowled. Mahendra Singh Dhoni kept India's hopes alive for a while with his run-a-ball 53 and all rounder Ravindra Jadeja impressed with 60 not out on debut, but Sri Lanka's slow bowlers squeezed the run rate to maintain the upper-hand. Earlier, Dilshan and Sangakkara (84) put on 143 for the second wicket for Sri Lanka.
