 Dhaka, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com)  Ruling Awami League's central working committee met Tuesday morning through felicitating people on their voting the party to a thumping victory in the national polls in December. Presided over by party president Sheikh Hasina, the first-ever meeting of the ALCWC after the polls began at 10am to last through 11:30am, when a half-hour recess was announced. "To begin with, the meeting congratulated veteran AL leader Zillur Rahman as he is set to take the oath as the president of the republic on February 12," AL spokesperson Syed Ashraful Islam told reporters during the break. "In its long 60 years of existence, the Awami League for the first time has congratulated a president today (Tuesday). "During the crucial days following the emergency rule proclamation, when the caretaker government suspended all politics with an iron fist, Zillur Rahman shepherded the party most ably and confidently. "We hope he will discharge his presidential duties skilfully, maintaining a perfectly neutral stance. Zillur Rahman will continue to guide us in the future." Ashraful said Hasina too was felicitated in the morning session. Abul Kalam Azad, the prime minister's press secretary, said, "The prime minister herself was overwhelmed with emotion while congratulating the president-designate Zillur Rahman this morning." "With tears brimming her eyes, Hasina offered flowers to Zillur Rahman as most of the Central Working Committee members were felicitating the senior AL leader on the occasion." bdnews
