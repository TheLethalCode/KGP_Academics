<TITLE> Chelsea hunt for Scolari replacement </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, Feb 10 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chelsea began the search for Luiz Felipe Scolari's replacement on Tuesday with Dutchman Frank Rijkaard appearing as a leading contender. British newspapers carried stories linking the former Barcelona manager with the vacant post while Rijkaad's agent said his client was keen on taking a Premier League job having been out of work since leaving the Nou Camp last year. "He is obviously a big fan of the game and a big fan of the Premier League, so he is interested in working in the Premier League," Perry Overeem told Sky Sports News on Tuesday. "Yes (Rijkaard would be looking for a long-term role). But it depends on all the conditions and the plans. "It would have to be a long-term plan for him, not just something for one or one-and-a-half seasons. "He would consider every serious job offer from one of the major soccer leagues in Europe, obviously Chelsea and the Premier is one of those." Rijkaard's fellow Dutchman Guus Hiddink is also regarded as a prime target for Chelsea, although the Russia coach appeared to distance himself from the job on Monday. With Chelsea still involved in three competitions, they will be anxious to replace Scolari quickly. They face Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League this month and have a tough away game in the Premier League at third-placed Aston Villa coming up. Defeat in that game would end Chelsea's remote title chances and leave them in a battle to remain in the top four and qualify for next season's Champions League
