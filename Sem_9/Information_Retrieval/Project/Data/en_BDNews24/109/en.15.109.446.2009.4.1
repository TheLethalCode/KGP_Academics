 Dhaka, April 1 (bdnews24.com)  Sports Minister Ahad Ali Sarker on Wednesday reiterated the government's desire to host the opening ceremony of the 2011 ICC World Cup at the Bangabandhu National Stadium. "It is a government decision, but it is still in discussions. We believe that holding the opening ceremony of the Cricket World Cup will uphold the country's image," Sarker said in a briefing after the meeting with the National Sports Council, Bangladesh Football Federation and Bangladesh Olympic Association at the NSC Tower. BFF president Kazi Salahuddin said that his federation had also no problem if football was not hampered. He, however, wanted to know how many days it would take to prepare the stadium for the opening ceremony. NSC chairman and army chief General Moeen U Ahmed, who is also BOA president, said that his organisation was ready to help the government. The meeting also discussed preparations for the 2010 South Asian Games in Bangladesh. "We have been trying to free sports from politics," said Moeen. He also added that they aimed on winning 10 more gold medals from the Games.
