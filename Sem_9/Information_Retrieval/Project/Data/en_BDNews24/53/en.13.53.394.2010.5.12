<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) - British lawyers acting for 48 year old British businessman Gholam Moustafa, an alleged leader of banned outfit, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) have accused the Bangladesh authorities of "severe mistreatment" since his arrest on 16 April, according to Wednesday's edition of UK's Guardian newspaper. They are also alleging that the British government has been complicit in this mistreatment  though the newspaper provides no evidence of this. The newspaper says that according to his family, "Mustafa appeared to have a swollen face when he was paraded before television cameras shortly after his arrest." It goes onto say that, "When he appeared in court 11 days later, a journalist working for the Guardian could see that he was unable to stand throughout the proceedings, at one point sinking to his knees. "The businessman told a British consular official he had been forced to assume stressful positions for long periods during questioning at a detention centre known as the Taskforce for Interrogation Cell, where the use of torture is alleged to be common." The article, written by journalists Ian Cobain and Fariha Karim quotes lawyers for Mustafa's family as also saying that there were strong grounds to believe that British officials had been complicit in his mistreatment and they were considering bringing legal action against the UK government. The lawyers are said to be angry that the UK High Commission in Dhaka had failed to secure consular access to Mustafa for more than two weeks after his arrest or arrange for him to be seen by a doctor. The Guardian reports that the family's solicitor, Gareth Peirce, has written to the foreign secretary, David Miliband stating that: "There is serious reason to believe that the security services have . been mixed up in the ill-treatment carried out by the Bangladeshi authorities and this is still ongoing." The newspaper does not provide any evidence for this assertion. In his reply to the letter, the Labour government's outgoing foreign secretary, David Milliband, is quoting by the Guardian newpaper as saying that Mustafa's welfare was the "primary objective" of the Foreign Office. When contacted by the Guardian, the British foreign office is reported as saying that it had made repeated requests to the Bangladesh authorities to see Mustafa before finally being allowed access to him on 2 May. The Bangladeshi foreign ministry is reported by the Guardian as rejecting the British foreign office's statement, saying it had received only one such request  the day after Mustafa's lawyers wrote to Miliband  and that the request had been promptly granted. Moustafa was arrested in Sylhet for trying to organise and strengthen HuJI. The alleged militant had earlier been arrested on Dec 2, 2007 from a house in the capital's Bashundhara residential area, where allegedly a pistol and five jihadist books were found in his possession. Mostafa was sentenced to 17 years in prison in Bangladesh but managed to get bail from the High Court. These torture allegations come 12 months after Jamil Rahman, another British terrorism suspect alleged that he was tortured in Bangladesh. He told the Guardian that British intelligence officers had threatened him with reprisals if he did not give evidence against Mustafa in an English court. "They told me that they would arrange for somebody to give evidence against me in court if I didn't agree," he said. Rahman, 32, a former civil servant from south Wales, said that, after being tortured by DGFI officers, he was repeatedly interrogated by men who identified themselves as MI5 officers. He was never charged with any offence and eventually returned to the UK, where he began civil proceedings against the UK govern
