 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) Main opposition BNP has hinted at running the Chittagong City Corporation elections despite their outright rejection of the Election Commission's neutrality. Secretary general Khandakar Delwar Hossain on Thursday said they would not participate in the national elections under the present Election Commission after what happened in the Bhola by-elections. BNP alleges that the April 24 by-polls were rigged by the ruling Awami League with the help of the EC. Delwar however said a final decision on CCC elections will come from chairperson Khaleda Zia. The CCC elections are scheduled to start on June 17. The deadline for submitting nominations is May 20. "But we will contest other local government elections including those for city corporation, municipality and Union Parishad," Delwar said. A senior BNP leader told bdnews24.com that senior leaders of Chittagong unit were to sit in a meeting at a hotel in Dhaka on Thursday evening. "We have seven days in hand according to the election schedule. We have to decide by then," said Delwar in reply to a question. BNP's vice president, and a leader of Chittagong BNP, Abdullah Al Noman, was present while Delwar spoke to journalists. BNP had demanded the dismissal of the election commissioners, including the commission's chief, for what they said was their blatantly partisan attitude and for the irregularities during the Bhola by-election. bd
