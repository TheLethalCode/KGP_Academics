 MADRID, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Clay master Rafa Nadal tamed big-serving American John Isner 7-5, 6-4 to claim a place in the last eight of the Madrid Open on Thursday and was joined by Roger Federer and Andy Murray. World number one Federer, who beat Nadal in last year's final, swatted aside Swiss compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka 6-3, 6-1 and Briton Murray crushed Victor Hanescu of Romania 6-2, 6-1. Unseeded Latvian Ernests Gulbis, conqueror of Federer at last month's Rome Masters, awaits the 16-time Grand Slam winner in Friday's quarter-finals and third seed Murray will play Spaniard David Ferrer. At more than two metres tall, 19th-ranked Isner is a tough opponent on any surface and two booming aces on the second and third points of the match prompted anxious muttering and nervous applause from the crowd in the Magic Box arena. With the sliding roof closed on a rainy day in the Spanish capital, world number three Nadal struggled to make any inroads until the 11th game when he converted the first break point of the match to take a 6-5 lead. Bidding for a third straight Masters title of the year on his favoured surface after triumphs in Monte Carlo and Rome, Nadal broke again early in the second set. Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo and several of his Real Madrid team mates were watching in the stands as the 23-year-old Spaniard sealed victory with his only ace to set up a quarter-final against French 12th-seed Gael Monfils. PLEASANT TOPICS Nadal opted not to compete at last month's Barcelona Open, where he had won the previous five years, to make sure he did not suffer a repeat of the knee injuries that dogged him in 2009 after a gruelling European clay season. The decision looks to have left him fit and hungry for a second Madrid Masters title after he won the event in 2005 when it was played on indoor hard court. He appeared irritated when asked about his knees at a news conference, telling the reporter: "We've already talked enough about that. They are fine and I would prefer to talk about more pleasant topics." Looking ahead to his match against Monfils, Nadal said the world number 18 was a dangerous prospect. "He serves well and has a very strong forehand. If he's on form he's very hard to beat." Local favourite Fernando Verdasco was denied a place in the quarters when he was upset 7-5, 6-3 by Juergen Melzer in a battle of the big-hitting left-handers. The Spanish sixth seed, who lost to Nadal in the final in Monte Carlo and reached the last four in Rome, had treatment on an ankle problem at the end of the first set. He committed 41 unforced errors and unseeded Austrian Melzer dashed the crowd's hopes of a possible semi-final on Saturday between Verdasco and Nadal when he broke the Madrid native for a sixth time on his first match point. ANNOYING INJURY A subdued Verdasco said at a news conference he had injured the ankle in his second-round victory over Croat Ivo Karlovic but said he should be fit for the French Open. "It's annoying, and the injury is in a difficult place," the 26-year-old said. "There are lots of tendons in this zone but two physios have told me it isn't serious. I think I'll be able to make it for Paris and to be 100 percent." If Nadal reaches Sunday's final, the Mallorca native will reclaim the number two ranking from Serb Novak Djokovic, who pulled out of Madrid due to ill
