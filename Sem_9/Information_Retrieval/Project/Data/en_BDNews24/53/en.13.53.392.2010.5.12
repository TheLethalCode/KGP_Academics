<TEXT>
 Magura, May 12 (bdnews24.com)--A Magura court on Wednesday granted bail to opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farrouque in a criminal case that accuses him of defaming the prime minister's son. Twenty-one cases have so far been lodged against Farrouque across the country for allegedly defaming Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed by stating in parliament and elsewhere that Wazed was involved in illegal Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) operations. Magura chief judicial magistrate Sheikh Zajal Uddin granted bail upon a petition by Farrouque after he appeared before the court at about 10.30am along with his lawyer Mokaddes Hossain and other party lawyers. The court ordered Farrouque to sign a Tk 5000 bond. On Jan 18, Magura Jubo League convener Enamul Haque Hirak filed the case. Farrouque has secured bail from a number of courts. bdnews
