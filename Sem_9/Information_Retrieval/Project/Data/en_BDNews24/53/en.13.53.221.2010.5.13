<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)The Anticorruption Commission on Thursday questioned BNP policymaker M K Anwar over Bhairab bridge graft case. A three-member team, led by assistant director Harunur Rashid, interviewed Anwar from around 11 in the morning to 12.30pm at his Elephant Road residence. But Anwar revealed little, saying, "The investigation officers came to my house to know about a case. I was a member of the cabinet committee on public procurement." "I have told them that all decisions of the committee were taken legally and unanimously." Rashid also maintained confidentiality. "We came to Anwar's residence to ask a few questions about the Bhairab bridge. The matter is confidential so we cannot say anything." Anwar is one of the 10 former BNP-led coalition government ministers to have received ACC letters for questioning in the bridge graft case. Former prime minister Khaleda Zia is among them. On Monday, ACC investigators questioned former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan at his Gulshan residence in the same case. Former communications minister Nazmul Huda had gone to the commission and answered queries earlier. The other accused are: Khondoker Mosharraf Hossain, M Shamsul Islam, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and Aminul Huq, and former state ministers Salahuddin Ahmed and A K M Mosharraf Hossain. Khaleda's lawyer Mahbubuddin Khokan gave ACC officials her response to the letter on Sunday. bdn
