 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)-- Bangladesh and Russia will sign a framework agreement on peaceful use of nuclear technology during the foreign minister's visit to Russia on May 21. Briefing journalists at the foreign ministry on Thursday, foreign minister Dipu Moni said state minister for science Yeafesh Osman would sign the deal in her presence in Moscow. The foreign minister will hold bilateral talks with her Russian counterpart Segey Lavrov and the two leaders would witness signing of the the nuclear agreement. She said prime minister Sheikh Hasina will visit Russia by the year-end or early next year. "I will also have talks with my Russian counterpart on Bangladesh-Russia cooperation in nuclear technology and other bilateral issues," she said. The foreign minister said under the framework agreement, the two countries would strike other deals necessary for operationalising the proposed Rooppur nuclear plant in Pabna. Moni said her Russia trip was mainly focused on the prime minister's Russia visit. The cabinet had already approved the framework agreement set to be signed. Energy-starved Bangladesh has already approved a three-year (2008-11) project styled "Accomplishment of Essential Activities to Implement 600 mega watts Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant" to accomplish preparatory work for the construction of a medium size (600-1000) nuclear power plant, according to ministry sources. The ministry officials say the International Atomic Energy Agency had already agreed to give Bangladesh necessary technical assistance that includes ensuring the site safety standards. Bangladesh has been trying to implement the Rooppur power plant from 1961 when the country was a part of Pakistan. Successive governments since independence tried to materialise the project, but failed for various reasons. The Awami League government in its election manifesto pledged to start the nuclear power project to match the ever-increasing power demands. According to power ministry sources, the country produces up to 4,000 MW electricity every day against the daily minimum demand of 6,000 MW
