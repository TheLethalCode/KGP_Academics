<TEXT>
 Gopalganj, May 13 (bdnews24.com)--Mufti Hannan, the main suspect in the case involving the murder attempt of prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000, has claimed that leaders of her own party were involved in the plot. Coming out of a Gopalganj court where he was produced in the three related cases on Thursday, Hannan shouted the names of the Awami League leaders at journalists. "The truth will come if they are arrested and grilled." The leaders whose names he mentioned are party's religious affairs secretary Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, Gopalganj district unit joint general secretary Mahbub Ali Khan, Kotalipara Upazila unit joint secretary Golam Kibria Daria and local Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Israfil. The Awami League leaders, however, said Hannan took their names to divert the case. The incident involved planting of bombs at the venue of a public rally in Kotalipara in 2000. Two bombs, weighing 158 kgs, were planted--one at the venue of a public rally of Hasina, in her first term as prime minister, in Kotalipara scheduled for July 21, 2000 and the other at the helipad there. One case was filed for attempted murder of the prime minister and the two others were lodged under explosives and treason laws. Hannan, leader of banned Islamist outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islam (Huji), told reporters: "The persons planting the bombs have remained at large. I've been made a scapegoat. I've been implicated in a planned way." Thursday was the date for charge-framing in the attempted murder case at Gopalganj Special Tribunal. Hannan and 10 other accused in the cases were taken from Dhaka Central Jail to Goplaganj on Wednesday. But judge Morshed Alam deferred the charge-framing to July 1, as three other arrested suspects were not produced before him. Meanwhile, the Awami League leaders in question hurried a press conference at Gopalganj Press Club to protest the statement of Hannan. Religious affairs secretary Abdullah said: "He has given false statement only to defame me and other party leaders, and to divert the case. We're not involved in the plot." He said he had assisted the state counsel in conducting the case filed under explosives law, in which Hannan got life term. AL Gopalganj unit general secretary Chowdhury Emdadul Haque, vice-president Idris Ali Mollah, Mahbub Ali Khan were also present at the press conference bd
