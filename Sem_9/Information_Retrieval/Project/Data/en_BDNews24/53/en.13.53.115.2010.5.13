 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League MP Sheikh Helal Uddin and his wife Rupa Chowdhury have secured bail in three cases. The High Court granted them bail four days after the couple was sent to jail. The bench of justices Mohammad Shamsul Huda and Abu Bakar Siddiquee on Thursday granted bail to Helal in two cases and his wife in one case. Both of them have already been convicted in these cases. A Dhaka court on Sunday sent the couple to jail after rejecting their bail petition. They filed the petition to the High Court the next day. Sayeed Ahmed Raja, lawyer for the petitioners, said after the ruling that there is no bar in their release since they had been granted bail in all the cases. The couple is currently in Shikdar Medical College Hospital in Gulshan for medical treatment. A special court in Feb, 2008 sentenced Helal, the first cousin of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, to 13 years in jail for illegal wealth and concealing information. Rupa was sentenced to three years in jail for abetting her husband. Helal was sentenced to seven years in jail in an extortion case in February the same year. The couple had been officially absconding when Helal ran in the national elections in December 2008 and elected as MP from Bagerhat. b
