 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)Prime minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated a 55 MW gas-fired rental power plant at Ashuganj in Brahmanbaria on Wednesday afternoon. Hasina flew in the town around 12:30pm. Brahmanbaria deputy commissioner Abdul Mannan said after the inauguration of the power plant the prime minister will open a 250-bed hospital. She was also expected to attend a meeting at the Bramhanbaria Government College ground at 3pm. The private plant, the 49th plant in Bangladesh, will produce enough power equivalent to the average daily demand of Barisal and four neighbouring districts. The construction of the plant started on June 01, 2009 on the land of Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited. The plant will require nearly 10 mcf (million cubic feet) gas daily. Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company will supply the raw material. At present 47 percent people of the country have access to electricity. bdnews24.co
