<TEXT>
 SANTIAGO, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Chilean officials believe they have a criminal case against a Pakistani man being held under an anti-terrorism law after he was arrested in the US Embassy with traces of explosive on him. The man, identified by the US State Department as 28-year-old Muhammad Saif-ur-Rehman Khan, was arrested on Monday at the embassy in Santiago, and is being held under an anti-terrorism law. Police said traces of the explosive Tetryl were found on Khan's documents and mobile telephone. Tetryl is a compound used as a booster to help detonate explosive charges. Chief state prosecutor Sabas Chahuan said he saw a solid case, but did not say what type of crime he believed had been committed. Chahuan said he had information that he was unable to disclose.

Khan is scheduled to appear before a judge on Sunday, at which time he will be charged or set free. Chahuan did not provide details about Sunday's proceedings. Police on Thursday searched the central Santiago residence of a suspected associate looking for evidence, and carried away CDs, a briefcase and a diary, officials said. A senior State Department official said on Tuesday that Khan, a student who had been in Chile for four months, was invited to the embassy so officials could notify him that his visa for the United States was being revoked. The US official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was not aware of any link between Khan and the Pakistani-American accused of trying to bomb New York's Times Square on May 1. Khan has denied any wrongdoing and instead criticized the United States. "I have nothing to do with bombs. I have nothing to do with terrorists. I don't have a beard," Khan told reporters on Tuesday evening. "They (the United States) just want to cover up their shame and guilt for what they have done or are doing in Iraq and Afghanis
