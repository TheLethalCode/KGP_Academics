<TEXT>
 Chittagong, May 12 (bdnews24.com)  In contrast to the ruling party, Awami League, there is no visible enthusiasm of the main opposition BNP, with the announcement of Chittagong City Corporation polls schedule. BNP had earlier questioned the neutrality of the Election Commission (EC) over the Bhola-3 by-elections. Chittagong metropolitan BNP president Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury told bdnews24.com in response to the query about whether BNP will participate in CCC polls, "We will follow the party's central committee's decision." However, local leaders, including BNP's vice president Abdullah Al Noman expressed hopes that despite the prevailing lack of activities of Chittagong BNP, the polls will see an increased activity. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's advisor Amir Khasru said that he has no intention of running for mayor, while Noman said he was yet to decide though his followers want to see him as the mayor. Chittagong metropolitan BNP's general secretary Shahadat Hossain and senior vice president Dastagir Chowdhury both intend to contend but are waiting for the decision of the party's central committee. As a result, there is no visible activity over the elections on their behalf yet. The Election Commission on Tuesday declared that the CCC elections will be held on June 17. BNP leader Mir Mohammad Nasir Uddin was defeated by Awami League leader ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury in the last two CCC elections. Amir Khasru elaborated on his view about the polls and said that they are ready to compete. However, when asked about who will be contending in the polls, he said, "We will decide on the matter at a local-level meeting in a few days." Admitting to conflicts within the party, Noman told bdnews24.com: "Such conflicts are commonplace in big parties like BNP. However, everyone will forget the conflicts and work together during the polls." Amir Khasru expressed similar views. Asked about the absence of BNP's activities over the CCC polls, Noman said, "Nowadays you do not need poll preparation like that in the past. The people are more conscious. And the party will be prepared when the election comes." Former minister Amir Khasru said that he will not be contending in the polls and wants to continue his role in the party's policy making and parliamentary politics in future. Noman said, "I have not thought about contending myself. But the city dwellers are fed up of the current mayor's activities. So there is pressure from local levels for me to contend." bdne
