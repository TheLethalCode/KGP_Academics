 David Bergman Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) Most of Dhaka's expatriate clubs continue to use floodlights although a High Court order has banned their use in Bangladeshi clubs. bdnews24.com inquiries have confirmed that the Nordic, Dutch, British, British High Commission, German, Canadian and American clubs use full floodlighting for playing tennis after dark. It was not possible to find out the situation in the Australia Club. These clubs, based in upscale Gulshan or Baridara neighbourhood, are frequented by foreigners living in Bangladesh including the diplomatic community. Only one club  the International club  has voluntarily stopped using its floodlights for sports. On May 2, the High Court asked the Dhaka Club, Officers' Club and Uttara Club not to play games in floodlights between 7:00pm and 11:00pm for three months to save electricity. This ban was subsequently extended to the Gulshan Club. The court also asked the Rangpur deputy commissioner, B M Enamul Haque, to explain why punitive measures should not be taken against him for playing tennis in floodlights. The manager of the Nordic club told bdnews24.com that the club used floodlighting, as "the only time our members can play tennis is at night." Asked whether she thought that the club should stop using lights given the electricity crisis in Dhaka, she said, "No, I don't think our members would agree." The chair of the board of the Nordic club, Theo Olpheten, also admitted to bdnews24.com that it uses floodlights for tennis. "Our members pay a fee which is supposed to allow them to use the facilities, including tennis courts. If we stopped floodlights we would face a difficult problem with the members," he said. However, Olpheten emphasised that the club was well aware of the electricity problem in Bangladesh, and was doing as much as it could to cut power consumption within the club, pointing to the club's 'determined attempts to limit the wasteful use of air conditioners'. A spokesperson for the British club  known as the British Aid Guest House Association  said that although they were using floodlights, 'our manager has said that if we receive a circular from the government telling us to stop the use of floodlights, we will stop using them." As for the American club, a US embassy spokesperson said that the "embassy complies with all applicable laws and regulations with regard to operations of its facilities in Bangladesh." It did not want to comment further. Sharon Bhan, a member of the the International Club's executive committee, told bdnews24.com: "We stopped using the floodlights a while back after we saw newspaper reports on the High Court orders stopping the use of floodlights in the local clubs." "I don't know what other expat clubs are doing. They make their own decisions," he added. The secretary of the Gulshan club  which since the High Court order has stopped using floodlights - did not want to make any comment on whether the situation was unfair on local clubs. "The petitioner only gave the names of four clubs, and so the High Court only gave the order in relation to these four clubs. "It did not give an order for any other clubs, either for local people or for expats. "I don't know what expat clubs would have done if the High Court had imposed an order on them," he adde
