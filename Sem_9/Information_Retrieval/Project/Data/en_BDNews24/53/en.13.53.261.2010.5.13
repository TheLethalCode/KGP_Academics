 Narail, May 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Opposition chief whip Zainul Abdin Farroque on Thursday secured bail from a Narail court in a case accusing him of defaming the prime minister's son. Some 21 cases have so far been lodged against Farrouque across the country for allegedly defaming Sajeeb Ahmed Wazed, son of prime minister Sheikh Hasina, by stating in parliament and elsewhere that Wazed was involved in illegal VoIP operations. Narail chief judicial magistrate Amulya Kumar Sarker granted bail upon a petition by Farroque after he appeared before the court. On Jan 18, former Bangladesh Chhatra League vice-president of Narail, Md Saiful Islam Babu, filed the case against the opposition chief whip. Farroque has so far secured bails from a number of other courts in defamation cases filed against him for making allegations against the prime minister's son. Talking to reporters on the court premises he alleged that the government could not safeguard the country's sovereignty and freedom of the judiciary. bdne
