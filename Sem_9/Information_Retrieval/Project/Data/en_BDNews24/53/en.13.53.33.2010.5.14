<TITLE> Protest crackdown sparks fighting in Bangkok </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Violence flared in the Thai capital on Friday as troops confronted groups of protesters around a major commercial district following overnight fighting that killed one and wounded nine, including a rogue general. The usually bustling business area near Lumpini Park was tense and quiet after fighting until dawn. Soldiers were earlier seen using tear gas and water cannon before dawn at Nana intersection, packed with shops and racy go-go bars. Shots and loud bangs were heard in several areas of Bangkok, but police said they were warning shots fired into the air to frighten the red-shirted protesters, who remained defiant, standing their ground at their barricades and new checkpoints. "They are tightening a noose on us but we will fight to the end, brothers and sisters," a protest leader, Nattawut Saikua, told supporters to loud cheers. The latest violence followed tough security measures imposed on Thursday evening to reclaim Bangkok's commercial district after the collapse of a reconciliation plan proposed last week by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. Troops had yet to seal off all roads surrounding the main protest site as earlier promised, raising questions over whether Abhisit would succeed in dispersing them and adding to uncertainty in Thailand's financial markets. "Investors should avoid making investments today and wait to see the situation over the weekend," said Kiatkong Decho, a strategist with stockbroker CIMB Securities in Bangkok, predicting a two percent drop in share prices on Friday. "The city is pretty much shut off right now. Everyone is on edge and tensions are just very high," he added. "At this point, I think there are not many options left for Abhisit but to forcibly remove the protesters." The shooting and a security cordon mark the start of a violent crackdown in which the Thai government stands a good chance of clearing the streets, the Eurasia Group political risk consultancy said. "But it will not end the polarisation that has led to the current instability -- ensuring that the pressure from the red shirts will persist and that political volatility will remain a persistent problem for Thailand for the forseeable future". It is unclear who shot a renegade general who has been in charge of security for thousands of protesters occupying a 3 sq-km (1.2 sq-mile) stretch of central Bangkok since April 3. Khattiya Sawasdipol, a suspended army specialist better known as "Seh Daeng" (Commander Red), was shot in the head, apparently by a sniper, while talking to reporters on Thursday evening. He underwent brain surgery and remains in stable condition. The shooting sparked half a dozen confrontations overnight between rock-throwing protesters and armed security forces on the outskirts of the protesters' barricaded encampment. One protester was shot in the eye and died after a group of red shirts confronted soldiers armed with assault rifles next to a park in the Silom business district, witnesses said. Some protesters hurled rocks and troops fired in return. Gun fire, explosions and sporadic fighting continued into the night around army checkpoints near the main protest site, which was protected by barricades made from tyres and wooden staves soaked in kerosene and topped by razor wire. By Friday morning, nine people had been wounded, according to the Erawan Medical Center. The military brought in armoured vehicles, shut down power in some areas at the protest site and cut some mobile phone services. PRIME MINISTER UNDER PRESSURE Khattiya had been branded a terrorist by the Thai government, which accused him of involvement in dozens of grenade attacks that have wounded more than 100 people. But in recent days he was equally critical of other red shirt leaders, accusing them of embracing Abhisit's proposed "national reconciliation" which unravelled after protesters refused to leave the streets. Most businesses and embassies in the area have evacuated staff and were closed for the day. Apartment complexes were mostly empty after the government warned it would shut down power and water supplies, and landlords urged tenants to leave. Abhisit is under enormous pressure to end the protests, which began with festive rallies on March 12 and descended into the deadliest political violence in 18 years in which 30 people have been killed and more than 1,400 wounded. The crisis has paralysed parts of the capital, decimated tourism, pushed away foreign portfolio investors and slowed growth in Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy. Foreign investors have sold $584 million in Thai shares in the past six sessions, cutting their net buying so far this year to $607.6 million in an emerging market seen at the start of the year as one of Asia's most promis
