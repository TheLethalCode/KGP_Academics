<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) The government is pushing power tariffs in the next two months. Prime minister's energy adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury made the announcement on Thursday. A proposal will soon be sent to the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission for approval, he said at a press briefing at the Press Information Department. Power secretary Abul Kalam Azad, at the briefing, presented a plan to increase power production up to 9,426MW by 2015 in phases. The plan has set a target of producing 1,000 MW to 1,200 MW through quick installation of rental power plants by the next year. Moreover, power production target is set at 792 MW this year, 920 MW in 2011, 2,269 MW in 2012, 1,675 MW in 2013, 1,170 MW in 2014 and 2,600 MW in 2015. Azad said almost all the power stations are run by gas and the government is looking for an alternative source of energy. Authorities are thinking of installing power plants based on coal, diesel and furnace oil. The relevant offices of the government are now working on creating an energy reserve, Azad said. The quick installation of rental power plants would be done by private firms, for which the government will have to subsidise the power sector to purchase electricity at a high price. Adviser Chowdhury was asked whether this was the reason behind the government decision to augment power cost. The energy adviser gave a negative response. He, however, said the government will only send a proposal to the BERC that will make a final decision about the tariff hike. bdne
