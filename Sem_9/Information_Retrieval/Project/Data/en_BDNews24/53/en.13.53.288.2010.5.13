 Kishoreganj, May 13 (bdnews24.com) A total of nine bodies were recovered on Thursday while another seven passengers remained missing after an overloaded trawler sank in Meghna River at Kishoreganj on May 12. The dead were identified as Ambia, 36, Anowara, 35, Tanzila, 10, Tasbir, 6, Tania, 5, Shumon, 4, Shadhin, 3, Sharmin, 4, and Din Islam, 7. A total of ten bodies have been recovered. On Wednesday, the body of Sabekunnahar, aged 6 was found. Bajitpur police chief Subrata Kumer Saha on Thursday noon told bdnews24.com that the sank trawler was brought to the river bank using three strong boats. They then recovered the nine bodies from inside the trawler. The trawler bound for Nasirnagar's Chatalpar Bazaar from Bajitpur Upazila capsized at around 10am on Wednesday with more than one hundred passengers and hundred mounds of paddy in excess of its capacity. While many of the passengers managed to swim to the river bank 7 passengers remain missing Mafia Khatun, 8, Tanvir, 10, Nurchan Begum, 26, Abdul Bari, 80, Hasmat Ali, 60, Shwapan, 3, and Shahana, 12. Four divers of Kishoreganj and Bajitpur Fire Service and another four from Dhaka are trying to locate the missing passengers. The parliamentary member of Kishoreganj-5 (Nikli-Bajitpur) Afzal Hossain is observing the rescue. Deputy director of Kishoreganj Fire Service Abu Abdullah Md Saidullah said that the place where the incident took place is more than 70 feet deep, which hampered the rescue activities. The relatives of the missing families are gathering on both sides of the river. Bajitpur police chief Subrata Kumar Saha, quoting the survivors, said the trawler was carrying more passengers and goods than its capacity. A team of fire-service divers are searching for the missing, he said. Trawlers are a regular medium of transport in Haor areas like Kishoreganj, with accidents like this common. Around 55 people died when a trawler capsized in the Haor in December, 2009. Two years earlier to the day in 2008, a total of 45 passengers died when another trawler sank at Ghoradigha area of Nikli upazila. bdnews24.com/c
