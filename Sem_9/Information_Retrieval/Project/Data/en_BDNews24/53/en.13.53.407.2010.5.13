 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)The High Court on Wednesday asked the police to submit findings of an investigation into the death of night guard Manik while in custody of Chittagong police. The court also asked sub-inspector Younus Mia to be present at the court on May 23 and give a written explanation of the incident. The bench of justices AHM Shamsuddin Chowdhury and Md Delwar Hossain gave the order on Wednesday in response to a writ petition filed in public interest by Human Rights and Peace for Bangladesh.
