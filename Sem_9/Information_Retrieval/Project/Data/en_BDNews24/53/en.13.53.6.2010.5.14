 Dhaka, May 13(bdnews24.com)--The chief of a telecoms ministry-related parliamentary watchdog favours a rethink of the decision to cancel licences of five private land-phone companies. Hasanul Haque Inu, the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on telecommunication ministry, was speaking at a pre-budget roundtable titled 'Telecommunication Sector and Digital Bangladesh' hosted by Telecom Reporters Network Bangladesh (TRNB) at Dhaka's Hotel La Vinci. "We expressed concern over the decision to shut down five PSTN companies on behalf of the standing committee," Inu said and wondered if the decision was realistic. "I think the government should revaluate the decision," he said and claimed that the cancellation had evoked mixed reactions. Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission on Wednesday cancel licences of Dhaka Phone, WorldTel, RanksTel, PeoplesTel and National Telecom, which have been shut down since late March, on charges of illegal VoIP operations. He said a proposal would be sent from the standing committee to lift tax on SIM cards of mobile phones for building 'Digital Bangladesh.' The regulatory body would function as an independent entity, but there will be scope to appeal against its action, he added. Bandwidth prices will also be lowered, according to the parliamentary panel's chairman. "VoIP should be legalised as it is a much-talked topic nowadays. VoIP licences will be made available. The revenue will see a boost if it is allowed to run like cottage industries," Inu said Telecoms secretary Sunil Kanti Bose said, "We are trying to lower VAT and tax to a reasonable level. The upcoming budget will have a reflection of it." "We want reform in telecom sector and are working for that," he said BTRC chairman Zia Ahmed said, "PSTN business will survive but the sector will be purged of corruption." "The government will take stern action against corruption. It will curb irregularities in the business," he declared. Chaired by TRNB convener Shahed Siddique, the roundtable was moderated by its member secretary Shawkat Milton. b
