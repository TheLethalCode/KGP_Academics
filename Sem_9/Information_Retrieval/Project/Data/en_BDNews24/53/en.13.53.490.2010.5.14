 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) Taxicab drivers fought pitched battles with police on Thursday on Dhaka streets over requisition of vehicles, leaving 20 people injured. Traffic was halted for over an hour between Farmgate and Sonargaon roundabout at midday, causing long tailbacks, as clashes took place at Farmgate, Manik Miah Avenue and Bijoy Sarani. A number of vehicles were also vandalised at the time. A policeman was among those injured. Police detained six drivers and seized 20 cabs, the cab drivers said. Tejgaon police chief Mahabbur Rahman told bdnews24.com that a traffic sergeant ordered a taxicab to stop for requisition around 12pm at Sonargaon crossing. The driver stopped, got out of the car and ran away. Later, a police driver parked the vehicle near Kawran Bazar underpass. A little while later, other drivers came to the spot with eight taxicabs and parked them randomly on the streets. They had a heated argument with the police driver and at one stage assaulted him. A number of police officials on duty around rushed to the spot and the clash erupted. Police reinforcements arrived and brought the situation under control. Cab drivers alleged that the sergeant assaulted the cab driver and scolded him as he had stopped a little far off. Police beat up the other drivers when they went there to protest the incident. Salauddin, a taxicab driver, told bdnews24.com that traffic police commandeer cabs twice or thrice a month. A requisitioned vehicle is kept for a week in return for no money, leaving the poor drivers suffer with their families.
