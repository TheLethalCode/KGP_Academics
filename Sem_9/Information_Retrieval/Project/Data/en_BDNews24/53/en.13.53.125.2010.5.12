 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) - A nation-wide survey has found that the financial costs incurred by Bangladeshi workers seeking work abroad is much higher than for workers in other countries in the region. It also showed that informal channels, like hundi, are a much more efficient way of obtaining remittances sent by expatriate Bangladeshis than banks and money transfer agencies  though expatriates still prefer to use the formal channels. The findings were released at a function on Wednesday at the capital's Hotel Westin. IOM's regional representative Rabab Fatima said that its survey showed that migrants from Bangladesh have to pay high amounts of money for migration. "The survey findings substantiate earlier estimates that Bangladesh has the highest migration cost in the region, with the majority (75 percent) paying between Tk 1 lakh and Tk 3 lakh," said Fatima. "In a break down of the total money spent by the migrants, about 60 percent is paid to intermediaries and 18 percent to 'helper' (brokers)," she said. The expatriates' welfare secretary said the official charge for migration to a Middle Eastern country was Tk 84,000 while expatriates are having to pay up to Tk 200,000. "This is very embarrassing. The government is really putting utmost importance to reducing migration cost," said Khan. The survey also looked at the mechanisms by which migrant workers sent back remittances to Bangladesh. According to the survey, 90% of the 1,000 respondents said that it takes 15 days to receive the money through formal channels whereas it takes less than five days, on average, using informal channels. The survey showed that a person is likely to need to make at least two visits to the bank or a post offices to receive a payment, whilst people receiving remittances through informal channels mostly require only one visit. Most of the recipients, the survey found, do not pay extra money to get the remittance. But about 10 percent of recipients receiving money through a bank or post office say that they have to pay unofficial money to the officers. The findings show that the expatriates use formal channels for security but use informal channels for quick transfer of the remittance. The study suggested that the banks and post offices should increase their ability in providing services to expatriates so that they use formal channels. Bangladesh is very dependent on remittances from 6.5 million expatriates across the globe. Last year the expatriates remitted US $ 10.72 billion, according to the ministry of expatriates' welfare and overseas employment. The figure is 12 times the level of last year's foreign direct investment and six times the level of overseas development assistance, according to official estimates. The remittance is 12 percent of the Bangladesh's gross domestic products. Bangladesh Bank governor Atiur Rahman and senior programme manager of the DFID, which funded for the survey, Jim McAlpine, also addressed the meeting. b
