 BANGKOK, 12 May (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thailand's "Red Shirt" opposition protesters vowed Wednesday to "fight to the death" as authorities threatened to lay siege to their sprawling encampment in the capital after peace efforts broke down. The government announced it would cut off food, water and power supplies to the vast rally site in central Bangkok and urged local residents to leave as it prepared to seal off the area to prevent reinforcements arriving. The mainly poor and working class Red Shirts shrugged off the tough new measures, saying they had their own generators and that it would be impossible to cut their power without also affecting hospitals in the area. They rejected a demand by embattled Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva for the protests to end on Wednesday, putting a proposal for mid-November elections in jeopardy. "If you want to crack down, you're welcome at any time," said one protest leader, Jatupron Prompan. "We will fight to the death." The Red Shirts have said they will continue their rally until Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban is charged for his role in overseeing a deadly April 10 crackdown in which soldiers attempted to clear part of the capital. Suthep went to the Department of Special Investigation Tuesday to hear a complaint against him after the Reds demanded he turn himself in to police, but Red leaders refused to disperse until a formal case is opened against him. As Abhisit's fragile peace process stalled, the authorities announced they would cut off vital supplies, as well as telephone and transport links, to the site at midnight Wednesday-Thursday. "This is the beginning of measures to fully impose the law," said Sunsern Kaewkumnerd, a spokesman for the government unit set up to deal with the crisis, warning the authorities were ready to use force if necessary. "The army is ready, but at this moment I don't want to talk about a crackdown as we want to use measures to put pressure on them. "To the residents in the area: please leave. After midnight, authorities will not allow anyone to come in," Sunsern said, noting that some homes and foreign embassies would suffer disruption to water and power supplies. But officials were still meeting into the evening to discuss the practicalities of the plan as doubts arose over whether they could cut power to the rally site without plunging a large part of the capital into darkness. The movement has said it agrees to Abhisit's reconciliation roadmap, which foresees elections on November 14, but wants to see the government take responsibility for the April 10 incident, in which 25 people lost their lives. "None of the Red Shirts are afraid of your threats to cut water and power. We will run at soldiers with our two bare hands even if they fire at us with assault rifles," said one protest leader, Weng Tojirakarn. Abhisit has warned he may scrap the plan for early elections if the protesters do not leave their vast base, which has been fortified with barricades made from fuel-soaked tyres, bamboo poles and razor wire. "They should not make any more demands at this time otherwise it will affect the election date," said government spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn. "If they don't join the reconciliation process that date may not stand." The Reds say the government is undemocratic because it came to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote after a court ruling ousted elected allies of their hero, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was unseated in a 2006 coup. Their ranks were boosted over the weekend by 5,000 more supporters who arrived from the movement's heartland in the impoverished rural northeast, defying a ban on rallies in the capital, which is under a state of emergency. Twenty-nine people have been killed and almost 1,000 injured in Bangkok in a series of confrontations and attacks since the protests began in mid-March, in Thailand's worst political violence in almost two decad
