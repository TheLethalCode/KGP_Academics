<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)Single-day turnover on the premier bourse for the first time ever crossed the Tk 20 billion mark on Wednesday. Dhaka stock's turnover touched Tk 22.82 billion just two days after hitting a record-breaking all-time high of Tk 18.66 billion. Since Monday, the market started to come out from a long bearish trend riding on the back of banking and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) on the news of the finance ministry's green signal to convert face value of shares from Tk 100 to Tk 10. Most of the shares of the banks and NBFIs now have a face value of Tk 100. Many have submitted proposals to the regulator to denominate the face value of their shares while many others announced their decisions to make such changes. Market participators assumed that investors' rush to hold shares of banks and NBFIs might have caused the high turnover. "Investors are expecting more declarations from the companies on denomination of the face value," said a brokerage house official. Banks and NBFIs, obviously, dominated the day's turnover board, with 13 out of the 20 turnover leaders coming from the sector. The financial sector gained heavily along with power and fuel shares. Insurers ended mixed while mutual funds started to come out from the bearish trend as most of them gained. Market heavyweight Grameenphone, the lone telecoms issue, gained 1.32 percent. The benchmark general index or the DGEN rose 1.45 percent or 83 points to 5811.73, after gaining by almost 3 percent the previous day, reflecting investors' increased confidence in the market. Gainers beat losers 124 to 117 with three scrips holding steady.
