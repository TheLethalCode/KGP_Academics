One group was physically comforted by their mothers after the event; a second group spoke to their mothers by telephone, but did not see them while the third group did not have any sort of interaction with their mothers at all.

"Humans lacking social support from family and friends have poorer health outcomes than their better-connected peers. Vocal cues may be able to provide some of the same relief from these outcomes as direct interpersonal interaction including touch," the researchers said.
