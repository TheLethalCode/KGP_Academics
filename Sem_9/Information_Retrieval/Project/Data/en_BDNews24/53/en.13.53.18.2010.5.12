 Khagrachari, May 12(bdnews24.com)---CHT land commission has extended the land dispute petition deadline by another 90 days. Commission chairman Khademul Islam Chowdhury said the deadline had been extended taking into consideration the inhabitants of the remotest areas. He was speaking as chief guest at a joint meeting convened by commission and administration at Khagrachhari Town Hall on Tuesday. The commission called for submission of petitions to resolve land dispute on Mar 14 with a deadline of May 15. The deadline has been extended by another 90 days. The commission chairman said that already more than 1200 applications has been received. However, petitions from tribal people are fewer than that from settlers, Chowdhury said. He also pointed out that the government land survey in the hilly regions would resolve 80 percent disputes. So the commission chairman urged people to ask the government to start the land survey soon. Chowdhury said there was no precise measurement of land in the hilly region as a land survey has long been overdue. It has also given rise to conflict over land ownership and demarcation, he said Chaired by additional deputy commissioner (revenue) Gias Uddin, the programme was also addressed among others by commission secretary Abdul Hamid. When contacted CHT regional council chairman Jyotirindra Bodhipriya Larma said it would not be possible for him to attend the meeting until the land commission law which is inconsistent with CHT Peace Accord is amended. bdnews
