 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) The central bank on Wednesday formally introduced online tender service across the country. Bangladesh Bank is the first among the government, semi-government and autonomous institutions to successfully launch e-tender service, its governor Atiur Rahman said. "Bangladesh has lots of problems in tendering a work. E-tendering will increase transparency and accountability. We hope the entire country will come under this service," Rahman said at the launch at the BB headquarters in the city. From now, the bidders will be able to register online and get all information through e-mail about the tenders, he added. Bidders can also download tender forms and other necessary documents and submit bids on the website, he added. Online updates would be available to the bidders not present while the tender box is opened. The governor said, "We leaped one step ahead towards the dream of a paperless Bangladesh. The day will come when we won't have to carry files in our hands."
