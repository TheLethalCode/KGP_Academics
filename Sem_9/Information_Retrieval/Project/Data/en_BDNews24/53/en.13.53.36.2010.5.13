 Moinul Hoque Chowdhury bdnews24.com Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com) Chittagong City Corporation mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury will have to resign by the end of next week if he wants to run the upcoming elections, the Election Commission says. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday that the law requires mayoral contenders to leave 'beneficial' posts before submitting their nomination papers. "Otherwise their candidacy will be cancelled," Hossain said. The deadline for nomination submissions has been set for May 20. Chowdhury expressed his intent in seeking an unprecedented fourth term as mayor, following the declaration of the poll schedule on Tuesday. He collected his nomination papers for the city corporation polls, scheduled for June 17, on Thursday. According to law, he cannot contend for the same position while being in office. Other than him, Chittagong's AL-backed MP and Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and Industries (CCCI) president MA Latif and MP Nurul Islam BSC have expressed their interest in contesting in the polls. Commissioner Hossain said, without mentioning specific names, that both the posts of mayor and MP are beneficial posts, and anyone in those posts would have to leave office before submitting their nominations. However, councilors are allowed to take part in the polls without resigning their offices. He also said that there is a court directive regarding this. The commissioner also said that a directive on this issue has been sent to CCC's returning officials on Thursday. bdnew
