<TEXT>
 Gopalganj, May 13 (bdnews24.com) -- Mufti Hannan, the main suspect in the attempt on prime minister Sheikh Hasina's life in 2000, claimed that leaders of her own party had been involved in the plot to assassinate her. Coming out of a Gopalganj court where he was produced in the three related cases on Thursday, Hannan shouted the names of the Awami League leaders at journalists. "The truth will come if they are arrested and grilled." The leaders whose names he mentioned are party's religious affairs secretary Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah, Gopalganj's district unit general secretary Mahbub Ali Khan, Kotalipara Upazila unit joint secretary Golam Kibria Daria and local Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Israfil. The Awami League leaders, however, said Hannan took their names to divert the case. The incident involved planting of bombs at the venue of a public rally in Kotalipara in 2000.
