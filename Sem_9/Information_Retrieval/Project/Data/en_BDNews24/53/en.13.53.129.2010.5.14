 BISHKEK, May 14 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Clashes erupted in southern Kyrgyzstan Friday as the interim government moved to regain control of official buildings seized by supporters of ousted president Kurmanbek Bakiyev. Shots rang out in the cities of Osh and Jalalabad, where hundreds of Bakiyev supporters battled factions loyal to the government with sticks and stones, medical officials and reports said. The government regained control of an administration building in Osh with the help of special forces but Bakiyev supporters still controlled a building in Jalalabad, officials said. At least 30 people were hospitalised in Jalalabad, some with gunshot wounds, the head of the interim government Roza Otunbayeva said in Bishkek, blaming Bakiyev supporters for the violence. She said the Osh administration building had been retaken and authorities were "taking measures to impose order in the city of Jalalabad". The capital Bishkek was calm, she added. "The interim government has all the forces and capacity to stop actions by destructive elements. Measures are being taken to restore the country to stable development." "We have many supporters and, correspondingly, sufficient strength." Bakiyev -- including large numbers of women -- on Thursday seized regional administration buildings in Osh, Jalalabad and the town of Batken. They occupied the airports in Osh and Jalalabad. The US embassy in Bishkek, in a statement, expressed concern about the violence, urging "the peaceful resolution to the problems that have caused this situation." The interim government, which took power after Bakiyev was ousted in an uprising last month, has so far avoided using security forces against protesters in a bid not to inflame tensions. Media reports said the government had sent special forces to Osh to stabilise the situation and the troops were now on their way to impose order in Jalalabad. However Otunbayeva said that the gunfire had come from Bakiyev supporters who had "again spilled the blood of citizens of Kyrgyzstan". Omurbek Tekebayev, a leading member of the interim government, accused Bakiyev of being behind the unrest and said its organisers "wanted to ignite an inter-ethnic conflict in the country. Another top interim government official, Azimbek Beknazarov, said there was information that Bakiyev supporters planned mass protests on May 17. "Popular militia groups are forming throughout the country with the aim of thwarting a destabilisation of the country," he added. He claimed that the "south of the country is completely under the control of the authorities. The protests that ousted Bakiyev left at least 86 people dead and the interim government has since struggled to impose its authority on the country. Bakiyev, who drew the bulk of his support from southern Kyrgyzstan, has since taken refuge in Belarus, which has so far not responded to calls from the interim government for his extradition. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev warned last month Kyrgyzstan risked civil war but the situation calmed with the departure of Bakiyev. Bakiyev's support committee in Kyrgyzstan said Thursday that 25,000 supporters of the ousted president were making their way to Bishkek to "settle scores with the interim government". There was no immediate sign of this in the capital but his Bishkek-based support committee said 10,000 people were expected later in the day. Bakiyev came to power in a popular uprising -- the so-called Tulip Revolution of 2005 which ousted the previous president Askar Akayev -- but became increasingly unpopular amid allegations of corruption and mismanagement. The mountainous ex-Soviet state is in a key strategic location and houses a US airbase used for the transit of supplies for the conflict in Afghanistan as well as a Russian military b
