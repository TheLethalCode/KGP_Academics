 GROS ISLET, Saint Lucia, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -- Unbeaten Australia eased into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup Tuesday after a comfortable six-wicket win over West Indies, a result which eliminated the hosts. Australia will face Pakistan in their semi-final Friday while Sri Lanka, who earlier produced a last ball win over India, will face England Thursday. A passionate capacity crowd at Beausejour Stadium were hoping for a spirited performance from the home side but they crumbled to 105 all outafter skipper Chris Gayle was bowled by Dirk Nannes in the first over of the game. Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan put on 34, the highest partnership in the innings, but even though Sarwan stuck around it was largely to witness wickets tumbling at the other end with leg-spinner Steven Smith picking up three, for 20 runs. Such was the collapse of the West Indian batting, Australia's two main strike bowlers Nannes and Shaun Tait did not bowl out. The 20-year-old Smith, who carries the burden of being a promising leg-spinner in a country that still reveres Shane Warne, was on a hat trick after he had Kieron Pollard stumped with a beautifully flighted, turning delivery and the next ball had local favourite Darren Sammy caught and bowled. Sammy had been applauded all the way out to the middle and not even the failure of St. Lucia's only test cricketer stopped the crowd from keeping up an incessant noise. During the interval a local fan, dressed as a priest, circled the ground splashing 'holy water' on his fellow supporters but there was to be no miracle for West Indies. Australia knocked off the total with 3.4 overs to spare and for the loss of just four wickets with wicketkeeper Brad Haddin top scoring with 42. If the win was familiar for Australia, so was the defeat for West Indies and their captain Gayle acknowledged the crowd's disappointment. "There are no excuses and I apologise to the fans for our display in this World Cup but we have to hold our heads high, we have worked really hard," he said. Australia completed three wins out of three for Michael Clarke's side in the Super Eight stage of a competition in which last year they were dumped out of in the first round - after a defeat to West Indies. "We came into this tournament ranked very low and our performances have been outstanding, we have performed consistently and in completely different conditions and that is so important," said Clarke. "Hopefully come Friday we can come out and continue this momen
