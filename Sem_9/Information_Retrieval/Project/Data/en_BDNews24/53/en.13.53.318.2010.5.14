 BANGKOK, May 16 (bdnews24.com/AFP)  Thai troops opened fire on the streets of Bangkok on Friday as they ramped up pressure on "Red Shirt" protesters to give up their campaign to topple the government after a two month standoff. Volleys of gunfire sent residents fleeing in panic near the Suan Lum Night Bazaar, popular with tourists, while protesters set fire to an empty police bus and vandalised army vehicles and water cannon. Two journalists, one of them a Canadian with the France 24 television channel and the other a Thai photographer, were shot and wounded. Their conditions were not known. Troops were seen repeatedly firing into Lumpini Park, close to the Red Shirts' sprawling encampment, which has been fortified with razor wire, truck tyres doused with kerosene and sharpened bamboo poles. It was not clear if the troops were firing live ammunition, but the army has warned in the past it would use lethal force against "terrorist" elements. A line of about 100 soldiers carrying assault rifles was seen near the park, according to an AFP reporter. Three Red Shirts were seen being detained by the security forces. Army spokesman Sunsern Kaewkumnerd said there were about 2,000 Red Shirt protesters in the area and that the order was given Friday morning to disperse them after they had "intimidated authorities with weapons". Defence Minister General Prawit Wongsuwon said the operation was meant to force the movement's leaders back to talks with the government. "The military operation aims to put pressure on the Red Shirts to come back to the negotiating table," Prawit told AFP. An army spokesman, however, said the military had no plan to force protesters out of their main fortified rally site on Friday. Around the wider protest area, which extends for several square kilometres (miles), soldiers blocked roads and set up checkpoints to seal off the area. "The total seal-off measure took place since yesterday evening," said Sunsern, adding that the electricity company had cut off the power to part of the capital. As part of the operation, some of Bangkok's commuter rail system was shut, including a section through the key tourist area of Sukhumvit Road. The army had warned Thursday it would deploy snipers around the Reds' protest site and use armoured vehicles to prevent more demonstrators joining thousands who have occupied a large area of central Bangkok for two months. The army's decision followed the shooting late Thursday of renegade Major-General Khattiya Sawasdipol, a high-profile Reds supporter, who had been accused of trying to stymie government moves to reconcile with the protesters. He was unconscious in the intensive care unit of Vahira hospital with a "low" chance of survival from a head wound, said Chaiwan Charoenchokethavee, the hospital director. Another demonstrator died after being shot in the head in clashes with security forces Thursday night. Eleven others were wounded. Core Red leaders had publicly distanced themselves from Khattiya, known by his followers as Seh Daeng, but after his shooting one top protester vowed there would be no surrender. "If you think the shooting of Seh Daeng will scare leaders and make them not dare to take the stage, you are wrong," one of the protest leaders, Jatuporn Prompan, said at the rally site. "We will not leave here as losers." The army denied involvement in the shooting as protesters dug in. The fresh violence came after Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva shelved a plan to hold early elections in November and hopes faded for a resolution to the crippling political crisis. The mostly poor and working class Reds, who launched their campaign in mid-March for immediate elections, initially agreed to enter the peace process but efforts to reach a deal that would see them go home eventually broke down. The Reds consider the government illegitimate because it came to power in a 2008 parliamentary vote after a court ruling ousted elected allies of their hero, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was unseated in a 2006 coup. Bracing for further possible unrest, the government on Thursday extended a state of emergency to 15 more provinces. Almost one-third of the country including Bangkok is now under emergency rule. At least 30 people have been killed and about 1,000 injured in Bangkok in a series of confrontations and attacks since the protests began -- Thailand's worst political violence in almost two deca
