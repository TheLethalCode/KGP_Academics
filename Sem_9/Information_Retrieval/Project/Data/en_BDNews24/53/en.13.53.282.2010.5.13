 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority claimed that launch communications had returned to normal on Thursday despite the continuing strike of some water transport workers. "Most of the launch staff attended work today after the shipping minister gave an ultimatum to them to resume their work," BIWTA traffic inspector at Sadarghat launch terminal Md Mahmud Hossain told bdnews24.com on Thursday. Water Transport Workers Federation started an indefinite strike on May 7 to press home their 22-point demand, including raising their wages, rejecting a new wage structure finalised the previous day. Shipping minister Shahjan Khan on Wednesday termed the strike politically motivated and asked the workers to join their respective works by Thursday afternoon or face cancellation of their professional certificates. BIWTA officials said most of the launches started traveling as usual. Eleven out of 12 launches, scheduled to leave Sadarghat terminal by 12 noon for different destinations, set out as per schedule, they said. Inspector Mahmud said: "The situation has turned normal. Master drivers are operating around 80 percent of launches." But the master of a Barisal-bound launch, requesting anonymity, told bdnews24.com: "The authorities are making the master of one launch operate another launch." Visiting the Sadarghat terminal on Thursday this correspondent found only water transport workers belonging to the pro-Awami League Nou Shramik League (Waterway Workers League) and Jahaji Shramik Federation (Ship Workers Federation), opposing the strike. A tripartite meeting of water transport workers, launch owners and government representatives on May 7 finalised the new wage structure, which has raised wages by 50-100 percent. The federation rejected the new structure demanding 300 percent rise in wages. Meanwhile, a Bangladesh navy team started repairing a fuel-carrying ship of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, whose engine has been damaged by the striking workers at Godnail under Siddirganj upazila in Narayanganj district. bdnew
