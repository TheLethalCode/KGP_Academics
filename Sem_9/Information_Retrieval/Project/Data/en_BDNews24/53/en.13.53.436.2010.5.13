 Chittagong, May 13 (bdnews24.com)Chittagong City mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury is seeking to run the June 17 polls with the logo 'lantern'. He has appealed to the Election Commission to include the lantern amongst other logos when he collected his nomination papers from the office on Thursday. Chowdhury won the last three polls with this logo, but the Commission has not allocated it this year. He said that if elected to another term as mayor he will develop chittagong into a "modern city". "If I am elected mayor this time, I will concentrate on developing a proper and modern Chittagong," Chowdhury said. He declared his intention to contest in the polls shortly after the Commission announced its schedule for the city council polls on Tuesday. However, Chittagong Awami League MP M A Latif also wants to run the polls, along with Nurul Islam BSC, MP. Local newspapers have reported that AL competitors might also run against Chowdhury without party tickets. Chowdhury responded to the reports: "I have no objection to anyone contending. No one has been barred from being a candidate. But members of the party should follow its decisions." Chittagong metropolitan Awami League's general secretary Kazi Enamul Haque Danu, who also went to the Commission office, said they had extended their support for Chowdhury at its extended meeting on Wednesday. The last day of submitting nominations is May 20. bdn
