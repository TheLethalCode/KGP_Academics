 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of a readymade garment factory in the capital's Pallabi took to the streets on Thursday demanding arrear wages. Over 500 workers of Arizuana garments in Mirpur 12 demonstrated in front of the factory from 10:30am. They were also involved in chase and counter chase with the police at that time suspending traffic from Mirpur 11 through Mirpur 12 for an hour. Pallabi police chief Iqbal Hossain told bdnews24.con they obstructed the demonstrators as they were attempting to vandalise vehicles. Local MP Illias Molla went to the spot. The workers withdrew from the road at around noon after being reassured by the owners that their demands would be met, Hossain said. Meanwhile, students of Titumir College blocked the road in front of the college for an hour from 11am demanding that the college authorities provide them with a bus for easier transportation. Traffic ground to a halt from Mahakhali to Gulshan 1, said Gulshan zone assistant police commissioner Nurul Alam. The demonstrators lifted their blockade an hour later, after the college authorities assured that their demands would be addressed.
