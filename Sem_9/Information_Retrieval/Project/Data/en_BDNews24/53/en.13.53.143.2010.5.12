 Dhaka, May 11(bdnews24.com)Civil aviation authorities hope that Shahjalal International Airport will not face any major setbacks in the wake of a partial water transport workers' strike. However, a foreign carrier has already cancelled two flights fearing fuel crisis. Chairman of Bangladesh's civil aviation authority, Air Commodore Sakeb Iqbal Khan Majlish, told bdnews24.com on Wednesday evening, "The fuel crisis is being resolved and we hope that there will be no further problems." "We have some fuel in store and another 60 fuel lorries are on their way to Dhaka." He was positive that within Wednesday night the airport would have a fuel stock of 4000 tonnes. "With this reserve, we should be able to run for the next 3-4 days." The civil aviation chief said they were making arrangements for more fuel. However, the airport authority informed carriers beforehand that fuel supply would be stopped as soon as their suppliers, Padma Oil, warned them of the likely crunch. Saudia had already cancelled two of their scheduled flights on Wednesday. The airport's director, Wing Commander Sahidur Rahman, told bdnews24.com that Saudia's Damam-Dhaka and Riyadh-Dhaka flights for Wednesday were cancelled. "However they will be resuming their flights from (Thursday)." "The Saudi airlines told us beforehand that they would postpone flights if the fuel crisis continued," the airport chief said. On Tuesday night, Rahman quoted a May 9 statement by the Padma Oil Company and told bdnews24.com that the company had expressed their inability to supply fuel due to a strike by the water transport workers. The federation went on strike from Friday midnight rejecting a new wage structure announced by the government. However, other workers associations have accepted the new structure. Under the new structure, wages of the water transport workers rose by 50 to 100 per cent. Padma Oil Company provides most of the fuel to the airport. Anwarul Karim, chairman of the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation, told bdnews24.com that fuel could not be unloaded from the four tankers at Godnail because of the strike. bdne
