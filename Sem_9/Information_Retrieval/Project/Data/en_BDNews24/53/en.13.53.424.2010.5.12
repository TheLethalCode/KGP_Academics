<TEXT>
 Barisal, May 12 (bdnews24.com) BNP chief Khaleda Zia says the state machinery is falling apart and the opposition will unseat the government with a series of street campaigns. Full Story She said the entire country had ground to a halt because of the ruling party's malevolent governance. Khaleda made the comments on Wednesday at BNP's rally at Barisal Bells Park which is the fourth in a string of programmes drawn up to rejuvenate the opposition party. The leader of the opposition reiterated that she would be declaring the next of course of action in their bid to launch an anti-government campaign on May 19 from the 'grand rally' in Dhaka. Referring to the government's failure Khaleda said, "There will be a mass upsurge if this trend continues." Harping on her pet peeve about the previous military-backed interim government installed on January 11, 2007, Khaleda said that the current government was a 'ghost of 1/11'. "This government has to be unseated through popular movement. Spells or talismans will not work anymore," she added. The two-time prime minister also said the change would bring "peace to the country and prosperity to the people." In her hour-long speech, Khaleda portrayed different issues of the country and failures of the governing Awami League. Terming the Awami League-led alliance government inefficient, worthless and a complete failure, Khaleda predicted: "This government will never again be able to come to power." Khaleda hinted that the ruling AL government was plotting to bring foreign forces into the country. "The situation is so bad that the Indian high commissioner, for his protection, has written to his country for security personnel." "Similarly, if the other embassies also bring in their own forces, the country will be full of foreign forces." "This is surely nothing but a conspiracy," she added. Khaleda also expressed her concern over murders and likened the current situation to the situation that "was prevailing during 1971 to 1974" when founding president of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rhaman, prime minister Sheikh Hasina's father, was in office. She said that the party was launching the campaign in response to the 'popular demand'. "We will go for movements to protect the interests of the people," she stressed. Justifying her call to launch the anti-government campaign, Khaleda suggested that the people had run out of patience with the ruling government and wanted to see a change. She went on to say that the party was launching the campaign in response to 'popular demand', "We will go for movements to protect the interests of the people," she stressed. The former prime minister also alleged that the current government was awarding power projects without tenders 'by creating an artificial crisis.' Addressing the government officials, Khaleda asked them not to 'approve or sign' the unsolicited power generation proposals. "Investigations will be held into these projects after the BNP returns to power and punishments will be given according to law." Khaleda claimed during her five year-term, from Oct 2001-Oct 2006, 1,500MW was added to the national grid "whereas the current government could not add a single megawatt in the last 16 months." However, according to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), plants, with a generation capacity of 1346.45 MW came into operation during the tenure of the BNP-led regime, when the public sector added 667MW and the private operators added 679.45MW. During the tenure of the current AL-led government, however, 571MW has already been added to the national grid since Jan 2009. She also criticised the state of affairs regarding different issues including partisanship, deteriorating law and order, prices of essentials, gas, water and power crises and a bleak employment scenario. She mentioned that the government had failed in these issues. Comparing prices of necessary items of the two governments, Khaleda claimed that "all prices went up" and that those were far more than what people could afford. Khaleda alleged that the government was filing false cases and attacking BNP leaders and supporters. "They're doing just as the caretaker government of Fakhrudidn Ahmed and Moeen Uddin Ahmed did." The opposition chief termed AL 'undemocratic and fascist' and said, "This regime has brought a one-party rule in the country." "Democracy is absent when they are in power. They destroy democracy by ententes with the dictators." She also termed the Election Commission as an organisation of 'blueprints' and alleged that the EC had even tried to create a rift among the BNP. "This commission is shameless. It's completely partisan." Khaleda reached Barisal at around 4pm, when standing committee member Mirza Abbas, vice president Selima Rahman, Altaf Hossain Chowdhury and the local leaders greeted her at the Circuit House. Thousands of people, came to join from the nearby districts, were present at the Bells Park area before the due time of the rally. Saying that the party leaders and supporters were barred to join the grand rally, Khaleda said, "The launch strike was called to stop people from coming. Buses were also obstructed at many places." "The government is afraid and resorting to such measures," she claimed. Over one hundred loudspeakers, mobile medical camps and ambulances were provided on the rally premises. Several projection screens were also set up. Banners, festoons and over two hundred archways greeted Khaleda Zia. Law enforcers including the RAB, police and members from the detective agencies formed a three-layer security. Traffic movement to a halt due to the rally. The rally, presided over by organising secretary Mojibor Rahman Sarwar, was also addressed by senior leaders ASM Hannan Shah, Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury, Abdul Moeen Khan, Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, Aman Ullah Aman and Syed Moazzem Hossain Alal among others. BNP chairperson also spent some time with the local leaders at the Circuit House before leaving for Dhaka.
