 Brahmanbaria, May 12 (bdnews24.com)-Only an Awami League government can ensure people a happy and peaceful life, prime minister Sheikh Hasina has said. "People can live in peace and happiness whenever the Awami League comes to power," Hasina said while addressing a public rally, hosted by local Awami League, at Niaz Muhammad High School ground in Brahmanbaria. Hasina flew in the town around 12:30pm. The prime minister claimed that prices of essential commodities are low compared with those during the BNP-led government's period. She said, "People during the tenure of BNP-led four-party alliance government had to buy the coarse rice at Tk 40 a kg, which was Tk 10 in 1996, when the Awami League was in power." Hasina said, "People rejected the four-party alliance in 2008 national election as they built mountains of money through corruption." The prime minister attended the public rally after launching the 55 MW Ashuganj rental power plant. The private plant, the 49th plant in Bangladesh, will produce enough power equivalent to the average daily demand of Barisal and four neighbouring districts. The construction of the plant started on June 01, 2009 on the land of Ashuganj Power Station Company Limited. Earlier, the prime minister inaugurated the 250-bed Brahmanbaria Sadar Hospital. She also exchanged views with the senior government officials at the Circuit House in the afternoon. Chaired by acting party general secretary Mahbub-ul-Alam Hanif, the rally was also addressed by state minister for liberation war affairs ABM Tajul Islam, Subid Ali Bhuiyan MP, and local MPs. bdnews2
