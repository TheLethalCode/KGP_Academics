 PARIS, May 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- Patrick Vieira's international career appears to be over after he was omitted from the 30-man provisional World Cup squad announced by France coach Raymond Domenech on Tuesday. Vieira, the former captain and a World Cup winner in 1998, joined Manchester City from Inter Milan in January in a bid to prove his fitness after struggling with injuries in recent seasons. He will not be given a chance to add to his 107 caps in South Africa though, and Domenech revealed the decision not to choose him had been a difficult one. "We talked about this for a long time," said the France coach. "I had to judge him on the professional side. It is a very emotional decision." Vieira said he accepted Domenech's choice but admitted to feeling aggrieved that he had not been contacted personally. "I still feel in good shape. I'm not questioning this list. I respect his choice," Vieira told Infosport. "I would have accepted it more easily if he'd called me yesterday (Monday) rather than learning about it like that. That's what hurt." Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema was the other high-profile player to miss out, barely 10 months after his 35 million euro transfer from Lyon. Striker Djibril Cisse received his first call-up since being cut from France's squad prior to the 2008 European Championship, after netting 29 goals this season for Greek champions Panathinaikos. There were also first call-ups for 25-year-old Marseille winger Mathieu Valbuena and 28-year-old Bordeaux centre-back Marc Planus, and a surprise selection for 19-year-old Rennes midfielder Yann M'Vila. "It's a surprise for me, a huge surprise," M'Vila, a France under-21 international, told RTL. "Personally it's a dream to play at a World Cup. It's a big surprise to be in the 30. Why not make the 23?" Domenech revealed his provisional squad live on French television channel TF1's main evening news programme, having earlier indicated that he would be naming his final 23-man squad for the June 11-July 11 tournament. "There is a team and there are those who will come alongside," said Domenech. "They have to bring something; a bit of freshness, a bit of calmness, a bit of aggressiveness. Each in their own way can bring a little extra. "It is a sign for them that they are on the right path." The 30-man list will have to be trimmed to 23 by June 1, 10 days prior to France's opening match with Uruguay in Group A. Mexico and hosts South Africa are France's other group stage opponents.
