 ATHENS, May 14 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A bomb exploded outside Athens' main prison on Thursday, slightly injuring two people and damaging dozens of shops and homes up to four blocks away, police said.

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest austerity measures last week and more protests are planned by labour unions. During the march, three people, one of them a pregnant woman, were killed when hooded youths threw petrol bombs at a bank in central Athens.
