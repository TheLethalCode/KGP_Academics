 RIO DE JANEIRO, May 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- There was no place for Ronaldinho or Adriano in Brazil coach Dunga's 23-man squad for the World Cup, which was announced on Tuesday, though, Ronaldinho still has a slight hope as he was named on a seven-player reserve list. Both players have fallen out of favour during Dunga's reign and were not expected to be selected for the June 11-July 11 tournament in South Africa. The 30-year-old Ronaldinho, part of the 2002 World Cup-winning team, made his last appearance for Brazil in April 2009 while Dunga had expressed concern over Adriano's fitness. "We did all we could to get him (Adriano) to full fitness, but in the end we had to make a decision," said Dunga. Ronaldinho's AC Milan team-mate Alexandre Pato was also overlooked, with Wolfsburg striker Grafite taking the fourth forward berth alongside Robinho, Luis Fabiano and Nilmar. "The players who I have called up enjoy my complete confidence," said Dunga, who is seeking to emulate Franz Beckenbauer and Mario Zagallo in winning the World Cup both as a player and a coach. "Unfortunately I was only able to select 23 players. " I judged them on their commitment, attitude, and the ability of the players to assume responsibility and at the same time inject passion into their performances." Brazil, five-time World Cup winners, have been drawn in Group G alongside Ivory Coast, Portugal and North Korea. Squad: Goalkeepers: Julio Cesar (Inter/ITA), Doni (Roma/ITA), Heurelho Gomes (Tottenham/ENG) Defenders: Luisao (Benfica/POR), Lucio (Inter/ITA), Juan (Roma/ITA), Thiago Silva (AC Milan/ITA), Daniel Alves (Barcelona/ESP), Maicon (Inter/ITA), Michel Bastos (Lyon/FRA), Gilberto (Cruzeiro) Midfielders: Gilberto Silva (Panathinaikos/GRE), Josue (Wolfsburg/GER), Elano (Galatasaray/TUR), Kaka (Real Madrid/ESP), Ramires (Benfica/POR), Felipe Melo (Juventus/ITA), Julio Baptista (Roma/ITA), Kleberson (Flamengo) Forwards: Luis Fabiano (Sevilla/ESP), Nilmar (Villarreal/ESP), Grafite (Wolfsburg/GER), Robinho (Santos) Reserves: Ronaldinho (AC Milan/ITA), Alex (Chelsea/ENG), Marcelo (Real Madrid/ESP), Carlos Eduardo (Hoffenheim/GER), Sandro (Internacional Porto Alegre), Diego Tardelli (Atletico Mineiro), Paulo Ganso (San
