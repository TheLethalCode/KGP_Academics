<TITLE> New UK foreign minister: Afghanistan is top priority </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Britain's coalition government will remain committed to the war in Afghanistan and keeping close ties with the United States, the new Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Wednesday. Hague, the former Conservative deputy leader appointed on Tuesday after his party struck a deal with the smaller Liberal Democrats. Despite differences on forging closer ties with Europe, Hague said that for now neither party is in favour of handing over more powers. Afghanistan remained the main focus, he said. "It is our most urgent priority here in my work to make sure that we have got a grip with what is going on in Afghanistan," he said in a BBC interview. Britain has 9,500 troops in Afghanistan and has been the United States' closest ally there since the 2001 invasion to oust the Taliban. However, the death of 285 UK troops, concerns over tactics and equipment levels and debate over what they are fighting for have made the war unpopular among many British voters. Pressure to reduce Britain's record budget deficit will not lead to immediate cuts in military spending, he said. The government will hold a review of defence policy and budgets. "In this year there will not be a reduction in defence spending," he said. "What happens in the future will depend on the strategic defence and security review." EUROPEAN QUESTION Europe will be one of the biggest potential sources of conflict between Hague's centre-right Conservatives and their centrist Liberal Democrat coalition partners. Many Conservatives are deeply opposed to greater ties with Europe, while the Lib Dems are strongly pro-European. Nick Clegg, the Lib Dem leader and new deputy prime minister, is a former member of the European Parliament who wants Britain to adopt the euro currency -- but only when the economic conditions are right. Conservative leader David Cameron said in February Britain "would never join the euro" while he is prime minister. The two sides have agreed not to join or propose joining the euro or to hand more powers to Brussels without a public vote. "All British governments sometimes face difficulties over European policy, but given the discussions we have had and the agreement that I have just outlined, we certainly don't start off with it as a difficulty," Hague said. "Neither party is in favour of handing any more powers to the European Union." Hague, who led his party to a landslide defeat by Labour's pro-Washington leader Tony Blair in 2001, said he wanted a "solid but not slavish" relationship with the United States. "No doubt we will not agree on everything," Hague said. "But they remain -- in intelligence matters, in nuclear matters, in international diplomacy, in what we are doing in Afghanistan -- the indispensable partner of this count
