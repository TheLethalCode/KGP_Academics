 MANILA, May 12 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Senator Benigno Aquino, far ahead in the Philippine presidential election count on Wednesday, said he will move quickly to fulfil his vow to investigate the outgoing administration of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Aquino said it was necessary to reform the judicial system as Arroyo, who has said she will ensure a smooth transition before her term ends on June 30, appointed Renato Corona on Wednesday as the next Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Aquino campaigned on a platform of fighting corruption and improving governance, and told Reuters on Tuesday he would tackle the budget deficit by reviewing government spending and boosting revenues through cracking down on tax evasion.
