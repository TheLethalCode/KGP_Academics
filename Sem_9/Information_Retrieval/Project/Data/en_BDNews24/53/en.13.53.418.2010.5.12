<TITLE> New law coming for civil servants </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)--The government has finalised draft of a new law for civil servants aiming to make the public administration dynamic. If the act is finalised, the civil servants would not need to be loyal to any party, H T Imam, who advises the prime minister on administration and establishment, told a roundtable discussion at Hotel Sheraton on Wednesday. The draft of the Civil Service Act will be sent to experts for their views and then placed before the cabinet, the former bureaucrat said. "A number of issues including recruitment, scope of work, promotion and training will be controlled through this law. They don't have to be loyal to any party, rather they will face action if they do so," Imam said. There are long-running allegations that public servants are forced to follow the dictates of the party in power or face persecution. The establishment ministry in cooperation with UNDP organised the discussion titled 'Citizens Charter for Improved Service Delivery'. Imam said the government has taken initiatives to reform the public administration to make it dynamic and purge it of corruption and partisanship. The adviser also unwrapped the cover of the draft of citizen's charter for the public administration. Opinions will be sought on the draft charter up to May 30 before it is finalised and every office will prepare its own charter. He said the 'digital Bangladesh' aims to reach services at people's doorsteps and the new charter will help people to be aware of their rights.
