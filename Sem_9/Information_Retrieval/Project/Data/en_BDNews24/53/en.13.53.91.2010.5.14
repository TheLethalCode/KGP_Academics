<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)Main opposition BNP on Friday accused the government of not providing temporary power supply for holding its upcoming rally at Paltan ground. The accusation was made at a press briefing at the party's metropolitan office at Naya Paltan. "We requested the Dhaka Power Distribution Company for short-term electricity supply for the rally in Paltan. But the government organisation said it cannot provide sufficient wire needed for that", Nazrul Islam Khan, a standing committee member, said. Khan claimed that this was a ploy to 'thwart the normalcy of the rally' scheduled for May 19. BNP on May 11 submitted an application to the DPDC to provide 100 KV of electricity for installing 250 mikes and giant electronic screens for chairperson Khaleda Zia's speech. DPDC rejected their plea and said that it was not giving any new electricity connections for the last three months. Khan, however, termed the DPDC explanation 'a lame excuse'. Responding to a query, the BNP leader said they needed no such prior permissions in case of their recently held rallies in Barisal, Khulna, Rajshahi and Chittagong. He also alleged that even the Dhaka Metropolitan Police authorities did not allow their request for publicity prior to the rally in Dhaka. "We will hold a peaceful rally in Dhaka. Our supporters from the every nook and cranny of the capital will join the rally." Khaleda, as she had declared from her Rajshahi rally on May 5, is expected to pronounce the party's anti-government programmes from the fifth divisional 'grand rallies' in Dhaka. Dhaka City Corporation mayor and BNP vice-president Sadeque Hossain Khoka, senior joint secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and other leaders were also present at the briefing. bd
