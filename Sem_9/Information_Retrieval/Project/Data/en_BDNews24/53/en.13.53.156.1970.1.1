 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US authorities are expanding their probes of past mortgage securities deals, with New York's attorney general opening an investigation into whether eight banks misled rating agencies, a source familiar with the matter said. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office on Wednesday served subpoenas on four US banks and four European lenders, the source said.

The reports come less than a month after the SEC charged Goldman Sachs with fraud over its marketing of a subprime mortgage product. Federal investigators are also probing Morgan Stanley, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The bank's chief executive, James Gorman, said he had no knowledge of any such investigation. The companies that rated the mortgage deals were McGraw-Hill Cos Inc's Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service, a unit of Moody's Corp. The New York attorney general's investigation was first reported by The New York Times. Spokesmen for UBS and Deutsche Bank declined to comment, and a spokeswoman from Credit Agricole declined to comment on the New York Attorney General's investigation. The other banks did not immediately return messages seeking comm
