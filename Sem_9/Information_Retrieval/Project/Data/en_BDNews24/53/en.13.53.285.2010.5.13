 LONDON, May 13 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Before he became prime minister, David Cameron was once asked what was his favourite joke. "Nick Clegg," he replied. The put-down came back to haunt Cameron when he was reminded about it during his first news conference as prime minister on Wednesday. Clegg, now Cameron's deputy in a coalition government, was standing right next to him. The way they handled the awkward question suggested that whatever their political differences, the two men had good chemistry. Clegg burst out laughing and looked quizzically at Cameron, who pulled a face and muttered that he had indeed once made the quip. At that, Clegg pretended to storm off while Cameron cried "Come back!" Clegg returned to his lectern and the two men smiled broadly, apparently enjoying their double act. Cameron's Conservative Party turned to Clegg's Liberal Democrats for support after an inconclusive election last Thursday. After five days of intense discussions, the two men took office on Tuesday night. After months spent lambasting each other's policies, Cameron and Clegg now stood side-by-side in the sunny garden of 10 Downing Street, promising a bright future together. Whether such light-hearted moments will be enough to relieve the inevitable tensions ahead remains to be seen. The two parties have radically different views on subjects as sensitive as immigration, defence and Britain's relations with Europe.

The scene was a world away from the two men's performances during televised debates that dominated the election campaign. Then, Clegg attacked Cameron as typical of the "old politics" he despised, while Cameron portrayed Clegg as a hopelessly naive novice who would endanger Britain. All of that was set aside on Wednesday as the two men bantered on the Downing Street lawn. Cameron and Clegg are perhaps helped by similarities in their backgrounds. Both men are 43, both have fathers who worked in financial services, both went to exclusive private schools. Their personal rapport may prove crucial to making the coalition work at times when the parties' MPs will find themselves at loggerheads over policy issues. But on this upbeat first outing, Cameron and Clegg seemed ready to make light of even the thorniest problems. Asked about an upcoming by-election in a constituency where a Conservative and a Liberal Democrat candidate would be competing, Cameron said the two parties could perhaps save on petrol costs by sharing a car. Clegg chuckled at the id
