 Dhaka, May 14 (bdnews24.com)At least 11 taxicab drivers were injured on Friday in police beating while trying to besiege Tejgaon Police Station for release of six colleagues. Taxicab drivers fought pitched battles with police on Thursday on Dhaka streets over requisition of vehicles, leaving 20 people, including a policeman, injured. Dhaka Metropolitan Police have launched an inquiry into Thursday's clash. Tejgaon police chief Mahabubur Rahman told bdnews24.com that they had dispersed the demonstrating drivers at 1pm on Friday. bdnews24.com photographer Nashirul Islam saw 10 taxicab drivers and a passer-by injured. Over 200 taxicab drivers demonstrated in front of the police station and pelted the police with stones. The demonstrators also set fire to two taxicabs running past the station at about 1pm. No taxicab drivers, however, was arrested on Friday, the police officer said. Trouble began on Thursday afternoon when a traffic sergeant signaled a taxicab driver to pull up at Sonargaon roundabout but the driver left his vehicle and ran away. A police driver later drove the cab and put it beside the underpass of Karwanbazar. Some seven or eight taxicab drivers gathered there in a little while and parked their cabs haphazardly. Taxicab drivers later exchanged heated words with the police driver and beat him up. Police officials on duty around rushed to the spot and swooped on the drivers. Some vehicles were also vandalised during the clash. Police reinforcements arrived soon and brought the situation under control. Police arrested six drivers and seized four taxicabs at the scene. Taxicab drivers alleged that the traffic sergeant got angry with the taxicab driver for pulling up a little far away from where he had signalled him to. The policeman slapped and rebuked the driver. Other taxicab drivers came to the scene and then the police sergeant also beat them, they also alleged. A taxicab driver Salauddin said traffic police requisition their cabs two or three times every month and keep them for more than half a month without paying any money. INQUIRY OPENS Dhaka Metropolitan Police have launched an inquiry into Thursday's clash. The deputy traffic commissioner (west) will head the probe committee, a DMP statement said on Friday. The committee was formed after the publication of three photos and reports in the daily Manabzamin on Friday, which caught eyes of DMP, added the statement signed by the additional deputy police commissioner, media and community service of DMP. It also said the policemen, found guilty in the investigation, will face departmental action. bdne
