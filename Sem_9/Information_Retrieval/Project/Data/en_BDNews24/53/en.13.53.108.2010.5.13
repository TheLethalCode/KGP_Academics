 Moulvibazar, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  The management of Dholoi tea garden at Kamalganj upazila in Moulvibazar has closed down the tea garden over a dispute centring around the appointment of a managerial clerk. The announcement of a "lockout" came on Thursday as the management failed to resolve the dispute over the appointment of Barun Dev from nearby Katabil tea garden, Babul Kumar Sarcar, manager of the garden, told bdnews24.com. The tea garden's workers were demanding that one of them should be appointed to the post. The tea garden's panchayet committee head Gouranga Nayek said the management had triggered the protest by appointing Barun ignoring its demand. Garden officials said Barun had not been able to join his assignment on Friday in the face of workers' opposition. They said around 600 male and female workers staged a sit-in protest on Saturday in front of the manager's office demanding cancellation of Barun's appointment and resignation of Babul. They also confined Moniruzzaman, assistant manager of the garden, to his office. MM Islam, deputy general manager of the tea garden, sat with workers' leaders several times to try and settle the dispute but had failed. bdnew
