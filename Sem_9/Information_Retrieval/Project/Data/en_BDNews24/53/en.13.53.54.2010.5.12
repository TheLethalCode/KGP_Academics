<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com)-- Striking launch workers are refusing to go back to work even though the shipping minister is threatening to cancel their licences if they do not call off the stoppage and return to work by Thursday afternoon. In a press briefing on Wednesday, he said, "The workers who do not start working by 5pm (Thursday) will lose their future opportunity to work. Their licence will be cancelled." He spoke as the ongoing strike by a section of water transport workers, which entered its fifth day on Wednesday, appears to be seriously impacting both sea and air ports. The minister termed the strike as 'politically motivated' and urged the workers to sit with the government to resolve the issue. He urged launch owners to operate their vessels without any fear and assured them of government support. Shajahan said that the Noujan Sramik Federation have called four strikes in the last 17 months and alleged that the federation leaders do so simply for their own selfish interests. He added that the government would not allow anyone to take advantage of the strike and if the workers started work no workers would be arrested. State minister for labour Monnujan Sufian, who was also present at the press conference termed the strike as "illegal". She said that if the workers do not agree to the new wage scale then there is opportunity to sit in meetings concerning this. The problem has to be solved through dialogue and there is no other alternative, she added. In reaction, Noujan Sramik Federation treasurer Abdul Malek told bdnews24.com that the labourers would not resume work leaving their activists behind bars. "Let them (the government) cancel our licenses if they can. We will continue our programmes," Malek said. Meanwhile, a maritime transport directorate circular, signed on Wednesday by director general Bazlur Rahman, said that licences of workers who would not join their respective workplace before 5pm on May 13 would be cancelled. Badiuzzaman Badal, senior vice-president of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport (Passenger Carriers) Agency, however, told bdnews24.com that the owners had decided to resume their transportation despite the ongoing strike. Badal was asked how water transport could continue with no skilled masters and drivers. In reply he said, "Many of the drivers and masters have already rejoined work. Those workers who will not join before the government deadline expires might be discharged." IMPACT ON WATERWAYS At the press conference, the shipping minister said that the situation is becoming normal. He claimed from Wednesday morning unloading has started at the Chittagong port and launches and ships are travelling from different terminals. He claimed that the number of passengers is rising as fear about the strike has started to fade away. bdnews24 correspondents report that unloading at Mongla port is almost at a halt and least 23 ships are waiting at the outer anchorage of the Chittagong port for unloading. Kazi Abdus Salam, assistant manager (Traffic) of the Mongla port, said although five ships carrying food, and one ship carrying fertiliser have anchored at the port, they are not being unloaded as work at the mooring has been suspended for the last five days. Unloading from a container ship is going ahead as it anchored at the jetty, he told bdnews24.com. Nearly 200 cargo ships, coasters and barges are sitting idle in and around the Mongla port. Syed Forhad Uddin Ahmed, secretary of the Chittagong Port Authority, told bdnews24.com that 23 ships are waiting at the outer anchorage of the port and failing to unload as the lighter vessels used for this purpose are not available due to the strike. However, our correspondents do report that most of the passenger launches scheduled to leave Sadarghat terminal have already left. In Sadarghat seven out of ten launches scheduled to leave the terminal had left by 11am. A total of 16 launches arrived at the terminal, said traffic inspector of Sadarghat Mahtab Uddin. IMPACT ON AIRPORTS Shahjalal International Airport had notified all operators that it would not be possible to refuel aircraft after midnight Tuesday given their low stock. On Tuesday, the director of Shahjalal International Airport, Wing Commander Sayeedul Hasan Khan, told bdnews24.com citing a notice dated May 9 from Padma Oil, the main supplier of jet fuel, that the strike has prevented oil transportation and unloading from tankers. BACKGROUND The strike started on Friday midnight as the Noujan Sramik Federation rejected a government announcement of a new pay scale increasing wages by between 50 to100 percent against a demand from them of a 300-350 percent rise. Some unions have already agreed to the pay hike. Shipping minister Shajahan, however, had termed the strike 'irrational' as it was called even after declaring the new pay scale. On Sunday, the minister urged upon the workers to call off the strike and sit in a meeting. The workers rejected the call and demanded the resignation of the minister. On Monday, the federation's acting president Shah Alam was arrested in a case for vandalising the office of the pro-government Noujan Sramik League which had filed a case on Sunday against 125 federation members. Abul Kashem Master, joint secretary of the Noujan Sramik Federation, told bdnews24.com that they would continue with the strike until their leader Shah Alam was released and their demands were met. bdnews24.c
