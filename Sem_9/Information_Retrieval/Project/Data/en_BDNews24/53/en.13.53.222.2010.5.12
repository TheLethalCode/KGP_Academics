 LONDON, May 12 (bdnews24.com/AFP) -- England coach Fabio Capello insists Jamie Carragher has been given no guarantees he will go to the World Cup and also revealed he failed with an attempt to persuade Paul Scholes to come out of retirement. Capello named Carragher in his provisional 30-man squad for the World Cup on Tuesday after convincing the Liverpool defender to come out of his self-imposed international exile. But he was unable to do the same with Manchester United midfielder Scholes, who snubbed the Italian's advances in favour of spending the close-season with his family. Carragher retired from England duty in 2007 after growing unhappy at his lack of first-team chances during the reigns of Sven Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren. The 32-year-old later admitted in his autobiography that he felt worse when he lost a Liverpool match than he did when England lost. Capello's need for fit defenders meant he overlooked that comment but he is adamant he has made no promises to Carragher, who will have to prove his worth during England's training camp in Austria and two friendlies against Mexico and Japan before the squad is trimmed to a final 23 by June 1. "No, absolutely. He is one of 30 players," Capello said. "During the training camp I will evaluate all the players and take a decision." Capello first made contact with Carragher two months ago and received a positive response from the star two weeks ago. "I select him because he is a really really good player," Capello added. Capello's desire to bolster his midfield with another experienced campaigner in the absence of injured LA Galaxy winger David Beckham convinced him to try to bring Scholes, 35, out of his six-year international retirement. "It was up to him. He said 'no, I prefer to stay with my family'. I tried," Capello shrugged. Capello has also brought Ledley King into the squad even though the Tottenham centre-back has never played for England under the Italian due to a knee injury which prevents him training and limits the times he can play games in quick succession. However, the England boss believes King proved his fitness by playing four times in 15 days for Tottenham at the end of the Premier League season. "We have been monitoring him for a long time because he is one of the very best English defenders," Capello said. "In the past 15 days he has played four games so he is good. He is a really important defender." Capello included Manchester City midfielder Gareth Barry, who had been ruled out for four weeks with an ankle injury, after consulting his medical staff just hours before naming his group. "I put him in because his next medical check is on May 24, after this we will decide what to do. I hope he is ready to start the tournament," Capello said. Capello is also confident over Rio Ferdinand's fitness after speaking with Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, even though the England captain has hardly played in the second half of the season due to a series of injuries. There was no place for Fulham striker Bobby Zamora, who has impressed during his side's fairytale run to the Europa League final, and Capello revealed the player had effectively ruled himself out as he has to play with painkilling injections ahead of a likely operation on an Achilles injury. With so many fitness questions marks over his squad, Capello acknowledged he might have to compromise and take some players who are not 100 percent fit. "Yes, there are some players who are very important, they know my style and what I ask of them," he
