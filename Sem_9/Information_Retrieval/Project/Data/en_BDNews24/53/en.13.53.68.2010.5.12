 Dhaka, May 12 (bdnews24.com) -- The four members of banned Islamist outfit Hizb-ut-Tahrir's Dhaka University unit, arrested in a case under the Anti Terrorism Act, were sent to jail on Wednesday after two days' police interrogation. Judge Md Ismail Hossain of Dhaka chief metropolitan magistrate's court ordered them to jail rejecting their bail petition in the afternoon when the investigation officer, Shahbag police station's sub-inspector Abdul Malek, produced them before the court. Following the order, the lawyers for accused Mostafa Ahmed and Kazi Salauddin pleaded for allowing them to sit for departmental examination to be held on Thursday. The judge granted the plea and let the accused use calculators, papers, pens and scales in the jail. Sub-inspector Ratan Sheikh, the general recording officer of the court, confirmed bdnews24.com about the court's allowing them to sit for exam. Shahbagh police arrested the four from Surja Sen Hall in the early hours of Saturday when they were distributing anti-state leaflets. A case was filed against them under the Anti Terrorism Act of 2009. The accused are Abdul Hai, son of Md Kadir of Nabinagar in Brammanbaria; Mohasin Hossain, son of Sirajul Haque of Kandal Masterpara village under Langalkot upazila in Comilla; Fahad Bin Rashid, son of Harun-or-Rashid of Jhenidah; and Amirul Islam, son of Mokbul Hossain of Ishurdi upazila in Pabna. Earlier, on April 19 the police had arrested Hizb ut-Tahrir's chief coordinator for Bangladesh operations Mahiuddin Ahmed, also an associate professor of the Institute of Business Administration of Dhaka University, from his Green Road house. Mahiuddin had been allegedly trying to reorganize the banned outfit.
