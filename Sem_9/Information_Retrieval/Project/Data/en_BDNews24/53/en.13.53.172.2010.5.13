Bangladesh is becoming a part of history by being the second country." Police superintendent Abu Saleh Mohammed Golam Mahmud will be leading another 160-man contingent to the Haiti mission. Members of the two contingents received pre-deployment briefing at Rajarbagh Police Lines auditorium on Wednesday.
