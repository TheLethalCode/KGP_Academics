<TEXT>
 Dhaka, May 12 (dbnews24.com)The High Court has adjourned the hearing of a writ petition until May 17 relating to opposition leader Khaleda Zia's cantonment house. The bench of Justice Mohammad Iman Ali and Justice Obaidul Hasan gave the order on Wednesday. Khaleda's lawyer Moudud Ahmed said that since a plea was filed with the chief justice to move the writ petition from the current bench, the hearing should be adjourned until its resolution. Attorney general Mahbubey Alam said that the plea had been filed so that the hearing on the writ petition did not take place. Counsels of the BNP chief on Tuesday pleaded once again to shift the appeal from the current High Court bench. Led by senior lawyer T H Khan, a group of pro-BNP lawyers submitted the application to the acting Chief Justice Md Abdul Matin who is filling in for Justice Md Fazlul Karim, currently abroad. Justice Matin directed the lawyers to place the application before Karim after he resumes work. The bench of justices Iman Ali and Obaidul Hasan are currently dealing with the writ petition. This is the third such petition, filed within a month, although the previous two had been turned down. On April 11, it rejected an appeal by Khaleda's lawyers to stay the government order requiring her to leave her residence, and two days later rejected another application in which she expressed 'no confidence' in the bench. The same bench, on May 5, rejected the second plea. The original petition was filed challenging the legality of vacating Khaleda Zia's Dhaka cantonment residence. bdnews24.c
