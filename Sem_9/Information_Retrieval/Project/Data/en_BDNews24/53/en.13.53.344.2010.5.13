 Dhaka May 13 (bdnews24.com)-- Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has reiterated her government's determination to protect the 'religious rights' of all people in the country. "This government wants the people of all religions and cultures to live in the country enjoying the same religious rights," she said on Thursday when a delegation of Bangladesh Puja Udjapon Parishad met her at her office. Mentioning that Bangladesh was founded upon secularism, she said: "We believe in everyone's religious freedom and we'll ensure it." Highlighting the incidents of brutal persecution of the minority community after the 2001 national elections which the BNP won, she said: "Not only minority people, those who believed in secularism were also tortured." Hasina told the delegation that her government would finalise the Vested Property Act in consultation with representatives of minority community. She asked the members to submit a list of temples to the government so that they can be more easily protected. "Religious establishments are part of our heritage. We have to preserve them."
