 Dhaka, May 13 (bdnews24.com)  Prime minister Sheikh Hasina has issued a warning against those destroying the academic environment in educational institutions. "A certain group is conspiring to destroy academic environment in many educational institutions. They wouldn't be spared whoever they are," she said on Thursday. The prime minister was meeting with a Dhaka University teachers' delegation headed by vice-chancellor professor A A M S Arefin Siddique. The prime minister's deputy press secretary Mahbubul Haque Shakil briefed the media on the meeting. He quoted Hasina as telling the teachers: "The government is determined to establish academic environment in institutions and create a knowledge-based modern education system." She called upon the DU teachers to take the lead. Hasina urged the teacher community to raise the standards of education in every institution. "This is a hard thing to do but we have to do this for the sake of the nation." She said academic environment in educational institutions was destroyed during the BNP-Jamaat government. "Even forged results were published in different departments to benefit the party members." The prime minister's press secretary Abul Kalam Azad was present during the meeting. bdne
