 SEOUL, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Koreans vote on Wednesday in a presidential election expected to be won by a conservative former CEO who says he'll help business and get tough on North Korea, but whose leadership may be undermined by a fraud probe. The last legally allowed opinion polls a week ago showed former Hyundai Group executive and ex-Seoul mayor Lee Myung-bak on course to easily win the single, five-year term to lead the world's 13th largest economy. But since then a financial scandal has resurfaced which, though not expected to unseat him, could damage his political standing by making him the first president-elect to face a criminal investigation. On Monday, parliament voted to appoint a special investigator to look into charges that Lee, who denies any wrongdoing, was linked to an investment firm suspected of swindling millions of dollars from investors. Even if he is implicated, the outcome of the probe is unlikely to be resolved before the inauguration on Feb. 25. A sitting president cannot be prosecuted for such crimes. Polls close at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT), with a lower-than-usual turnout expected from the nation's 38 million voters because of Lee's daunting lead in a country used to close races in its four previous democratic elections. Turnout in 2002 was around 70 percent. Lee's closest rival is the left-leaning Chung Dong-young, who served in the cabinet of outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun and is seen as his heir. Chung trailed Lee by about 30 percentage points in last week's poll. If Lee is elected, it will end 10 years of liberal presidents in a county that only saw its first open vote in 1987. Since then, it has sent a former general, two dissidents who fought decades of dictatorship and a human right lawyer to the presidential Blue House. Lee would be the first businessman. He is likely to be less generous to North Korea, which has seen a strong flow of aid under the Roh government. Lee wants Seoul's largesse tied more closely to progress the North makes in ending its nuclear arms programme. Financial markets have been encouraged by Lee's pledges to make life easier for foreign investors and cut through the red tape he sees as stifling local business, especially the giant conglomerates that were behind South Korea's economic rise. Lee, nicknamed "the bulldozer" for his can-do style and who turned 66 on election day, says he wants to bring 7 percent growth. That compares with an average of a little over 4 percent during Roh's rule. But economists say Lee's target is a tall order for a country that is coming under increasing competitive pressure from neighbouring China while one of its biggest export markets, the United States, is looking at an economically tough 2008. Economists are urging Lee to implement painful reforms to help South Korea transform from a manufacturing and export-based economy and better develop the finance and other services sectors.
