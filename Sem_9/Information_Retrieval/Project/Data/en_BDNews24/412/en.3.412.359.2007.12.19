 JERUSALEM, Wed Dec 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel's Housing Ministry has drawn up a preliminary proposal to build new homes on occupied land near Jerusalem but Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's office said on Wednesday the plan has not been authorized. The issue of Israeli settlement building in the Jerusalem area has clouded renewed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians launched at a U.S.-sponsored conference last month.

Israeli Vice Premier Haim Ramon, a close Olmert confidant, criticized the draft Atarot-Qalandia proposal, suggesting it was conceived by low-level ministry officials. "These steps are unnecessary at this stage ... The road to building a neighborhood like this is very long, and these things are not helping negotiations," Ramon told Israel Radio. Erekat said he spoke by phone to representatives from the Quartet of Middle East mediators -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- and asked them to put pressure on Israel to halt all settlement activity as called for under the long-stalled 'road map' peace plan. The road map calls for Israel to halt all settlement activity, including so-called natural growth, and for the Palestinians to rein in militan
