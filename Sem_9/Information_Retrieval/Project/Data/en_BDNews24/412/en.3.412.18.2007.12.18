 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former president AQM Badruddoza Chowdhury Tuesday apologised to the nation for his failure to try 'war criminals' and asked the government to put them on trial. "Today I apologise to the people of the country in public because we failed to try war criminals of 71 when we were in power," Chowdhury said at a Victory Day discussion at the Institute of Diploma Engineers in the afternoon. The chief of Bikalpadhara Bangladesh said the previous political governments should apologise too. Chowdhury, a former senior BNP leader, was the constitutional figurehead of the state from Nov 14, 2001 to June 21, 2002. "All who carried out killings, rapes, lootings and arsons during the liberation war are war criminals. Their crimes cannot be forgiven. "The war criminals of the World War II are still being searched out and tried. Why isn't it possible in our country? The government has to take the initiative to try war criminals." He said the interim government did many good things. "It will be another good job accomplished if the trial of the war criminals is arranged." The former president advised the government to sit with political parties to overcome the economic depression and rein in the runaway prices of essentials goods. Chowdhury said the national leaders of the country such as Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Maulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani, MAG Osmani, Ziaur Rahman, Sher-e-Bangla AK Fazlul Huq and Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy had been made made controversial. The nation should pay due respect to them, he added. bdnew
