<TEXT>
 VILNIUS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Kirkilas was quoted on Tuesday as saying his Social Democratic Party was in favour of an opposition proposal for an early national election. Kirkilas said the minority centre-left coalition government he has led since mid-2006 could not act due to lack of support in parliament, local television reported. "It is impossible for the minority government to carry on in these circumstances ... It was the main reason of our decision (to support an early election)," Kirkilas told LNK television. The Social Democratic Party's leadership had decided to instruct its members of parliament to vote for an early election, the television reports said. Parliament can vote on a motion this week or in mid-January. The opposition said last week the government had lost the confidence of the country and had to go. Inflation in Lithuania hit a decade record of 7.8 percent in November, and several thousand protesters marched through the capital Vilnius last month to urge the government to stop prices from rising or increase social benefits and pensions. Rising inflation prevented Lithuania from joining the euro zone at the beginning of this year. The Baltic country joined European Union and NATO in 2004 after regaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.
