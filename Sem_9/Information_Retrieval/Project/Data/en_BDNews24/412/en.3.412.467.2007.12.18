 WASHINGTON, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A US judge on Tuesday scheduled a hearing into whether the CIA violated a court order by destroying videotapes of the harsh interrogations of two terrorism suspects. US District Court Judge Henry Kennedy, who in 2005 had ordered the government to preserve information on prisoner mistreatment at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, set the hearing for Friday, overriding government objections. Lawyers for a group of Guantanamo Bay inmates had requested the hearing to learn whether the government had complied with the preservation order. The CIA last week disclosed that it had destroyed hundreds of hours of interrogation tapes, prompting an outcry from congressional Democrats and human rights activists. The sessions recorded on the tapes were believed to have included a a form of simulated drowning known as waterboarding, which has been condemned internationally as torture. The Justice Department last week urged Kennedy not to investigate the videotapes. The department said there was no evidence the interrogation subjects, including suspected al Qaeda lieutenant Abu Zubaydah, were at Guantanamo at the time. The CIA said it destroyed the tapes lawfully and did so out of concern for the safety of agents involved if the recordings were ever made public. The White House as repeatedly denied that the United States tortures terrorism suspects.
