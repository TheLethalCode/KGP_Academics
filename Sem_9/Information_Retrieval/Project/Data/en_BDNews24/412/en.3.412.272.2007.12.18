<TITLE> Lebanon's Hariri blames stalemate on Syria </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIRUT, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The leader of Lebanon's governing coalition has accused Syria of seeking to drag out the political limbo surrounding the election of a new president. Saad al-Hariri told Tuesday's al-Nahar newspaper: "What happened in parliament proves that Syria is still trying to prolong the vacuum in the Lebanese presidency." The presidency has been vacant since Nov. 23 when the term of pro-Syrian Emile Lahoud ended -- the first such hiatus since the 1975-90 civil war. The presidential election in parliament was postponed for a ninth time on Monday, even though the anti-Syrian governing coalition and its Damascus-backed opponents have agreed on army chief General Michel Suleiman as the next president. They are at odds over how to share power once Suleiman is elected and also over how to amend the constitution to allow a senior public servant to become president. The new cabinet will be formed after the new head of state is elected. But the opposition, led by Hezbollah, wants guarantees it will have at least a third plus one of the seats in the government before it will attend the presidential election. There can be no quorum for the vote without a deal. Hariri, a governing coalition heavyweight, said he supported a formula whereby the new president would have a decisive say in government decisions by allocating him seats in cabinet. "Our position is commitment to the president having the balancing vote in cabinet," Hariri told al-Nahar. The opposition should not have the seats needed for it to veto government decisions and the governing coalition should not have the two-thirds required to impose its will, he said. Suleiman was appointed army chief in 1998 when Syria controlled Lebanon. He has good ties with Hezbollah.
