 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Technology Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (BTTB) is considering installation of a second landing station for the submarine cable to ensure uninterrupted internet connection, an official said Tuesday. In a discussion sponsored by the state-run telecoms agency, BTTB official Lt. Col. Ziaur Rashid Safdar said they felt an alternative arrangement was necessary in the wake of repeated cut-offs of the submarine cable inside the country in recent months. Presenting a paper, Rashid said the alternative arrangement was needed considering the possible demand over next three years, lack of chances for a second line under the existing arrangement and its possible cost. He said they had had six proposals for installation of the second line. The options are MCS Cable, TIC submarine cable, Asia-America Gateway Cable (AAG), SEA-ME-WE-3, SEA-ME-WE-5, SEA-SAME and South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Information Project. Other than these there are BSNL, Bharati, Reliance and VSNL for landline connections. The official said it was uncertain to get available connection from the consortium cable to meet the future demand. Bangladesh currently uses connection from the SEA-ME-WE-4 but its operations were not possible to expand because it did not reach Chennai in India, he said. The services were installed on March 21, 2006. Sixteen telecoms companies use the line in 14 countries. He said to use the SEA-ME-WE-4 services the country needed to spend US$35.1 million. Currently, the country annually needs to spend another US$1.5 million to maintain and keep the service running, he said. The country will earn Tk200 crore from the services in the current fiscal year, he said. "If there's a second connection the country's information technology sector will benefit enormously," he said. Aminul Hasan, managing director of the state-owned mobile operator Tele Talk, said any crisis could be overcome if a timely decision was taken. "We have to consider the proposals in light of the reality," he said. Abu Saeed Khan, the technology editor of bdnews24.com, reviewed the proposals and said the proposal of the TIC submarine cable could be a good option since it passed through the Bay of Bengal. "A second line could be installed through branch cable from it. We don't have too much time to waste. We have a crisis of the ship that works to install such a line in the sea. "Three organisations manufacture such cable. Setting up the second line either in Mongla or Khulna is justified. The whole coast does not face destruction in case of a natural disaster," he said. Mohammad Salam, president of the Internet Service Providers Association, said a V SAT could not be an alternative to submarine cable. "We have to think of the emergency time," he said. bdnew
