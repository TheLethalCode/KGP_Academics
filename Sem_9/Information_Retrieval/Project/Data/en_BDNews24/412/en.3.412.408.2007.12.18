Hundreds of people flocked to banks for last-minute withdrawals of cash from their accounts as Eid-ul-Azha has been set for Friday.

The lowest call money rate for the day was recoded at 9 percent, the official said. The call money rate is the interest rate that banks charge other banks or financial institutions on overnight loans. The banks borrow the loans from other banks to finance the shortfall of money created by festival-time demand. In the days before the previous Eid-ul-Azha, the second largest religious festival of Muslims, the call money rate had climbed to 30 percent. Corporate bodies withdraw their money from banks to make payments to their parties and festival bonuses and salaries to employees ahead of religious festivals every year, and people buy sacrificial animals to celebrate the Eid fuelling demand for money in the banking system.
