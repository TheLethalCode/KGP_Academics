 ALGIERS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, inspecting the ruins of UN offices bombed by al Qaeda in Algiers, said on Tuesday the world body would not be intimidated by the "terrifying" attack that killed 17 staff. "I am still shocked by what I saw," Ban, on a one-day visit, said after visiting the devastated site of one of the Dec. 11 bombings claimed by al Qaeda's north Africa wing. "The impact of the attack was terrifying," he said of the attack, one of twin bombings the same day which killed at least 37 people in Algiers. "We are not intimidated. All the UN agencies will continue their work in Algiers. I hope Algeria will bring those responsible to justice," he told reporters. "Terrorism is terrorism ... we must continue the fight to eradicate it." The attacks were the second big bombing this year in the capital of the OPEC member country, seeking to rebuild after civil strife in the 1990s which killed up to 200,000. Witnesses said Ban was driven in a heavily guarded convoy of vehicles to the city's Hydra district where he inspected crumpled blocks of masonry at the site of the ruined offices of the UN's refugee agency and the UN Development Programme. Reporters were not permitted to accompany Ban to the site. The second suicide car bombing on Dec. 11 damaged the Constitutional Court building in Ben Aknoun district. Al Qaeda's North African wing claimed responsibility for the suicide bombings, saying it had targeted what it called "the slaves of America and France". Ban also met President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, saying Algeria and the world body had decided to work together closely to fight terrorism. Ban, who said the two men also discussed climate change, illegal migration and the question of Western Sahara, added that the UN expected to obtain other offices in Algiers shortly. "The Algerian authorities assured me they will find suitable accommodation," he said. "They told me it will be ready as soon as possible." The United Nations has identified the dead UN employees as 14 Algerians and one victim each from Denmark, Senegal and the Philippines. Ban said at the time that the bombs were "a despicable strike against individuals serving humanity's highest ideals under the UN banner" and "an attack on all of us". UN Development Programme Administrator Kemal Dervis said during a visit to Algiers last week that the United Nations was boosting security at its offices around the world after Tuesday's attacks, but he said this would need more funding.
