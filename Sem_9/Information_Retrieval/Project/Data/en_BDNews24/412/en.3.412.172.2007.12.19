 WELLINGTON, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming will make a short return to limited overs international cricket on Sunday when he leads a New Zealand XI against Bangladesh in a Twenty20 fixture in Hamilton. The match will mark the final time Fleming will skipper a New Zealand team in a limited overs game, New Zealand's selection manager Richard Hadlee said. Fleming stood down as New Zealand's limited overs captain after the World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year, then was replaced as captain of the test side by Daniel Vettori. Teenage opening batsman Jesse Ryder and fast bowler Tim Southee have also been named in the side, which includes several senior players involved in the Chappell-Hadlee one-day series against Australia. "The game will be an opportunity for a number of Black Caps to play ahead of the (one-day) series against Bangladesh," Hadlee said in a statement. "It also allows the chance for some exciting emerging players. "Jesse Ryder is an undoubted talent at the top of the order, while Tim Southee is a very promising fast-bowler. "This match gives both players exposure to an international-class level of competition." The match will raise money for World Vision's Cyclone Sidr relief efforts. Bangladesh play a three-match one-day series and two tests against New Zealand, who are preparing for the final match of their own one-day series against Australia in Hobart on Thursday. New Zealand XI: Stephen Fleming (captain), Jesse Ryder, Jamie How, Peter Fulton, Ross Taylor, Scott Styris, Gareth Hopkins, Jeetan Patel, Tim Southee, Michael Mason, Iain O'Brien, James Marshall (reserve fielder
