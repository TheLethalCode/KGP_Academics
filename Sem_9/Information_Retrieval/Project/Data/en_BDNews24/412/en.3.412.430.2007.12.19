<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka magistrate Wednesday asked former LGRD minister Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan and two others to appear in court on March 17 in a case filed by a lawyer alleging a death threat and defamation. The two others who face similar charges are former state minister for LGRD and cooperatives Ziaul Haq Zia and former LGRD secretary MA Kashem. Advocate Mahbubul Alam Dulal filed the case with the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate's Court for Dhaka. The magistrate took the case into cognisance and summoned the three. The case dates back to a 2006 row between the LGRD ministry and the Transparency International Bangladesh. The plaintiff alleged that a group in the coalition government threatened TIB Trustee Board chairman Prof Mozaffer Ahmad, after his organisation branded the LGRD ministry as one of the most corrupt ministries in Bangladesh. After the TIB published the report, a group in the four-party coalition government threatened to sue Professor Mozaffer, the case alleged. According to case details, Mahbubul Alam along with other lawyers defended Mozaffer Ahmad and protested the death threat by publishing a statement in newspapers. Mahbubul Alam alleged that a gang had threatened him with death after bursting into his law chamber in Old Dhaka on July 17, 2006. The plaintiff claimed that it was not possible to file the case at the time as the "situation was not favourable". bd
