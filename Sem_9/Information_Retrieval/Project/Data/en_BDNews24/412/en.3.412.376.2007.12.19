<TITLE> South Korea likely to vote for businessman president </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - South Koreans voted on Wednesday in a presidential election expected to be won by a conservative former CEO who has vowed to help business and get tough on North Korea, but whose leadership may be undermined by a fraud probe. The last legally allowed opinion polls a week ago showed former Hyundai Group executive and ex-Seoul mayor Lee Myung-bak on course to easily win the single, five-year term to lead the world's 13th largest economy and end 10 years of left-leaning presidents. But since then a financial scandal has resurfaced which, though not expected to affect his election chances, could damage his political standing by making him the first president-elect to face a criminal investigation. "We need to change the regime that has been in power for the last 10 years," Lee told reporters at a polling station. On Monday, parliament voted to appoint a special investigator to look into charges that Lee, who denies any wrongdoing, was linked to an investment firm suspected of swindling millions of dollars from investors. Even if he is implicated, the outcome of the probe is unlikely to be resolved before the inauguration on Feb. 25. A sitting president cannot be prosecuted for such crimes. The National Election Commission said early turnout was down from five years ago, when the race was much closer. Pollster say they expect about 60 percent of the country's 37.7 million voters to cast ballots on Wednesday, down from 71 percent in 2002. Voting ends at 0900 GMT. Lee's daunting lead of 30 percentage points over his closest opponent in last week's poll has cooled enthusiasm in a country used to close races in the four previous elections since its first open presidential vote in 1987. Lee's closest rival is the left-leaning Chung Dong-young, who served in the cabinet of outgoing President Roh Moo-hyun and is seen as his heir. "This election is a battle between truth and lies," Chung told reporters when he voted. If Lee is elected, he will be the first president with substantial business experience to run the county. Voters have sent a former general, two dissidents who fought decades of dictatorship and a human rights lawyer to the presidential Blue House. Lee is likely to be less generous to North Korea, which has seen a strong flow of aid under the Roh government. He wants Seoul's largesse tied more closely to progress the North makes in ending its nuclear arms programme. Financial markets have been encouraged by Lee's pledges to make life easier for foreign investors and cut through the red tape he sees as stifling local business, especially the giant conglomerates that were behind South Korea's economic rise. Lee, nicknamed "the bulldozer" for his can-do style and who turned 66 on election day, says he wants to bring 7 percent growth. That compares with an average of a little over 4 percent during Roh's rule. But economists say Lee's target is a tall order for a country that is coming under increasing competitive pressure from neighbouring China while one of its biggest export markets, the United States, is looking at an economically tough 2008. Economists want Lee to put in painful reforms to help South Korea transform from a manufacturing and export-based economy and better develop the finance and other services sectors.
