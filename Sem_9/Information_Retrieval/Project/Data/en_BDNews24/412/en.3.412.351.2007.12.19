 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)The United Kingdom Wednesday said it expected the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh by the end of 2008. In a news briefing, visiting UK secretary of state for international development Douglas Alexander made it clear that his government was keen to see an imminent change. Alexander said he was also interested to know when the state of emergency might be lifted. He praised the government for steps such as separation of the judiciary from the executive, decision on a National Human Rights Commission and bringing down the number of extra-judicial killings by security officials. "We support the restoration of full democratic process as early as possible. ...we will welcome a clarification (from the government) how and when it will happen," said Alexander, who was on a two-day visit to Bangladesh. "We have asked for a clarification on when the state of emergency may be lifted," said British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury, who also spoke at the briefing. Alexander also announced a grant of $60 million in adaptation funds to cope with global warming and natural disasters. bdn
