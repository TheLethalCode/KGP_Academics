 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)Colombia-born pop superstar Shakira left Bangladesh Wednesday after her visit to the Sidr-ravaged region and Rajshahi as a Unicef global goodwill ambassador, a spokesperson said. The two-time Grammy Award-winning and seven-time Latin Grammy Award-winning artist arrived in Dhaka shortly after Sunday midnight with four others. In the cyclone-ravaged area of Mirajgonj under Patuakhali, she visited the Child Friendly Spaces (CFS) developed for displaced and psychologically imperiled children and participated in the distribution of family kits and warm clothes among them. "I'm sorry for what happened to you," she said as she hugged children and women during her visit to the Sidr-affected areas listening intently to their stories. "But things will get better again. I admire your resilience and your patience and how much you still have to give when you have so little for yourselves." Eleven-year-old Neepa, who lost both parents to the cyclone sang to Shakira and said she wanted to be a singer like her when she grows up. She told Shakira that the Unicef school she visits is the one source of "happiness and stability she has during this difficult time". "I came to Bangladesh to see the impact of the cyclone and to learn about Unicef's approach to education," said Shakira. "We visited a variety of education programmes, and I came away with a clear sense that education is a powerful tool to improve people's lives," she said. "By making a small investment in these children we can give them the opportunity they deserveand we can build a better, safer world." Foreign affairs adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury greeted Shakira Tuesday evening on her Bangladesh visit. They met over dinner hosted by Unicef Bangladesh representative Louis-Georges Arsenault. Iftekhar thanked Shakira for her interest about Bangladeshi children, the foreign ministry said in a statement. During her visit, which was kept largely under wraps, the singer stayed in Radisson Water Garden Hotel. Shakira visited Patuakhali Monday and travelled to Rajshahi Tuesday morning and returned to Dhaka around 5:30pm the same day. "The pop star has left Dhaka," Zafrin Chowdhury, senior communications officer for Unicef, told bdnews24.com by phone, without giving details on her flight schedule. On why Unicef kept Shakira's visit in secret, Zafrin had earlier said: "Everything happened according to Shakira's wishes." "She just wanted to see for herselfBangladesh," Zafrin said. Shakira visited Unicef's education projects for working and street children in Rajshahi. Shakira was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations children's agency in 2003. She is the youngest and first Colombian to serve as a Unicef global ambassador. Shakira had also worked for relief operations in other disaster-hit regions, especially in Latin America. bdn
