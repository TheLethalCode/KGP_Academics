<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court dealing with extortion charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wednesday fixed Dec 26 to hold a hearing on charge-framing, a lawyer said. Dhaka metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Haque made the decision in his court recently set up on the Sangsad Bhaban premises. "I have been informed that the next hearing on the charge-framing will be held on Dec 26," prosecution lawyer ABM Sharfuddin Ahmed told bdnews24.com. The judge made the latest decision after the Supreme Court on Dec 13 cleared all barriers to hearing the case in the relocated court. The court usually sits in the city's old part but the government shifted it to the Sangsad Bhaban area on security grounds. The court is close to the special jail where Awami League chief Hasina has been detained since July 16, pending trial. The defence lawyers had petitioned to the High Court against the government decision to shift the court and secured halt to the move on Dec 9. But the Supreme Court overturned the High Court decision, making way for the trial to go on. The charges involve alleged extortion of about Tk 3 crore from a businessman when Hasina was in office in 1996-2001. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana and their cousin Sheikh Fazlul Karim Selim are also accused in the case. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury filed the case on June 13, saying that he paid the money to the accused as they threatened to cancel a power plant project. Both Hasina and Selim are behind bars while Rehana has been shown a fugitive as she lives in London. All of them and the Awami League denied the charges, saying they were aimed at stopping Hasina from running for the next polls. bdnews24
