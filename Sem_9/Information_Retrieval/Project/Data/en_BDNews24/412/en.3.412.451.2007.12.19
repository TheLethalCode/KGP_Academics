 GALLE, Sri Lanka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mahela Jayawardene moved on to a watchful 71 to help Sri Lanka reach 211 for four at lunch on the second day of the third and final test against England on Wednesday. Resuming on 147-4, Sri Lanka did not lose any further wickets and added 64 runs during a testing 20-over session played out under overcast skies after the start was delayed due to overnight rain. Jayawardene's innings on a bowler-friendly surface has now spanned 194 deliveries and has included eight boundaries. Tillakaratne Dilshan, just recalled to the test team, was unbeaten on 45 at the break, a more aggressive innings spanning 61 deliveries and including seven fours. England's fast bowlers all bowled well on the second morning, maintaining a more consistent line and length than during the first morning, but were left ruing missed opportunities. Dilshan, on seven, slashed a chance to Alastair Cook in the gully that was dropped in the second over of the day and Matthew Prior missed a difficult low chance off Jayawardene late in the session when the Sri Lanka captain had made 66. Steve Harmison remained the most successful bowler with 3-39 from 18 hostile overs. Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 after winning the first test by 88 run
