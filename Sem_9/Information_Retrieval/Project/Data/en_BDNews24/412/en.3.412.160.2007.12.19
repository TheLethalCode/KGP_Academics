 MANILA, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine marines backed by air strikes killed at least six Muslim militants during an operation against rebels suspected of involvement in an attack on a US supply helicopter, military officials said on Wednesday. Two soldiers were killed in the fighting on Basilan island that started on Tuesday and dragged on for hours, with the last shots fired on Wednesday morning, Lieutenant Colonel Vincent Teodoro said. The militants belonged to the Abu Sayyaf, which President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has vowed to crush, as well as rogue members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which is involved in stop-start peace talks with Manila.

Muslim insurgents have been battling for some measure of independence from the largely Catholic Philippines for decades and despite long-running peace talks violence continues to flare due to the military presence, a gun culture and a tradition of kidnap-for-ransom and banditry.
