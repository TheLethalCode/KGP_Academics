 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladeshi bowlers gave a much improved performance and the team moved about with more confidence and energy in the field to restrict the State Northern Knights to 173/7 in a rain-hit second warm-up at Seddon Park today (Tuesday) before another spell of showers put a stop to the Tigers' plan to bat. The target for the Tigers was 201 in 41 overs under the Duckworth-Lewis system and on a pitch playing nicely the tourists would gave fancied getting there. But rain lashed Seddon Park just when the Bangladesh openers were preparing to come out. After 22 minutes at 5:20pm local time (10:20am BST) the umpires concluded that the ground will not be in a condition to resume the match, , according to tigercricket.com, the official website of the Bangladesh Cricket Board. The sky was overcast from the morning but Northern Knights' skipper James Marshall preferred to bat on winning the toss on the same pitch that had been used in Sunday's first warm-up that the home team had won by 7 wickets. Bangladesh had rested Mashrafe Bin Mortaza while Syed Rasel was out injured. Nevertheless Nazmul Hossain and Shahadat Hossain were on song from the start. Nazmul, playing his first game in New Zealand, found the perfect length and troubled the batsmen with movement off the seam. He struck first when Nick Horsley (18) hit a scorching uppish drive and Mehrab Hossain (Jr.) came up with a stunning catch at mid on (28/1 in 6.4 overs). Mehrab flung to his right with both hands and then with the ball popping out held on to it with the right hand. Nazmul then removed number three Daniel Flynn (5) who cut straight to Aftab Ahmed at point (42/2 in 10.6 overs). Abdur Razzak had experimented with flight and length in the first match to find out the right areas to bowl and decided that he would stick to his natural style in this game. With the wicket becoming skiddy due to the mild drizzle he found immediate results. The second delivery from Razzak hurried on to opener Bradley Watling's (30) pads and umpire Billy Bowden upheld the appeal for lbw (68/3 in 16.2 overs). Razzak was impossible to get away and conceded just 7 from his first spell of 5 overs. Farhad Reza got Marshall (21) caught behind with an away swinger (4/85 in 21.5 overs) before Mark Orchard and K Williamson steadied the innings. The first rain interruption came after 37.4 overs with Knights on 145/4. Following an early lunch the players returned to the middle to finish the 3.2 overs in a now reduced-over game. Orchard (43) was bowled by Razzak after smashing the bowler over mid-wicket for a six in the 39th over and Shahadat uprooted the stumps of Peter McGlashan in the next over before dismissing Ian Butler two balls later. Shahadat was impressive throughout and bowled with hostility and pace. His sharp bouncers were on the money and he was unlucky not to finish with more than two wickets. The Bangladeshi batsmen will practice tomorrow at Seddon Park in the morning to try and make up for the lost opportunity today. Meanwhile, pace bowler Sajidul Islam is expected to arrive in New Zealand tomorrow afternoon to replace Rasel. Rasel will however stay back to undergo further examination by specialists. The Tigers round off their preparation for the ODI series against the Black Caps with their last warm-up fixture against the Auckland Aces, the leaders in the ongoing first class competition here, on Friday at Eden Park Outer Oval. "We were much improved today. There was more movement and the fielding was very good. the bowlers pitched the ball up which we didn't do in the first match," said coach Jamie Siddons.
