 Maruf Mallick bdnews24.com Technology Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Eighteen companies have made offers to Bangladesh Telecommunications Regulatory Commission to set up an international internet gateway, as the deadline for taking part in the bidding expired Tuesday, officials said. An official, who spoke to bdnews24.com on condition of anonymity, said BTRC received the proposals from the companies but he would not say when a decision would come. Some 40 firms had collected application forms from BTRC, which invited bids in October, he said. Contacted by phone Tuesday, BTRC chairman Manzurul Alam confirmed the news to bdnews24.com. Forty-two companies had earlier proposed to set up three international gateway exchanges while 39 firms have shown interest in interconnection licences. One company will get the licence to initially set up two exchangesone in Dhaka and the other in Chittagong. Once installed, the gateway exchanges would break the monopoly of the Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board in international call business. According to tender terms and conditions, applicants must be Bangladeshis, and telecoms services providers have been asked not to join the bidding. bdn
