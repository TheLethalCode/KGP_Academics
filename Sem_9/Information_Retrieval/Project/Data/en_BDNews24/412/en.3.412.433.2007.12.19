<TEXT>
 MADRID, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy is to receive a contract extension as a reward for his outstanding scoring record. "We will agree a contract renewal in the next few days because that's what I promised him and because that's what he deserves," Real president Ramon Calderon told radio station Onda Madrid. "Players like him deserve to be rewarded for both their performance and behaviour. He is an extraordinary player and person and it would be great if he could end the season as top scorer together with (team mate) Raul." Dutch international Van Nistelrooy, whose existing deal expires in 2009, hit 25 league goals in his debut campaign last season to fire Real to their first Primera Liga title in four years. The 31-year-old former Manchester United striker has scored another eight league goals this season, helping the club go top of the table, four points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona. Calderon said he was so pleased with his squad he was no longer obsessed with trying to sign AC Milan playmaker Kaka, FIFA's World Player of the Year. "It might appear to be an arrogant thing to say but we've got such a strong squad that there might not be any room for Kaka," he said. "We've got a squad capable of winning everything. No one is going to leave the club nor are we going to sign anyone during the winter transfer window because the squad is absolutely complete. It is one of the best in Europe." Calderon promised to sign the Brazil international when campaigning to be elected as president last year
