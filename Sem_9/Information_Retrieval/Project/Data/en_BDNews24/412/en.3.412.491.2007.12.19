<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) -- The government Tuesday completed negotiations with the World Bank on a $100 million budgetary support proposal which the Bank offered following the twin floods and the deadly cyclone, the Economic Relations Division secretary said Wednesday. "We've successfully completed the negotiations," ERD secretary Aminul Islam Bhuiyan told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "The proposal will be placed before the WB Board on Jan 10," Bhuiyan said. The government began negotiating with the WB on the budget support Monday and it ended on Tuesday at the ERD. Bhuiyan said that the government would receive the budgetary support by January next year if the WB Board approved the proposal next month at a meeting in Washington. According to the finance ministry proposal, the fund will be used to recover the losses and damage caused by cyclone Sidr and to help minimise the pressures on the budget in meeting the import costs of additional food grains, rising petroleum and other commodity prices. Earlier last week, the ERD at a meeting with the local consultative group (donors' platform) said that it would need $400 million as budget support to minimise pressures on the budget following the cyclone. Of the $400 million, Bangladesh asked the WB to give $100 million. WB vice-president Praful C Patel, during a recent visit in Bangladesh, predicted that the international price shocks alone were likely to cost Bangladesh's economy $1.6 billion, while because of Sidr, another $2 billion. Rising international oil and fertiliser prices are putting an additional fiscal burden on the current year's budget. The global lender, in a quick response, offered Bangladesh up to $250 million assistance to cover immediate, mid-term and long-term needs following the devastation caused by the cyclone. Besides, the WB will give $25 million for livelihood restoration support that will be made available by April 2008 and $125 million for supporting the long-term vision of disaster prevention and management articulated by the chief adviser recently. bd
