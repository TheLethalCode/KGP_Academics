<TITLE> BB revises down GDP growth target </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)Bangladesh Bank Wednesday said economic growth would slow to 6.2-6.5 percent in the current fiscal year, hurt mainly by natural disasters and increasing prices of oil and food on the global market. The forecast came against the GDP growth target of 7 percent, set in the budget for fiscal 2007-08. Bangladesh recorded GDP growth at 6.7 percent in the previous fiscal year. The gross domestic product is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of the economy. It represents the total value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period. In a news briefing at the central bank's headquarters, governor Salehuddin Ahmed said the BB revised the projection, as the country's economy was severely hurt by twin spells of flooding, the Nov 15 Sidr, increasing oil prices on the global market and the government's anti-graft drive. "Apart from these factors, steps for various reforms have added to the crisis. It seems that the crisis won't be over so soon. But it will fade in phases as the central bank and the government have taken some steps," he said. Explaining his statement, the central banker said any reforms measure initially created some trouble but everything took shape in the long run. Earlier, various research organisations and international lending agencies predicted that the economy would grow at a rate lower than projected. The International Monetary Fund said the growth of GDP would stand at 5.5 percent while local research organisation Samunnay predicted the same. Salehuddin said the central bank was extra-cautious to avoid any food crisis in the country and released an adequate flow of money from its reserve. "About $18.4 crore has already been released. If necessary more will follow," he said. Over the criticism of his bank by some economists that what the government would do with a huge amount of reserves, the banker said: "A $5.4 billion reserve is not huge at all, but it has been kept to manage any crisis. Now it's working." He said he was unsure if the prices of daily commodities on the domestic market would decrease since the prices of food and other items continued to rise on the global market. bdnews
