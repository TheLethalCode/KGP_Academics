 LONDON, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday they had arrested a 19-year-old man in connection with an allegation that a woman was raped at a hotel where Manchester United players and staff were holding a Christmas party. Police said detectives began an investigation after a report that the 26-year-old woman had been attacked at the Great John Street Hotel in the northwest English city of Manchester in the early hours of Tuesday. "A 19-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of rape this evening after presenting himself to police. He remains in custody for questioning," said a spokeswoman for the Greater Manchester Police force. Reports on the BBC and Sky News said some players and their guests had gone to the hotel as part of the premier league club's annual Christmas party. No one at Manchester United could be reached immediately for comment. A hotel spokeswoman said the hotel was closed to the public but was likely to reopen on Wednesday. "We have had an allegation at the hotel and we are helping police with their investigation," she said. In a statement, police said: "Police are currently investigating a report of rape at a hotel in Manchester city centre. "At about 4.15 a.m., police were called to the hotel on Great John Street to a report that a 26-year-old woman had been raped. Inquiries are continuing." Police released no more detail
