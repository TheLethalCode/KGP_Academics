<TITLE> Ukraine's new PM seeks Russia meeting on gas </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 KIEV, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukraine's newly appointed Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko wants talks with Moscow on her long-held objective to eliminate all intermediaries in gas trade with Russia, she said on Tuesday. But she stressed that gas would continue to flow to Europe without any disruptions. Europe gets a quarter of its gas from Russia, 80 percent of which travels through Ukraine. "My position remains unchanged. There should be no intermediaries on the gas market," she told a news conference after parliament endorsed her appointment. Tymoshenko has long criticised the role of intermediary firm RosUkrEnergo as an opaque company that increases the cost of gas transit and said Russian gas export monopoly Gazprom needed to deal direct with Ukraine's state-run Naftogaz. "We have Naftogaz Ukraine which we will put back on a normal financial footing. On the other side, there is Gazprom and there are two governments, Russia and Ukraine. No one needs any intermediaries in this matter. And I think it is in this specific context that we will hold talks with the Russian side." "All gas issues will be taken apart in detail, all gas agreements that have remained secret will be studied. We have to unearth a massive amount of documents..." she said. Tymoshenko's fiery rhetoric when she had been premier for just seven months in 2005 contributed to worsening relations between Russia and Ukraine. Despite her departure from office, the situation peaked when Russia briefly cut supplies in January 2006, affecting some European countries, due to stalled talks on gas prices. This year, Ukraine has already agreed to a 38 percent increase in next year's prices. "Ukraine, as a gas transit state, will fulfil all transit obligations, without fail," Tymoshenko said.
