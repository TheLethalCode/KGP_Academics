<TITLE> China anti-graft Web site felled by "too many hits" </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 BEIJING, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Chinese government Web site encouraging citizens to report corruption crashed on its first day under the weight of too many hits. China's National Bureau of Corruption Prevention, formed in September after a string of high-profile scandals involving government officials, launched its official Web site (yfj.mos.gov.cn) on Tuesday. By the afternoon, the Web site could not be opened, the Beijing Youth Daily said. It quoted an official as saying that the "number of visitors was too large". The Web site was up later on Tuesday, the paper said, and had 12 pages of comments left by Internet users on its discussion board ranging from allegations of collusion between driving schools and government traffic bureaux to criticism of the Web site itself for being "done relatively crudely". On Wednesday morning the Web site was again down for a while. China has called on citizens to blow the whistle on rampant corruption in business and government, but investigators struggle to rein in officials who permit little direct oversight and do not have to answer directly to the public. China will draft a five-year plan to tackle corruption, the official People's Daily said in a separate report, citing notes from a meeting of the country's decision-making Politburo on Tuesday.
