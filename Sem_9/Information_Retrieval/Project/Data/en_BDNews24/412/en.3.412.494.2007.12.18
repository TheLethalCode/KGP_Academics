 BRUSSELS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Iran's main opposition exile movement on Tuesday urged the European Union to follow Britain's lead in removing it from an official list of banned terrorist groups. The People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran (PMOI) said a British court's decision to take the group off a blacklist would help its fight against a wider European Union ban. The group argues it could better nurture opposition to Tehran's ruling Shi'ite clerics if it was not banned in Europe. Groups on the EU blacklist -- which also include the Palestinian Hamas, Sri Lanka's Tamil Tigers and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) -- have their assets frozen. "We demand that the EU and EU countries respect the rule of law and remove the PMOI from the list of terror organisations," Maryam Rajavi, head of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an affiliated group, told reporters in Brussels. Britain's Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission ruled in November there was no evidence that the PMOI, which is also banned in the United States, had any terrorist intent. It said the PMOI should be removed from the British blacklist, and last Friday rejected the British government's appeal against the decision. British Home Office Minister Tony McNulty said he was disappointed with the latest ruling and that the government would take up the case with Britain's Court of Appeal. "I remain convinced that where terrorism is concerned, the rights of the law abiding majority and the overriding need to protect the public, both in the UK and abroad, must lead us to take such a cautious approach," he said in a statement. The PMOI began as a leftist-Islamist opposition to the late Shah of Iran and has bases in Iraq. Western analysts say the group has little support in Iran because of its collaboration with Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.
