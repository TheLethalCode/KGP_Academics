<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  A devastating five-for from pacer Delwar Hossain Tuesday fired Rajshahi to the National Cricket League's one-day title with two games to go. Rajshahi shrugged off their loss to Chittagong in the four-dayer to hand a massive 70-run defeat to the same opponents in the eighth round one-dayer at Rajshahi Divisional Stadium. Their southern neighbours Barisal geared up for the battle for the second position after drubbing Dhaka by eight wickets at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Khulna also followed Dhaka to concede an 86-run defeat to Sylhet at Birshreshthho Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium. After the eighth round, Rajshahi enjoy an unassailable lead with 14 points while Barisal joined Dhaka and Khulna in the second position with eight points each from as many matches. Sylhet are in the third position with six points while Chittagong are tottering in the bottom with four points from eight outings. Rajshahi vs Chittagong Chittagong folded to 172 in 37 overs after Rajshahi posted 242 all out in 47.2 overs. Pacers Delwar Hossain and Shafaq Al Jabir ran through Chittagong's batting order and the visitors never recovered after being reduced to 55 for seven. Middle-order Faisal Hossain Dickens stuck to one end with a run-a-ball 91 not out but hardly got any support from others, who fell in the face of a fierce spell from Delwar. Delwar returned five for 34 runs while Shafaq chipped in with two for 21. Earlier, opener Shakil Haider gave the hosts a decent start with 95 off 103 balls, studded with 10 fours and two sixes. Shakil was the sixth Rajshahi batsman out, leaving the side at 174 for six in 33.5 overs. Anisur Rahman (31) and Mushfiqur Rahman (22) then took their side to a decent total. Dhaka vs Barisal Mahmudullah Riad (50) and Nadif Chowdhury (51 not out) struck fifty, but Dhaka saw their innings end on 196 all out in 49.2 overs after opting to bat first. Medium pacer Arafat Salahuddin (3/38) wrecked the top order while Sumon Kumar (3/39) cleaned up the tail. Barisal, in reply, easily reached the target, thanks to a solid opening stand of 115 runs from Shariar Nafees (61) and Nasiruddin Faruque (55). After Nafees and Faruque were out in quick succession, Raqibul Hasan (36) and Mohammad Shahin (21) remained unbeaten to take their side to 197 for two with 16 balls to spare. Khulna vs Sylhet Despite a poor start, Sylhet put up a challenging total of 278 for eight in 50 overs, thanks to two fifties from middle orders Alok Kapali (73) and Golam Rahman (65). They together put on 77 runs for the fourth wicket before Kapali edged Nazmus Sadat to wicketkeeper Shagir Hossain. Rahman then paired with Sharifullah (34) to add another 70 vital runs for the fifth wicket. In reply, Khulna got off to a fine start scoring 73 runs for the opening stand but failed to keep the momentum after the spinners were introduced. They finally were all out for 192 in 45.1 overs. Leg-spinner Kapali led the rout snaring three for 45 while spinners Enamul Haq Junior, Nabil Samad and Imtiaz Hossain claimed two wickets each. Opener Nazmus Sadat top-scored with 83 off 78 balls clubbing 12 fours, but that could not stop Khulna, the league leaders in the four-dayers, conceding their fourth defeat in eight matches. b
