<TITLE> S Africa's ANC faces sea change after Zuma revolt </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 POLOKWANE, South Africa, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The unity and discipline that bound South Africa's ruling ANC through decades of struggle against apartheid has crumbled in a grassroots revolution that swept Jacob Zuma to top of the party. "Zuma tsunami sweeps away ANC old guard," the Business Day financial daily said in a frontpage headline, after Zuma humiliated President Thabo Mbeki in a leadership election at a party conference in the northern town of Polokwane. With the ANC politically dominant, Zuma is almost certain to become president when Mbeki has to step down in 2009. The ANC has had ideological divisions in the past, but this leadership battle has split it into Mbeki's conservative camp and Zuma's wing, backed by left-wing trade unions and the Communist Party. Discipline has been replaced by open dissent from young ANC militants, who identify with Zuma's populist message and are supported by many ordinary black South Africans, all feeling left behind as Africa's biggest economy has boomed under Mbeki. Zuma supporters barracked Mbeki's ministers and aides under a huge banner calling for unity, an unrealistic request for a party suffering from the worst rifts in its 96-year history. Previous leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Mbeki have been able to take for granted a leadership-driven culture that meant dissenters among the membership would quickly close ranks with party leaders for a common goal. In Polokwane, appeals for such military-like discipline have fallen on deaf ears. Zuma himself may wonder if the tide of party "people power" that he has ridden to the top could one day unseat him too. 'WHEEL IS TURNING' "We are seeing a new ANC emerging and a new generation of ANC leaders," said Susan Booysen, a political analyst at South Africa's Witwatersrand University. "The wheel is turning, and they are saying: 'Let's try something different'." Mbeki and his ministers, some of them veterans of the anti-apartheid struggle, have been jeered and interrupted on the convention floor by Zuma's supporters. In a scene that would have been unthinkable during the struggle against apartheid, Defence Minister Mosiuoa Lekota pleaded to be left alone as he was encircled by Zuma supporters and followed into the street. "Give a guy a break," said Mosiuoa, who was jailed alongside Nelson Mandela at the notorious Robben Island prison during the apartheid era. Even Finance Minister Trevor Manuel, widely seen as the architect of South Africa's post-apartheid economic boom, was heckled as he made a brisk exit after casting his vote. Zuma, who has waged a dogged two-year campaign to unseat Mbeki since being fired as the country's deputy president in 2005, is the greatest beneficiary of the ANC's changing culture. But ANC members, too, may be asking themselves if he will embrace the new spirit of democracy, or try to impose himself just as much as other leaders have. His campaign, relying heavily on personal charisma, offered few details of his intentions for either policy or leadership style. It is by no means clear that he will try to democratise the party. And if he does try to make sweeping changes to current structures or the ANC constitution, some members, especially current office holders and those with deep roots in the party, may resist. "If you have been used to closed meetings for years, democracy is scary," said Steven Friedman, an analyst at the Institute for Democracy in South Afri
