<TITLE> Boro output leaps, poverty still rises: FAO, WFP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sep 21 (bdnews24.com)A special report by FAO and WFP has estimated the current year's Boro production at some 17 percent higher than the previous yearbut poverty was still on the rise due to spiralling food prices, it said. The report said the rise in Boro output was due to favourable weather as well extra efforts of farmers and government in the wake of high prices and production loss of 1.4 million tonnes in the 2007 Aman season after two consecutive floods and Cyclone Sidr. However, it also estimated that increase in food prices had raised the number of 'absolute poor' by 7.5 million people, to a total of 65.3 million, and raised the prevalence of undernourishment to 45 percent. The FAO/WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission came to Bangladesh at the request of the ministry of agriculture from April 14 to May 6, visiting 37 of the country's 64 districts, to estimate national food production and evaluate food supply and demand so that the government and international community could minimise the impact of potential food crisis or insecurity. The mission's report said total cereal output in the 2007/08 marketing year (November/October)including 2007 Aman, 2008 Boro and Aus seasonswas estimated at 28.85 million tonnes or 5.6 percent above the previous year,. The 2008 Boro rice output alone was estimated at 17.54 million tonnes, up by 17.2 percent from the previous year and 29.3 percent above the five-year average. The national average Boro yield was estimated at 3.78 tonnes per hectare, an increase of 9.05 percent above the national yield for the previous year. The report said farmers planted more areas of Boro due to damage to transplanted Aman by floods during the previous season. The high price of rice in the local market also influenced farmers to cultivate each and every available plot for Boro rice, it said. The rapid increase in the planting of hybrid varieties played a part in raising overall yields and production, it added. Total cereal (rice and wheat) import requirement for 2007/08 was estimated at about 3.07 million tonnes, of which 2.57 million tonnes are expected to be imported commercially. Food aid received or committed is estimated at 155,000 tonnes; The mission made a number of agricultural policy recommendations including adequate supply of fertilisers during the planting period, extending the supply of electricity for irrigation and ensuring timely agricultural credit for farmers to buy best seeds, fertilisers and other inputs. It also recommended a significant increase in food security safety net assistance programmes. The mission, the first of its kind to visit Bangladesh in many years, held meetings with relevant institutions, including government, international agencies, donors, nongovernmental organisations and the private sector. It reviewed the crop production data from the ministry of agriculture and Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, and collected available data and information on food security from different sources. bd
