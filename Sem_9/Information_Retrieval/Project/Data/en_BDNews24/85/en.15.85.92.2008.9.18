 Tel Aviv,Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni secured a narrow victory on Thursday in a party leadership contest that sets her on course to succeed the scandal-crippled Ehud Olmert as prime minister in the coming weeks. But after a tense night of counting following exit polls that showed Livni cruising to a big win, party officials said the final margin over Shaul Mofaz, a former general who is now transport minister, was just over one percentage point.

"The good guys won," Livni, a one-time Mossad intelligence agent, told her backers within the ruling centrist Kadima party. Party spokesman Shmuel Dahan said: "Kadima today has a new chairman.

Two other candidates trailed well behind. Palestinian peace negotiators -- and possibly the sponsors of the peace process in Washington -- were among those applauding as early counts from local offices seemed to confirm a win for Livni, who is leading talks with the Palestinians.

Olmert, who telephoned Livni with congratulations, has said he will resign as soon as Kadima has a new leader. But the outgoing premier, who could be indicted for corruption, has also vowed to exercise his right to stay on in a caretaker capacity until Livni forges her own, new coalition government. That process, involving deals with ambitious Labour party leader Ehud Barak on the left and influential Jewish religious parties on the right, could take weeks or months. Many believe there may yet be an early parliamentary election, which polls show Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud would win
