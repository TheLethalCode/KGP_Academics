 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)Political parties have generally welcomed the announcement of the national elections on Dec 18 but criticised the chief adviser for avoiding "key issue of emergency". Smaller parties Saturday sang more in tune with the two major parties, the Awami League and the BNP, saying emergency should go before the national elections. In an instant reaction to the Saturday evening speech, acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman said: "The chief adviser did not say anything about (lifting of) emergency . "Fakhruddin Ahmed said all the right words but carefully avoided the key issue, emergency," Zillur Rahman told reporters at his Gulshan home after the chief adviser's televised speech to nation Saturday night. Zillur also sounded a caution on the chaos that could ensue with Upazila polls being held so soon after the JS election. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain also said he expected emergency to go. Delwar hailed the date for national polls ahead of the local ones but said, "Emergency must be lifted immediately. Fair election is not possible at all under emergency." He echoed the acting AL chief's position on the back to back elections, with the Upazilas going to polls days after the Dec 18 general election. Delwar said he was also worried that peace could be the casualty if Upazila polls were held so quickly after the national vote. The Communist Party of Bangladesh expressed "satisfaction" at the CA's announcement, while the Workers Party "welcomed" it. The Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal (JSD) said the government "deserves to be congratulated" for putting parliament first. Elections to the Jatiya Sangsad will be held on Dec 18, and to Upazilas on Dec 24 and 28, the chief adviser announced Saturday in his televised speech. The Awami League was critical of Upazila polls being held in less than a week. "Upazila elections will immediately follow the parliamentary elections. This will mean the elections won't be free. There will be chaos. There will be 100 per cent chance of disruption of peace," Zillur Rahman said. But the party's acting general secretary was more generous towards the caretaker chief, praising the burying of uncertainties surrounding the December polls. "We welcome the CA's speech. Any doubts created about the national elections have been eradicated by the CA's speech. We won't have any doubts about the national elections anymore. "The CA's speech has proved correct the statements the Awami League has been making all along. "The Awami League will start its electoral activities from tomorrow. AL will take part in the elections under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina." Rashed Khan Menon of Workers Party was equally welcoming, but added: "Creating the right atmosphere for polls depends on lifting of emergency." A "satisfied" Mujahedul Islam Selim of CPB also expressed his fears. "There are lots of reasons for apprehensions about fairness of the elections ... the CA himself has said in his speech the anti-corruption drive has slowed down ... which means compromise deals had to be made with the big parties to ensure their participation. "How much this election will be free from black money and what the results will be is not very hard to imagine," Selim said. Hasanul Huq Inu of JSD said it was deplorable that emergency would not be lifted. "It is not realistic to hold Upazila elections within 6 or 10 days' after JS polls," Inu said. The chief adviser did refer to the August 4 city and municipal polls when emergency rules were relaxed and said a similar step was on the cards ahead of the national elections. Fakhruddin said the government would act based on the need. "We have no enmity with the political parties. Nor do we have any conflict of interest or motive," Fakhruddin said. The EC decision on the dates and order of elections, he said, came in response to demand from political parties. "In this march towards democratic transition, in order to avoid conflict, showing respect to the wishes of most of the political parties, the Election Commission has decided to hold the parliamentary elections first," Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser also spoke of the several rounds of dialogues with the political parties. "We have had discussions with leaders of the two major parties. The two leaders have already announced their participation in the elections. "I had said in May in my speech to the nation that the parliamentary election would be held on a day in the third week of December," Fakhruddin said as he formally made the date public following an EC decision earlier in the day. bdnews24.com/sum/sm
