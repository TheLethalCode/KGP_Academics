 Chittagong, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP minister Amir Khosru Mahmud Chowdhury has backed calls for bringing Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina across the table to restore civility to politics. Chowdhury, who served as commerce minister of the four-party government for two years, also believes the current anti-corruption drive should contunue. His comments, to journalists at his Mehedibag residence in the city, came during his first public appearance since he returned to the country Sunday. He flew in to his hometown Chittagong Thursday afternoon. "There may be differences of opinion between political parties. But they must not stoop to levels only sworn enemies do. "Civility is required for transition to democracy. To this end, the leaders of the two major parties (BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina) should be brought to a meeting across the table." "Politicians must respect each other if they are to continue in this business." A caretaker adviser last week spoke of government intentions to bring the two bitter rivals together for a face-to-face meeting, The government has also sought help from a top lawyer, barrister Rafique-ul-Huq, who stood for leaders, now being tried on corruption charges. Both former prime ministers have already shown positive attitude towards the proposed meeting. On 1/11, Chowdhury said, "It was borne out of corruption and politics of conflict. It is never desired." He said that the success of 1/11 was not yet visible. "Its will be considered successful when it hands over power to a democratic government through an election." On the anti-corruption, he said: "It should continue. The ACC should be allowed to work independently." He refused to comment on the bails secured by businessmen and politicians who had been arrested on charges of corruption. Chowdhury, who went to Singapore in May last year after the anti-corruption drive started in the country, returned to Dhaka Sunday morning and got bail from the High Court in two cases GATCO and allocation of 18 government houses. "I came back and surrendered to the court because I felt an atmosphere in which justice could be expected returned to the country." He did not reply to reporter who asked whether such atmosphere had not prevailed before. bdn
