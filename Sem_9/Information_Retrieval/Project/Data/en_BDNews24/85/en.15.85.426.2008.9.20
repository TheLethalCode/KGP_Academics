<TITLE> Georgia, Wall St. overhang annual UN summit </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 United Nations,Sep 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A new chill in East-West relations overhangs next week's UN General Assembly gathering of world leaders, the first major international meeting since Russia invaded Georgia last month. The financial turmoil on Wall Street -- just about 4 miles from UN headquarters in Manhattan -- could also cast a pall over the annual week of speechifying, whose main theme this year is stepping up aid to impoverished countries. Cold War tensions at the world body, immortalized by a 1960 incident in which then Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev banged his shoe on his table, faded after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, leading many to hope for a new era of cooperation. But, while politicians from both sides dismiss talk of a new Cold War, the increasing self-assertion of an oil-rich Russia had begun to impact anew on United Nations business even before the August events in Georgia. Not only has the Security Council been unable to pass any resolution or statement on Georgia itself, where Russia's action followed a bid by Tbilisi to recapture a Moscow-backed rebel region, it has been paralyzed on other issues too. In July, Russia vetoed a Western-drafted resolution to impose sanctions on Zimbabwe over a violent election. Russia and China have also used the threat of vetoes to prevent meaningful action to oblige Myanmar to be more democratic. The new atmosphere may make little difference to the General Assembly's headline event -- serial speeches by leaders of the 192 N members that typically dwell on issues of interest to those countries. While President George W Bush will as usual speak for the United States -- his final address to the assembly -- Russia will again be represented by no one more senior than Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose speech last year was low-key. But the talk at the United Nations is of possible "spillover" from the Georgia crisis to other issues, notably the nuclear dispute with Iran, which will be discussed in the wings by the foreign ministers of six big powers. Western countries want to impose more sanctions on Tehran to try to force it to stop uranium enrichment. The question is whether Russia, never enthusiastic about previous rounds of sanctions, will this time stop cooperating altogether. FRICTIONS "In the aftermath of Georgia there is an impact on Russian statements on other issues, which we regret," Washington's UN Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad said last week. "We hope and expect with regards to the nuclear issue on Iran ... on which the (Security) Council has unanimously expressed itself -- at least without opposition from Russia -- that we can continue to cooperate on this issue." East-West frictions have also played into the underlying "North-South" tension at the United Nations. Although Russia's treatment of its neighbor Georgia has caused worldwide concern, some developing countries are not sorry to see Moscow standing up for itself again and checking what they see as the Western dominance of the last 20 years. Nowhere has this trend been more noticeable than among left-wing governments in parts of Latin America. Venezuela and Nicaragua have even recognized the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, following Russia's lead. A new General Assembly president from Nicaragua, former Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto, took over this week and announced a radical plan to try to trim the wings of the Security Council and give power to the assembly. Such a development would have incalculable effects on world affairs, enabling the developing-country majority to over-ride the big powers. But it has virtually no chance of success, since any of the big powers could stop it. Political disagreements next week will not stop countries paying lip service to the meeting's theme set by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon -- to reaffirm and boost commitment to the UN's Millennium Development Goals. That series of eight specific targets, ranging from slashing back poverty, hunger and disease to boosting education, is meant to be achieved by 2015. But a UN report released earlier this month said the world's richest countries are reneging on promises to boost aid, threatening the goals. The past week's financial markets mayhem, in which investment bank Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and the US government threw an $85 billion lifeline to insurer American International Group, is hardly likely to help, UN officials fear. Secretary-General Ban "is deeply concerned ... this could give a very serious negative impact to the overall capacity of the international community ... in realizing the Millennium Development Goals," spokeswoman Marie Okabe said on Thursday
