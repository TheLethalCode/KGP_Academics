 Chittagong, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Workers of Amin Jute Mills in Chittagong on Monday staged demonstrations and rallies at the mills premises to demand, among other things, unpaid salaries. They said they would start a strike in the mills on Tuesday. The workers at the rally at 11am asked authorities to immediately accept their demands. Lokman Hossain, Babul Miah, Md Mohiuddin and Zakir Hossain spoke at the really. However, no union leaders were seen in the workers' protest procession and rally. The workers demands include payment of wage in arrears for seven weeks and of 21 months' held-up salary, reinstatement of 23 casual workers, a stop to appointment of casual workers and making the job of casual workers permanent as per the circular of the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), the state-run jute mills regulator. A worker named Md Rafique told bdnews24.com the Mills authorities owe the workers seven weeks' wage. The wages for two weeks during the Ramadan and before the Eid are also due. Besides, the authorities are yet to pay five weeks' wage from last year. He said families of more than 2,500 workers are starving. "The wage of the workers will be paid if the BJMC pays us money," deputy general manager of Amin Jute Mills Abdul Malek said to bdnews24.com. He, however, could not say when the money would be made available. "The higher authorities are being reminded of the issue of wages in arrears every week. In every day's report the authorities have been told that the mills situation may deteriorate."
