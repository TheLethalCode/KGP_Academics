 MADRID, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leaders Espanyol lost their 100 percent record when they were held 1-1 at home by Getafe in the Primera Liga on Saturday. Earlier, Atletico Madrid registered their third 4-0 win in a row at the Calderon, when they hammered Recreativo Huelva. Unbeaten Getafe had the better of the first period in Barcelona and took the lead when striker Manu del Moral scored from the penalty spot just after the break. The goal brought the game to life and, with tackles flying in thick and fast, Espanyol levelled at a freekick soon after. Defender Sergio Sanchez scrambled a loose ball over the line and both sides had chances to win in a breathless second half. Espanyol are top with seven points from three games, one ahead of Atletico and two in front of third-placed Getafe. The rest of the weekend matches are on Sunday when champions Real Madrid visit Racing Santander and Barcelona seek their first league win of the season at promoted Sporting Gijon. Atletico were buoyed by their 3-0 Champions League win over PSV Eindhoven in midweek when they took to the field against Recreativo. They were leading after eight minutes when Argentina striker Sergio Aguero rose unmarked to head home from a freekick for his fourth goal in three matches over the last eight days. The home side were guilty of easing off but Portugal midfielder Maniche doubled their advantage just after the break with a powerful drive from outside the area. Miguel de las Cuevas set up the third for Florent Sinama Pongolle 12 minutes from time and the French striker bagged his second against his former club on a breakaway at the end. Atletico chalked up the same scoreline against Schalke 04 and Malaga in their previous two home game
