 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The chief election commissioner has said the dates for elections to parliament, Dhaka City Corporation and Upazila Parishad will be announced on Monday. "The Commission will disclose the dates for Jatiya Sangsad, Dhaka City Corporation and Upazila Parishad elections on Monday," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters Wednesday at the Election Commission Secretariat. But the schedules would not be announced now, he said. The commission would hold dialogues on Saturday with the BNP and two of its four-party allies, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote. "After the talks on Saturday we will meet with the chief adviser to let him know about the progress of the third round of dialogues. Then we will set the dates for elections," Huda said. He had earlier said the talks would be held Thursday. But the alliance parties, the CEC said, would not be able to make it on Thursday. He said his office would send letters of invite on Thursday to the parties. The alliance earlier boycotted the dialogue on the grounds that they would join in only in presence of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who had been detained on corruption charges. Khaleda, facing a slew of corruption charges, was released on bail on Sept 11. On whether Upazila polls would be held ahead of general elections the Chief election commissioner said, "We had a plan before. But now the plan is not working. We have to make a new plan." The commissioners and officials of the Election Commission Secretariat would work on spacing the elections. Replying to a query he said: "The chief adviser will not announce elections dates. The chief election commissioner, in line with Representation of Public Order, declares the dates." Meanwhile, the chief adviser, Fakhrudin Ahmed, is likely to address the nation on various issues including the elections schedule after he returns home from China, an adviser has said. Local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal told reporters today that the Election Commission would however announce the final date and schedule of the elections. "The chief adviser should address the nation so that the people do not lose faith in the upcoming elections," the adviser said. The CEC had earlier told reporters: "We will also sit with Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote the same day. But they will have to send letters informing us of their interests to hold talks." Jamaat-e-Islami sent a letter to the commission on Wednesday seeking a convenient time and schedule to join the dialogue. Islami Oikyo Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami told bdnews24.com that they would also send a letter to the commission on Wednesday to let it know that they were eager to attend the dialogue. bdnew
