<TEXT>
 MADRID, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Newcomers BATE Borisov got away lightly with a 2-0 defeat against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in their Champions League debut in Group H on Wednesday. Sergio Ramos gave the nine-times European champions an early lead and they threatened an avalanche of goals but BATE held firm until early in the second half. Ruud van Nistelrooy doubled the advantage with his 54th goal in the competition and any thoughts of a fightback by the team from Belarus effectively disappeared when defender Anri Khagush was sent off soon after.

The ball rebounded off one of his defenders and Dutch striker Van Nistelrooy tapped in the loose ball in the 57th. Soon after, BATE lost Khagush when he collected his second yellow card for another foul on Arjen Robben, who had given him a torrid time all night.
