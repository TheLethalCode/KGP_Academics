 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)The deadline for income tax returns has been extended by a month to Oct 31, the National Board of Revenue chairman said Saturday. "We decided to extend the deadline for income tax returns till Oct 31, taking into account the month of Ramadan, Eid and Durga Puja falling in September and early October," NBR chief Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com. The date has also been extended because of floods in many parts of the country, he added. The previous deadline was Sept 30. Majid said many sections of the public, including the business community, had requested the NBR to extend the date in light of religious holidays and the flood situation. The NBR took all into consideration and sent a proposal to the finance adviser for a month-long extension of the deadline. The revenue chief told bdnews24.com that the finance adviser approved the proposal Saturday morning. The Sept 30 annual deadline for income tax returns is almost always extended. Last year, the date was also extended by a month. According to the income tax ordinance, a person or establishment can personally request an extension for filing income tax returns by applying to the local tax official but only if they have a credible reason. bdnews24.c
