 NEW DELHI, Sun Sep 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Police arrested four Muslims, including three accused of planting bombs that killed 23 people this month in New Delhi, officials said on Sunday. The four were picked up during overnight raids in the city. The arrests come two days after police shot dead two men, one of whom they said organised the bombings and also deadly attacks in Jaipur and Ahmedabad. "We have arrested four people -- three are bombers and one is a caretaker of the building where they were hiding," said Rajan Bhagat, spokesman of Delhi Police. The Indian Mujahideen group has said it carried out the Sept. 13 bombings. It has claimed other attacks in recent months as well.

They are also looking for a man they named as Qayamuddin, also known as Ashfaque. With the latest arrests, the total number of people held by police over the New Delhi attacks has gone up to six
