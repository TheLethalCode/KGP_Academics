 Chittagong, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile courts on Monday found tins of Chinese milk powder still on sale in Chittagong city, despite a ban on the seized brands and firms facing legal action for marketing the banned products. Executive magistrate Sanjida Sharmin told bdnews24.com that six tins of Yasili-1 and Yasili-2 were seized from Arif Departmental Store at Singapore Bangkok Market in Agrabad, and two Baby Sweet milk powder tins were seized from Shams Store in Hazipara. Magistrate Sanjida said representatives from Alway Trading Company that marketed the banned brands had withdrawn the products from many shops, but not all. She said the three brands of powder milk imported from China were banned as they did not pass approval of Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution. Arif Departmental Store was fined Tk 7,000 and Shams Store was given a warning for selling the products, she added. Mobile courts also raided shops at Agrabad Lucky Plaza, Wel Mart, GEC Crossing, Khulshi Market and the city's Barkal area on Monday. A BSTI team confiscated tins of the Chinese milk powder brands from different shops in the port city on Saturday, being marketed without BSTI's clearance. The seized milk powder was sent to the BSTI laboratory for testing, though this may take some time as the institute does not at present have the equipment to test for the harmful substance melamine that has caused the recent milk powder scare in China. The commerce ministry said Sunday it might take up to seven days to test the milk products, though the government has asked Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution to test all imported milk powder. The ministry has also ordered legal action against Alway Trading Company and Mou Enterprise for selling powdered milk not approved by the BSTI. The government said the milk powder brands 'Sweet Baby' by Sun Care and 'Yashilli-1' and 'Yashilli-2' of Yashilli company were suspect as Chinese authorities had earlier informed Bangladesh about the existence of harmful substances in the milk products of the two companies. bdnews24.
