 Madrid,Sep 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Seven people were slightly hurt on Sunday after a car bomb exploded outside a police station in the town of Ondarroa in the Basque Country in northern Spain, police said. Three police officers were among those injured after the large bomb went off at about 4.30 a.m. (10:30 p.m. EDT on Saturday), and the other four were passers by, a spokesman for the Basque Country police in Bilbao said. None of those hurt was in serious condition, although the bomb badly damaged nearby buildings. About two hours before the blast, another big car bomb exploded near the office of Caja Vital bank in the Basque Country capital of Vitoria, but no one was hurt, the spokesman said. Police had cordoned off the area in Vitoria before the first explosion, after receiving a warning call in the name of Basque rebels ETA but there was no call before the second blast. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades of armed struggle for traditional Basque lands in northern Spain and southwestern France. The attacks came just days before the regional government of the Basque Country was due to lodge a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights about the refusal by Spanish authorities to let them proceed with a referendum-style vote on the region's future. The Basque Country, which has its own distinct language and culture, already has considerable autonomy over areas such as health and education
