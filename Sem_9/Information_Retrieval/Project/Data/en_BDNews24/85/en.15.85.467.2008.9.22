 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  The government has decided to make struggling Bangladesh Shipping Corporation a public limited company, the home adviser said on Monday. "We have been able to turn Bangladesh Shipping Corporation as a public limited company. But it will take time to formally start operations," MA Matin told reporters after a board meeting at the shipping ministry. "The audit is complete. The decision will be sent to the law ministry for approval and later to the cabinet for a final approval," Matin said. As a PLC, the organisation would initially float shares worth Tk 4,800 crore in the stock market, the adviser said. On how the organisation would run as a public limited company, Matin said: "An operator, either a local or a foreign company, will be employed to run the company as a fully commercial organisation." Asked about the debts, BSC managing director Kamrul Ahsan Rabbani said: "The total assets of the company are worth over Tk 942 crore and it has debts of more than Tk 214 crore. So it has net assets worth about Tk 728 crore." "The process of making the organisation a public limited company started in May. It will take time to complete legal procedure," Ahsan said. b
