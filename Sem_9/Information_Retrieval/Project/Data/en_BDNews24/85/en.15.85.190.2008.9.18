 Manila,Sep 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Philippine troops seized a major training camp of Muslim guerrillas in the troubled south, killing seven rebels and wounding dozens in air and ground attacks, an army general said on Thursday. Brigadier-General Jorge Segovia, chief of the military operations centre in Manila, told Reuters soldiers stumbled upon the rebel base after chasing rogue members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in Lanao province on Mindanao island. A soldier was killed and eight were wounded in a rebel attack in Calanugas town on Wednesday, before troops staged the counter offensive that led them to the guerrilla base. "Our troops had occupied the rebel camp on Wednesday after hours of heavy fighting with a big number of guerrillas," Segovia said, adding seven dead rebels were found in the area. "Dozens of MILF rebels were also wounded based on intercepted radio communications. This is one of our major tactical victories since punitive actions were launched last month." He said the rebel camp had fortified bunkers and training facilities that could accommodate more than a hundred people and there were indications the guerrillas hastily abandoned the area when troops closed in, backed by rocket-firing helicopters. Segovia said an estimated 150 rebels have been killed in almost four weeks of fighting on the troubled southern island of Mindanao. About 80 civilians and nearly two dozen soldiers were also killed. About 100 soldiers were also wounded, Segovia added. A recent rise in violence has threatened more than a decade of Malaysia-brokered peace talks aimed at ending nearly 40 years of conflict that has stunted growth in the poor southern region, believed to be sitting on rich deposits of minerals and hydrocarbons. Fighting has subsided since the start of Ramadan, Islam's holy month, on Sept. 1 but flared up at the weekend when MILF rebels attacked army positions in four provinces. "There has been a reduction of more than 50 percent in the number of violent incidents since the start of Ramadan," Segovia said, adding about 150 skirmishes, ambuscades and burning of houses had been reported from Aug. 18. Last month, rogue MILF members went on the rampage after a deal on expanding an autonomous Muslim region was halted by the Supreme Court due to legal challenges raised by mainly Catholic politicians. The Philippine military swiftly responded, unleashing an air and ground attack on rebel positions on Mindanao, displacing more than 500,000 people
