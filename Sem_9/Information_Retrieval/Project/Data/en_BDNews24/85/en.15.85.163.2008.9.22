 Zurich,Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz, who a colleague said had been feeling the strain from the global banking crisis, is in a coma after suffering a heart attack, the Swiss government said on Sunday. The government said Merz was in a critical but stable state and his doctors had decided to keep him in an artificial coma for the time being after he had a heart attack on Saturday. He is likely to be operated on later in the day to stabilise his heart, the government said in a statement. Merz, also Swiss vice-president, has given a flurry of media interviews in recent days on the financial market turmoil that has hit Swiss banks hard, telling a newspaper on Saturday he did not believe the crisis was over yet. He had a hectic week, travelling to London to meet his British counterpart Alistair Darling and keeping in close contact with the Swiss central bank and banking regulator as the country's financial sector came under heavy pressure and markets see-sawed. Fulvio Pelli, president of Merz's liberal Free Democrats, said the minister had been under "a lot off pressure recently" due to the financial crisis, Swiss media quoted him as saying. A former management consultant, Merz, 65, has been minister since early 2004. Swiss news agency SDA said the Swiss parliament would confirm Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf on Monday as his temporary replacement. Swiss President Pascal Couchepin has cancelled a planned trip to New York for the UN General Assembly due to the news about Merz
