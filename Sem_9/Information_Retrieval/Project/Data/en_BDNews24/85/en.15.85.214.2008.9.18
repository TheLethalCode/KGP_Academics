 DHAKA, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Bangladesh are confident the exodus of players to the unofficial Indian Cricket League (ICL) would not cripple the national team in next month's home series against New Zealand, a cricket official said on Thursday. Former Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar and 12 other leading players signed for the Twenty20 league on Tuesday. The board has said it would slap 10-year bans on those playing in unofficial tournaments.

The tests will be played in Chittagong and Dhaka from Oct.17 and 25 respectively.
