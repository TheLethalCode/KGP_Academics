<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Jatiya Party (BJP), a small component of the four-party alliance that the BNP heads, has criticised the Election Commission for not inviting it to the dialogue. Chairman Andalib Rahman Partha at a press conference on Friday said they had been overlooked although they had representation in the last parliament, a criteria the EC set for invitation. "The four-party alliance component BJP won four seats in the last parliamentary elections. But due to a mysterious reason the Election Commission did not invite us to the dialogue. "We will have to remain alert against signs of a 'palace intrigue' against the four-party alliance." Partha, son of former minister and founder of the party late Naziur Rahman Manjur, held the news conference at his father home at Road no 7 in Baridhara. He alleged the EC had held dialogue with parties like Kalyan Party that never had representation in the parliament. "BJP got four seats. Our lawmakers took oath separately. But the commission did not invite us. It is mysterious." The Election Commission is set to hold third-round dialogue separately with BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ) on Saturday. "The Election Commission is behaving in an unfair manner with BJP We think if they (EC) continue behaving the way they have been they would lose the people's trust." He said the issue had been discussed by the top leaders of the alliance. BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain at the meeting of the combine on Sept 16 demanded that the Election Commission invited its partners, especially the BJP, to the dialogue, he said. Other BJP leaders were present at the news conference. bdne
