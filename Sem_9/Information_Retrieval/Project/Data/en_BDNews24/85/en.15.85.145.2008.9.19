<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Barrister Rafique-ul-Huq Friday said he was optimistic about a dialogue between the two former prime ministers once the Awami League chief returned home after the Eid. "The public opinion about the two leaders sitting together across the table is very strong. Can they ignore it if the public opinion is strong?" barrister Rafique said to bdnews24.com on Friday evening after returning from a seven-day private trip to Singapore. Huq defends both Awami League president Sheikh Hasina and BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in court. "During the discussion with me Sheikh Hasina did not dismiss the idea of sitting with Khaleda Zia for talks. "She told me that she would make a final decision after consulting the party leaders and workers after her return home. On the other hand, Khaleda Zia has already expressed her interest." He said the meeting of the two arch political rivals may take place after the Eid. "The sooner the dialogue takes place the better." Earlier on Wednesday, Rafique told bdnews24.com by phone, "She's been through a spell of poor health. It's been really bad. She's suffering from glaucoma. A surgery was required but could not be done." Hasina, who like Khaleda is standing trial in a plethora of corruption charges, is in the United States for medical treatment after she was released on parole. Education adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said recently that the government had approached the lawyer to help bring the two top leaders across the table to discuss the nation's many crises. bdnews24.com
