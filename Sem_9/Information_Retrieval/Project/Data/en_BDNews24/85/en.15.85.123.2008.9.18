<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Speakers at a discussion on Thursday suggested that all industries, including garment factories, be moved outside Dhaka to protect the capital city. At a discussion on river pollution and protection of environment at the office of Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA), they expressed fear that the pollution created by its inhabitants might destroy the city. "Waters have been contaminated up to Shatnal area of the river Meghna. It affected breeding of hilsha fish," said Inamul Huq, former additional director general of the Water Development Board. He said the WASA had effluent treatment plants for only 10 percent of Dhaka's total wastes, while the rest go to the river. BELA director advocate Rezwana Hasan said, "We have selected six rivers near Dhaka. The condition of the rivers will be kept under observation." She stressed local people's role to protect rivers of the country. Huq blamed the WDB for the present situation of the rivers. "According to the government rules, the WDB is responsible for the waters of the rivers," the ex-WDB official said. Hashem Sufi, director of Dhaka History Research Centre, also stressed on people's support to protect the rivers. Sufi blamed the occupation of river banks on the government as it leased the banks out to people. He said there was a plan to dig a canal at a cost of Tk 700 crore to bring water from the river Jamuna to protect Buriganga, but it was possible to bring water from Padma at a cost of Tk 50 crore. Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association organised the discussion. bd
