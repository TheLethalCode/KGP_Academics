<TEXT>
 MANCHESTER, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said on Thursday he had to choose between youth and experience in replacing the suspended Nemanja Vidic for Sunday's Premier League game with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. The Serbian international misses the clash between the champions and last season's runners-up through a one-match ban for his sending off in Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Liverpool. Jonny Evans, 20, could be handed a league debut after replacing Vidic in Wednesday's 0-0 Champions League draw against Villarreal or Ferguson may move Wes Brown alongside Rio Ferdinand as he looks to improve on the performance at Anfield. "I have got a decision to make about centre-back, whether I go with Evans and his ability but lack of experience or whether I opt for Wes Brown's experience," Ferguson told reporters. "I am sure we won't be giving goals away like we did last Saturday and therefore we go down there very positive about it. "It's always a good game when the top sides meet, which is why I was disappointed with last Saturday." Leaders Chelsea have made a far better start to the season than United, who can ill afford to lose much more ground in the early stages of the title race. United are 14th with four points from three games while Chelsea have 10 from four matches. United's Bulgaria striker Dimitar Berbatov is again doubtful with a knee injury but Paul Scholes returns from suspension and Gary Neville may start his first league match since March 2007 if Brown does not play at right back. "Gary Neville was playing only his second competitive match this season (against Villarreal) and did very well, which will bring him on if I decide to play him on Sunday," said Ferguson
