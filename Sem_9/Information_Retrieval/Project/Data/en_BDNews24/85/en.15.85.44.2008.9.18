<TITLE> Alitalia "hanging by a thread" on decision day </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Italy's labor minister said on Thursday that the liquidation of Alitalia was a "very real risk" later in the day when an investor group offering to rescue the state-controlled airline was due to make its final decision. "I really think the future of Alitalia is hanging by a thread," Minister Maurizio Sacconi said on a morning talk show. With Alitalia in special administration and running out of cash to buy fuel, the risk that the airline that was once the flyer of popes and divas had only days or even hours of life left seemed more palpable than ever. "There is no room for negotiations left ... liquidation is a very real risk," a pessimistic-sounding Sacconi said. CAI, the group of Italian businessmen headed by chairman Roberto Colaninno, has threatened to withdraw if its proposal does not get union approval. Colaninno has said he had no further concessions to make and nothing left to discuss. Unions have been told they have until 3.50 pm (9:50 am EDT) on Thursday to give their final position. The CAI board meeting starts at 4 pm (10 am EDT). After days of tense negotiations with workers, Colaninno told unions he would propose withdrawing the offer at the meeting if they do not come on board by then. Alitalia, a national symbol for more than six decades, has been the victim of political interference, labor disputes, mismanagement and, more recently, soaring fuel costs. Asked if the government had a contingency plan to deal with the domestic transport chaos that a collapse of Alitalia would entail, Sacconi said no. "This is a very traumatic situation that we said we have feared many times," he said. The carrier, which had 1.17 billion euros ($1.66 billion) in debt at the end of July, is losing more than 2 million euros a day. It filed for bankruptcy protection at the end of August. Only three of Alitalia's notoriously feisty nine unions have said they are ready to accept CAI's offer. Some 3,250 of Alitalia's 20,000 workers would be laid off under the bailout plan, which would see CAI buy only the profitable parts of the airline before relaunching it as a slimmed-down regional carrier. The biggest, CGIL, said it was not optimistic that a deal could be reached, while one of the main pilots' groups said it remained opposed in the absence of changes to the plan, which involves job cuts, lower pay and reduced benefits. After two attempts to sell the state's 49.9 percent stake failed, the new government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi persuaded a group of investors to present a rescue plan. An Alitalia collapse would be a huge political blow for Berlusconi, a media mogul who promised in April's election to use his business contacts to find an Italian buyer. Berlusconi has offered special payouts to the workers who would lose their jobs under the rescue plan, but warned that offer would be withdrawn if the airline collapsed. Underscoring the problems in the sector, neighboring Greece said on Wednesday it would shut down its ailing state carrier Olympic Airlines and relaunch it under a new structure
