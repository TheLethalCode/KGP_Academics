 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court on Wednesday granted three months' bail to a number of BNP leaders including Mir Nasiruddin, Iqbal Hasan Mahmud Tuku, AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Zafrul Islam Chowdhury, Abdul Wadud Bhuiyan, Daud Saluddin, Manjurul Ahsan Munshi and Ariful Haque Chowdhury. The vacation bench of justices Mirza Hossain Haider and Mamnun Rahman in the orders also halted the sentences of former state ministers Mir Nasiruddin, Amanullah Aman, Tuku, Mirza Abbas and his wife Afroza Abbbas for the same period. The court stayed the 13 years' sentences of Mir Nasir, Tuku and Aman each on charges of accumulating illegal wealth. It also asked the government and the Anticorruption Commission to explain why the sentences against them would not be declared illegal. The court also stayed the proceedings of one criminal case filed against Aman for three months. It stayed the seven years' sentence of Afroza in a tax-dodge case and granted her bail. The court also granted her three-month bail staying a graft case, as she appealed for bail after turning herself in to the court. The same bench granted AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Zafrul Islam Chowdhury, Wadud Bhuiyan and Daud Salauddin bail for three months and stayed the proceedings of tax-dodge cases for the same period. It granted Munshi bail for three months in four criminal cases and BNP leader Ariful Haque Chowdhury for as many months in a criminal case. The court stayed the five-year jail sentence of BNP central committee member Syeda Afisa Ashrafi in an extortion case. "As per the emergency powers rules convict persons will not be allowed to contest any local polls including the national elections," barrister Mahbub Uddin Khokan, the lawyer for all BNP leaders, said to reporters. "But people who got bail in the High Court will be able to run in the elections," he said. b
