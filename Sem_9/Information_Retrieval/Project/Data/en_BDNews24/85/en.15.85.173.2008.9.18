<TITLE> FBCCI chief echoes Matin on antigraft drive </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  FBCCI president Annisul Huq has said the government's anticorruption drive has lost momentum, hours after home adviser Abdul Matin said on Thursday the antigraft drive had run out of steam as most of the accused secured bail. "There was a push against corruption due to the caretaker government's antigraft drive after 1/11. But it has stopped now. Now it seems the government has moved from its earlier stance," Huq said at an iftar gathering at the FBCCI auditorium at Motijheel. "All political parties indulged in corruption. The party that was in power always resorted to corruption. The businessmen also did corruption. Stern action should be taken against all corruption-mongers." "Alongside the government the business community is also taking initiative to overcome the political crisis in the country. As part of the initiative the FBCCI will organise an iftar party in next few days for the top leaders of the two major parties." The FBCCI chief said if necessary the FBCCI would take initiatives to bring the two top leaders across the table. His comments came two days after adviser Hossain Zillur Rahman said the government had made moves to get former prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to sit and talk. "The FBCCI has taken different initiatives to bring down the commodities price. Some positive result has already been available," Huq said. He said they would take some more initiatives after Eid to bring the price of essentials within the buying capacity of common people. bdnew
