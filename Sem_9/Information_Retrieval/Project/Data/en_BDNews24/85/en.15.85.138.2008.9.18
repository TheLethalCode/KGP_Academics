<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman has said the emergency rule is being dragged on to gag the people and facilitate a few. He asked authorities to immediately lift it. "The emergency is being prolonged only to help some perpetrators continue with their illegal acts and shutting people up through a period," Zillur said. He made the remarks at a meeting with former AL lawmaker Ali Reza Raju at his Gulshan home on Thursday. Zillur spoke on the government initiatives to get all political parties to sit together for discussion. "Awami League will continue to support all well-meant democratic actions." He, however, expressed doubts about the success of such efforts before the polls. "We might not turn up finally if Jamaat-e-Islami joins the talks." The stand-in chief welcomed barrister Rafique-ul-Huq's initiative to try to persuade former prime ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina to sit together and discuss the state of affairs. "All is well that ends well." Barrister Huq represents both in the Supreme Court. He took a swipe at the caretaker government's policymakers. "Only scholarly knowledge cannot make a good governor. A good administrator must know how to win people over by caring for them, by not making them scared with legal tools." bdnews
