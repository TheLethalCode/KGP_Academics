<TITLE> Tennis star Serena Williams pens 'inspirational memoir' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Serena Williams, the world's top female tennis player, will release "an inspirational memoir" in fall 2009, tracking the highs and lows of a career in which she has overcome injuries to regain the women's crown. Williams, 26, has won nine Grand Slam titles, including four in a row in 2002-2003 which made her the world's No. 1 player. She is renowned for her strength on court as well as her colorful outfits. But facing various injuries and distracted by off-court interests, Williams slipped from the top until she staged a comeback this year to win the U.S. Open and regain the No. 1 ranking for the first time in five years. This year, with her sister Venus, she won gold in the Women's Doubles at the Beijing Olympics. Karen Kosztolnyik, a senior editor who acquired the book for Grand Central Publishing after a bidding battle, said Williams was one of the world's most remarkable athletes. But it was also her charm and drive that gave her a role in modeling, film, television and fashion, with her line of designer clothing called Aneres -- "Serena" spelled backwards. "We've watched her rise to No. 1 despite physical and emotional setbacks, and her hard work and determination have inspired legions of fans, young and old. Serena will give her memoir a strong motivational slant," she said in a statement. Financial terms were not given for the deal that was negotiated with literary agent Suzanne Gluck from the William Morris Agency.
