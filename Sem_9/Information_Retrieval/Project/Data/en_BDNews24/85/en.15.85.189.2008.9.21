 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com) The BNP has welcomed the chief adviser's announcement of the national elections on Dec 18 ahead of the Upazila polls but demanded emergency be lifted right away. The party took much longer than others  nearly three and a half hours  in preparing its response to the Fakhruddin Ahmed specch but did not come up with any surprises. "This has been the popular demand for long. I thank the government for the (JS) date (before Upazilla polls)," secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain told reporters at his NAM apartment shortly before midnight Saturday. But he disagreed with the chief adviser on lifting of the emergency. "Emergency must be lifted immediately. Fair election is not possible at all under emergency," he said. Fakhruddin said in his speech certain emergency clauses could be lifted to help the polls process. "I would like to say in unequivocal terms that the government will not hesitate for a moment to do everything necessary to hold a transparent and fair election," the chief adviser said. "The relevant emergency laws or rules will be relaxed or repealed at the right time to facilitate campaign and candidates' preparations for the polls," Fakhruddin said. Delwar echoed acting AL chief Zillur Rahman on the back to back elections, with the Upazilas going to polls in days after the Dec 18 JS vote. Upazila polls have been planned for Dec 24 and 28. Delwar said he was worried that peace could be the casualty if Upazila polls were held so quickly after the national elections.
