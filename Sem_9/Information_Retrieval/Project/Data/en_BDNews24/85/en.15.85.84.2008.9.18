<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  Favourites Mohammedan Sporting Club returned to the winning ways on Thursday with an emphatic 3-0 drubbing of Arambagh KS in their away match of the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Mohammedan, who were held 1-1 by Chittagong Abahani in their opening match, controlled the match from the start to end. The Federation Cup champions sat on a two-goal cushion inside 13 minutes in the first half on the rain-soaked pitch. With playmaker Arman Aziz, who had missed the first match, expressing himself, winger Nasir Hossain put the Black-and-Whites ahead inside the first minute while Mohammad Robin doubled the lead in the 13th minute to establish a clear dominance over the Federation Cup's quarterfinalists. Robin turned around to smash a Faisal chip that was blocked by an opponent defender and Nasir tapped in the rebound from a hand shaking distance in the 45th second to give Arambagh a atste of what was to come. Egyptian medio Hazem Khaled tested Arambagh's goalkeeper Piru with a dipping shot just before Robin being set up by Nigerian striker Bukola Olalekan drove a low shot past Piru in the 13th minute. Mohammedan's coach Maruful Haq might have been wondering why his team did not extend the lead in the first half as the Motijheel-based club kept on creating chances. Robin failed to meet a teasing cross from Nasir in the 19th minute while defender Rajani Kanta Barmon nodded the ball wide the next minute. Arambagh had their first chance in the 27th minute, but Nicodemus Anunda shot wide off the near post. Mohammedan's Olaleke also came close to widening the lead twice in the 38th and 40th minutes. Aziz made it 3-0 seven minutes into the second half to put the fate of the match beyond doubts when his powerful drive from a Hazem corner went in after a slight deflection from Arambagh defender Akram. Mohammedan's margin should have been 4-0, but Olaleken, Federation Cup's highest scorer for Mohammedan, missed the target from a spot kick as referee Hannan Miron awarded what appeared as a dubious penalty. Goalkeeper Piru gripped Olaleken's low drive diving to his right to deny Mohammedan's fourth in the 59th minute. Faisal's shot beat Piru and the goalpost four minutes later. Arambagh found Mohammedan defence tough nut to crack, although they had two good chances in the span of two minutes in the second half. Striker Nicodemus Anunda saw his first attempt rattle the Mohammedan crossbar in the 68th minute and two minutes later he forced Mohammedan keeper Aminul Islam into a brilliant save for a corner. b
