 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed leaves for New York on Saturday night to attend the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), an adviser said on Friday. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said he would also will fly with Fakhruddin. The interim government head also addressed the UNGA last year. "Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed and I will leave for New York Saturday night. The chief adviser is expected to return home on September 30 if his programmes are not revised," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com. He said the chief adviser's visit was "very significant" as general assembly was usually the most important gathering of the world leaders in a single venue. Iftekhar said Fakhruddin would address the general assembly on 26 October, meet a number of world leaders and attend some conferences and receptions in New York. "The participation of the chief adviser will raise further international profile of Bangladesh, the current chair of the 50-member Least Developed Countries (LDCs)," He said Bangladesh was an acknowledged thought-leader in the climate change debate, a successful example of poverty alleviation through indigenously grown ideas, and a consistent top contributor to global peacekeeping. "Our role is thus perceived as stabilising and development-oriented," he said. bd
