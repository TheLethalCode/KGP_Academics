<TEXT>
 KIEV, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - France defender William Gallas scored two minutes from time to salvage a 1-1 draw for Arsenal against Dynamo Kiev in their Champions League tie on Wednesday. Gallas, who scored in both legs in the final qualifying round, converted from close range at the far post after Theo Walcott's low cross into the danger area had taken two deflections. "We feel like we lost two points," Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger told reporters. "It was a big frustration, but a great relief at the same time because we scored a goal just two minutes from the end." Kiev, who lost all six group games in the competition last season, had looked set for an opening Group G victory after Guinea striker Ismael Bangoura scored a 64th-minute penalty. Bangoura easily beat keeper Manuel Almunia after Bacary Sagna had tussled with Ognjen Vukojevic. Arsenal dominated the opening half but failed to make the most of their chances. Dutchman Robin van Persie sprung the offside trap after just two minutes but his low shot was turned away by Dynamo goalkeeper Stanislav Bogush. Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor bent a shot just over when bearing down on goal after latching on to a wayward pass and van Persie shot wide after a neat Arsenal build-up. The best chance fell to Cesc Fabregas just before halftime but the Spanish midfielder could only shoot weakly at Bogush from close in. Kiev threatened soon after the break when Almunia saved low down from Roman Eremenko and the Ukraine side went ahead after Sagna was harshly penalised for tangling with Vukojevic.
