 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  With an election date now fixed, the Election Commission has urged speedy disposal of a writ petition that challenges the commission's delimitation of parliamentary constituencies. Election Commission counsel Dr Shahdeen Malik made the appeal to the High Court vacation bench of Justice Nazmun Ara Sultana and Justice Md Rezaul Haq on Sunday. The court is set to give a decision on Monday on whether a final hearing date would be fixed. Dr Malik told journalists since the date for the parliamentary elections has been announced, the legal challenge against the EC's delimitation of constituencies should be settled. So an appeal has been made for a final hearing on the writ petition, he added. Former state minister for civil aviation and BNP lawmaker from Dhaka-2 constituency Abdul Mannan filed the writ petition on Aug 6 challenging the validity of the gazette delimiting the constituencies. The next day, the High Court halted the effectiveness of the gazette for three months. At the same time, it asked the Election Commission and the government to explain why the gazette would not be declared unconstitutional and invalid. The gazette was published on July 10 delimiting 300 parliamentary constituencies. The Election Commission on April 29 primarily delimited 133 constituencies. On an earlier writ petition by Mannan, the High Court on May 13 had asked the EC and the government to justify why the commission's decision to delimit 133 constituencies should not be declared without legal validity. The earlier petition is also waiting a final hearing at the High Court. bdnews2
