 MARSEILLE, France, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Liverpool opened their Champions League group stage campaign with a gritty 2-1 victory in Marseille on Tuesday, a win that once again highlighted the match-winning qualities of captain Steven Gerrard. Starting for the first time since undergoing a groin operation late last month, the dynamic midfielder pulled his side level with a superb looping shot before scoring the winner with a twice-taken penalty kick. The visitors had trailed for just three minutes before Gerrard equalised in the 26th, instantly firing the ball diagonally into the top corner of the goal from the edge of the area after latching onto a Dirk Kuyt pass. Marseille coach Eric Gerets, who had nearly as many words for Gerrard as his own team at the post-match news conference, admitted he was impressed. "I watched his goal about six times and it was just amazing," Belgian Gerets told reporters. "Not many players in the world can score such a goal. I've said it before but he's really world class." TOOK CONTROL Marseille, eager to avoid a repeat of last December's 4-0 thrashing by the same opponents in another group encounter, started well and opened the scoring on 23 minutes through captain Lorik Cana, but Gerrard soon took control of the contest. "We had just scored and should have focused more on protecting our advantage but players of Gerrard's quality are capable of scoring goals like that," Gerets added. "He changed the course of the match." Gerrard, who played only 22 minutes of Saturday's 2-1 Premier League win over arch-rivals Manchester United, was on target again on 32 minutes, this time from the penalty spot, scoring his 99th goal for a club he has graced for a decade. Liverpool coach Rafael Benitez, whose side held firm under sustained pressure from Marseille in the second half, paid tribute to his playmaker but was not entirely satisfied. "Gerrard's first goal was fantastic but he can play better and the team can play better," Benitez said. "The positive thing is there is room for improvement." Gerrard, who has so often lifted his team out of tight spots, was his unassuming self after the game, naming goalkeeper Pepe Reina as the man to credit for Liverpool's win. "Reina was the real hero," Gerrard said. "We were under pressure for 45 minutes. We stopped playing in the second half, we didn't pass well enough." Liverpool certainly have work to do to emerge from a tough Group D that also features PSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid. Tuesday's game reminded them, however, they have a captain capable of lifting the side when they need it the most
