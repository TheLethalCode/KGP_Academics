<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 23 (bdnews24.com)A High Court bench has set Sept 29 for the final hearing on a writ petition challenging the legality of a gazette that redefines electoral districts. With an election date now fixed, the Election Commission has urged speedy disposal of a writ petition that challenges the commission's delimitation of parliamentary constituencies. The HC vacation bench of justice Najmun Ara Sultana and justice Md Rezaul Haque set the final hearing date Monday. Lawyer for the Election Commission Dr Shahdeen Malik argued that settling the matter was urgent since the date for parliamentary elections has been announced, and appealed to the court for a final hearing date as soon as possible. Barrister Nasiruddin Ashim and advocate Jahirul Haq, lawers for the petitioner, however, requested more time for preparation. Dr Malik told bdnews24.com the petitioner will hopefully take part at the hearing next Monday (Sept 29). Abdul Mannan, a former state minister for civil aviation and BNP MP from Nawabganj, filed the writ petition on Aug 6 challenging the validity of the gazette delimiting the constituencies. The next day, the High Court halted the effectiveness of the gazette for three months. At the same time, it asked the Election Commission and the government to explain why the gazette would not be declared unconstitutional and invalid. The gazette was published on July 10 delimiting 300 parliamentary constituencies. The Election Commission on April 29 primarily delimited 133 constituencies. On an earlier writ petition by Mannan, the High Court on May 13 had asked the EC and the government to justify why the commission's decision to delimit 133 constituencies should not be declared without legal validity. The earlier petition is also waiting a final hearing at the High Court. bdnews24.com/at
