<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  A High Court judge on Wednesday felt embarrassed to hear the appeal filed by former prime minister Sheikh Hasina challenging the legality of the MiG-29s purchase graft case. One of the judges in the bench of Justice Mirza Hossain Haider and Justice Mamnun Rahman declined to hear the petition citing embarrassment as being the reason, Hasina's counsel barrister Shafique Ahmed said. Another bench of Justice AFM Abdur Rahman and Justice SM Imdadul Haque will be hearing the appeal on Thursday, he added. "Sheikh Hasina filed the writ petition challenging the charge framing in the MiG-29s case on September 14 and a hearing was supposed to be conducted today (Wednesday). "But at 11am, the court said the hearing would not be possible to conduct as a judge was feeling embarrassed," Ahmed said. Then the chief justice empowered another bench headed by justice AFM Abdur Rahman to hear the appeal, he said. Hasina has been granted bail in the case, the lawyer said and asserted that it has no merit for charge framing. He said bail petitions seeking Hasina's release in another three cases will be submitted on Sunday. The currently extinct Anticorruption Bureau filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on Dec 11, 2001 against five persons including Hasina. It accused them of resorting to corrupt practices in the purchase of eight MiG-29s combat aircraft. A High Court bench on Sept 6, 2007 rejected Hasina's appeal filed to set aside the case. Again on March 18, the Supreme Court rejected her appeal filed challenging the High Court order. The case is on trial in the lower court. On August 20, charges were pressed against Hasina and other accused in the case. bdnews24
