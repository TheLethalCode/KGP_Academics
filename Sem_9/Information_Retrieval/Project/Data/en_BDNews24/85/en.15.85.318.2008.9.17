 Srinagar, India, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 12 people were wounded on Wednesday after suspected militants threw a grenade into a crowded market in Indian Kashmir, police said. The grenade was aimed at a police jeep in the heart of Srinagar, Indian Kashmir's summer capital, they said. "The blast created panic in the busy area and people ran for cover in shops and buildings," said Latif Ahmed, a shopkeeper who witnessed the blast. Officials say violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants has declined significantly since India and Pakistan, who claim the region in full but rule in parts, started a peace process in 2004.
