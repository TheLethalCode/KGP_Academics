 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government will send a team of scientists and technical experts to China to put the Rooppur nuclear power plant on stream with Chinese assistance, an adviser said on Wednesday. The Chinese leaders pledged in talks with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed, now visiting China, to help Dhaka to implement the nuclear power plant for producing electricity, foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com from Beijing by telephone. "According to discussions with Chinese leaders, we will send a scientific and technical team to China soon to examine further possibilities for cooperation on nuclear energy for peaceful purposes," he said. Iftekhar said Chinese president Hu Jintao and prime minister Wen Jibao during meetings with Fakhruddin said China would help Bangladesh to build the Rooppur nuclear plant for peaceful purposes. "Some new potential areas of cooperation and possible Chinese support also came up for discussion." "These include the construction of future seventh and eighth friendship bridges across Meghna and the Meghna-Gumti and the production of hybrid seed for expansion of agriculture production," he said. Iftekhar termed Bangladesh-China relations as "time-tested" and "all weather" and said Fakhruddin's visit strengthened the ties. "China is important for us, as Bangladesh is for China." "I have every confidence that all governments to follow will bear this in mind and that close ties with China will be an internal pillar of Bangladesh's foreign policy," said the foreign adviser.
