 Washington,Sep 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The White House on Saturday condemned a suicide car-bombing at the Marriott hotel in Islamabad that has killed at least 40 people, calling it a "reminder of the threat we all face." "The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took place in Islamabad, Pakistan," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe. "The United States will stand with Pakistan's democratically elected government as they confront this challenge." President George W Bush, who was briefed on the attack by his national security adviser Stephen Hadley, offered his condolences to the families of the victims in the bombing. Bush is due to meet with newly elected Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in New York on Tuesday before the United Nations General Assembly. The bombing is the third targeting the American chain hotel in Islamabad and comes amid stepped up US strikes against al Qaeda and Taliban militants believed to be hiding in the remote ethnic Pashtun region of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan
