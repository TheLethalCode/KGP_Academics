 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  A baby was born on Friday from a frozen embryo implanted in the mother's womb, a first in Bangladesh. Opshora, the baby girl, was born by caesarean at Modern Hospital in the city at 2:15pm, after being in the mother's womb for 37 weeks. A five-member team of Dhaka Medical College Hospital led by assistant professor of gynaecology and obstetrics department Dr Rashida Begum operated on the mother. Dr Rashida Begum said at a news conference Salma Begum, 36, and Afzal Hossain, who have been married for five years, decided to take a baby through test tube last year. But the first attempt failed. "Opshora is doing well. At birth, her weight was 3.2 kilogrammes." "In the first test-tube baby attempt, 14 embryos were born. In September last year three embryos were transferred to the uterus of Salma. But she failed to conceive. "Eleven embryos were kept frozen for four months. Of them four remained alive. Frozen embryo was placed in the uterus of Salma in January this year," Dr Rashida said. No complexity arose during the whole process starting from implanting the embryo in Salma's uterus to the birth of the baby. Dr Rashida earlier said she had failed in five attempts to make a woman give birth to a baby from frozen embryo. Salma and Afzal spent Tk 2.65 lakh on the entire procedure  the test tube baby treatment cost them Tk 2 lakh and they spent Tk 65,000 on preservation of frozen embryo and its implant. Dr Rashida said in the test-tube baby treatment the embryos in excess are kept in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees Celsius temperature by a specially programmed machine in a special jar. Later, the frozen embryo is transferred to the uterus. She said the first frozen embryo baby was born at Queen Victoria Medical Centre in Melbourne, Australia in 1984. In Asia the first such baby was born in Singapore National University Medical Centre in 1987. The record for a baby born from a embryo kept frozen for the longest time is 13 years. bdnew
