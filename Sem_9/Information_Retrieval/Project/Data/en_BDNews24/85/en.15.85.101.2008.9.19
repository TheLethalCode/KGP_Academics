 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League on Friday said the caretaker government was making the general elections uncertain. "The government is showing friendliness to a broken force. Efforts are on to rehabilitate that force," acting AL president Zillur Rahman said at a discussion prior to an iftar gathering at the Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh. Presidium member Amir Hossain Amu said all plans of the caretaker government failed. "We don't want to see any new plan. Please hold the parliamentary polls and free the nation," Amu said. His colleague Tofail Ahmed said an all-party meeting one month ahead of the polls might push it to uncertainty. He said the AL was preparing for movement as well as the election. "If the election is not held in line with the roadmap, the Awami League will realise it through movement." Motia Chowdhury said the government was planning to hold a political summit to recognise the politics of Jamaat-e-Islami. People of Kotalipara of Gopalganj living in Dhaka arranged the gathering. bdnew
