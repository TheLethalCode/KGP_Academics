<TITLE> We didn't sin: Bashar </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com) - The Bangladesh Cricket Board banned on Wednesday for 10 years its contracted or registered cricketers who signed for the breakaway Indian Cricket League for 10 years, but Habibul Bashar, one of those banned, doesn't feel they have committed so serious an offence to keep them out of national cricket for so long. "Yes, I've heard of the decision and now feel very bad, but I don't think we have done any crime to get such a big punishment," former captain Bashar told bdnews24.com by phone Wednesday. The country's highest cricketing body's decision came at a time when Bashar along with opener Shahriar Nafees, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and middle-order Alok Kapali returned home after signing deals with the ICL, not recognised by the International Cricket Board. Apart from the above four, middle-order Aftab Ahmed, opener Nazimuddin and all-rounder Farhad Reza applied for retirement citing no reasons and the BCB Tuesday refused to accept their letters. Knowing about the consequences of playing in the ICL, Bangladesh's most successful captain Bashar said, "I knew that some measures would be taken, but never imagined that the punishment would be so extensive." "They could have given us such punishment had we been involved in shameful activities like betting, and we would accept it with heads bowed." "I want to repeat that we haven't gone to the ICL to do any crime, but just to play cricket," said the 35-year old cricketer, who will lead 'Dhaka Warriors' in the ICL. Bashar said the Indian media took them positively as a team from Bangladesh and the ICL authority organised a colourful programme for them with approximately 100 reporters covering it. "We want that they play for Bangladesh and they did not commit any sin coming here to play. We must release them if they get recalled for the national team," Bashar quoted Indian World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev as saying. The board's decision means the banned cricketers will not get any opportunity to play international as well as domestic cricket for Bangladesh. "It is very sad not to be able to play domestic cricket after having represented the country for long and it is also hard to accept the decision. "But you see we will play in the ICL as a team from Bangladesh and it will bring the country fame if we perform well there," said Bashar adding that the ICL was not banned by the ICC. Bashar said they wanted to sit with the board to let it know about their contracts with the ICL. On the summons of the board, Bashar said, "I was outside the country when it sent the letter, but now I've come back and want to sit with the board." Bashar also refuted claims that he convinced some cricketers to play in the ICL. "They had offered Aftab (Ahmed) and (Shahriar) Nafees before me ....I will leave everything if any player says in front of me that I tried to convince them," Bashar said in defence. Bashar also said there might not be any opportunity to rescind their decision having already signed the deals with the ICL. "It is possible to play for the national side in addition to playing in the ICL," said Bashar. bdnews
