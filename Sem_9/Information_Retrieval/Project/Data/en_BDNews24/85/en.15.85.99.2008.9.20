 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed left for New York Saturday night to attend the 63rd United Nations General Assembly, following his televised address to the nation announcing a date for parliamentary polls. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury accompanied the chief adviser, on an Emirates flight around 9.40pm. This is the CA's second appearance at the general assembly, since he took office as head of the interim government on Jan 12 last year a day after the promulgation of the state of emergency. In last year's speech, the chief adviser highlighted the political situation leading to the promulgation of the state of emergency and his caretaker government's commitment to hold ninth parliamentary polls by December this year. "The chief adviser will have a one-on-one meeting with UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. He will address the General Assembly on Friday 26th September," Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told bdnews24.com ahead of their departure. "The participation of the chief adviser will further raise the international profile of Bangladesh, the current chair of the 50-member group of Least Developed Countries (LDCs)," he said. The foreign adviser said Bangladesh was an acknowledged voice in the climate change debate, a successful example of poverty alleviation through indigenously grown ideas, and a consistent contributor to global peacekeeping. "Our role is thus perceived as stabilising and development-oriented," he said. The chief adviser will attend high level meetings of the Commonwealth heads of government, on millennium development goals, on Africa's development needs and on malaria, according to the foreign adviser. He will also hold bilateral meetings with a number of leaders including the newly elected prime minister of Nepal, Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda, said Iftekhar. Fakhruddin is expected to return home on September 30 if his programmes are not revised," Iftekhar told bdnews24.com. bdn
