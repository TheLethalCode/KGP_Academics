 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League presidium member Amir Hossain Amu on Friday protested the arrest of Awami Jubo League general secretary Mirza Azam from the jail gate immediately after his release on bail on Thursday. Amu aired his anger at a meeting held at the party's headquarters on Bangabandhu Avenue. The High Court on Tuesday set Azam free bail in a case on charges of acquiring assets illegally. But police, acting on a complaint filed with Paltan Police Station based on apprehensions of breaching the emergency powers rules, detained him again from the jail gate. "People won't accept the government treating political leaders this way. The overall law and order situation will slump if the law enforcers abuse the law in this manner," Amu said. He also demanded party chief Sheikh Hasina's unconditional release and announcement of election dates. "Announcing the dates of elections only will not suffice, the government has to ensure the release of Sheikh Hasina and other AL leaders to create an amicable polls environment." He also asked authorities to release the leaders of the AL's front organizations. "If the government activities give rise to any crisis, people will hold the government responsible." bdnews
