<TITLE> Indian economy to grow 8 pct despite global woes: PM </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 NEW DELHI, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India's economy is expected to grow by more than 8 percent in the fiscal year to March despite being hurt by the global slowdown and soaring oil prices, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Wednesday. Singh said annual wholesale price inflation, which held above 12 percent in late August, was showing some signs of moderation and prices were expected to improve further due to steps taken by the government. The Indian government has cut import duties and banned exports of food items, while the central bank raised its key lending rate in both June and July to tame inflation. The repo rate now stands at a seven-year high of 9 percent. A Reuters poll of analysts showed inflation would remain largely unchanged at 12.09 percent for the 12 months ending Sept 6. Singh said India's growth prospects may be affected by the global economic slowdown, the steep rise in international prices of petroleum products and those of other primary commodities. "Even then, the overall growth rate of the economy will still exceed 8 percent, making India the world's second-fastest growing economy." The Indian economy grew by an average 8.8 percent in the last four years, but the central bank expects it to moderate to around 8 percent in the 2008/09 fiscal year
