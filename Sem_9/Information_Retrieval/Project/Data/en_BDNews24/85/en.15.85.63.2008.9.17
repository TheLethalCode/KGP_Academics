<TITLE> Roma problems exposed by newcomers Cluj </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ROME, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A few months after AS Roma were locked in a battle for the Italian title, a remarkable loss of form culminated in Tuesday's shock home Champions League defeat by CFR Cluj, piling more pressure on coach Luciano Spalletti. The Romanians showed no fear in the Group A opener, with striker Juan Culio taking full advantage of some woeful Roma defending to score twice in the 2-1 debut win. Spalletti's side had almost snatched the Italian title off Inter Milan on last day of the season in May but Tuesday's display was a far cry from their slick and attractive performances of old. Last season's quarter-finalists failed to land top transfer target Adrian Mutu from Fiorentina in the close season and fans have been underwhelmed by their new recruits, especially after popular winger Mancini was sold to rivals Inter. Forward Julio Baptista arrived from Real Madrid and defender John Arne Riise signed from Liverpool but both have come in for early criticism, with Roma having garnered just one point from their first two Serie A games. "I'm not leaving Roma, we'll pedal harder," Spalletti told reporters after watching Cluj's players dance with delight at full time. "I think Riise played well, Baptista has been with the Brazil team and has not been able to train with continuity. But their displays don't seem so different from the others." Roma have a string of hurt players missing, especially in defence, while injury-plagued captain Francesco Totti looked far from fully fit when he came off the bench. The death of 82-year-old club president Franco Sensi in August also hit the club hard with constant rumours of fresh investment not coming to fruition
