 Tokyo,Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's ruling party was poised on Monday to choose Taro Aso, an advocate of government spending to boost the economy, to be next prime minister and woo voters before an election that may be held in the next couple of months. The outspoken former foreign minister would take over the reins from Yasuo Fukuda, who suddenly quit this month leaving a policy vacuum as the economy flirts with recession and risks further damage from turmoil on Wall Street. The new leader must try to revive the world's second-biggest economy despite the constraints of its huge public debt, although he may have scant time to do so if, as media and pundits predict, he calls an early poll for parliament's powerful lower house. Aso, who wants tax cuts for businesses and stock investors, has said Japan's goal of balancing its budget by 2012 could be put off, a stance that has alarmed fiscal reformers in his party. Kyodo news agency said Aso had swept the votes from ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) branches and newspaper polls have shown he also has a hefty majority of party lawmakers, as calls for stimulus grow due to increasing economic risks. Former defence minister Yuriko Koike, aiming to become Japan's first female premier, expressed disappointment that debate, which focused on economic policies, never really took off in the LDP race among Aso and four dark-horse rivals. Critics have charged the contest was merely a show aimed at appealing to voters ahead of an expected early general election. Of the five candidates, only Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano, a fiscal conservative, clearly stated the need to raise Japan's 5 percent consumption tax to help fix its tattered finances and even he said an initial hike would be a few years away. "Everyone changed the nuances in their economic and fiscal policies to be closer to what I was saying, so it was hard to see what the point of the debate was," Koike, who has stressed the need for market-friendly structural reforms, told reporters. Media reports said Aso was considering keeping Yosano in a new cabinet to be formed on Wednesday as well as tapping another rival, former defence minister Shigeru Ishiba, in an effort to unify the party, which is suffering from dismal voter ratings. The LDP leader is virtually assured the premiership by virtue of the government's majority in parliament's powerful lower house, which is due to vote in a new prime minister on Wednesday. SNAP ELECTION Although an outspoken nationalist, Aso would likely stick to Fukuda's line on foreign policy, solidifying Japan's tight security alliance with the United States and improving relations with China, which have warmed lately after years of strains due to disputes stemming from wartime history. While Aso has called for more transparency in China's rising defence spending, he says Tokyo should welcome Beijing's economic growth and is likely to stay away from Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine, seen by critics as a symbol of Japan's past military aggression. Aso, a dapper dresser and fan of manga comic books popular with young people, regularly tops voter surveys for next prime minister, making him the LDP's natural choice to lead it in a general election that must be held by next September. Japanese media say an election could be called for as early as October 26 to make the most of any bounce in public support after the unpopular Fukuda became the second leader to abruptly resign in less than a year, although Aso said on Sunday that his priority was to pass an extra budget to support the economy. The new leader would be seeking a mandate to break a deadlock in parliament, where the main opposition Democratic Party and smaller allies control the upper house and can stall legislation. But the ruling coalition is widely expected to lose the two-thirds lower house majority that allows it to override upper house vetoes, and analysts say a clear victory for either side may prove elusive, leaving more policy paralysis. Speculation persists over a possible rejigging of party allegiances to clear the way for smoother policymaking, although an attempt by Fukuda and Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa to form a "grand coalition" flopped last year
