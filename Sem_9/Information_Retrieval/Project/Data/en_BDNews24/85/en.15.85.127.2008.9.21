 LJUBLJANA,Sun Sep 21,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slovenians are voting for a new government on Sunday, hoping to maintain the prosperity the small Alpine country has achieved since independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Most polls suggest that Prime Minister Janez Jansa's ruling conservative Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) might retain its edge and get another 4-year mandate.

Slovenia is one of 10 mostly former communist states that joined the European Union in 2004 -- the same year it became a NATO member -- and was the first of the newcomers to adopt the euro in January 2007. While its economy thrived, thanks to rising exports on the markets of the EU and the former Yugoslavia, inflation rose steadily to reach a six-year high 6.9 percent this summer -- by far the highest in the euro zone. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT) and were due to close at 1 p.m. EDT when the first exit poll projections of the results were expected on two national television channels.
