 BASEL, Switzerland, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk made a convincing start to their Champions League Group C campaign on Tuesday with a comfortable 2-1 at FC Basel. Seeking to make it past the tournament's group stage for the first time in five attempts, Mircea Lucescu's side took control of the match in the first half with two long-range free-kicks from Brazilian midfielders Fernandinho and Jadson. Basel defender David Abraham grabbed a consolation goal for the home team in second-half stoppage time. "I was a bit disappointed that we let in the goal at the end, we eased up a bit too much," Lucescu said. "We controlled the first half though and overall it was a deserved victory." Basel coach Christian Gross agreed with Lucescu's assessment. "They deserved it because they were faster and more determined," he said. "We gave them too much space and time to build up their moves. We have to improve massively in all areas but I am convinced we will learn from this game." FEROCIOUS SHOT There was little the Basel defence could do about the first goal with Fernandinho, one of five Brazilians in Shakhtar's starting line-up, firing his team ahead just before the half-hour mark with a ferocious free-kick from 30 metres out. Jadson doubled the visitors' lead with a similarly spectacular, though somewhat more fortunate, effort on the stroke of halftime. His strike, also from well outside the area, escaped both his team mates and the Basel defenders to bounce past goalkeeper Franco Costanzo and into the goal. Gross made two halftime substitutions, including the introduction of an extra striker, but it was the visitors who continued to dominate. Midway through the second half, defender Vyacheslav Shevchuk came close to adding a third goal with another long-range effort that came back off the post and straight into the arms of a grateful Costanzo. A minute later, Jadson fired in another dangerous free-kick which Costanzo did well to tip over. With 10 minutes remaining, Basel's substitute striker Eduardo Rubio squandered a great chance, taking too long to react when the ball fell to his feet just a couple of metres from the Shakhtar goal line. Argentine defender Abraham then showed his colleagues how to do it, finally prodding the ball across the line after pouncing on to a long ball, but it proved far too late with the referee blowing the final whistle seconds later
