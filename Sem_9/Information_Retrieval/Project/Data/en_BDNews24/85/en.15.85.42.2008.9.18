<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  The High Court has ordered submission of a medical report on Chittagong mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury. The vacation bench of justices Jinat Ara and Syed Mohammad Ziaul Karim ordered the defence to submit the report by Tuesday after hearing the bail petition of the mayor in the Bijoy TV corruption case. Earlier on Sept 14, another vacation bench of justices Khondker Musa Khaled and Farid Ahmed refused to hear the bail appeal. Dr Kamal Hossain, representing Mohiuddin, said the mayor being 'very sick' required bail. The Appellate Division on July 30 halted the proceedings in the case, he also said. Advocate Harisadhan Deb Barman and advocate Abdul Baset Majumder assisted Kamal Hossain in the hearing. The Anticorruption Commission filed the case on May 27 last year, and pressed charges on Nov 22, against Mohiuddin and two others for launching the channel without prior permission of the government. bdne
