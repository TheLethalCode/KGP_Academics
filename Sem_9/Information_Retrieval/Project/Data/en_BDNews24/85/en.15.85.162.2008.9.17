 MOSCOW, Sep 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed friendship treaties with Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia on Wednesday and promised them the backing of Russia's armed forces. The treaties formalize military, diplomatic and economic co-operation between Moscow and the separatist regions, which Russia recognized as independent states after its brief war with Georgia last month. Medvedev signed the treaties with South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity and Abkhaz leader Sergei Bagapsh. Only Nicaragua has followed Moscow's lead and recognized the enclaves as independent. In a speech after the signing ceremony in the Kremlin, Medvedev said Russia committed itself to defend Abkhazia and South Ossetia from any Georgian aggression. Russia says it was morally obliged to send troops and tanks into South Ossetia last month to prevent what it called a Georgian genocide against the region's residents. Moscow's action drew widespread international condemnation. "The documents we have signed envisage that our countries will jointly undertake the necessary measures for counteracting threats to peace ... and opposing acts of aggression." "We will show each other all necessary support, including military support," Medvedev said. "A repeat of the Georgian aggression ... would lead to a catastrophe on a regional scale, so no one should be in doubt that we will not allow new military adventures. No one should have any illusions."
