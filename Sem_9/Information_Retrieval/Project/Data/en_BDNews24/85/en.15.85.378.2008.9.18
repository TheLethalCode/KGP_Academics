 Tokyo,Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Japan's ruling parties have agreed to call a general election for October 26, in hopes a bounce in support for a new prime minister will limit damage to its massive majority, the Asahi newspaper said on Thursday. The main ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is set to pick a new leader on Monday, after unpopular Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda stepped down this month. Polls suggest the new leader will be outspoken former foreign minister Taro Aso. Parliament would likely be dissolved on October 3 and the election campaigning start on October 14, the paper said, citing sources within the LDP and its junior coalition partner, the New Komeito. A final decision would be made after the new prime minister was appointed, the Asahi said. Japan is not required to hold an election for the lower house of parliament until next September but a snap poll has been widely predicted because the LDP hopes to take advantage of a jump in voter support for a new prime minister. But some in the LDP said the government should delay the election to allow it to pass a supplementary budget with tax cuts and other fiscal measures to ease financial uncertainty after the collapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothers, the paper said. The new LDP leader will almost certainly become prime minister because of the party's domination of the lower house of parliament, which appoints Japan's premier. Analysts say voters could be evenly divided between the two major political parties, possibly triggering a rejigging of lawmakers' loyalties. Left in the shadows during the LDP's leadership campaign, the main opposition Democratic Party is trying to increase its numbers ahead of the expected election, by seeking a merger with the small conservative People's New Party. The People's New Party, which has five members in the lower house of parliament, was founded by former members of the LDP who opposed then-prime minister Junichiro Koizumi's plan to privatize the postal system. Koizumi called a snap election in 2005 as a referendum on the issue and led the LDP to a landslide victory
