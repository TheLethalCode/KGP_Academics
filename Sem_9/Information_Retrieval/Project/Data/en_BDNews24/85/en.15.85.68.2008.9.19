 Perth, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Oil rose for a third day on Friday, towards $99 a barrel, on growing US and Nigerian supply concerns even as the dollar jumped on an emerging US government plan for a comprehensive solution to the financial crisis. Central banks around the world have pumped billions of dollars to credit markets and US authorities are working on a plan to mop up bad debt after previous actions including bailouts failed to restore market confidence, aiding commodities that have been hammered by a flight from risk. US light crude for October delivery rose 62 cents to $98.50 a barrel by 2:45 a.m. EDT, posting a third day of gains as prices rebounded from a seven-month low of $90.51 a barrel on Wednesday in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers' collapse, the near failure of insurer AIG and takeover of Merrill Lynch. London Brent crude rose 43 cents to $95.62. "I think oil is up because there is more confidence in the financial markets. There is a feeling that the crisis is bottoming out and some may see it as a good time to buy," said Gerard Rigby, an independent energy consultant based in Sydney. While the financial crisis roiled markets from stocks to bonds to foreign exchange, some oil traders were shifting their focus back to fundamentals, with worries over falling US inventory levels and Nigerian attacks aiding a $7 recovery. But analysts said ructions on Wall Street would still be a key factor. The US dollar rose against the yen and recouped most losses against the euro on Friday on reports Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is considering a comprehensive solution to the current financial crisis. "Traders will continue to alternate focus between the financial markets, which could result in further demand destruction, dollar movements as well as production out of the US Gulf of Mexico," said Gerard Burg, a resource analyst at the National Australian Bank in Melbourne. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Paulson plan to work through the weekend with Congress on a comprehensive plan to deal with toxic bank assets choking the financial system, a Treasury spokeswoman said on Thursday. Some 93 percent of the oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, source of a quarter of the nation's crude output, remained idled on Thursday along with about 14.5 percent of the nation's refined fuel capacity. Analysts said rising tensions in Nigeria's crude-rich Niger Delta region will also lend support, with militants threatening to broaden their "oil war" to offshore oil fields. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has cut one-fifth of OPEC member Nigeria's oil output. Despite supply concerns in the US and Nigeria, fresh signs of weaker crude demand in China, the world's No. 2 energy consumer, curtailed some of oil's earlier gains. Asia's top refiner, Sinopec, plans to reduce crude oil imports by 8-10 percent from the amount originally planned for the rest of the year, while cutting crude through-put due to ample domestic fuel supplies, a company official said on Friday. Oil market participants were also keeping a close eye on No. 2 U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley -- a major player in energy markets -- which was said to be in advance talks to be bought by U.S. retail bank Wachovia Corp. Morgan Stanley withdrew from a half-hour oil trading window, used to assess benchmark prices, after pricing agency Platts placed it under review because of counterparty concerns over its credit status, although the move does not stop Morgan Stanley from trading as normal in the open market
