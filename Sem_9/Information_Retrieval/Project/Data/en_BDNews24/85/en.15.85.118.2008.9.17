 LONDON, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Luiz Felipe Scolari said his Chelsea team did not play as well as he would have liked despite their emphatic 4-0 win over Girondins Bordeaux in their opening Champions League Group A match on Tuesday. "We started very well, we got three points but we made too many mistakes. We did not control the game enough, we let them have too much of the ball, especially in the second half, but we did get two late goals," said the Brazilian. "However, the most important thing was the result." Scolari, taking charge of a team in the Champions League for the first time in his long career and gesticulating wildly from the dugout, singled out Frank Lampard for praise saying he had been outstanding for the last three or four years in Europe. "He loves football, he trains hard every day and when you do this God helps you. If you didn't do this in training you would not do well in the match." Lampard opened the scoring after 14 minutes before Joe Cole doubled Chelsea's lead on the half-hour. Although Chelsea dominated the match they did not score again until the 82nd when Florent Malouda made it 3-0. Nicolas Anelka added the fourth with the last kick of the game. "OK, the result was good and it is important to win but we made too many mistakes," said Scolari. BLANC FRUSTRATED Bordeaux manager Laurent Blanc, a winner at Stamford Bridge during his spell in central defence with Manchester United at the start of the decade, said Chelsea were far the better team. "We always knew it was going to be tough if Chelsea opened the scoring but it was frustrating they took the lead from a situationwith Frank Lampard getting on the end of a cross  that we knew all about. "It was also frustrating that a little guy like Joe Cole can get in front of two or three big blokes in defence and head it in it was frustrating. "We knew we were playing a top side but we should have shown a bit more physical effort and commitment. It's disappointing. We battled so hard to get into this competition and we didn't seem to be aggressive enough or up for it tonight," he added. "Chelsea were better than us and we looked a bit fragile. We have been a bit inconsistent in the League as well. What summed up our night was their third goal and the way they went through our defence. We have to be tougher." Scolari added that he was delighted Chelsea captain John Terry's red card against Manchester City in the Premier League on Saturday was rescinded by the Football Association on Tuesday and that he could now play against Manchester United on Sunday. "I have never known anything like that before," said the Brazilian. "It can only happen in England. "I am very pleased. It proves the referee is not Godeveryone makes m
