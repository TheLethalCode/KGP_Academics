 KARACHI, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan batsman Younis Khan will skip the inaugural Twenty20 Champions League tournament to concentrate on playing first class cricket in Australia. The tournament, to be held Dec. 3-10 with $6 million in prize money will feature two teams from each of Australia, India and South Africa and the champions from the English and Pakistan domestic competitions.
