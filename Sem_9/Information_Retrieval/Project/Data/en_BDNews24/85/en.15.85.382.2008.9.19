 NEW DELHI, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies opening batsman Xavier Marshall has tested positive for a banned substance, a senior cricket board official told website www.cricinfo.com. Jamaican Marshall and Tonito Willett from Leeward Islands tested positive last month at a camp to pick the side to face England in the Stanford Twenty20 winner-take-all $20 million (11.1 million pound) match on November 1, the report said. Donald Peters, chief executive of the West Indies board (WICB), told Cricinfo any action would be taken after receiving legal advice. He did not say what substance was involved. "They (attorneys) are looking into the matter and will advise us the course of action," Peters said. "WICB has a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and the matter could come up to the disciplinary committee. We are looking at a time frame of two weeks." The 22-year-old Marshall has played four tests and 18 one-day internationals
