<TITLE> Jamaat flip-flop shocks EC </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has been taken by surprise at the flip-flop of Jamaat-e-Islami which agreed to get registered in their first two rounds of talks only to reverse its stance in the final round, the chief election commissioner says. The Islami Oikyo Jote has done the same, the EC has said. "Oh my God! What do I hear from the Jamaat and Islami Oikyo Jote hujoors (religious leaders) in the holy month of Ramadan?" a bewildered chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said to reporters on Monday. "Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote had earlier told us that they agreed on the issue of registration. But the amazing thing is that this time they have gone back on their previous stances," Huda said. The EC held talks with the three parties of the four-party alliance  BNP, Jamaat-e-Islami and IOJ  on Sept 20. Jamaat and IOJ had joined the previous two rounds of dialogue sessions, but initially skipped the final round in a public show of solidarity with the BNP. When BNP decided to sit with the commission after the release on bail of party chief Khaleda Zia on Sept 11, the allies followed suit. "BNP have talked to the commission with a positive mentality. They seemed eager to join the elections, which makes us optimistic." "[But] they (Jamaat and IOJ) have made the U-turn, which I find impossible to believe." "Their attitude is very unfortunate," he said. All the 16 parties, who were invited to the dialogue, have agreed to get registered with the Election Commission, except those two parties, Huda said. Many parties including the Awami League have asked the EC not to allow the Jamaat-e-Islami, who they accuse of being backed by anti-liberation forces, to register. The statement of Jamaat secretary general Ali Ahsam Mohammad Mojahid in the first-round of dialogue held on Oct 25 last year that there was no war criminal in the country drew howls of protests from other political parties and the civil society. The party in its third-round dialogue asked the EC not to make the registration for the political parties mandatory. bdnew
