 ATHENS, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Olympiakos Piraeus continued their winning start to the Greek Super League season with a 4-1 victory over Panserraikos at the Karaiskakis Stadium on Sunday. After three rounds, the reigning champions are the only side with a 100 per cent record after Ergotelis were held to a 1-1 draw by Levadiakos. There were wins also for AEK Athens and Asteras Tripolis, while Panionios and OFI Crete drew 1-1. Olympiakos enjoyed a comfortable afternoon once Serbian striker Darko Kovacevic had turned superbly in the penalty area to put them ahead after 23 minutes. Four minutes later, Luciano Galletti made it 2-0 when he attacked down the right, stepped inside a defender and calmly swept the ball past the keeper. Olympiakos had to wait until the 81st minute for the third goal when Diogo rose unmarked to head home a Vassilis Torosidis cross. After Bozidar Tadic had pulled one back from the penalty spot, Oscar played a delightful one-two with Fernando Belluschi to complete the win. AEK had to work hard for a 1-0 win over Iraklis but they got it thanks to a 14th minute goal from Ignacio Scocco. They now have seven points along with PAOK and Ergotelis, who made a great start in their game as Dimitris Orfanos put them 1-0 up against Levadiakos in just the second minute. The visitors came back to level in the 37th minute through Eduardo Montoya. Bennard Koumordzi gave Panionios the lead in their home game against OFI Crete in the 61st minute. But former Panathinaikos striker Dame N'Doye got his second goal of the season four minutes later to give the Cretan side a share of the points. Asteras Tripolis, meanwhile, picked up their first win of the campaign as they beat Thrasyvoulos Filis 2-0. Both goals came in the second half through Jean Carlos in the 59th minute and Danijel Cesarec six minutes late
