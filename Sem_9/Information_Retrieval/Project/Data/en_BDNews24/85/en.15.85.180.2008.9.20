 Moscow,Sep 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia is against the United Nations taking any extra measures on Iran over its nuclear program for now, and thinks efforts towards dialogue should continue, the Foreign Ministry said on Saturday. The comments came after talks between majors powers over a fourth round of UN sanctions against Iran ended with no firm commitment on Friday. Western countries fear Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies.

Russia and China however have been resisting such moves
