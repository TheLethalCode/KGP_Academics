 LONDON (Reuters) - Oil rose to near $99 on Thursday as global markets rebounded and the US energy sector worked to restart operations shut by Hurricane Ike. Supply disruptions caused by rebel attacks in OPEC exporter Nigeria also supported prices, after turmoil in the financial markets sent prices tumbling earlier in the week. US crude traded up $1.83 to $98.99 a barrel by 1038 GMT, adding to a $6 gain on Wednesday, the largest one-day percentage gain in three months. London Brent crude rose $1.48 to $96.32 a barrel. Stocks gained after major central banks poured billions of dollars into the money markets to ease liquidity strain, with further support for crude coming from the weaker dollar. "Most of the big moves at the moment are financial market related rather than related to the fundamentals. A bit of weakness in the dollar seems to have pushed prices higher right now," said Tony Machacek, broker at Bache Commodities. Investors flocked into oil and other commodities earlier this year as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar, helping to push crude to a record high over $147 a barrel in July. Financial market worries pushed many investors into safer havens on Monday and Tuesday, traders said. Hurricane Ike toppled several platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and 12 refineries along the Gulf Coast remain shut following the storm. Nearly 96 percent of oil production in the Gulf -- home to a quarter of US output -- was still offline on Tuesday while a US government report released on Wednesday showed a sharp drop in crude stocks in the world's top consumer. Rising tensions in Nigeria's crude rich Niger Delta region have heightened supply concerns, with militants threatening on Wednesday to broaden their "oil war" to offshore oilfields. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has cut a fifth of OPEC member Nigeria's oil output. Analysts said trading could stay volatile as movements on broader financial markets could override supply and demand fundamentals. "In the current financial turmoil, trading commodities with any theme or rationale is still exposed to extraordinary exogenous factors which can bring waves of buying or selling, unrelated to the core fundamentals of each commodity," said Petromatrix analyst Olivier Jakob. Overnight, No 2 US investment bank Morgan Stanley and top US savings and loan Washington Mutual were reportedly up for sale, while Britain's Lloyds TSB agreed to buy rival HBOS. Gold prices have rallied by almost 12 percent over the last-two days, as investors look for a safe-haven away from rattled equity and bond markets
