 Madrid,Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A soldier was killed and another person wounded on Monday in a car bomb attack in the northern Spanish town of Santona, near the Basque Country, a government spokesman said. The blast took place at around 1 a.m. (7 a.m. EDT) near a military installation in the seaside town, in the region of Cantabria. It came within 24 hours of two car bomb attacks in the Basque Country, one of which wounded up to 11 people. State news agency EFE reported earlier that a man identifying himself as a member of Basque separatist guerrilla group ETA had called authorities shortly before the explosion. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades of armed struggle for traditional Basque lands in northern Spain and southwestern France. The attacks were carried out just days before the regional government was due to lodge a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights about Spanish authorities' refusal to let them hold a referendum-style vote on the Basque Country's future. The Basque Country, which has its own distinct language and culture, already has considerable autonomy over areas such as health and education
