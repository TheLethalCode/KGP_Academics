 Srinagar,Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A soldier was shot dead by militants and at least 25 people were wounded on Wednesday in two separate attacks by militants in Kashmir, police said. Armed militants threw a grenade into a crowded market in Kashmir, injuring 25 people, police said. The grenade was aimed at a police jeep in the heart of Srinagar, Kashmir's summer capital, they said. "The blast created panic in the busy area and people ran for cover in shops and buildings," said Latif Ahmed, a shopkeeper who witnessed the blast. In a separate attack, a soldier was killed in an encounter with militants in Kupwara sector of north Kashmir, police said. Officials say violence involving Indian troops and Muslim militants has declined significantly since India and Pakistan, who claim the region in full but rule in parts, started a peace process in 2004. But people are still killed in shootouts and occasional explosions. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Kashmir in nearly 20 years of violence
