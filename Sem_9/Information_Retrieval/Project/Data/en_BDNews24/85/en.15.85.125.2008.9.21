<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina has sought bail from the High Court in an extortion case filed by businessman Noor Ali. Hasina's counsel Sheikh Fazle Nur Taposh filed the bail petition Sunday on her behalf to a vacation bench of justices Sheikh Rezwan Ali and Md Roisuddin. "The hearing is set to take place on Monday," the lawyer said. The bail plea states that Hasina was currently abroad undergoing medical treatment on a temporary release order, but needed bail on health grounds. Unique Group chairman Noor Ali filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on June 13 last year against Hasina, her cousin Sheikh Helal and his wife Rupa Chowdhury accusing them of extorting Tk 5 crore. The HC on Aug 7 last year granted the AL president bail in the case on a writ petition challenging the case proceedings, but the Appellate Division later halted the bail order. Bail petitions in another two cases against the Awami League chief would be submitted to the HC on Monday, Taposh said. The government released Hasina on a temporary order on June 11 to seek treatment abroad. She was arrested on June 16 last year. bdnew
