<TEXT>
 Mumbai, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  The BSE Sensex should start sharply higher on Friday, taking cues from world markets on news the US government is set to design a broad plan to deal with the toxic bank assets clogging the financial systems. Asian stocks rallied and Wall Street had its best day in six years on Thursday boosted by the likelihood of a more comprehensive solution to the crisis than the current piecemeal approach. "We are going to ape the international movements. Expect a sharp gap up open," Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president at Karvy Stock Broking, said. He added investor confidence was still weak and markets may give up some of their gains later in the day, with Europe's opening keenly watched. The 30-share BSE index rebounded from sharp early losses and snapped a seven-day losing streak on Thursday, rising 0.4 percent to 13,315.60. It has lost more than 34 percent so far this year. Foreign fund outflows are a worry. Net sales this month have reached $1.7 billion, taking the total withdrawal to $9 billion this year. The annual inflation rate in early September came in above expectation at 12.14 percent, rising for the first time in four weeks. By 0340 GMT, Japan's Nikkei was up 3.2 percent and MSCI's measure of other Asian stocks was 5.3 percent higher. Nifty futures traded in Singapore climbed 5.5 percent. STOCKS TO WATCH Drugmaker Lupin Ltd, after it bought a 60 percent holding in South African marketing firm Pharma Dynamics, its third acquisition in as many months. Petronet LNG, after it deferred a planned shutdown of its import terminal from October to January, by when its capacity would be doubled to 10 million tonnes a year. Textiles firm Richa Industries, after it said it planned to invest 1.25 billion rupees on an infrastructure project in northern Uttarakhand state.
