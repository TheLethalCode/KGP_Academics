 NEW YORK, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Stocks soared on Friday, led by a surge in financial shares, as a series of sweeping steps to contain fallout from the credit crisis eased investor worries. The rally, coming a day after Wall Street notched its best day in six years, propelled shares of Bank of America , the No. 2 US bank, up 22 percent, making the stock the top boost to the S&P 500. Shares of No. 3 US bank JPMorgan Chase , up more than 16 percent, were a top boost to the Dow. The S&P financial index jumped 12.4 percent. US authorities, led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, are working on a comprehensive solution to mop up hundreds of billions of dollars of bad debt from banks' balance sheets that has choked the global financial system. Early Friday US securities regulators joined regulators from other countries in temporarily banning short sales of financial shares. In addition, the US Treasury said it will establish a program to guarantee money market fund holdings. The stabilization measures helped calm nerves on the last day of a tumultuous week that saw investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings file for bankruptcy protection and the US government bailing out insurer American International Group. "The authorities are trying to address the systemic risk now, rather than continue with an ad hoc approach," said Weston Boone, vice president of listed trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. ""We've had skyrocketing funding costs, interbank lending has dried up and there's been a run on money markets that's led to stress in the commercial paper market. It's all part of the historical intervention that's going on." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 402.95 points, or 3.66 percent, to 11,422.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index shot up 52.40 points, or 4.34 percent, to 1,258.91. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 89.99 points, or 4.09 percent, to 2,289.09. Shares of Washington Mutual climbed 35 percent to $4.06 after the Wall Street Journal reported that Citigroup was considering making a bid for the US savings and loan. Citigroup shares were up 21 percent to $20.48 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Morgan Stanley, pummeled earlier this week as investors fretted about the outlook for the last two remaining US investment banks, jumped 36 percent to $30.56. Shares of rival Goldman Sachs climbed 26 percent to $136.13. The Securities and Exchange Commission slapped the ban on short selling of nearly 800 financial stocks. On Thursday, British authorities also issued a ban on short selling. Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke plan to work through the weekend with Congress on a plan to set up an entity that will take bad assets off the balance sheets of banks. That entity could be similar to the Resolution Trust Corp, used to clean up the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s at a $400 billion cost to taxpayers. US President George W Bush will make a statement at 10:45 am EDT on Friday. "The president will discuss the causes of the crisis and outline actions being taken to stabilize markets and restore confidence," a White House spokeswoman said. The US Treasury Department announced it will use $50 billion to back money market mutual funds whose asset values fall below $1
