 SINGAPORE, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Asia's soccer chief is calling for the region's system of training and appointing referees to be overhauled in a bid to boost the standard of match officials. Declaring 2009 "AFC Asian Referees Year", President of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Mohamed Bin Hamman proposed a revamp to prevent bias in the choice of officials and to ensure only the best referees take control of important matches. "What happened in the past was that some people, and I'm not saying everyone, but some would say 'I prefer him or I don't prefer him' and the appointments of referees would not always be the best choices," Bin Hamman told the AFC's website.
