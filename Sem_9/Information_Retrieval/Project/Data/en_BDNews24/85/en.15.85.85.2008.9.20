<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission began talks with Jamaat-e-Islami on the concluding day of the final round of electoral dialogue Saturday. The talks started around 10:30 am at the EC Secretariat, with the seven-member Jamaat delegation being led by nayeb-e-ameer Moqbul Hossain, while chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda led the EC side. BNP, which has named a 10-member team for its dialogue, is set to sit with the EC at 11.30am. IOJ is scheduled to sit with the EC following BNP. Jamaat secretary general M Kamaruzzaman, before the party's meeting, told bdnews24.com that they would discuss registration of the political parties, the Representation of the People Order (amendment) Ordinance, withdrawing the state of emergency and holding national polls ahead of all other elections. The third and final round of electoral dialogue between the EC and political parties began on Sept 6, with a total of 16 parties invited. BNP and its allies skipped their previous schedule dialogues earlier in the month, however, saying they would not sit with the EC before the release of the Khaleda Zia from detention. On her release from prison on Sept 11, the BNP chief announced that her party would sit with the EC for talks and take part in the upcoming polls. Four-party alliance members Jaamat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote followed suit. bdn
