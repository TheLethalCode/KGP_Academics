 BARCELONA, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona rediscovered their scoring touch to beat Sporting Lisbon 3-1 in their Champions League Group C opener at the Nou Camp on Tuesday. Pep Guardiola's side had failed to win in their last three matches, scoring just once from the penalty spot coming into the game, but Rafael Marquez headed them in front midway through the first half. Striker Samuel Eto'o doubled the lead by converting a penalty on the hour but Barca looked vulnerable when Sporting's Tonel pulled a goal back in the 72nd minute.

Lionel Messi went close with a curling shot after a trademark cut in from the right flank but the breakthrough came from a set piece three minutes later.

Fabio Rochemback warmed Victor Valdes's hands with a powerful freekick after half-an-hour but it was only a brief respite. Barca continued to press and started finding space down the right through Daniel Alves and Messi in the second half. Eto'o was given the chance to extend the lead when Sporting defender Abel pushed him in the back as he went for a cross in the area, and the Cameroon striker scored from the spot. But Barca's nerves were jangling after defender Tonel got across to turn a Miguel Veloso free kick in at the near post soon after and Sporting grew in confidence. Messi stepped forward and helped rally his side, however, running at the visitors' backline and creating a number of opportunities in the closing stages. But it was Andres Iniesta who made the crucial opening by curling in a low cross from the left flank and Xavi poked the ball home at the back post with an outstretched foot
