 BAGHDAD, 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two bomb blasts killed six people and wounded 29 others in northern Iraq on Sunday, police said. In Baghdad, gunmen killed a senior Interior Ministry official, Brigadier-General Adel Abbas, along with his driver in a drive-by shooting. A suicide truck bomb killed three people and wounded 23 when it exploded at a police checkpoint in the northern city of Kirkuk, Brigadier-General Sarhat Qader, a local police chief, told Reuters. Kirkuk is 250 km (155 miles) north of Baghdad. Further south, a roadside bomb struck a minibus, killing three occupants and wounding six others on a road near the town of Jalawla in volatile Diyala province, police said. Violence in Iraq has been hovering at four-year lows. But insurgents have shown they are still capable of launching deadly attacks, especially in northern Iraq where al Qaeda militants regrouped after being pushed out of other parts of the country
