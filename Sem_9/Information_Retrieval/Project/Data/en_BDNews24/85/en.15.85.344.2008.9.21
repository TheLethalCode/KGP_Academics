<TEXT>
 Ljubljana,Sep 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Slovenians began voting for a new government on Sunday, anxious to maintain the prosperity the tiny Alpine country has gained since independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Most polls suggest the ruling centre-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) might retain its edge but recent surveys show the opposition centre-left Social Democrats (SD) and its allies could together get more seats in parliament than the SDS and its partners. The new government's priority will be to keep spending in check and curb high inflation while keeping the booming economy on track despite a global financial slowdown. Both camps pledge more market liberalization to help the country of 2 million people to reach that goal and analysts expect a high degree of political continuity whichever party wins. There will however be a need for consensus as polls show the winner will have to rely on several coalition partners to form the next government. Both main parties also promise to sell-off of dominant state-owned firms in the financial and energy sector. Slovenia is one of 10 mostly former communist states that joined the European Union in 2004 and was the first of the newcomers to adopt the euro in January 2007. It declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991 and has been a member of NATO since March 2004. About 1.7 million people are eligible voters who can chose between some 1,400 candidates competing for 90 seats in parliament. Polls opened at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. EDT) and were due to close at 1 p.m. EDT when the first exit poll projections of the results were expected on two national television channels. Preliminary official results are expected around 5 p.m. EDT
