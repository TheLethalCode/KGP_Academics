 Dhaka, Sept 20(bdnews24.com)AL leaders expressed mixed reaction to the chief adviser's announcement of a general election date on Saturday. Acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman, in an instant reaction to Fakhruddin Ahmed's televised address Saturday night, highlighted the fact that the chief adviser had not mentioned lifting the state of emergency. Acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam said: "We welcome the chief adviser's speech. Any doubts created about the national elections have been eradicated by the announcement." The CA in his speech announced the date of Jatiya Sangsad polls, to be held Dec 18, ahead of Upazila polls on Dec 24 and 28. In the lead up to and during the latest round of electoral dialogue, political parties including Awami League had demanded general elections ahead of all other polls. Lifting the state of emergency was another near-unanimous demand by parties. But, Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home after the speech: "Upazila elections will immediately follow the parliamentary elections. This will mean the elections won't be free. "There will be chaos. There will be 100 per cent chance of disruption of peace," he claimed. Ashraful, in a separate reaction, told bdnews24.com: "We have no doubts about the national elections any more. The CA's speech has proved correct the statements the Awami League has been making all along." "The Awami League will start its electoral activities from tomorrow to take part in the elections under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina," Ashraf said. He added: "It should be noted that the CA at one point in his speech said that he spoke to the two leaders and both of them along with their parties will take part in the upcoming elections." Zillur had earlier in the day said AL will not budge from demands for the release of party chief Sheikh Hasina and prioritising national elections. "Awami League welcomed 1/11. We have supported the roadmap of the Election Commission without any hesitation," Zillur said at an iftar party of Dhaka city AL unit on Saturday. "Awami League sat in dialogue with the Election Commission three times, and also had a sitting with advisers of the caretaker government." "Now, we will not budge an inch from our demands." The party has called an urgent presidium meeting to be held Sunday morning. The meeting will begin at 11:00am, at the Gulshan residence of AL acting president Zillur Rahman, said the party's deputy office secretary. Ashim Kumar Ukil told bdnews24.com that this meeting would review the political situation. bdnews24.com/
