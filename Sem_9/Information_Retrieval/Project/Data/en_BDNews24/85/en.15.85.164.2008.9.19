 Seoul, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - HSBC dropped a $6.3 billion offer for 51 percent of Korea Exchange Bank, blaming turmoil in financial markets and ending what would have been the biggest cross-border move in South Korea's bank sector. Abandoning the long-running deal, which had been beset by regulatory delays, added to speculation HSBC would look to buy a distressed western peer amid a financial sector shakeout that has seen share prices plunge and forced a hasty round of dealmaking. "In the light of developments around the world, not least changes in asset values in world markets, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of shareholders to continue to pursue this acquisition on the terms negotiated last year," HSBC Asia CEO Sandy Flockhart said in a statement. Shares in KEB, South Korea's sixth-ranked bank, tumbled 8 percent to 11,600 won by 0455 GMT on Friday in a broader market up 4.7 percent. Global stocks rallied on news the United States government was looking at a comprehensive solution to the financial crisis. John Grayken, chairman of U.S. private equity firm Lone Star, which was selling the KEB stake, said he was disappointed with HSBC's decision to walk away from the deal. Shares in HSBC, Europe's biggest bank by market value, rose nearly 6 percent in Hong Kong. HSBC, less damaged than many from the subprime mortgage meltdown, has been rumoured as a potential suitor for ailing U.S. savings and loan Washington Mutual and UK rival Royal Bank of Scotland. "Maybe it's better for HSBC to look at other markets. U.S. bank valuations are very depressed. That is very attractive to HSBC," said Y.K. Lee, analyst with Core Pacific-Yamaichi in Hong Kong. Analysts said big falls in global asset prices and tight funding might have pushed HSBC to look elsewhere. Also, KEB's share price has held up better than its peers because of the merger premium. HSBC may also be looking to preserve capital, they added. KEB had shed 13 percent in the past year to Thursday's close, outperforming the MSCI index for Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, which tumbled by nearly a third. Separately, HSBC said on Thursday its HSBC Overseas Holdings UK Ltd unit agreed to sell its 18.6 percent stake in Mexican micro credit lender Financiera Independencia for $145 million. With the British bank's withdrawal, Lone Star, which has been struggling to exit its $1.2 billion investment in the South Korean bank since 2006, is likely to offload its KEB shares in a block trade at a discount, analysts said. Rival Kookmin Bank, whose 2006 deal to buy a bigger stake of KEB for $7.3 billion was scrapped by Lone Star, said it was watching the situation with interest, though it is spending about $4 billion as part of the process of setting up a holding company. Kookmin shares were up 5.7 percent. "We think the likelihood of Lone Star selling its sake in the market is higher than before due to global liquidity constraints," Morgan Stanley said in a note. LONG DELAY HSBC agreed a year ago to buy Lone Star's majority stake in KEB, hoping to propel itself into the top ranks of Asia's third-largest banking market. The deal was also seen as a test of whether South Korea would live up to a pledge to open its financial sector wider to international investors. But a July 31 deadline to complete the deal passed without regulatory clearance because of ongoing legal disputes surrounding Lone Star's investment activities in South Korea. The original agreed purchase price of was 43 percent above KEB's Thursday's close. CEO Richard Wacker said in a speech to staff that KEB would work with Lone Star to find "a new shareholder that shares our goals for the future.
