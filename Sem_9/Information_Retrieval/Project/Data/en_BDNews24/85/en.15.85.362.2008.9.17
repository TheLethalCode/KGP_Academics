<TEXT>
 DUBAI, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English second-tier soccer team Burnley are looking for an investor from the oil-rich Gulf states to develop the club and steer them to the Premier League. Majority owner and property developer Brendan Flood admitted he was seeking to bring Middle Eastern funding and players to the humble northern England team, which competes in the Championship, the second tier of English soccer. "It's a club with super-sized ambition and we need an investor with a super-sized cheque book," Flood told Dubai-based magazine, Arabian Business. "It could help fulfil a lot for us." The move comes after the recent takeover of Manchester City by Abu Dhabi investors and media reports of interest by United Arab Emirates businessmen in Newcastle United and Liverpool. Flood said he was seeking $50 million to renovate Burnley's 126-year-old Turf Moor stadium and was also keen to take players from the Gulf on loan to boost the club's performance. Burnley are 12th in the Championship table on eight points, having won two of their six games this season
