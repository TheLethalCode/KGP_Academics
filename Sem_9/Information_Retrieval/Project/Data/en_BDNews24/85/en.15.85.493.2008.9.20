 Chittagong, Sept 20, (bdnews24.com) - Muktijoddha Sangsad KS lost their first away match of the Citycell B. League when the struggling giants went one goal down to hosts Chittagong Abahani Limited at MA Aziz Stadium Saturday. Shakawat Hossain Rony scored the all-import goal for Ctg Abahani Limited, who held Dhaka Mohammedan Sporting Club to a 1-1 draw in their first match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The port city side, Abahani, enjoyed superior ball possession in the first half over their superior rivals Muktijoddha Sangsad, who made a frustrating start with a 1-1 draw against Khulna Abahani KC in their first home match in Dhaka. Ctg Abahani produced at least three good opportunities in the first half, but unfortunately they failed to cash in on the chances due to poor finishing by strike duo Mithun and Nepalese Santosh Shahukhal. Mithun advanced into the danger zone with a solo effort, but his pacing-shot just went wide in the 11th minute before Jahid picking up a throw-pass from Mithun rattled the Muktijoddha sidebar in the 24th minute. Three minutes later, Santosh got into a better position, but the lanky striker smashed a shot miles off the target. After the barren first half, Muktijoddha Sangsad came alive with yielding three chances, but their strike duo Rokonuzzaman Khanchan and Murad Khan Milon spoiled the sitters to disappoint the freedom fighter side. Kanchan whipped a nice cross for Milon, who only needed to beat Abahani Nepalese keeper Kiran Kumar to find the net, but failed to connect his head in the 59th minute. Two minutes later, Milon saw his powerful shot rebound off Abahani keeper Kiran while Kanchan headed a chance wide off the near post in the 66th minute. The hosts finally broke the deadlock in the 76th minute when Rony hammered Mithun's right-side cross past Muktijoddha goalkeeper Nizam Majumder to give the few hundred spectators at the big bowl a wild celebration. bdnew
