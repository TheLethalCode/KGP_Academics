A senior official said two policemen were injured in the clash with militants around a house in the Muslim dominated Jamia Nagar area. There was a "fierce exchange" of gunfire around the house, eyewitnesses told the BBC. At least 20 people died in a series of blasts in the city last week. Television news channels showed an ambulance taking away a bloodied person from the crowded Jamia Nagar area after the gun battle ended.
