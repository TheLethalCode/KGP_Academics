 BUENOS AIRES, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Champions River Plate and their arch-rivals Boca Juniors slumped to shock defeats against modest opposition in the Argentine championship on Sunday. Boca, Argentina's most popular club, lost 3-2 at home to Tigre in a game where all the goals came in a remarkable first 32 minutes. Carlos Luna pounced on a poor clearance and Martin Morel curled in a free kick to put Tigre 2-0 ahead after only 12 minutes at the Bombonera. Boca pulled level when Sebastian Battaglia scored from close range in the 22nd minute and Jonathan Blanco put through his own goal, only for Morel to put Tigre back in front in the 32nd minute. Battaglia then turned villain when he was sent off in the 39th minute for a tackle from behind. River lost 3-1 at promoted San Martin-Tucuman despite taking an 11th-minute lead through Omar Merlo following a corner. Gustavo Ibanez equalised in the 34th minute before Daniel Vega and Enzo Bruno scored in the last 15 minutes for the hosts. Boca, who have 11 points from six games, dropped to fifth in the table, one point and one place behind San Martin, while River, who have only won once, slumped to 17th with six points. Tigre went second with 14 points, two behind leaders San Lorenzo who beat Colon 3-0 on Frida
