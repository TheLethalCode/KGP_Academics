 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  A former PWD chief engineer has won permission from a court to confess his crimes to the Truth Commission. The court on Sunday permitted AFM Manzurul Islam and his wife to seek clemency from the Commission despite graft charges already being pressed against them. Metropolitan sessions judge Md Azizul Huq stayed further proceedings of the case against the former chief engineer of the Public Works Department and his wife Akter Jahan Ruby for 30 days. Public prosecutor Ehsanul Huq Samaji told bdnews24.com that Manzurul and his wife were first to seek court permission for TAC clemency after being chargesheeted. The High Court had earlier granted them bail in the case. The couple also submitted their bail documents to the sessions court. Samaji said "anybody can seek clemency from the TAC until charges against him are framed by a court, according to the TAC laws". Manzurul Islam has been accused of amassing Tk 1 crore worth of illegal wealth and Ruby allegedly earned Tk 93.15 lakh through illegal means. The case was filed against them with Gulshan Police Station on Sept 6 last year.
