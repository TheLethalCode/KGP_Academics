 TOKYO, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dinara Safina and Svetlana Kuznetsova muscled their way to straight-set wins on Saturday to set up an all-Russian final at the Pan Pacific Open. Fourth seed Safina crushed compatriot Nadia Petrova 6-1 6-0 after the fifth-seeded Kuznetsova had beaten Slovenia's Katarina Srebotnik 7-6 6-2 in the day's first semi-final.

"I don't expect too many aces with my serve but it needs to be better," Kuznetsova said after facing 11 break points against qualifier Srebotnik. "Some days it works, some days it doesn't. If it doesn't work, I'll have to fight for every point." Six of the world's top 10 players entered the $1.34 million Pan Pacific tournament, although number one Serena Williams did not make the tri
