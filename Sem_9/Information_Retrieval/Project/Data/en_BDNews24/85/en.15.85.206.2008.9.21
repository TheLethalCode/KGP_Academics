 PARIS, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A penalty by Ederson gave Olympique Lyon a 1-0 win at Le Havre in Ligue 1 on Saturday and sent the seven times champions five points clear at the top. Brazilian midfielder Ederson converted the spot-kick just before the break after forward Frederic Piquionne was brought down in the box by Le Havre defender Nicolas Gilet. Lyon, chasing an eighth consecutive title, played the last 25 minutes with 10 men after forward Sidney Govou was sent off for a second booking.
