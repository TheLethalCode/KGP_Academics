<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  The interim cabinet on Saturday gave the final approval to the Right to Information Ordinance 2008, empowering public to access information in some public offices and non-governmental organisations. "The Right to Information Ordinance 2008 has been finally approved," Syed Fahim Munaim, press secretary to the chief adviser, said to reporters after the cabinet meeting. "As per the ordinance the related officials will supply primary information on issues including arrests and releases within 24 hours." The ordinance, which the president is expected to sign into a law, stipulates officials sitting in new posts to be created in most government offices and NGOs give the people information within 20 days of receiving applications. Whereas, officials are to give primary information within 24 hours on a person's life and death, arrest and release from jail, says the new law that has been demanded by the media, civil society and rights groups . Organisations funded by taxpayers' money and NGOs run on foreign funds are required by the ordinance to ensure people's right to information, officials who attended the meeting of the council of advisers said. The ordinance, finally given the go-ahead after the cabinet provisionally vetted it on June 18, does not cover six security agencies and a list of about 20 instances of exemption from disclosure of information, an official with the knowledge of the matter, said on condition that he not be named. National Security Intelligence, Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, Military Intelligence Directorate, Special Security Force, Criminal Investigation Department of Police and Central Intelligence Cell of the National Board of Revenue will stay beyond the reach of the ordinance. This provision will not apply to information having to do with corruption and human-rights violation. It aims to promote transparency and accountability, reduce corruption and facilitate good governance in government offices and NGOs. The ordinance provides for a three-member autonomous information commission headed by a chief information commissioner, mandated with a four-year term, to enforce the law and deal with complaints from the information seekers. One of the two commissioners will be a woman, Munaim said. The government will appoint staff at the suggestion of the commission to discharge its responsibilities across the country, according to the draft. The president will appoint the chairman and members of the commission at the suggestion of a five-member selection committee headed by a Supreme Court judge. The others who will be sitting on the commission will be two lawmakers from the treasury and opposition benches of the parliament nominated by the speaker, the cabinet secretary and a government representative. People will have the right to seek information from public offices in a prescribed form with a fee. The public offices will also maintain information so that the people can get information on demand. People living below poverty line can apply in white paper without paying fee. Individuals may file appeals with the information commission on being declined information. The officials may be penalised Tk 50 a day up to Tk 5,000 for such refusal. Media professionals have welcomed the ordinance but said some amendments they had suggested after the first draft of the ordinance had not found their way in the second draft. Some said the tool of empowerment may still need sharpening. bdnews24.
