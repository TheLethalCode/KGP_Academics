<TITLE> Bombing kills two in Swaziland </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Mbabane,Sep 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two people who were about to plant a bomb on a bridge near one of Swaziland's royal palaces were killed late on Saturday when the device exploded prematurely, police said on Sunday. "We can confirm that the bomb killed two people," said police spokesman Vusi Masuku. Swaziland has faced rare protests demanding democratic reform and greater social spending in the run-up to last Friday's parliamentary poll in one of the world's last absolute monarchies. Masuku said two other people, one believed to be South African, were also involved in the planned attack near a palace belonging to King Mswati III just outside the capital Mbabane. Police on Thursday detained several union leaders and prevented other labor activists from participating in a protest at the border with South Africa. Authorities said the protest would have led to anarchy ahead of the election. An estimated 400,000 Swazis were eligible to vote in the election in which 55 seats are being contested. Mswati, who rules the country of 1.1 million people with a free hand, will appoint an additional 10 deputies to the assembly. Final results, expected on Monday, are unlikely to change the country's political landscape since opposition parties have effectively been banned by royal decree since 1973. The monarch will also choose the country's prime minister and cabinet. Although Mswati remains popular among many of his subjects, there is rising discontent over his extravagant lifestyle, refusal to adopt democratic reforms and to tackle social problems, including one of Africa's worst AIDS epidemics
