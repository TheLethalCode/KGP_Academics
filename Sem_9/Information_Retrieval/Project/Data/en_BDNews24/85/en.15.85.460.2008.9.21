 LONDON, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal turned on the style to beat Bolton Wanderers 3-1 on Saturday and get an early-season taste of the top of the Premier League. They top the standings on 12 points, one ahead of Liverpool, who were held to a goalless Anfield draw by Stoke City. Chelsea, who host Manchester United on Sunday, have 10, with West Ham United up to fourth on nine after beating Newcastle United 3-1 in Gianfranco Zola's first game in charge. Bolton took the lead with a Kevin Davies header after 14 minutes but Arsenal poured forward in an almost frenzied response with Emmanuel Adebayor and Alexandre Song hitting the post.

The former Italy striker put West Ham ahead with a deflected shot, slotted the second before halftime and set up Matthew Etherington for the third early in the second half. Newcastle, without a manager, pulled one back through Michael Owen but they were well beaten. "Fantastic, I couldn't have asked for more than that," Zola told Sky Sports News. "It means a lot, the players worked very hard this week." In Saturday's other games Michael Chopra came off the bench to score twice as Sunderland beat Middlesbrough 2-0 and Blackburn Rovers beat Fulham 1-0 thanks to a late goal by Matt Derbyshire. There are four other games on Sunday featuring the four teams involved in UEFA Cup action last Thursda
