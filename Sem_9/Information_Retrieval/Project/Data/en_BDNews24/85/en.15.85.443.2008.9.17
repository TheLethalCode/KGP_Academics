 Dhaka, September 17 (bdnews24.com)The government plans to organise three policy-framing conferences on development of investment and growth, administrative reforms as well as education in November, an adviser said Wednesday. "We are working to hold elections in which all political parties will be taking part," Hossain Zillur Rahman told reporters at the commerce ministry. "We have completed the participation phase, and are now working on the qualitative phase so that no person of questionable character can take part or win them." "Basing on our talks with different groups, we have decided to hold these three policy-framing conferences in November on different aspects of dialogue. "Through the process, and with the participation of politicians, including the two top leaders, we'll be able to determine what the functions of the future government are to be, and necessary recommendations to resolve problems, if any, adopted." Top politicians will represent their respective parties at the proposed conferences. At an inter-ministerial meeting earlier, various programmes undertaken for the development of Chittagong as well as the decisions of the advisory council meeting were discussed, he said. bdnew
