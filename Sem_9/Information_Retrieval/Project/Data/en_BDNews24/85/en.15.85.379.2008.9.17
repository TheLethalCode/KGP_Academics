 ISLAMABAD (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The top U.S. military officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, reiterated on Wednesday a U.S. commitment to respect Pakistan's sovereignty after a flurry of U.S. strikes on militants in Pakistan strained relations between the allies. Mullen said this month he was not convinced Western forces were winning in Afghanistan and he was "looking at a new, more comprehensive strategy" that would cover both sides of the border, including Pakistan's tribal areas. U.S. officials say Taliban and al Qaeda-linked fighters use ethnic Pashtun tribal regions on the Pakistani side of the border as a springboard for attacks into Afghanistan. A new government in nuclear-armed Pakistan has promised support for the U.S.-led campaign against Islamist militancy even though the campaign is deeply unpopular with many Pakistanis. But Islamabad objects to cross-border strikes and protested against a bloody helicopter-borne ground assault by U.S. commandos in South Waziristan this month. There have been five U.S. missile strikes this month, killing militants and civilians. In talks with army commander General Ashfaq Kayani and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, Mullen expressed appreciation for the positive role Pakistan was playing in the war on terror and pledged U.S. support, the U.S. embassy said in a statement. "Admiral Mullen reiterated the U.S. commitment to respect Pakistan's sovereignty and to develop further U.S.-Pakistani cooperation and coordination," the embassy said. The tension with the United States compounded worry on Pakistan's financial markets. Dealers said the rupee weakened to a new low of 77.20/30, partly because of the row with the United States, a major source of financial help for Pakistan as it struggles with economic problems, but it firmed slightly before the close. Stocks also ended down in the lowest ever trading volume with tension with the United States adding to worry about a global financial crisis and weak domestic economic fundamentals. "NOT VIABLE" Army commander Kayani said last week Pakistan's territory would be defended at all cost and a military spokesman said on Tuesday aggression across the border would be confronted. Pakistan says U.S. strikes could spark an uprising among its Pashtun minority along the border. U.S. President George W. Bush approved the U.S. commando assault in South Waziristan on September 3 without Islamabad's permission as part of a presidential order on covert operations, officials and sources familiar with the matter said. But officials and analysts in Washington said the Bush administration was unlikely to use commando raids as a common tactic against militant havens in Pakistan because of the high-stake risks to U.S. policy in the region. "Unilateral actions are probably not a durable or a viable solution over a prolonged period of time," U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte said during a visit to Hong Kong. "The best way forward for both of our countries is to try and deal with the situation in that border area on a cooperative basis," he said. Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari, said in London on Tuesday he did not believe the United States would carry out more raids. Pakistani security officials said on Monday firing by Pakistani troops forced two U.S. military helicopters to turn back to Afghanistan after they crossed into Pakistani territory, although the U.S. and Pakistani militaries denied it. There have been no other reports of U.S. incursions or missile strikes since Friday but pilotless drones have been prowling over militant sanctuaries on the Afghan border. Villagers in both South and North Waziristan said drones were flying on Tuesday night. An intelligence official said militants tried to shoot one down with an anti-aircraft gun but failed.
