 Chittagong, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club held 10-member Sheikh Russel KC to a 1-1 home draw in the Citycell B. League at MA Aziz Stadium Sunday. Alfaz Ahmed put Sheikh Russel ahead in the 35th minute while Kamara restored the parity to Chittagong Mohammedan, who earlier played a 1-1 draw against title contenders Brothers Union in their first away match at Bangabandhu National Stadium. After the second round match, Sheikh Russel, who beat Farashganj SC 2-1 in their league opener, raised their point tally to four while Chittagong Mohammedan collected two points from as many matches. The visitors had to wait for 35 minutes to take the lead as veteran striker Alfaz headed a Saiful Islam header off a Moroccan playmaker Saeed free kick home from close before Sheikh Russel's Igir Mohammad saw his powerful shot blocked by Mohammedan defender Dhiman Barua three minutes later. The hosts, Mohammedan, took their first shot on target five minutes from break when Linkon whipped in a cross for Rafael, whose shot went miles off the target. After the resumption, Mohammedan stepped up the attack and the port city side were rewarded by a spot kick as Mohammedan's Touhid advanced into the danger zone and Sheikh Russel's defender Parvez Babu pushed Touhid down inside the box. Kamara converted the penalty shot to level the Mohammedan margin. Sheikh Russel were reduced to 10 men in the 70th minute when Parvez Babu collected his second yellow card making another foul on Touhid, but Sheikh Russel held their nerve up to end the remainder without any casualty. bdnew
