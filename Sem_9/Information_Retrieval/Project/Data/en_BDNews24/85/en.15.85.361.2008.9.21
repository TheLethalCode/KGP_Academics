<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Dhaka court has sentenced former Sonali Bank managing director Md Tahmilur Rahman to eight years in jail for graft, and a Tk 1 lakh fine or another three months in prison if the fine remains unpaid. Judge AK Roy of Special Judge's Court-2 handed down the verdict Sunday, in which Tahmilur was sentenced to five years for amassing illegal assets and another three years for concealing wealth related information. The court also ordered authorities to confiscate Tahmilur's illegally acquired assets. Since Tahmilur has been absconding, the verdict will be effective from the date of his arrest or surrender. Anticorruption Commission assistant director SM Manjur Ahmed filed the graft case on March 27 with Ramna Police Station. The case details said, in his wealth statement submitted with the ACC, Tahmilur concealed information about property worth Tk 1.19 crore with his wife Shamima Begum abetting him. The court could not deliver any verdict against Shamima as the higher court has set aside the charges pressed against her. bdne
