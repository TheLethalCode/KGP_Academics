 New Delhi, Sep 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India on Thursday said it has allowed foreign news and current affairs magazines to publish local editions, which will help readers get the magazines at cheaper rates, a government statement said. The foreign news and current affairs magazines like 'The Economist' are currently imported into India, which makes them costlier for readers. Indian publishers can now change the content and add local content and advertisements in such magazines, it said. Print publication advertising revenues in India generated 94 billion rupees ($2.4 billion) in 2007, or 48 percent of the country's media advertising revenues, PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) said in a report. Sustained economic growth and entry of new breed of advertisers would ensure steady print advertising growth of 14.5 percent over 2006-11, the report said. This has resulted in foreign media firms picking up stakes in Indian media firms. India currently allows 26 percent foreign direct investment in news publications and said it would continue to keep it at that levels
