 PORTO, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Two goals in two minutes from Argentines Lisandro Lopez and Lucho Gonzalez helped Porto to a 3-1 win over Fenerbahce in their opening Champions League Group G match on Wednesday. Porto top the group with three points with Arsenal and Dynamo Kiev who drew 1-1, sharing second spot. Striker Lisandro Lopez put Porto in front with an unstoppable 11th minute shot inside the area after a cross from the left by midfielder Raul Meireles. Two minutes later Lucho Gonzalez was set up by Uruguyan winger Cristian Rodriguez and doubled the lead. Spanish striker Daniel Guiza reduced the deficit for Fenerbahce when he tapped in a rebound after Porto's Helton failed to clear a header by Brazilian Alex after 29 minutes. Substitute Lino made the three points safe for Porto with the third goal in the stoppage time. In the last minutes the Turkish team squandered several chances including a shot by former Brazil defender Roberto Carlos which went wide. It is Porto's first win in the opening match of the Champions League for five seasons. "This team managed to break a first-round jinx. We played brilliantly for periods of the match," Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira told Sports TV. "But We squandered several chances to put the victory beyond doubt." Fenerbahce coach Luis Aragones, who joined the Turkish side after leading Spain to European Championship glory, said: "We handed over the game in those two minutes. "We knew Porto were very strong and we wanted to avoid conceding goals in the first 15 minutes. In the second half we played better and we had excellent chances but we ended up letting in another goal in injury time
