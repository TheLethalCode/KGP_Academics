A military spokesman said it appeared mechanical failure was the cause of the crash of the CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter. "Right now it appears it was not hostile activity. It appears to be a mechanical malfunction," the spokesman said. He said the total number of personnel on board the helicopter was seven. The helicopter was part of an aerial convoy flying from neighboring Kuwait to the Balad US military air base in Iraq
