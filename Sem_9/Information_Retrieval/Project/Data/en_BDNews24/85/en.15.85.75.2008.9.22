 Chittagong, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)  A Chittagong court Monday sentenced Jamaatul Mujahedin Bangladesh leader Jabed Iqbal Mohammad to 10 years in prison for involvement in the countrywide serial bombings of 2005. Speedy Trial Tribunal Judge Shafikul Karim also fined the JMB Chittagong chief Tk 5,000 or another year behind bars on failure to pay the sum. The judge acquitted another accused Arshadul Islam of charges. Both accused were present during the verdict. Three other accused in the case, JMB kingpins Shaikh Abdur Rahman, Siddikul Islam alias Bangla Bhai and Ataur Rahman Sunny, were executed last year for separate terrorist acts. The court had also earlier sentenced Jabed, one of the top leaders of the now-banned Islamist party, to 10 years in another case involving bomb attacks. JMB carried out a serial bomb attack across the country on Aug 17, 2005. Chittagong police filed a case with Double Mooring Police Station for the blast in front of a residential hotel at Agrabad. Charges were pressed on Feb 14 in which five people were made accused. bdnew
