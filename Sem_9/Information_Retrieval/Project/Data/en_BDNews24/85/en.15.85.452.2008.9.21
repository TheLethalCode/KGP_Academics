<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  A Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution (BSTI) team seized tins of two brands of Chinese powder milk in Chittagong Saturday, as those marketed without BSTI's clearance. Among the confiscated tins imported from China, 32 were Yashilli brand baby milk and other two packets were of the Unilack-Sanoara Corporation. The team has sent the milk to BSTI's laboratory for testing. Rezaul Karim Sircar, deputy director in charge of BSTI's Chittagong Zone, told bdnews24.com that they ran a drive at a number of shops in the city's Medical College area, GEC crossing and Karnafuli Complex, acting on a tip-off. He said Dhaka's Al-way Trading Company markets Yashili powder milk for babies. "It has not taken BSTI's approval before marketing. Therefore, we are doubtful of its standard." "Diplomilk, belongs to Sanoara Corporation, and has also been marketed without BSTI's approval." He added that Sanoara Corporation has not withdrawn its Diplomilk, notwithstanding BSTI's exaction of a Tk 50,000 fine for marketing its brand without BSTI's approval. But Mujibur Rahman, a director of Unilak-Sanoara Corporation, claimed that Diplomilk has not been marketed without BSTI's license. Speaking to bdnews24.com, he said they have taken the samples. "The approval process remains underway." The company applied to BSTI on Aug 8 seeking approval, paying fixed fees and submitting samples testing on Aug 12, he said. Diplomilk supplied samples to shops for market research purposesto gain buyers' opinions about the milk and the design on the tin cover not for selling commercially, the director claimed. He said, they have approval of marketing powder milk belonging to the Red Cow and Diplomilk until 2010, but they can't market these owing to the legal tangles.
