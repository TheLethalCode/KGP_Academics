 MADRID, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Espanyol, the Primera Liga's surprise early leaders, were one of the outstanding teams of the first half of last season before a dramatic collapse. This season, under new coach Bartolome "Tintin" Marquez, the Barcelona-based club are the only team with a 100 percent record after two rounds. But after the chastening experience of dropping out of the top four when they lost 13 of their last 19 matches last season, Espanyol are determined to avoid any over-confidence before their match against fifth-placed Getafe at home on Saturday. "Espanyol are used to experiencing euphoria followed by pessimism. We have to remain humble and work as hard as possible," said Marquez, who replaced Ernesto Valverde in the close season. Marquez will be without injured playmaker Ivan de la Pena, but could hand former Liverpool defender Steve Finnan his debut. Spain's Champions League contingent all return to action bolstered by positive results from the opening round of group matches during the week. Real Madrid saw off newcomers BATE Borisov 2-0 but face a tougher test away to Racing Santander on Sunday. The Cantabrians held Barcelona to a 1-1 draw at the Nou Camp last time out. The champions' defence has been the centre of attention after leaking five goals in their first two league matches. Promoted Numancia, who lost 4-3 at the Bernabeu last Sunday, almost snatched a last-minute equaliser after Real eased off. VAUNTED FRONTLINE Barca ended a run of three games without a win by beating Sporting Lisbon 3-1, but in contrast to Real it has been their failure to score goals that has been catching the headlines. The jury is still out on whether new coach Pep Guardiola can make the vaunted frontline of Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o function effectively. Before Tuesday's win they had scored once from the penalty spot in three games. On Sunday, they visit promoted Sporting Gijon, who are bottom. Villarreal held European champions Manchester United to a goalless draw away and on Sunday travel to take on Numancia, who have given both Real and Barca a good run for their money in their opening games. Atletico Madrid were impressive in dismantling PSV Eindhoven 3-0 away but need to prove they have the squad depth and the concentration to stay on course in the league when they receive Recreativo Huelva at the Calderon on Saturday. Their 2-1 defeat away to 10-man Valladolid last weekend is still fresh in the mind. On Sunday, Real Betis host Sevilla in the notoriously contentious city derby
