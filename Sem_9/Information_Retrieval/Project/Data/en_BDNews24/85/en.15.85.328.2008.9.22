 HARARE, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  David Shoko scored two minutes from time to hand Dynamos a place in the semi-finals of the African Champions League on Sunday with a 1-0 victory over Egyptian giants Zamalek. Shoko's late strike ensured second place in Group A for the Zimbabwean team, who will now meet Coton Sport of Cameroon in next month's semi-finals. Dynamos, beaten finalists in the same competition a decade ago, effectively needed only a draw to ensure their progress but Zamalek had to win away from home to stand any chance of reaching the last four. Egypt's Al Ahli kept up their unbeaten run in the league phase despite being held to a 2-2 draw by ASEC Abidjan in the last Group A match in Cairo. Al Ahli, who finished top of Group A with 12 points, meet Enyimba of Nigeria in the other semi-final. Mohamed Aboutrika gave Al Ahli a fifth minute lead but the hosts held it for just 45 seconds before Michael Akuffu equalised, getting first onto a long ball through the middle of the field. Al Ahli substitute Mahmoud Samir scored his first goal in continental competition with a 75th minute shot that the ASEC goalkeeper Daniel Yeboah dived over the top of. The lead was again short lived as Bi Cyriac Gohi produced some fine individual skill to bring ASEC level within four minutes. The first legs of the semi-finals will be played on the weekend of October 3-5 with the return game two weeks late
