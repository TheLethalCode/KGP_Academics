 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)Parliamentary polls will be held on Dec 18, ahead of Upazila elections, the chief adviser said Saturday in an announcement welcomed by political parties and diplomats in Dhaka. Elections to Upazilas will follow in less than a week in two phases, on Dec 24 and then on Dec 28. Fakhruddin Ahmed told the nation in his 8pm televised speech: "... the Election Commission has made the decision and informed me that the parliamentary elections will be held on the 18th of December this year." He did not say whether the emergency would be lifted before the elections, drawing flak from political parties including the heavyweights Awami League and BNP. But he did refer to the recent city polls when emergency rules were relaxed and said a similar step was on the cards ahead of the national elections. Fakhruddin said necessity would dictate the government actions. "We have no enmity with the political parties. Nor do we have any conflict of interest or motive," the interim government head said. The EC decision on the dates and order of elections, he said, came in response to demand from political parties. "In this march towards democratic transition, in order to avoid conflict, showing respect to the wishes of most of the political parties, the Election Commission has decided to hold the parliamentary elections first," Fakhruddin said. The chief adviser said the schedule for these elections would be announced by the Election Commission at a later date. In an instant reaction, acting Awami League chief Zillur Rahman said: "The chief adviser did not say anything about (lifting of) emergency ." He did welcome the announcement of the national polls date, though. "Upazila elections will immediately follow the parliamentary elections. This will mean the elections won't be free. There will be chaos. There will be 100 percent chance of disruption of peace," Zillur told reporters at his Gulshan home. BNP secretary general Khandaker Delwar Hossain, while hailing the date preceding Upazila polls, demanded emergency be lifted right away. Smaller parties sang more in tune with the two major parties, saying emergency should go before the national elections. They however welcomed the announcement of the date. The UK and US missions welcomed Saturday's announcement by the caretaker administration chief. The UK mission hailed "the reassurance it would provide to the Bangladeshi people", while the US embassy was "pleased" to see the polls roadmap being followed. The chief adviser also spoke on the preparations for the December polls, with participation of all the parties. "To this end, we have had a series of dialogues with the political parties . "We have had discussions with leaders of the two major parties. The two leaders have already announced their participation in the elections. "I had said in May in my speech to the nation that the parliamentary election would be held on a day in the third week of December," Fakhruddin said as he formally made the date public following an EC decision earlier in the day. "A major element in a fair and acceptable election is a flawless voter roll. There has been so much controversy in the past regarding voters' list. "In only 11 months, the Election Commission with assistance from the armed forces has prepared the roll for eight crore voters with their photographs. "At the same time, a database has been prepared for issuance of national identity cards. National ID cards are being issued." The chief adviser, who said his speech was not aimed at listing the interim government's achievements, referred to the "very peaceful" elections to the four big cities and nine municipalities on Aug 4. He sought to assure that the emergency laws would not also hamper or hinder the December elections. "I believe, the (national) elections will also be held in open, healthy and carefree atmosphere ... in this context, the issue of relaxing or even lifting the emergency is there. "I would like to say in unequivocal terms that the government will not hesitate for a moment to do everything necessary to hold a transparent and fair election," Fakhruddin said. "The relevant emergency laws or rules will be relaxed or repealed at the right time to facilitate campaign and candidates' preparations for the polls." But, the chief adviser warned against any attempts to disrupt peace and said the government would surely come down hard on anyone trying to foil a fair election. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had earlier said he had briefed Fakhruddin on "national and Upazila elections" after the final round of electoral dialogue wrapped up earlier Saturday. Huda told bdnews24.com correspondent Moinul Huq Chowdhury Saturday evening that the chief adviser would "speak on the matter in his speech to the nation". The election to the ninth parliament comes more than seven years after the eighth, held on Oct 1, 2001. The seventh was held on June 12, 1996, the highly controversial sixth on Feb 15, 1996, the fifth on Feb 27, 1991, the fourth on March 3, 1988, the third on May 7, 1986, the second on Feb 18, 1979. Elections to the parliament scheduled for Jan 22, 2007 were forestalled after days of political chaos and street violence leading to the state of emergency on Jan 11. The first parliamentary vote in independent Bangladesh took place on Mar 7, 1973. bdnews24.
