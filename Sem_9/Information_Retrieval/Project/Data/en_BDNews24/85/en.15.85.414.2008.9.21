 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Awami League Sunday pressed itself into election mode less than 24 hours after the head of the interim government announced a date for parliamentary polls. The party's election preparatory committee held a meeting Sunday morning at its offices in Dhanmondi, a party official said. Reorganising the committee was high on the agenda, information and research secretary Nuh-ul-Alam Lenin told bdnews24.com. "It was primarily meant to reactivate the committee ahead of the polls," said Lenin. AL had formed the committee before the scrapped Jan 22, 2007 polls. Advisory council member HT Imam chaired the meeting, attended by 20 assistant secretaries of the AL sub committees and some retired government officials, Lenin said. He did not name the retired government officials. "We will now spend time at offices regularly and resume our campaign," he added.
