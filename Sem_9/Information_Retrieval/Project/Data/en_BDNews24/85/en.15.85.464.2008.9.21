 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Politicians Sunday shrugged off calls for unity and consensus from business leaders who brought together the top leaders from the two major parties at a local hotel. FBCCI president Annisul Huq, hosting an Iftar attended also by editors and eminent persons, sought to make the politicians promise that they would stop hartals and strikes. "Now is the time to change," said Huq, posing for photo with politicians who accepted bouquets of flowers from FBCCI office-bearers and had a sumptuous iftar. "I am short in hearing. I could not hear anything. I will respond if I get a written proposal," said BNP secretary general Khandker Delwar Hossain, pressed by reporters after the post-iftar Huq speech. "We will publish our manifesto. Other parties will publish theirs. The people will choose the one they like," said Awami League presidium member Tofail Ahmed, responding to journalists. Another presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, seated on the podium alongside BNP and business leaders, did not comment. Barrister Rafiqul Huq, also seated with the political and business leaders at the main table, shared his progress on bringing the two top leaders across the table. "One of them is in the country. She's told me she's willing to sit anytime, at any neutral venue. 'I have no conditions,' she's told me," he said of BNP chief Khaleda Zia. "The other leader (Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina) who is abroad has assured me that she has no problem in principle. But she will make a final decision after consulting her party colleagues when she returns," said barrister Huq, who defended both former prime ministers in the court. "My objective has been partially fulfilled," the lawyer said, referring to the Iftar bringing the politicians together. Huq, the FBCCI president, told his audience: "If the politics of change has to start, now is the time for it." Tofail dismissed the FBCCI initiative, saying this was not the right forum for such discussion. "We have a policy. Other parties have their policies. Consensus or compromise between political parties cannot be reached this way. "Consensus or compromise is something that can be reached in the parliament." Asked whether AL election manifesto would promise not to call any further hartal, Tofail said, "We have already said that if we are elected to power we will continue the reform programmes of this government." Acting Awami League president Zillur Rahman and acting general secretary Syed Ashraful Islam did not attend the Iftar, held at the Winter Garden of Hotel Sheraton. Among the other Awami League leaders present were Motia Chowdhury, Farooq Ahmed Chowdhury, Saber Hossain Chowdhury, Abdul Mannan, Abul Maal Abdul Muhit, Asaduzzaman Noor and Hasan Mahmud. BNP leaders who attended the Iftar party included MK Anwar, RA Gani, Khandker Mahbubuddin Ahmad, Mahbubur Rahman, Abdullah Al Noman, Nazrul Islam Khan and Rizvy Ahmed. Besides, CPD chairman Prof Rehman Sobhan, Atiur Rahman, CPD executive director Mostafizur Rahman and Prof Abdullah Abu Sayeed attended. Among the editors were Ataus Samad, Abed Khan and Moazzem Hossain. Before the Iftar the leaders of Awami League and BNP moved among the guests and exchanged greetings. Huq in his written statement said, "Non-stop strikes, hartals and clashes in the past are still nightmares to us. We are the driving force of the economy. We do not want to intrude into anybody's territory. On the other hand, we are not ready to suffer undue losses." Apart from FBCCI directors, only notable presence among business leaders was former president Mir Nasir Hossain. bdn
