<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  The BNP secretary general says the amended Representation of People Order-2008 and the new electoral rules will be high on the agenda when the party delegates sit in a dialogue with election commissioners on Saturday. "We'll discuss the laws and the rules that the Election Commission has formulated," Khandker Delawar Hossain told reporters at the party's Naya Paltan headquarters. He said his party wanted to cooperate with the EC and the caretaker government for holding the polls if national elections were held ahead of the Upazila elections. "Our discussion will also focus on registration of the political parties, demarcation of boundaries etc.," Delwar said. He alleged that the EC had wasted time in the past by not inviting the (mainstream) BNP to the dialogue. The EC will hold dialogue with the BNP and its allies Jaamat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote on Saturday, the CEC said earlier in the day. The EC was supposed to sit with the BNP to discuss polls on Sept 8, but the party did not turn up without its chairperson Khaleda Zia, released from prison on Sept 11. Delwar said there was no division in the BNP and that all the reformist leaders would continue with their posts. "M Saifur Rahman and Mahbubur Rahman will continue as standing committee members," said the secretary general. "I think the political parties should hold talks not only with the Election Commission but also among themselves to hold free, fair and credible polls," said Delwar, the former chief whip of the immediate-past parliament. BNP vice chair Sarwari Rahman, joint secretary Selima Rahman, Jubo Dal president Moazzem Hossain Alal and former MP Sohrab Uddin were also present at the briefing.
