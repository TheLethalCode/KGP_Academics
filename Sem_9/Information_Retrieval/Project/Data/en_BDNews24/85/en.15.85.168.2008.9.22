<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com)Inspector general of police Nur Mohammad has voiced frustrations over obstructions to the proposed new police ordinance. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Anticorruption Commission chairman Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury, the police chief said it had yet to be enacted due to lack of political will. "I have been raising my voice to help strengthen and straighten the police force for two years." "But the police ordinance is not being enacted." "Give the nation's police force a chance to be better by enforcing reforms," the police chief urged the government. "The Bangladesh police are not capable of being a strong force with the facilities they are currently provided with," said the IGP. Meanwhile, the capital will get two more police stations on Tuesday, making a total of 35. "Setting up new thanas means bringing people nearer to police. As the thanas become smaller in area the people concerned will be benefited," the IGP said. Additional commissioner of police Masudur Rahman told bdnews24.com: "IG Noor Mohammad will inaugurate Darussalam thana at 10am and Kadamtoli thana at 12 noon Tuesday." He pointed out that Dhaka Metropolitan Police began its journey with just 12 police stations and 6,000 law enforcers on Feb 1, 1976. At present 33 stations are operating in the city. Masudur Rahman said six more police stations have been approved. "These six will be inaugurated soon, to bring the number of thanas in the capital to 41," he said. bdnews24
