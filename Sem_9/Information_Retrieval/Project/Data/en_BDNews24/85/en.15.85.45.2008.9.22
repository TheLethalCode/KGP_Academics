 BELGRADE, Sept 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters)  Croatian champions and leaders Dinamo Zagreb suffered their first league defeat of the season when they went down 2-0 to rivals Hajduk Split at home on Sunday. In Serbia, Champions Partizan Belgrade stretched their perfect start to five games after a Zoran Tosic brace following Lamine Diarra's opener handed them a 3-0 win at Rad Belgrade. Second-half goals from Drago Gabric and Senijad Ibricic gave Hajduk their first away win over Dinamo in five years and slashed the Zagreb side's advantage to three points. Dinamo have 19 points from eight matches, Hajduk 16 and Cibalia Vinkovci in third have 14 after their 1-0 home victory over bottom team Zadar. Gabric fired Hajduk ahead when he blasted the ball into the roof of the net with a fierce shot and Ibricic finished a flowing team move in the closing stages to reward Hajduk's most inpressive recent performance. Serbia winger Zoran Tosic took his tally to seven goals in as many matches in all competitions to keep Partizan in the driving seat, three points ahead of Vojvodina Novi Sad. He rifled in a piledriver from 35 metres and steered in a looping header after Senegalese striker Lamine Diarra had fired the champions ahead with a crisp low shot from 12 metres. Former European Cup winners Red Star Belgrade chalked up their first win of the season after two goals from captain Nenad Milijas and a third by Branimir Subasic helped them to a 3-0 home success against Jagodina on Saturday. Red Star climbed four places up the 12-team league to seventh after Milijas netted with a penalty and a spectacular long-range shot either side of a clinical finish by Azerbaijan striker Branimir Subasi
