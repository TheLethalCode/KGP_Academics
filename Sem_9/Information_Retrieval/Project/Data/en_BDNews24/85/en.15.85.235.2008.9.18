 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission has detected embezzlement of about Tk 42 crore in the Chittagong zone of state-run telecoms operator Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). An ACC special team in its investigation found that the money in repair and maintenance heads was siphoned off during the fiscal years 2000-2001 to 2007-2008 in 13 divisional offices of the zone, ACC director general (Administration) Col Hanif Iqbal said at regular press briefing Thursday. "During the eight fiscal years Tk 104.15 crore was spent on the repair and maintenance heads in Chittagong telecommunications zone. Of the amount the officials and employees of the offices in collaboration with each other misappropriated Tk 41.90 crore." "The special team of ACC reviewed the records and took the statements of the officials and employees concerned from September 4 to 11. "From their statements it has been gathered that though the entry of outsiders in the telephone offices were banned hundreds of coolies and workers from outside were allowed in and the money was withdrawn." "ACC also found huge property with some officials and employees of Chittagong zone that do not match their income," Iqbal added. bdne
