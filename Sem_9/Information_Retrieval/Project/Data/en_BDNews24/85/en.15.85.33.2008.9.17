 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhrudin Ahmed is likely to address the nation on various issues including the elections schedule after he returns home from China, an adviser said on Wednesday. However, the Election Commission will announce the final date and schedule of the elections, the local government adviser M Anwarul Iqbal said. "The chief adviser should address the nation so that the people do not lose faith in the upcoming elections," Iqbal told reporters at the Secretariat. The interim government head might address the nation on return from China, Iqbal said. Asked which messages the chief adviser would deliver in his speech, he said: "Well, he knows about the matter. He should clarify the issues so that people are assured that the elections will take place." The government has moved to sit separately with political parties again to reach a consensus on emerging issues and a final set of recommendations will also be made after the dialogue, he added. On the government step to make arrangements for Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia to sit across the table, the adviser said: "We want not only the two leaders but all political parties sit together for discussion." "The government will make moves to this end after concluding separate dialogues. But it will be done if the parties show eagerness. "The two leaders contributed a lot to the country. They should sit together on various issues." On whether any charter would be made on the recommendations of the dialogue sessions with the political parties, Iqbal said: "I don't know about that. But a set of recommendations will be prepared." Asked if the Upazila polls would be held before general elections despite objections from major political parties he said: "The Election Commission is supposed to hold elections. It will decide in consultation with all parties." "The government has nothing to do with it," the adviser said. bdne
