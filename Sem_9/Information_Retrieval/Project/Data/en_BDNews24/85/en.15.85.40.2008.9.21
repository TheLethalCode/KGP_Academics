 Beijing,Sep 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A fire at a club in south China's Guangdong Province late on Saturday left at least 43 people dead and 88 injured, said state news agency Xinhua, citing local police. The fire broke out just before midnight at the King of the Dancers club, triggered by "fireworks" on the third floor, said local police. The club, located in the Longgang District of Shenzhen just across the border from Hong Kong, held hundreds of people at the time of the fire, said Xinhua. Many of the deaths and injuries occurred in a stampede to escape through a narrow hallway, Xinhua quoted a club staff member as saying. There was only a narrow aisle, about 10 meters (yards) long, in the hall. Many people got hurt in the stampede, said Yang Zhi, who works at the club. Of the 88 injured, 51 people were being treated in hospital and in stable condition, doctors said. The Party chief of the province, Wang Yang, has ordered an immediate investigation into the cause of the accident, said Xinhua, without giving any other details
