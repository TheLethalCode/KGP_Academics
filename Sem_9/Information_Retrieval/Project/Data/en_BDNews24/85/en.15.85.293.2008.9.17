<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh and India wrapped up maritime border demarcation talks on Wednesday with no tangible agreement on the mid-flow of the Hariabhanga, a border river, officials say. The mid-point of the Hariabhanga will be the borderline between the two neighbours. At the end of the three-day technical talks, which took place after a pause of 28 years, the two countries only agreed further discussions to settle the issue. The date for the next meeting will be decided through the diplomatic channels, the officials said. Bangladesh demanded that the main flow of the Harianbhanga, which divides the river into two separate channels by the South Talpatti Island off Satkhira district, passes through the western channel, while India claimed otherwise. If the mid flow is determined from eastern side, the South Talpatti Island will go to India while Bangladesh will get the disputed island if the main flow is determined from the western side. Bangladesh is on the eastern side of the river and India on the west. "That we sat for a dialogue after a pause of 28 years is in itself an achievement. Again, we have agreed to hold further discussions," additional secretary MA Mahmood, who led the Bangladesh delegation at the talks at the foreign ministry, told bdnews24.com. "We have said that Hariabhanga's main flow passes through the western channel while the Indian side has claimed that it goes through the eastern one," said Mahmood. "We are technical delegations. And our job is to find out each other's positions. We have discussed many techniques and methodologies (of the demarcation)," Rear Admiral B R Rao, the Indian delegation chief, told bdnews24.com before hurriedly leaving the conference venue. Rao would not say whether they could reach a consensus on determining the mid-point of the Hariabhanga. "We have told your foreign secretary to tell us when they can sit for the next meeting." "We have very fruitful discussion and we move forward." Mahmood said Bangladesh reiterated its position on sea boundary delimitation in 1980 and maintained that the main flow of the Hariabhanga should be decided from the western side. The sea boundary demarcation is seen very important for oil and gas exploration for both the countries. As per the timeframe set by the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), India will have to submit the map of its sea boundary by May 2009 and Bangladesh by July 2011. According to the United Nations Convention on Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS), Bangladesh will get 200 nautical miles into the Bay of Bengal as its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and further 150 nautical miles as extended continental shelf. Bangladesh, India and Myanmar have disputes over the sea boundary as all of the countries, in some cases, demand the same part of the Bay of Bengal on which they want to go for oil and gas exploration. Bangladesh a few months back started sea border delimitation talks with Myanmar and the next meeting is scheduled in January. bd
