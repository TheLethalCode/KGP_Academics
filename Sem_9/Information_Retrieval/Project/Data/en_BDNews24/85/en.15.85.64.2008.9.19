 LONDON, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Rival Premier League managers Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger joined forces on Thursday to support Kevin Keegan and Alan Curbishley who resigned from their jobs two weeks ago on points of principle. Both men quit only three games into the season with Curbishley leaving West Ham claiming that the club's board had undermined him over transfers. Keegan left Newcastle citing interference from directors as the main reason for his resignation. "I admire Kevin Keegan and I admire Alan Curbishley because they went on a matter of principle and the principle being I am not in control of my team any longer," Manchester United manager Ferguson told Sky Sports News at a League Managers Association dinner at Wembley Stadium. "Players were being sold over their heads without even acknowledging them. That is not acceptable. It is not why you set out to be a manager, on the whims of a chairman. Arsenal manager Wenger said: "If you have no control, but are responsible for success or for failure, that is terrible. "The manager is the most important man at the club, if not why do you sack the manager if it isn't going well?" Ferguson, who has been in charge of Manchester United for nearly 22 years, and Wenger, who is coming up to 12 years at Arsenal, are the two longest-serving managers in the Premier League. "In the modern climate of young chairmen and very rich chairmen, you really need to be successful and you have to manage different things from when Arsene and I started," Ferguson said. MUTUAL RESPECT "Yes, there are financial constraints we are all aware of that but when you change halfway through from the start of the season, and the manager is subjected to these problems, it's no longer the same job. "And so therefore they walk because it's a matter of principle and I totally agree with it." The pair also discussed the amount of overseas money pouring into the Premier League, highlighted by the Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of Manchester City. The group have said they will try and sign Cristiano Ronaldo from United and Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal in the January transfer window. Wenger said he thought big investment could destabilise the league. "New people are coming in for different reasons now," he said. "In England we had a generation of fans whose ambition was to buy the club of their dreams. Those days are gone. Now people are coming in for different reasons, maybe money or glory. "To have more money in the League is a good thing, but the inflationary pressure of having too much money is destabilising for other clubs, it puts a huge pressure on their resources." Although the two men are fierce rivals, they smiled and joked with each other. "There is a much better understanding and mutual respect now," said Wenger. Ferguson added: "We've sat and shared a glass of wine and a meal on many occasions on coaching conferences in Geneva. Of course there is respect. We've both got great teams and have had incredible competition over the last decade.
