<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad thinks the government wants to bring the two former prime ministers across the table to form a national government, forgoing general elections. "We hear about the meeting between the two leaders. As far as our knowledge goes water and oil don't mix. So what's the meeting for?" the former president said at a rally before iftar at a community centre at Jatrabari on Friday. The Jatrabari, Demra and Shyampur thana units of the party organised the function. Ershad announced that he would run the next parliamentary elections from Gulshan constituency. The former military strongman expressed doubts over the staging of general elections. "People think the elections will not be held. There will be a national government." Ershad, however, urged the party supporters to get ready for the elections. "Insha Allah (God willing) I'll contest Gulshan constituency." "I've prepared the party for elections. If the Upazila elections are held before the national elections we will participate in it. "I congratulate the present caretaker government on its realising the importance of the Upazila as a local government institution." He took a swipe at former caretaker government chief and president Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed. "If Shahabuddin did not betray in 1991 the Jatiya Party would have gone on to win the elections then." bdnews24
