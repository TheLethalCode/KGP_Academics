 Dhaka, Sept 20 (bdnews24.com)  Jama'at-e-Islami in its third round dialogue session with the Election Commission on Saturday challenged new law regarding party registration. The party also questioned the demand of political parties including Awami League to bar parties backed by anti-liberation forces and war criminals from registration. "Why should the commission comply with demands of other political parties in not allowing us to be registered?" a Jama'at leader asked. The party asked the EC to stage national elections ahead of all other polls, withdraw the state of emergency and halt the delimitation of constituencies. The Election Commission began talks with Jamaat-e-Islami around 10:30 am at the EC Secretariat, with the seven-member Jamaat delegation led by nayeb-e-ameer Moqbul Hossain, while chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda led the EC side. Jamaat secretary general M Kamaruzzaman, before the party's meeting, told bdnews24.com that they would discuss registration of the political parties under the Representation of the People Order (amendment) Ordinance, among other issues. After the talks, Jama'at assistant secretary general M Kamaruzzaman told reporters: "We have opposed the electoral law on registration of parties as it is unconstitutional. The commission cannot formulate such a law without the approval of parliament." The third and final round of electoral dialogue between the EC and political parties began on Sept 6, with a total of 16 parties invited. BNP and its allies boycotted their previously scheduled dialogues earlier in the month, however, saying they would not sit with the EC before the release of the Khaleda Zia from detention. On her release from prison on Sept 11, the BNP chief announced that her party would sit with the EC for talks and take part in the upcoming polls. Four-party alliance members Jaamat-e-Islami and Islami Oikya Jote followed suit. bdnew
