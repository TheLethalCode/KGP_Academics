 MIRANSHAH, Pakistan,Sep 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least four people were killed on Saturday in a suicide attack on a convoy of Pakistani security forces in the North Waziristan region on the Afghan border, intelligence officials said. North Waziristan is a sanctuary for al Qaeda and Taliban militants and has been the scene of fierce battles and suicide attacks over the past several years. The Saturday attack was near the town of Mir Ali, where a large number of Arab and Central Asian militants linked to al Qaeda are believed to be hiding. A military spokesman said the blast was caused by a suicide bomber but added the number of casualties was being determined. One intelligence official said four people were killed but another said up to 12 people died. Pakistan's new government has committed itself to the US-led campaign against Islamist militancy even though the campaign is deeply unpopular. Security forces launched offensives against militants in two parts of the northwest in August and the government says hundreds have been killed, but there has been no offensive in North Waziristan
