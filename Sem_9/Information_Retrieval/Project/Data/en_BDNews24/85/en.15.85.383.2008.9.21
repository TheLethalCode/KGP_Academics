 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institution does not presently have the necessary equipment to test for melamine in milk products, a senior government official said on Sunday, in the wake of a Chinese milk scare and two Bangladeshi firms found marketing Chinese milk products without BSTI approval. The commerce ministry has ordered legal action against Al-way Trading Company and Mou Enterprise for selling powdered milk not approved by the BSTI, commerce secretary Feroz Ahmed said. A BSTI team on Saturday seized tins of two brands of Chinese powdered milk in Chittagong, being marketed without BSTI's clearance. After a meeting on marketing of harmful milk, Feroz Ahmed said on Sunday the BSTI did not have necessary equipment to test for melamine but would be getting it soon. The government has asked the BSTI to test all imported powdered milk. The secretary said it might take up to seven days to test the milk substances. Ahmed said milk products of Sun Lee were not available on the market among three suspect Chinese brands. But brands by the name of 'Sweet Baby' by Sun Care and 'Yashilli-1' and 'Yashilli-2' of Yashilli company were being sold. The commerce secretary said Chinese authorities had earlier informed Bangladesh about the existence of harmful substance in the milk products of the two companies. Among the tins confiscated by the BSTI on Saturday, 32 were Yashilli brand baby milk and other two packets were of the Unilack-Sanoara Corporation. The team has sent the milk to BSTI's laboratory. Ahmed said two Bangladeshi companies imported milk from these brands. Among the two Chinese brands, Yashilli contacted the BSTI authorities six months ago for registration and testing of its milk. But it did not submit necessary papers and fee later. On punishment against the companies, the commerce secretary said, "The existing laws prescribe two years' jail term and Tk 5,000 in fine for such crime." The punishment was not at all adequate, he added. He said the ministry asked the BSTI and district administration to stop sales of the milk. Bangladesh imported 42,587 tonnes of milk powder from 11 countries in last fiscal year. Of them, 4,747 tonnes were from Chinese companies. In last three months, Bangladesh imported 6,660 tonnes milk. China ordered widespread checks on dairy products and a recall of tainted items as a scandal that began with powdered baby formula and spread to milk sparked an outcry from China's trading partners. Malaysia joined neighbouring Singapore in banning Chinese milk imports while a dairy company in Japan pulled Chinese products from supermarket shelves following a similar move in Hong Kong after products were found contaminated with potentially deadly melamine. Panicked parents have crowded China's hospitals and demanded redress since officials and the Sanlu Group, the country's biggest maker of infant milk powder, said last week that babies developed kidney stones and complications after drinking milk made from powder tainted with melamine, a compound used in making plastics. At the latest count, 6,244 children have become ill, four have died and 158 are suffering acute kidney failure. bdnews24
