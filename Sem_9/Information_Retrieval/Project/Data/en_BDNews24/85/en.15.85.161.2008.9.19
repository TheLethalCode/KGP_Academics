<TEXT>
 ROME, Sept 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Brief news ahead of this weekend's matches in Italy's Serie A. AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti hopes to have Gennaro Gattuso back for Sunday's clash with Lazio (1830 GMT) as his side seek their first points of the season. The midfielder, who was on the bench for Thursday's 3-1 win over FC Zurich in the UEFA Cup, is expected to wear strapping on the wrist he fractured with Italy earlier this month. Alessandro Nesta, Andrea Pirlo and Filippo Inzaghi are injured, but Swiss defender Philippe Senderos may recover from a back problem to make his league debut following his move from Arsenal. Lazio, who take a 100 percent record to the San Siro after two games, cannot call on injured striker Tommaso Rocchi and midfielders Ousmane Dabo and Fabio Firmani. Champions Inter Milan will travel to Torino on Sunday (1300) without Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari, who was handed a three-match ban for shoving his hand into the face of Giacomo Tedesco in last weekend's 2-1 win over Catania. Romania defender Cristian Chivu is likely to make an appearance after recovering from shoulder surgery. Inter boss Jose Mourinho said he is not satisfied despite following up on the Catania win, his first in Serie A, with a 2-0 victory at Panathinaikos in the Champions League. "I want to improve everything," the Portuguese coach was quoted as saying on the club website (www.inter.it). "We have won a Champions League match and we have four points in the league. I have enough experience not to go crazy with joy. I always want to improve our results and our game." Captain Alessandro Del Piero is in doubt for Juventus's visit to Cagliari on Sunday (1300) after taking a knock on his knee in Wednesday's Champion League victory over Zenit St Petersburg, when he scored the winning free kick. Italy midfielder Mauro Camoranesi and French striker David Trezeguet are doubts too with ankle and knee problems. AS Roma's injury crisis continues as they aim to secure their first win of the Serie A campaign on Saturday against Reggina (1830) after Tuesday's shock 2-1 defeat to Champions League debutants CFR Cluj of Romania. Defenders Juan and Max Tonetto and midfielders David Pizarro and Simone Perrotta are unavailable while centre back Philippe Mexes and forward Julio Baptista are doubts for the home match. Captain Francesco Totti is still not 100 percent fit after a knee injury and is likely to start on the bench
