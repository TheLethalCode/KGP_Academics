 WASHINGTON, Sep 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An 18-year-old American woman and her Yemeni husband were killed in the suicide attacks on the U.S. embassy in Sanaa on Wednesday, the State Department said on Thursday. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack identified the woman as Susan el-Baneh, saying she was killed while standing in line with members of her family applying to visit the United States. The Buffalo News, a Buffalo, New York, newspaper, reported on its Web site on Thursday that el-Baneh had traveled to Yemen a month ago to get married. It quoted her brother as saying she and her Yemeni husband appeared to have gone to the embassy to do paperwork for the husband's move to the United States when the attackers struck. A senior State Department official who asked not to be named said the husband's sister was injured in the attack. McCormack said he did not have a complete count of the number of people who died in the attack or their nationalities. Two suicide car bombs set off a series of explosions outside the U.S. embassy compound in Yemen on Wednesday, killing 16 people including six attackers, according to a Yemeni Interior Ministry official.
