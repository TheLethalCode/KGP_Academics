<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 24(bdnews24.com)About 50 people were injured Saturday as workers of a readymade garments factory were involved in several clashes with law enforcers in Malibagh, police and witnesses said. The workers, demanding Eid bonuses, ransacked over 100 vehicles and blockaded the MalibaghBaddah highway for two hours, causing heavy traffic tailbacks ahead of iftar in adjoining areas of the city, police said. Lineman Sujon of Islam Garments at Malibagh Chowdhuripara said workers of the factory had been demanding Eid bonuses for days, and had spoken to factory management about their bonuses several times on Saturday since morning. When management refused to give bonuses, angry workers left the factory at around the 3pm, and blockaded the main road clashing with police. They eventually began returning to the factory at about 5pm when they were assured of their bonuses. But a rumour that a worker of the factory had died during the day's unrest sparked the ransacking of vehicles, and more subsequent clashes with police. Colleagues of injured workers took them to adjacent hospitals and clinics. Police eventually calmed the situation and cleared the blockade around 5.30pm and traffic movement resumed. Ramna police officer-in-charge Daulat Akbar told bdnews24.com in the evening: "The situation has been brought under control, after the factory owners assured workers of their bonus." However, Daulat added, a service pistol belonging to a sub-inspector had gone missing during the clashes. bdnews
