 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Visitors Chittagong Mohammedan SC on Wednesday held 10-man Brothers Union to a 1-1 draw in a dull Citycell B. League encounter at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Favourite Brothers' failure to win means the professional football league saw four upsets in five matches after Abahani Limited and Muktijoddha Sangsad's defeats and Dhaka Mohammedan SC's draw. Sheikh Russel were the only giants to avert an upset when they held on to their nerves over against Farashganj SC to secure full points from their first-round match on Tuesday. Brothers Union began their B. League campaign from where they left off in the Federation Cup, where they had bowed out from the group stage in the season's curtain-raiser. The All Orange played with three foreign recruits  Nigerian defender Chibuike Divine, Ghanaian attacking midfielder Henry Quaye and Nigerian striker Michael Oniya  but the trio had virtually no impact on the game except a goal from Oniya. Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal chose a lone striker, Oniya, with Motiur Munna, Quaye and Shakil Ahmed linking up with the Nigerian striker. But they could hardly split Mohammedan's solid five-man backline marshalled by Prodip Borua, Dhiman Borua, Shawkat Khan, Khan Sharif and Lincoln. After surviving a close call, the Gopibagh outfit, who finished fifth last season, went down in the 34th minute before drawing level in the 45th minute. The port city side enjoyed a superior ball possession in the first half and came close to taking the lead when Brothers goalkeeper MN Shakil made a fumble only for captain Amit Khan Shuvro to clear the ball in the 19th minute. Mohammedan kept piling on the pressure and took an deserved lead in the 34th minute with Raphael Sagno powerfully driving a waist-high pass from Masud Parvez Kaiser from the left. Akbar Hossain Ridon was set up by Camara Saifo Ulaye to threaten Brothers again, but his powerful shot went narrowly wide of the far post in the 42nd minute. Brothers Union the made two forays in the span of two minutes and the equaliser came from one of them. Meeting a center by Arup Kumar from the right, left-stopper Meshu drove a low shot straight to Mohammedan's keeper Mamun Khan in the 44th minute. The next minute, Oniya back-heeled a Arup header off a Shakil corner when it was seemingly drifting wide of the far post. After the break, play was mostly confined to the midfield with no teams showing the hunger to score. Mohammedan got a good opportunity in a scramble when Sagno's push was blocked by Brothers defender Divine. Brothers were reduced to 10 men when Meshu was booked for the second time in the match in the 83rd minute, but they saw off the remainder of the match without further problem. b
