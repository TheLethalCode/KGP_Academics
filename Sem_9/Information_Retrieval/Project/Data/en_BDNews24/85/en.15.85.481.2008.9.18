<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Sept 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission would sit in a dialogue with BNP at 11.30am on Saturday, a top polls official said. It would hold talks with BNP's allies Jamaat-e-Islami at 10:30am and Islami Oikya Jote (IOJ) at 2pm on the same day. "Letters have been sent to the secretaries general of the three parties inviting them to the dialogue," EC secretary Md Humayun Kabir said at a regular briefing at the EC Secretariat on Thursday. Sept 7 was scheduled for the EC's dialogue with the BNP and Sept 8 for Jamaat and IOJ, but the four-party alliance partners skipped the talks demanding release of detained BNP chief Khaleda Zia. The EC took fresh initiatives for dialogue with BNP after Khaleda was released on bail on Sept 11. Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda had earlier said the talks would be held Thursday. But the alliance parties, the CEC said on Wednesday, would not be able to make it on Thursday. He said his office would send letters of invite on Thursday to the parties. The CEC had earlier told reporters: "We will also sit with Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote the same day. But they will have to send letters informing us of their interests to hold talks." Jamaat-e-Islami sent a letter to the commission on Wednesday seeking a convenient time and schedule to join the dialogue. Islami Oikyo Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami told bdnews24.com that they would also send a letter to the commission on Wednesday to let it know that they were eager to attend the dialogue. bdnew
