 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com) - Bangladesh Cricket Board on Wednesday banned 'rebel' cricketers, who have signed up for the breakaway Indian Cricket League, from playing for the country for 10 years. Former captain Habibul Bashar, middle-order batsman Aftab Ahmed, opener Shahriar Nafees, all-rounder Farhad Reza and spinner Musharraf Hossain submitted letters to the board on Sunday. They are set to play in the ICL. The board at an emergency meeting made the decision which will come effect from Wednesday. "The meeting decided to impose a ban of 10 years on players, officials, and technical staff of the board, who participate in the cricket events which are not authorised by the ICC (International Cricket Council) and BCB," board president Major General Sina Ibn Jamali told reporters emerging from the meeting. "The player, official, technical staff concerned will be banned from all events and competitions organised by the BCB and will not be allowed to use BCB facilities," he added. Thirteen 13 players from Bangladesh were unveiled in New Delhi to play for the team dubbed the Dhaka Warriors on Tuesday, according to cricinfo.com. The team, which will compete in the second season of (ICL) from October 10, will be led by Bashar, and includes recent internationals Aftab Ahmed, Alok Kapali, Shahriar Nafees, Farhad Reza, Dhiman Ghosh and Mosharraf Hossain. The executive members of the BCB ad-hoc committee sat at an emergency meeting after six contracted players, who had retired from international cricket, did not appear before the board on Tuesday to explain reasons for the retirement. The board refused to accept all six retirement letters as well as that of Nazimuddin, who applied for the same on Tuesday. Later the board in a statement said, "The board is looking into legal technicalities for taking appropriate proceedings against the players who have reportedly joined the Indian Cricket League. "It has also decided to review the existing format of the contracts with players to discourage such abrupt action by cricketers in the future." Cricinfo.com added the team will be coached by Balwinder Sandhu, the former India player, and also has players such as retired left-arm spinner Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya, Manjural Islam and Mohammad Sharif. The others are Golam Mabud, a reserve wicketkeeper, and Mahbubul Karim, who was part of the Bangladesh Academy team currently touring Sri Lanka. b
