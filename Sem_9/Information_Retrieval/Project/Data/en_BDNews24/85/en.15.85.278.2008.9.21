 Srinagar,Sep 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - At least 35 people, including 10 policemen, were wounded on Saturday in Kashmir's main city after Muslim protesters demanding an end to Indian rule clashed with police, witnesses and police said. Separatists had called a one-day strike across the Kashmir valley, forcing shops and businesses to shut and people to stay indoors. Violence broke out in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, when police tried to stop them from shutting down shops, a police spokesman said. Hundreds of protesters threw rocks at policemen, starting clashes in which 10 policemen and 25 other people were hurt. Saturday's strike was called by the Jammu-Kashmir Coordination Committee, a new alliance of Muslim separatists, representatives of businesses and lawyers. About 40 protesters have been killed by government forces since last month in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley when new protests broke out -- some of the biggest since a separatist revolt began in the Himalayan region in 1989. The protests were prompted by a government decision to grant land to build shelters for Hindu pilgrims travelling to Kashmir, one of the world's most militarised regions. At least 30 people were hurt in the Jammu region, where Hindu protesters clashed with police complaining against the government's inability to solve the dispute. The mass protests in the state take place at a time when violence involving Indian troops and separatist guerrillas has declined significantly after India and Pakistan, who have fought wars over the region, began a slow-moving peace process in 2004. b
