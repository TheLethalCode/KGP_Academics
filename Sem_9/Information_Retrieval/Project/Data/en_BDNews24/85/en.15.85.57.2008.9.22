 Pakistan, Sep, 22, (BBC online) Pakistan's top leaders were to have been in the Islamabad Marriott hotel when it was bombed - but changed venue at the last minute, officials say. Interior ministry head Rehman Malik said the president, prime minister and military chiefs should have been there. He told journalists it would have been "a great catastrophe", but did not say why the dinner plans were changed. A suicide bomb devastated the Marriot on Saturday, killing at least 53 people and wounding more than 266. 'Entire leadership' "The national assembly speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership - for the president, prime minister and armed services chiefs - at the Marriott that day," Mr Malik told reporters. "The president and the prime minister changed the venue to the prime minister's house. The function was not held at the Marriott, thus the whole leadership was saved." The bomb - believed to have been detonated in a lorry - left a six metre (20ft) crater. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.

One Vietnamese, a German and an American are also known to have died. No-one has yet admitted carrying out the attack, but the Pakistani Taleban are thought to be the most likely suspects. Earlier on Monday, Pakistan's government said it would take targeted action against the militants, promising raids in some "hotspots" near the border with Afghanistan. Meanwhile, reports from Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, say the Afghan consul in the city has been kidnapped. The consul, Abdul Khaliq Farahi, was in a car in a Peshawar suburb when it was attacked by six unidentified men, officials say. His driver died in the attack
