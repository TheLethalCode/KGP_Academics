 Dhaka, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com)  Selectors on Sunday recalled opener Nafis Iqbal, middle-order batsmen Rajin Saleh and Tushar Imran and left-arm spinner Enamul Haq Jr in the 24-member provisional squad for the home and away series against New Zealand and South Africa. Besides, Imrul Kayes, middle-order batsmen Shamsur Rahman and Naeem Islam, spinner Suhrawardi Shuvo, pacer Mahbubul Alam Robin and wicketkeeper Sahagir Hossain have also been brought to the provisional squad for the forst time. The move came after seven top players last week retired from all forms of crickets to play in the breakaway Indian Cricket League. Former captain Habibul Bashar, openers Shahriar Nafees and Nazim Uddin, middle-order batsman Aftab Ahmed, all-rounder Farhad Reza, wicketkeeper Dhiman Ghosh and spinner Mosharraf Hossain Rubel retired. The Tigers will host New Zealand for three one-day internationals and two Tests. The Kiwis are scheduled to arrive here on Sept 30 before playing the one-day international series opener on Oct. 9 in Dhaka. Bangladesh will tour South Africa in November to play three ODIs, two Tests and a Twenty20 match. Among four experienced players, Tushar played his last one-dayer against New Zealand in December last year. Nafis and Enamul played against Australia and Zimbabwe in 2005 while Rajin had his last OFI outing against Zimbabwe in 2006. None of the four were in the squad for the last two Tests against South Africa at home in February this year. Tushar and Rajin played their last Test match against Sri Lanka in July 2007 while Nafis played against Sri Lanka in March 2006. Enamul played his last Test against New Zealand in Jan 2008. Chief selector Rafiqul Alam apparently hinted that except Nafis three others were included following the void created by the players' retirement. "There is no doubt about the talent of Nafis, but he had earlier not been considered due to fitness problems as he had suffered from groin injury as well as a muscle pull," said Alam. Nafis, elder brother of Tamim Iqbal, struck five half centuries in the last super league of the Premier League and hammered 150 in the National League. Alam said, "Opener Javed Omar was in our consideration, but Nafis and Imrul are ahead of Javed as both openers had performed well in the last Premier and National League." The chief selector added Imrul had been having a good time with the GP-BCB Academy team, which are now in Sri Lanka. The Tigers will start their preparation for the home series from Monday at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Provisional squad: Tamim Iqbal, Zunaed Siddique, Mohammad Ashraful, Roqibul Hassan, Shakib Al Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Jr, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mashrafee Bin Mortaza, Abdur Razzak, Shahadat Hossain, Syed Rasel, Nazmul Hossain, Mahmud Ullah, Dollar Mahmud, Nafis Iqbal, Rajin Salah, Tushar Imran, Enamul Haque Jr, Imrul Kayes, Shamsur Rahman, Naeem Islam, Suhrawardi Shuvo, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Sahagir Hossain. b
