 Dhaka, Sept 20(bdnews24.com)A new entity styled Bangladesh Tourism Board, with more regulatory and facilitating role, will replace the current Parjatan Corporation, which runs commercial establishments, a senior official said. "Under a new guideline already drafted, Parjatan Corporation will be abolished, and Bangladesh Tourism Board formed," said Shafik Alam Mehdi, chairman of the corporation. "Five out of 10 directors of the Board will be appointed from the private sector, and therefore, they would be able contribute to the development of the tourism industry. "The government has already drafted new laws and guidelines in tune with the times to promote the country's tourism industry," the chairman said. "It is now awaiting approval of the council of advisers." Mehdi's comments came at a roundtable on the tourism industry at the capital's Federation Bhaban on Saturday. He said a CEO might be appointed to run the Board. "If need be, an experienced CEO may be brought in from abroad." He said that ambitious foreign investment proposals had come in for the tourism industry in Sonadia and Cox's Bazar. "The tourism board, once formed, will make decisions in this regard," the Parjatan Corportation chairman said. Mehdi said that 18 of the 40 establishments including bars, launches, hotels, motels and duty free stores operated by the Parjatan Corporation had been handed to private sector operators. The remaining 22 would also go to the private sector, he said. Himself a civil servant, Mehdi criticised his fellow bureaucrats, saying many of the government's "sound policies" had not been implemented due to "bureaucratic red tape". Chaired by FBCCI president Annisul Haq, Nitol Niloy Group's Matlub Ahmed said, "The Indian government provides 30 per cent subsidies to the private sector in the building of tourism infrastructure in north-east India. The same could be done for tourism in Bangladesh." He also suggested relaxation of visa procedures to attract more tourists to Bangladesh. bdnew
