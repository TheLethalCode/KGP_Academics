<TEXT>
 ROTTERDAM, Sept 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Jon Dahl Tomasson converted an 86th-minute penalty to salvage a point for Feyenoord in a 2-2 draw against arch rivals Ajax Amsterdam in the Dutch league on Sunday. Sloppy defending by Tim de Cler gave Luis Suarez the opportunity to set up Jeffrey Sarpong to open the scoring for Ajax with a well placed shot at the near post six minutes before the interval. Tomasson equalised on 50 minutes, heading a rebound into the net after goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg blocked a shot from winger Diego Biseswar. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored his first league goal of the season from close range in the 69th minute after another Feyenoord defensive blunder to restore the lead. With more passion than good football, Feyenoord fought back again to hand Tomasson the chance to score his fourth goal of the season after Urby Emanuelson fouled Michael Mols. Groningen, who drew 1-1 at Heracles Almelo on Saturday, are top with seven points from three matches, one more then ADO Den Haag, PSV Eindhoven and Willem II Tilburg, who lost against Graafschap Doetinchem, AZ Alkmaar and Utrecht respectively. Feyenoord and Ajax are ninth and 10th with four points. Jason Oost put Graafschap ahead one minute before the interval from the penalty spot, while Joep van den Ouweland sealed victory with 20 minutes remaining against ADO Den Haag on Sunda
