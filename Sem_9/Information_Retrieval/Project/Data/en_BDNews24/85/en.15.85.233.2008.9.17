 Dhaka, Sept 17 (bdnews24.com)  Chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda said on Wednesday that the commission would hold dialogue on Saturday with the BNP and its allies Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote in the four-party . He had earlier said the talks would be held Thursday. But after talking with the BNP leaders, the commission pushed the meeting to Saturday, he said. He said his office would send letters of invite on Thursday to the parties. The alliance earlier boycotted the dialogue on the grounds that they would join in only in presence of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who had been detained on corruption charges. Khaleda, facing a slew of corruption charges, was released on bail on Sept 11. Jamaat-e-Islami sent a letter to the commission on Wednesday seeking a convenient time and schedule to join the dialogue. Islami Oikyo Jote secretary general Abdul Latif Nezami told bdnews24.com that they would also send a letter to the commission on Wednesday to let it know that they were eager to attend the dialogue. The CEC had earlier told reporters: "We will also sit with Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Oikyo Jote the same day. But they will have to send letters informing us of their interests to hold talks." bdnew
