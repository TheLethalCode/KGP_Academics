 By Arshad Mahmud, bdnews24.com Correspondent in Washington. Washington, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  President Bush made a surprise visit to Iraq on Sunday to say good bye to his Iraqi counterpart and thank the American troops stationed there. But the farewell trip unexpectedly turned into a public relation disaster when an Iraqi journalist abruptly took off his shoes and hurled them both at Bush during a press conference. Television footage showed that Bush kept ducking from side to side as the journalist, identified as Mutadar al-Zaidi, a reporter with the Cairo-based network Al Baghdadia Television, began hurling his shoes moments after the American president finished his remarks and said "Thank you" in Arabic. The incident lent an air of chaos and farce to a trip intended to highlight improving security conditions in the war-torn country. "This is a farewell kiss!" the reporter shouted as he was quickly overpowered by security agents who pinned him down to the floor of the heavily guarded room where the press conference was underway. Unfazed, the reporter kept shouting "Dog, dog!" in an unusual display of anger and revulsion toward a man, who many Iraqis believe is responsible for the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of men, women and children. He was later forcibly evicted from the room A visibly embarrassed Bush later joked about the incident. "All I can report is it is a size 10," he said of the shoes. But the Americans were not amused. Watching the incident on evening newscasts analysts and commentators were struggling to figure out what and how it happened. In an effort to explain why the Iraqi reporter acted in that way, Richard Angel, Middle East bureau chief of the NBC News, said that he perhaps represented the growing frustration and anger of the Iraqi people toward a man held responsible for the living hell that Iraq has become under American occupation. Describing him as a good professional, Angel said he had known the Iraqi reporter during his long stay there. "I think he just snapped" he said, perhaps unable to endure the enormous suffering and misery of the Iraqi people. According to some news reports, al-Zaidi lost some of his close relatives in the war and he himself was kidnapped by followers of Muktada al-Sadr, a rebel Shiite leader, while reporting from Sadr City. He was released a few months ago. Bush traveled to Iraq under a veil of secrecy for his fourth and presumably final stop as president, then went on to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, landing after dark to attend a rally with U.S. and foreign troops deployed to that country. Both war zones will be central to defining his turbulent presidency. His last visit comes against a backdrop of declining violence across Iraq, which the Bush Administration attributes to a buildup of thousands of reinforcements last year. Yet attacks have continued and many areas in Iraq remain unstable, particularly in the north. Last week, at least 57 Iraqis were killed in a suicide attack at a popular restaurant outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk. Last week in a speech at the U.S. Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., Bush vigorously defended the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and argued that his administration had "laid a solid foundation" for Obama overseas. Bush also urged Obama to "stay on the offensive" against al Qaeda and other terrorist groups
