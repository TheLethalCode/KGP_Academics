 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com) - Gano Forum president Dr Kamal Hossain has urged voters to bring "meaningful change" to government through the next parliamentary election, by rejecting black money and criminals. "Even after one and a half decades of establishing parliamentary government in the country, its parliament is yet to be effective and efficiency of administration and law enforcement agencies has been neglected due to politicisation and nepotism," the veteran lawyer said on Saturday. "We should not let go this opportunity of establishing a just and civil society." "Let us put an end to politics of devastation and conflict and establish a new trend in politics, being inspired with the spirit of Liberation War," Dr Kamal urged voters in a televised speech on state-run BTV. The nation is now going through a "tough challenge to bring a meaningful change", for which people have been yearning, Dr Kamal said. To bring that change through an acceptable election, there is a need for healthy politics to establish the nation for which freedom fighters had laid down their lives, he observed. "During the last three decades we've seen many countries have developed and still they are marching forward, but we are lagging behind due to our ailing political system." "The previous governments have also failed to handle important issues like gas-oil exploration and power production." He said the next government must assure proper use of natural resources, investment in agriculture sector and the country's education system. He demanded autonomy of Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Radio and assurance of rights and security of women, religious minorities and indigenous communities. "We hope the people of the country will respond to the call of Gano Forum and vote for its candidates," the Gano Forum president said. "Remember our election logo: the rising sun. We want to bring new light to the country." The caretaker government on Dec. 14 invited 15 political parties to deliver electoral speeches on state-run TV and radio.
