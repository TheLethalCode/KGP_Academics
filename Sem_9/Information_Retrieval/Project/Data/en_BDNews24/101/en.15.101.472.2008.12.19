 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League on Thursday named some 10 four-party candidates, including Motiur Rahman Nizami and M Saifur Rahman, as breaching the electoral code and sought measures against them by the Election Commission. "Some 10 candidates from the BNP-Jamaat alliance have violated the electoral code of conduct," said HT Imam, co-chairman of AL election conduct committee. "Jamaat chief Nizami's remarks in line with the Pakistani spirit hurt the pro-liberation sentiment," he said. Saifur Rahman violated EC rules in erecting a gate in Sylhet, he added. Imam also quoted Jamaat Delwar Hossain Saidee as saying "people would not be able to wear a beard or a tupi (cap) if AL came to power". "On our complaint, the Election Commission assured us measures against the violations after investigations," the AL leader said. AL-led alliance candidates have been instructed to abide by the electoral codes, the AL election coordinator said. In reply to a question, he said grand alliance candidates winning High Court stay orders to run polls include Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir, Habibur Rahman Molla, Motiur Rahman, Ataur Rahman Shameem and Kazi Zafar Ahmed. He said the election officials informed they would act on the HC orders. An AL delegation met with chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda and other election officials on Thursday. AL central leaders including Alamgir were also present at the meeting. bdnew
