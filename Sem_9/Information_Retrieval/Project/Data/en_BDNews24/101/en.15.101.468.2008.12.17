 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Wednesday said the government was prepared to take further measures to help the Election Commission stop loan defaulters contesting the election with court stay orders. "The government is certainly prepared to take all necessary steps in this regard if the EC asks," said the adviser, in response to a reported comment by the chief election commissioner. ATM Shamsul Huda was quoted in the media on Wednesday, saying defaulting borrowers contesting polls with court stay orders "are not safe". In an interview published in a national daily, Huda said: "The Election Commission will seek Bangladesh Bank's help to fight a legal battle against those running the election with the court's stay orders." The Commission will revoke candidacies if the court's verdicts on defaulters' petitions are available before the election, the CEC said. He added that if the verdicts came after, the EC would recommend annulment of membership to parliament to the Speaker. The finance adviser's response came as he spoke Wednesday to the press after a training programme for new 27th BCS audit and accounts appointees. On a question about the slow pace in ADP implementation, Mirza Aziz said, "It's common with every government that implementation is slow in the first quarter of the fiscal year but the elected government will find no fund shortage as the caretaker government didn't borrow too much and revenue earnings were very healthy." The latest planning ministry statistics show the rate of ADP implementation in the July-Sept quarter this year was 13 percent. The adviser told participants in the BCS training programme: "Public servants have little mass interaction whereas their prime job is to protect people's interests." "It's unfortunate that many public servants ignore public interests to stay in the good books of political leaders during a party's term in government," he said. "This is not fair. The government officials must first make honest and unbiased proposals to the government or the concerned ministry, but have to act on the minister's choice," the finance adviser said. "Giving opinion just for flattery is unfair," he said. bd
