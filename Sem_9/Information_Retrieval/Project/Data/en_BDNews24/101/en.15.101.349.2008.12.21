 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Michael Laurence Henry, the new physiotherapist of Bangladesh, suffered a serious head injury during the Tigers' practice session on Sunday at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur. The Australian physio, who replaced South African Darryn Lifson from London-based rugby team Skolars Rugby League Club on Dec. 15, was hit on the forehead by a direct throw from wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim during fielding practice. He was taken to Apollo Hospital, given 13 stitches and had a CT scan. He was under observation at the hospital. "He is now out of danger as the CT scan revealed no internal bleeding. However, since it is a head injury, doctors decided to keep him under observation for 24 hours," said Shafiqul Haque Heera, the manager of the national team. Heera added Henry was unmindful of the throw as he was looking at another ball when the throw hit him. After practising in the indoor complex for the first two days, the cricketers had a nets session for the first time on Sunday afternoon. The pitches looked fine despite being covered for a few days in the wake of a dense fog
