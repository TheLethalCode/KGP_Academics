 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has voiced support for enactment of specific laws to try war criminals. "If necessary, laws should be enacted to try the war criminals, but they must be properly identified first," the former president said. "If the war criminals are not identified, they how can we try them?" Ershad was speaking to reporters during an election rally in the capital's Mohakhali area from where he is contesting. "If we are voted to power, we'll put an end to politics of conflict and stop hartal by enacting law," said the former military ruler. Thousands of party workers of the Awami League-led grand alliance gathered at the rally in support of the JP chairman and AL ally. Ershad pledged to curb essential prices, tackle the capital's traffic chaos, support freedom fighters and bring measures for population control. He promised free education for families with two children. Touching on another hot election topic, Ershad said his party would not make any law that went against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah. bdnews
