<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission on Sunday decided to allot 'sheaf of paddy' symbol to BNP candidate Mobashsher Alam Bhuiyan and a separate logo to another BNP contender Abdul Gafur Bhuiyan, now running as an independent, for Comilla-10 seat. "Mobashsher is the BNP candidate for the constituency and other candidate is Gafur, who in contradiction to the electoral law, filed nomination as both party and independent candidate," said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda. Huda after a meeting at the commission also said, "As Gafur obtained court's orders, we had to keep him on the list and hence is allowed as an independent candidate." The two Bhuiyans were at loggerheads when Mobashsher got the BNP's electoral symbol 'sheaf of paddy' on Dec. 12. But the court gave the go-ahead to Gafur, prompting the returning officer to give the symbol to latter instead on Dec. 19, Huda said. The CEC said the same problems sprang up also in Sirajganj-5 and Chandpur-1 constituencies as parties nominated more than one candidate for those seats. "Allotment issue is now over," he said. The returning officers were instructed to allot 'sheaf of paddy' to Manzur Kader and an independent symbol to Golam Maola Bablu for Sirajganj-5 seat, and 'boat' to Awami League's Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and an independent symbol to Mir Iqbal Hossain for Chandpur-1. Before that a five-member four-party delegation met the CEC. "An Awami League delegation met with us before a BNP team came here to discuss issues," the Election Commission chief said. "They had allegations of electoral code breach against each other." "All we want is parties concerned will abide by the electoral codes, will not attack personal characters and refrain from spreading lies or ills." On the use of mobile phones on the polling day, the CEC said they had yet to decide. Asked about the printing of ballot papers, Huda said, "I don't see a big problem about the printing at the moment." The last batch of candidates who got the allotment of polls symbols on Sunday after the court rulings are: Azizul Huq Chowdhury for Dinajpur-6 (boat), BM Selim Reza for Jessore-2 (Kula), Siddiqur Rahman Manna for Bhola-3 (betel leaf), Abdus Sobha for Barisal-1 (sheaf of paddy), Dewan Nazrul Islam for Tangail-7 (green coconut), Motiur Rahman for Mymensingh-4 (boat), Ataur Rahman Shamim for Moulvibazar-2 (boat), Kazi Zafar Ahmed for Comilla-11 (plough), Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury for Chittagong-14 (pineapple) and Habibur Rahman Molla for Dhaka-5 (boat). bd
