<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bndews24.com) Airlines were forced to reschedule flights Friday with dense fog severely disrupting air services in Dhaka over the last few days, according to airport officials. "So far, no flight has been delayed as such today (Friday), as operators had retimed early morning flights because of winter fog," Ajit Bhowmik, on-duty information officer at Zia International Airport told bdnews24.com. A number of flights were delayed on Wednesday and Thursday, owing to thick fog at ZIA, he said. "We hope that passengers will not be hampered further as all airlines have already changed their schedules where necessary ahead of time." Flights which were supposed to take off or land at ZIA between midnight and dawn would operate early or late. "Midnight flights will land or take off earlier in the evening. Those flights, supposed to operate in the early morning or at dawn, will now function after 9.00am to avoid foggy weather," said Bhowmick. Passengers can contact flight enquiries on 8914810-4 at ZIA to know about flight re-schedules. bnd
