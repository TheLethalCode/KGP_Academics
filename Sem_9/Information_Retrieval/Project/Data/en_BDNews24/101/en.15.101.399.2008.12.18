 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Bagerhat, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  AL president Sheikh Hasina has promised to activate Mongla Port if the grand alliance goes to power then. The former prime minister also pledged to infuse "new life into Khulna" by establishing new industries and factories, at a rally in the country's second port city Thursday afternoon. "In addition to activating Mongla Port, a deep sea port will be established in the Bay of Bengal to be opened to the whole of Asia," she said at Khulna Circuit House. "New power plants will be established, gas connections will be given and rail communication will be improved in Khulna." The AL chief criticised the four-party government saying that they only looted the resources of the country. "We started the work of Rupsha Bridge but the four-party government transformed the four lane bridge into two lanes and pilfered money," she claimed. "The four-party created a reign of terror in Khulna and journalists Manik Shaha and Humayun Kabir Balu were killed." To free Khulna of this situation the grand alliance needs to come to power, said Hasina. The AL president also promised sale of fertiliser in the open market, rationing for labourers and doubling of benefits for the elderly, freedom fighters and widows. Hasina left Dhaka on Tuesday to take her election campaign to the south-western districts. On Wednesday, she 'meeted and greeted' the people in her home town Tungipara in Gopalganj . On Thursday she travelled to Khulna via Bagerhat, where she addressed rallies at Chitalmari and Bagerhat town. bdnew
