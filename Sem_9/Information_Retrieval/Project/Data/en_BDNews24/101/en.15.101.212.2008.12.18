 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Dinajupur, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has again voiced her fears of 'election engineering' in the upcoming general election by "other competing parties". She brought the Election Commission's activities into question, saying "the commission is not neutral". "But we are contesting in the polls for the sake of democracy," Khaleda said in her Dinajpur rally on Thursday evening. "If those, who have claimed that the caretaker regime was an 'outcome of their movement', come to power  then you can imagine what they will bring to the country," Khaleda said. She mentioned the spiralling prices and the "hidden hunger" under the caretaker government's tenure. BNP refused to contest under the state of emergency, as her party did not want to be "chained", she said without clarifying what she meant by the word. "The government lifted the emergency complying with our demand," she claimed. Reaching Dinajpur Thursday afternoon, Khaleda visited the grave of her mother in the town. Earlier in the afternoon, she addressed another rally at Birol in the district, where she pledged to write off agricultural loans, and also promised to set up a land port in Birol. Following the evening rally in Dinajupur Town, Khaleda headed for Joypurhat district. The BNP chairperson left the capital on Wednesday to take her election campaign to the north of the country. During her two-day trip she was scheduled to address rallies in 13 northern districts to secure votes for candidates of her BNP-led four-party alliance. bd
