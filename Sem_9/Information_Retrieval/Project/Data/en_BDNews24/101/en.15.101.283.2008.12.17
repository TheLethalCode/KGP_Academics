 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The government has directed employing authorities to appoint concerned officials in government offices and NGOs in line with the Right to Information Ordinance-2008 by Thursday, the ministry of information said Wednesday. According to the new law, promulgated on Oct 20, organisations funded by taxpayers' money and NGOs run on foreign funds are required by the ordinance to ensure people's right to information within two months from the day of promulgation, the MoI said in a statement. Information sought, under the new law must be provided, in most cases, within 20 days of receiving applications. But, officials are required to give primary information within 24 hours on certain matters of death, arrest and release from jail, says the new law, which has long-been demanded by the media, civil society and rights groups. The ordinance also provides for a three-member autonomous information commission headed by a chief information commissioner, mandated with a four-year term, to enforce the law and deal with complaints from information seekers. The ordinance does not cover the six security agencies, or a list of about 20 instances of exemption from disclosure of information. The new law aims to promote transparency and accountability, reduce corruption and facilitate good governance in government offices and NGOs
