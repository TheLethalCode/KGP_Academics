 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has again question the neutrality of the government and the Election Commission and alleged that candidates of her party faced hurdles in carrying out campaigning. No action is being taken against those in breach of the electoral code of conduct, she said. She made the allegations at a rally for four-party alliance candidate and Jamaat-e-Islami secretary general Ali Ahsan Mohammed Mojaheed at the old bus-stand at Faridpur, on her way to Dhaka from Barisal on Sunday night. At another rally at 9pm, she introduced BNP nominee Shama Obaid to her electorate at Kamala roundabout. Mojaheed, who is running with polls logo 'scale', said the alliance, if elected, will set up a science and technology university in Faridpur. Earlier, at a rally at the Barisal Bels Park ground, she asked people to vote for the four-party alliance to have peace and development, and stop 'conspiracy'. "Due to lack of time, I am unable to go to many places but will visit them if I am elected," Khaleda said. The former prime minister pledged that, if elected, her government would start the work for a university in Barisal and construct the Padma Bridge. She reached Barisal at 5pm and addressed a rally on her way in Munshiganj of party candidate Shah Moazzem Hossain.

She said due to the conspiracy of the other alliance, the election of Jan. 22, 2007 was cancelled. "The present government is the result of a secret coalition with that alliance." Khaleda accused the government of not rehabilitating the people affected by cyclone Sidr. "I was put in prison and my sons were tortured because I love the country," she claimed . "If we are elected then initiatives will be taken to bring gas to Barisal from the Bhola gas field and a bridge will be constructed on the river Kirtonkhola." Khaleda also introduced former mayor Mujibur Rahman Sarwar, candidate for Barisal-5, former minister Altaf Hossain Chowdhury for Patuakhali-1, Khondokar Mahbub Hossain for Borguna-2, Elen Bhutto for Jhalakathi-2, Abul Hossain Khan for Barisal-6 and Nurul Islam Monju for Pirojpur-2.
