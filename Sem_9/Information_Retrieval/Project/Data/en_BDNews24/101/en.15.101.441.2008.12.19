 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com) - Rapid Action Battalion will take up a number of pre-election and post-election measures, including a crackdown on militants and extremists, to ensure a secure polls environment, said the RAB chief Thursday. The elite force has launched operations to arrest terrorists and intensified intelligence surveillance focusing on the polls, RAB director general Hasan Mahmud Khandker said. RAB's militancy prevention cell and its intelligence wing have been working specially to arrest fugitive leaders of banned militant group Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh ahead of polls slated for Dec. 29. Khandker said he does not see any likelihood of subversive activities during the polls, but have taken all security measures under serious consideration. The RAB boss said he does not expect any untoward incident in the south-western dictricts during the polls, as extremists groups there have remained inactive. But they will be remaining vigilant in the region, he added. Khandkaer, along with senior RAB officials, was briefing journalists on RAB activities during election at the force's headquarters in the city. RAB will be working alongside army and police in each district town and divisional city from Dec. 24. There will be a total of 6,000 RAB members across the country deployed prior to the polls - one company (75-200 members) in each city and one platoon (30 to 50 members) in each district town. The force will also patrol as mobile and striking forces during the vote and its bomb squad will remain ready. RAB members will also be working to check violations of the election code of conduct and ensuring that all voters can vote without fear, said the elite force chief. bd
