 ISLAMABAD, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's foreign minister said on Wednesday he was optimistic about peace talks with India despite an Indian-imposed "pause" but expressed frustration that offers of help in the Mumbai investigation had been shunned. Tension has been simmering between the nuclear-armed rivals since last month's assault on Mumbai, in which 179 people were killed, and which India has blamed on Pakistan-based militants. India said on Tuesday the attacks had led to a pause in the nearly five-year-old peace process the neighbours initiated after nearly going to war for a fourth time in 2002, after a militant attack on the Indian parliament. "I hope, I'm confident that we'll overcome this hiccup and I'm optimistic," Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told a news conference with his Swedish counterpart. The tentative peace process has brought better diplomatic, trade and sporting ties but little progress has been made on their major dispute over the divided Kashmir region where guerrillas have been battling Indian security forces since 1989. Asif Ali Zardari, who replaced former army chief Pervez Musharraf as Pakistan's president in September, had been trying to push the process forward. India, the United States and Britain have blamed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and other affiliated groups for the Mumbai attacks, saying Pakistan must do more to stamp out militants. LeT was set up to fight Indian rule in Kashmir and has been linked by U.S. officials and analysts to Pakistan's powerful Inter-Services Intelligence military spy agency, who they say use it as a tool to destabilise India. Pakistan has promised to cooperate in investigations and has denied any official links to the Mumbai attack. "YET TO HEAR" Qureshi expressed frustration with India's failure to react to what he described as "constructive" offers of help in the Mumbai investigation and said a "blame game" initiated by India could set peace efforts back to square one. He said an offer of a joint investigation and a high-level team to work with Indian investigators was still on the table. "But we have yet to hear from Indian authorities, responding positively or negatively, to our proposals," Qureshi said. He also said India had not shared any credible evidence through diplomatic channels, and instead the information Pakistan was getting was coming through the media. Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told the news conference information he had received was that Pakistan-based militants were behind the Mumbai attacks and Pakistan had a special responsibility to cooperate in the investigation. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has been under domestic pressure for a robust reaction to the attacks, but India's defence minister reiterated on Tuesday that the government was not planning a military response. Pakistan, fighting its own war against militants, has arrested scores of activists from an Islamic charity India says is an LeT front, and says it will abide by a U.N. decision to put LeT founder Hafiz Saeed on a sanctions list of people and organisations linked to al Qaeda. But analysts fear Pakistan's response will follow a familiar pattern. A similar Pakistani crackdown on Let and Jaish-e-Mohammad after the 2001 attack on the Indian parliament was widely regarded as a sham. Nevertheless, militant infiltration into Indian Kashmir fell off sharply as Pakistan reined in the groups.
