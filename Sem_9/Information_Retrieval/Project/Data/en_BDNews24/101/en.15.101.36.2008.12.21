 Dhaka, Dec 20(bdnews24.com)  Repair work on the submarine cable, delinked in Egypt on Friday, might be completed by Dec 26, the cable operator in Bangladesh told bdnews24.com on Saturday. "Repair work should end by Dec 26 and then lines will be fully restored," said Monowar Hossain, managing director of the Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company Ltd. He also said alternative measures were being taken for connectivity. "We will contact Bangladesh Telecom Company Limited in order to restore communications between Bangladesh and the rest of the world through satellite systems," Hossain added. The cable 'SEA-ME-WOE' was cut at some point in the Mediterranean Sea, 1,860 kilometres from Alexandria around 1.40pm Friday (BdST). Bangladesh initially lost internet connectivity with Europe, but was later partially re-connected through Singapore. Nevertheless, slow internet speed is prevailing around the country after the cable glitch. Bangladesh is connected with the SEA-ME-WE-4 cable system, used by some 16 telecoms firms of 14 countries. bd
