 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The met office has said that the dense fog currently blanketing Bangladesh will last for two more days. The country has experienced moderate to heavy fog for several days, hampering ferry communication and flights at Zia International Airport. "The fog will last for two more days because a huge quantity of humid air coming from the Arabian Sea is resulting in heavy fog from the northern region of India to Bangladesh," said Kamrul Hossain, met office meteorologist. "But the temperature is not falling to low despite the fog," he said, adding however that the mercury will slide once the cold air starts blowing from Siberia. On Saturday the lowest temperature recorded in the country was 13.7 in Rangpur while the highest was 29.3 in Teknaf. The lowest and highest temperatures of the capital were 15.5 degrees and 20 degrees respectively.
