<TITLE> Enamul, Rajin in for Sri Lanka Tests </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Selectors named left-arm spinner Enamul Haque Junior and middle-order batsman Rajin Saleh on Thursday in the 14-member squad for the two Test home series against Sri Lanka. Except the two inclusions, the selection committee head by Rafiqul Alam pinned their hopes on the players who toured South Africa last month for two Tests, three one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match. Enamul Haque, who played his last Test against New Zealand at Dunedin early this year, has come in for fellow left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak, who was suspended by International Cricket Council for his illegal bowling action last month. "Shakib (Al Hasan) is our main spinner and Enamul (Haque Junior) has been picked as the backup spinner as Razzak was not available for the selection following his suspension," Rafique said at a press conference at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Enamul has been playing in India's first class cricket league Ranji Trophy and grabbed five wickets in three matches so far. The 22-year-old is expected to leave India on Dec. 23, three days before the first Test starts on Dec 26 in Dhaka. The door for Rajin Saleh, dropped from the South Africa-bound squad following poor performance in the home series against New Zealand in October, was opened due to the injury of middle-order batsman Naeem Islam. Islam sustained a palm injury on Wednesday during the ninth round of National Cricket League. "Naeem Islam was given 14 days' rest following his injury and Rajin Saleh has come in for Naeem," said Rafique. Asked what criteria the committee had followed in picking the squad as Mahmudullah Riad was ignored although he struck three hundreds in the national league, Rafique said, "He is certainly a good batsman, but we did not consider him this time considering the strength of the middle order comprised of Mohammad Ashraful, Shakib Al Hasan, Roqibul Hasan and Mehrab Hossain Junior." Selectors also dropped pacer Nazmul Hossain, who did feature in the squad for South Africa but played not a single match. The tenure of Ashraful's captaincy expires on Dec. 31, but he was named captain for series and media committee chairman Jalal Younus said that the cricket operations committee would decide on the issue later. Squad: Mohammad Ashraful (captain), Mashrafee Bin Mortaza (vice captain), Tamim Iqbal, Junaed Siddique, Imrul Kayes, Roqibul Hasan, Mehrab Hossain Junior, Shakib Al Hasan, Rajin Saleh, Musfiqur Rahim, Shahadat Hossain, Enamul Haque Junior, Mahbubul Alam Robin and Sajedul Islam
