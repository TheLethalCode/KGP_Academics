<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Dec 21(bdnews24.com)  The deep scars left by the atrocities in 2001 are still fresh in the psyche of the people of Kaliakoir in Gazipur. As the Dec. 29 polls draw closer, they are wary of a repeat of the assaults, lootings and arson the supporters of BNP and its allies had unleashed before and after the previous general elections. Quamrul Ahsan, the chief of Kaliakoir Police Station, on Saturday assured a meeting of media and public in the Cha Bagan area of the Sadar Upazila that there would be nothing of that sort this time round. "Law-enforcers are prepared for any untoward incidents in the run-up to and after the vote." "We have set up a police camp at Fulbari area next to Boalia union," he pointed out. But the memories don't die. Instead, they bring fears of post-polls reprisals, despite the police chief's assurances, say locals. Ishwar Chandra Barman, 40, a victim of the 2001 atrocities, recalled how on Oct 19, two days before the 2001 election, four-party alliance adherents took him from his home. "I was beaten up with hands and legs tied, in broad daylight next to the bazaar." His crime? "I canvassed votes for Awami League," he told those gathered at the Cha Bagan on Saturday. People came to the market and watched as the perpetrators brutally beat Barman. He also told how the criminals "looted and vandalised" his house and business. "They also extorted Tk 40,000 from two of my neighbours of Gachhbari after the election." Others present at the meeting told how on Oct 23, 2001, some 50 four-party alliance supporters attacked Goloa, a village of Boalia union in the Upazila, and besieged the villagers. They raped, tortured, plundered and committed arson attacks on houses in the village for around two hours, witnesses and victims recalled seven years later. Trees were felled, cows were slaughtered, and fishing farms and cultivable land were grabbed, the victims said. Men and women jumped into a nearby river to save their lives. Two sisters of a minority Hindu family were raped. It was not only minorities who bore the brunt, Muslim supporters of Awami League also came under attack. The four-party alliance supporters looted and burnt down the houses of Dewan Ibrahim, a freedom fighter and an AL leader, and Nawab Ali, a supporter. Aminur Rahman, AL president of Madhyapara Union, told reporters that the BNP people trumped up charges against him in eight cases, against general secretary Ataur Rahman in three and against freedom fighter Sarwar Alam in two cases. Russell, an AL worker of Tengarbad, said after the election many teachers in the area were forced to save their jobs by bribing BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami men and others by going to court. As Ishwar Chandra Barman recounted on Saturday the ordeals he had faced in 2001, three young men came and spoke to him. A visibly disturbed Barman did not say what the men talked to him about. bdnews24.co
