<TEXT>
 Ruhul Amin Rana bdnews24.com correspondent Chittagong, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said a change is needed to save the country from pillage and corruption. "We should bring a change to save the country from the politics of looting and corruption," said the ex-president and former military strongman at a Chittagong rally on Sunday. "I have come to seek vote from you on behalf of 'grand alliance' not as the former president, but the older brother of [Awami League president Sheikh] Hasina." He said he believed that the alliance would win the Dec. 29 general elections. "The people want to see change. They do not want to go back to the past. They want to get rid of the graft of BNP." "There is no difference between plough and boat [the election logos of JP and AL]  both symbols will bag the ballots and win the election together. "We don't lie and make false promises. We will present something new to the country," he said. "It is not expected that BNP will win the election. The country will be ruined if the 'grand alliance' is defeated," Ershad warned. Jatiya Party is a key component of Awami League-led alliance for the upcoming election. The JP chief asked AL candidate Afsarul Amin for Chittagong-9 constituency to withdraw from the race. He urged people to vote instead for Morshed Murad Ibrahim from Jatiya Party, a grand alliance candidate,. Ershad reached Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong shortly after 11am for electioneering in the port city. Both AL and JP candidates are running jointly from a number of constituencies. On the issue, Ershad told reporters at the airport that the 'grand alliance' had decided that AL would withdraw its candidates from all other constituencies except three seats. "The announcement will come today," he said. On the comment of the four-party alliance about the possibility of the election being rigged, he said: "I am hopeful that this election will be the fairest one." BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Dec 18 at a rally in Dinajpur voiced her fear of 'election engineering' in the polls by other competing parties. "There was confusion about all previous elections after independence, minor rigging also took place there. But there is no such fear this time. The Election Commission is working fairly." On whether there was rigging in the 1986 election during his rule, the former president said to bdnews24.com: "There was such suspicion about all previous elections. But nothing of that sort will happen in this election." On confusion by various quarters about the election, Ershad said: "The Dec. 29 election will definitely be held. The 'grand alliance' will come to power." Ershad said Bangladesh would be made a prosperous country and free of militancy if they were elected. He called on people to help build a hunger-free Bangladesh, curb corruption and beat the price hike of essentials by casting votes for boat and plough. "I have come to seek vote from you on behalf of 'grand alliance' not as the former president, but as the older brother of Hasina." Ershad spoke at a public meeting to campaign for JP candidate former minister Anisul Islam in Chittagong-4 constituency (Hathazari). He also spoke at three more meetings to solicit vote for the JP candidate. After the Hathazari meeting, he spoke at a public rally for Morshed Murad Ibrahim in Chittagong-9 constituency. Earlier, he spoke at a press conference at Morshed's residence. Asked about the alliance pitting candidates against each other in some constituencies, he said it would be resolved by Sunday or Monday. Asked whether grand alliance will break up if he was not elected 'president', he said the issue would be resolved through discussion. He added that the relation between a brother and sister was not to be severed, referring to his 'ties' with Hasina. bdnew
