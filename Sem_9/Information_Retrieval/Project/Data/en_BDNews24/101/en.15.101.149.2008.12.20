<TITLE> Business end of B. League begins Sunday </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The second leg of the Citycell B. League, country's top class football, begins on Sunday after the first leg battle saw four giants staying closely on the 11-team point table. Holders Abahani have 22 points from 10 outings, just three points cushion of jointly placed Dhaka Mohammedan and Brothers Union while new powerhouse Sheikh Russel have 18 points. It is certain that spotlight will be on top four teams in the second phase as they are staying very closely though all of them dropped points in the first-leg matches against minnows, likes Rahmatganj MFS, Chittagong Mohammedan, etc. Rahmatganj have already been dubbed as a giants-killer after their stunning wins over Dhaka Abahani and Dhaka Mohammedan, and holding Sheikh Russel KC and the Old Dhaka outfit will certainly be the main headache for the title contenders in the second leg. Chittagong Mohammedan and Chittagong Abahani are still dangerous in both of their own and away dens where they snatched points from top teams like Dhaka Mohammedan, Brothers Union and Sheikh Russel. The Chittagong outfits are still factors for Dhaka's top teams in the title race. No top teams in the point table could be able to make a smooth start with Abahani losing to Rahmatganj and Mohammedan drawing against Chittagong Mohammedan in their respective openers, but they bounced back in the mid-way of the first leg before they again suffered from players' injuries. Both Abahani and Mohammedan found difficult time to select their best eleven in a few matches following injuries to many players and sometime they paid heavy cost for this. This time all top teams are almost free from injuries and have been gearing up for the final battles. "All of us are almost fit for the second leg and I hope that we will be able to perform consistently," said Mohammedan captain Arman Aziz, who recovered his knee injury. Mohammedan coach Maruful Haq said that the mental toughness would play a key role in the second-phase matches and his boys were ahead of others. Abahani coach Amalesh Sen said that he would apply all strategies Abahani need to clinch the B. League title for the second time. Captain Nazrul Islam said that they would try to avoid mistakes they had earlier made and try to play well in the matches coming. Brothers coach Wasim Iqbal said he wants to maintain the spirit his boys showed in the last few matches. Reigning champions Abahani Limited host Farashganj SC in the second-leg opener at Bangabandhu National Stadium. The sky-blue outfit managed a lone-goal win over Farashganj in the first-leg match. bd
