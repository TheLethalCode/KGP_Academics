<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  The two alliances led by Awami League and BNP are gearing up as the main players in the upcoming election battle in the port city. The AL-led grand alliance is making all-out efforts to add to their record in the previous polls, while the BNP-led camp is leaving no stone unturned in coaxing voters to repeat their 2001 lead against their rivals by 14 seats to 2. The two major alliances will see the fiercest fight as popularity and other merits of their candidates top election concerns among the public, say observers. Some 17 political parties in Chittagong have fielded 75 candidates, excluding seven independents running for four seats in the city and 12 in the district. Two constituencies, Chittagong-5 (Raozan) and Chittagong-6 (Rangunia), have only candidates from the alliances. Meanwhile, both AL and BNP have nomination-deprived party stalwarts running as independents in Chittagong-9 (Double Mooring), Chittagong-3 (Chandanaish), Chittagong-14 (Satkania) and Chittagong-16 (Sandwip) seats. The most candidates per seat are contesting for Chittagong-10 (Bandar-Patenga)  ten in all, seven party men and three independents. The city has turned into a centre of polls buzz, slogans and rallies as elsewhere in the country. Door-to-door canvassing has reached maximum momentum as candidates have begun campaigning day and night to drum up support. bd
