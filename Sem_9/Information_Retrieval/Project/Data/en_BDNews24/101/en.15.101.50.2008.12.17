 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) - With emergency lifted and the ninth Jatiya Sangsad polls with handover to an elected government drawing nearer, chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed says the future will judge his success or failure as head of the two-year interim administration. "I've tried to work with all of my intelligence, consciousness, and wisdom. The future will judge the success or failure of my works," the chief adviser said on Wednesday. Fakhruddin was talking to journalists who paid a courtesy call at the CA's Office. The former governor of Bangladesh Bank is planning a long vacation after handing over to the next elected government, he said, hinting the last 23 months of discharging state duties had tired him out. In a friendly meeting, Fakhruddin shook hands warmly with journalists "as if it was a farewell", said those who were present. Sipping tea, he chatted informally to the media representatives and took part in a photo session. Against the backdrop of political upheaval, Fakhruddin Ahmed took oath as chief adviser to the new caretaker government on Jan. 12, 2007, running the country under a state of emergency for almost two years. The emergency was finally lifted on Wednesday, with little fanfare or disruption, making way for what most parties and observers believe will be a 'free and fair' vote to elect a political government on Dec 29. One of his most memorable moments, he said when put on the spot by reporters Wednesday, was harvesting paddy with farmers in the fields of Dinajpur. "That memory still moves me," the CA said in a nostalgic mood. "I saw how the hard work of farmers had overcome the food crisis at the beginning of this year. I've had proof that farmers respond positively if they are supported and inspired." Fakhruddin expressed his gratitude to the press for "helping his government". "You've presented news of government activities efficiently and professionally, thereby providing a bridge between the government and the people." "Since we took over, I believe the government and the press have worked with the same goal," said the head of the interim administration. "I hope the press will continue in the same way in future." He said he was sorry to hear the news of ETV special correspondent Rashed Ahmed and two of his colleagues, who were injured in an accident in Sirajganj on Wednesday while covering Khaleda Zia's election campaign. Fakhruddin said he directed his press secretary to take all the necessary steps for their proper treatment. bdnews
