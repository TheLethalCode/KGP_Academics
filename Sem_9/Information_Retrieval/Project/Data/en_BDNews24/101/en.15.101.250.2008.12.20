<TITLE> US automakers get last-gasp bailout </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)The US auto industry, a pillar of American capitalism teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, received a much-needed shot in the arm on Friday as President Bush announced emergency loans of up to $17.4 billion The deal from the federal government, in return for extensive restructuring of outstanding debt and labour costs in coming months, is meant to shore up the domestic auto industry as it weathers a global economic downturn and cash crisis that has threatened General Motors and Chrysler with bankruptcy. Ford, the other of the Big Three Detroit carmakers, has said it does not need federal aid for now, but its executives have also argued that a collapse of any of the companies could bring down the entire industry. The White House announcement came after the US Congress failed to agree on an emergency bailout of the auto industry, which forced President Bush to take the decisive action he appeared unwilling to from the very beginning. As a strong believer in free market, Bush was opposed to bailing out a private company but his economic advisers apparently convinced him that the auto industry was too critical for the US economy to be allowed to go under. "Under ordinary circumstances, I would say [bankruptcy] is the price that failed companies must pay," Bush said. "But these are not ordinary circumstances. In the midst of a financial crisis and a recession, allowing the U.S. auto industry to collapse is not a responsible course of action." He said the move was necessary to avoid a "disorderly" collapse of an industry that directly or indirectly supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. The federal loans will give the companies "a brief window" to restructure "outside of bankruptcy" and prove they are financially viable. If that is not done by March 31, Bush said, the federal government will call in its loans and let individual companies declare bankruptcy or fail. The deadline and other restrictions attached to the loans "send a clear signal to everyone involved," Bush said. "The time to make the hard decisions to become viable is now -- or the only option will be bankruptcy." Under the administration's plan, GM will be eligible for $9.4 billion in loans and Chrysler will get $4 billion. In return, the companies will be expected to submit a restructuring plan no later than Feb. 17, 2009. Another $4 billion will be made available after Feb 28. In addition, the administration has set several non-binding requirements that, if not met by companies, would require them to spell out a "business case" for any deviation. These targets include a reworking of wage and benefit agreements so that by the end of 2009 they are on par with foreign automakers that have plants in the United States. Industry analysts, however, remain sceptical about the ultimate success of the emergency plan and raise questions about whether the plan was too little, too late. Indeed, the automakers received just half the amount they sought to ride out the current crisis and many economists predict the ills that afflict the auto industry are too serious to be cured within the next three months. But independent analysts agree that in a troubled situation like the one the United States is now going through, the Bush administration had a few options left, especially in a time of transition. President-elect Barack Obama agreed. In a news conference in Chicago this afternoon, Obama called Bush's action a "necessary step to help avoid a collapse of our auto industry that would have had devastating consequences for our economy and our workers." He added: "With the short-term assistance provided by this package, the auto companies must bring all their stakeholders together -- including labor, dealers, creditors and suppliers -- to make the hard choices necessary to achieve long-term viability. The auto companies must not squander this chance to reform bad management practices and begin the long-term restructuring that is absolutely necessary to save this critical industry and the millions of American jobs that depend on it, while also creating the fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow." Asked if he has any plans to change the loan terms when he takes office, in view of criticism from the United Auto Workers union, Obama declined to comment, saying he and his economic team have not yet seen all the details of the plan. But he said executives of the Big Three automakers must realize "that the American people's patience is running out and that they should seize on this opportunity . . . to come up with a plan" for long-term viability. "That means they're going to have to make some tough choices," he said. Top executives of the troubled companies also pledged to meet the requirements of the loan. In a news conference, GM chief executive Richard Wagoner Jr. said the loans would let the company develop "a blueprint for a new General Motors. . . . Our company that helped build this country." Chrysler chief executive Robert Nardelli shared his views. He said the company was "committed to meeting these requirements" and thanked the administration "for their confidence in the company.
