<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Home adviser MA Matin has said that there is no fear of any militant attack on Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. Indian television network CNN-IBN reported on Saturday that the former prime minister had been warned by Indian intelligence agencies that a six-member suicide squad of the banned Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh was planning an attempt on her life. "There is no possibility of attack on Sheikh Hasina because we have already taken the highest security measures," Matin told reporters at the Secretariat on Sunday. "Law enforcers including striking forces have been deployed," he said. On the law and order situation for the upcoming election the adviser said: "The government has taken all necessary arrangements in this regard." "The officials concerned are being given guidelines on overall issues relating to election security in meetings held in divisional levels and led by the chief adviser," he said. "No disruption of law and order is likely during the election," said the adviser. The home secretary had said on Saturday that "preventative measures" were being taken after the Indian TV report. "We have adopted all preventive measures after CNN-IBN's telecast of a plan to assassinate Sheikh Hasina by Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami," home secretary Md Abdul Karim told bdnews24.com. But he declined to disclose the measures. A spokesperson for the Indian high commission in Dhaka said he was not aware of the threat. "We have no official comment on this issue," Deepak Mittal, the spokesperson, told bdnews24.com. He said he came to know about the news from bdnews24.com's breaking news service on Saturday. Awami League spokesperson and joint secretary general Syed Ashraful Islam voiced concern, on Hasina's return to Bangladesh in early November, over reports that the party chief's life was in danger and sought highest security for her. He did not disclose any specific source to the media. The government deployed the top-level Special Security Force for former prime ministers Hasina and Khaleda Zia ahead of the elections. b
