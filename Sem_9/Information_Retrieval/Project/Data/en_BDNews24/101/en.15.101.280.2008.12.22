<TITLE> North Korea's Kim recovered and in public: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - US and South Korean intelligence believe North Korea's state media reports of Kim Jong-il's public appearances over the past week are likely true and he has recovered from a stroke, a local daily said on Monday. South Korean and US officials have said they believed Kim, 66, suffered a stroke in August, which raised questions of who was in control of Asia's only communist dynasty and making decisions about its nuclear arms program. South Korea's largest daily, the Chosun Ilbo, quoted a senior South Korean intelligence source as saying aerial reconnaissance shows Kim's personal train went to places Kim was said to have visited by his state's media. Other intelligence sources have told local media the train has been idle for months. "Based on this, and considering other information, I believe the possibility is quite high that Kim Jong-il did actually visit those places," the source told the paper. Another intelligence source told the paper Kim was likely discharged from a hospital in October. North Korea in the past week has reported on a daily basis about Kim's visits to places such as army units and a ceramics factory. The reports were undated, which is typical of how the North reports on the man it calls the "Dear Leader." There was a report that stood out last week because it had a well-defined time element. In one picture Kim stands behind people reading an online version of a state newspaper. In another picture where Kim is not seen, a computer monitor clearly shows the December 16 date of the newspaper. In the undated pictures the North has released of Kim's state visits over the past week, the enigmatic leader often wears a thick coat, gloves and a fur hat, even indoors. The North has not provided clear evidence of a recovered Kim by showing him at a large state function or with a visiting dignitary. State TV has only shown still images of Kim, sparking speculation in the South that the stroke may have affected his body movements
