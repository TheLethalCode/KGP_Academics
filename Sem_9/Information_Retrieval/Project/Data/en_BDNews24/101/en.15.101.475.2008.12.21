 DENVER, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Thirty-eight passengers were injured when a Boeing 737 airliner went off a runway and caught fire at Denver International Airport on Saturday night, Denver Aviation Manager Kim Day said. None of the injuries were life-threatening, but the injured passengers were taken to area hospitals, Day told reporters at a news conference. There were 112 passengers and crew members on the Boeing 737, Continental Airlines flight 1404, which was taking off en route to Houston, Day said. Denver assistant fire chief Steve Garrod said the plane "crashed, caught fire" and flames extended into the cabin. He said the right wing was cracked, as was the fuselage. The fire chief said he did not believe the plane had become fully airborne because if it had, "you would have seen a lot more damage." Denver's temperature was about 10 degrees, but "ice was not a factor," Garrod said. He said passengers apparently evacuated using emergency slides
