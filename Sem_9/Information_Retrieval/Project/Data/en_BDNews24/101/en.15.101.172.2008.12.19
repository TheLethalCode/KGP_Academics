<TITLE> Amnesty condemns new Indian terror law </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)Amnesty International has urged India's president to reject new anti-terror laws, saying they would violate international human rights standards if put into practice. "India's experience with previous anti-terrorism laws has shown that they can lead to abusive practices," said Amnesty, in response to India's swift introduction of the new legislation after last month's terror attacks in Mumbai. The organisation, in a statement released Friday, called upon Indian authorities and lawmakers to "urgently review" the two anti-terror bills passed by parliament the previous day. The bills provide for amendments to the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act that would double the maximum period of detention to 180 days, and an 'FBI-style' National Investigating Agency, meant exclusively to probe acts of terrorism in the country. "The President of India should reject [the] laws which would violate international human rights treaties," said the human rights watchdog. The legislation was proposed amid public anger over the attacks that killed over 170 people, exposing holes in India's security and intelligence network leading to the security minister's resignation. Experts say India's main political parties ignored concerns that the law could be misused. "While we utterly condemn the attacks and recognise that the Indian authorities have a right and duty to take effective measures to ensure the security of the population, security concerns should never be used to jeopardise people's human rights," said Madhu Malhotra, AI's Asia Pacific deputy director. The experience of other countries which have also rushed to pass sweeping anti-terror legislation in response to terrorist attacks has shown that such measures undermine the rule of law and respect for human rights internationally, and do not enhance security, said Amnesty. "India's authorities and legislators should show their respect for the rule of law, in the face of terrorist attacks, by reviewing provisions such as allowing a maximum of 180 instead of an earlier provision of 90 days detention of suspects," said Malhotra. AI's other concerns over the new amendments include: sweeping and overbroad definitions of "acts of terrorism", no clear and strict definition of what constitutes "membership" of a "terrorist gang or organisation", closed trials and the requirement, in certain circumstances, of accused people to prove their innocence.
