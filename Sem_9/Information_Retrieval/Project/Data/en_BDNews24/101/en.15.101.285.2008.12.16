 MILAN, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Inter Milan do not want to sign Chelsea striker Didier Drogba, the Serie A club's sporting director said on Monday. Inter coach and former Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho hinted on Sunday that misfiring Brazil striker Adriano may be allowed to leave the Italian champions, sparking speculation of a swap deal with Drogba. "There's no dream for Drogba. Inter already has a group of strikers covering the whole range of characteristics," Marco Branca was quoted as saying on Inter's web site (www.inter.it). "Drogba is a Chelsea player and for many years he has been doing very well in London. We have our strikers who are doing just as well." Media reports last month said Drogba, whose season has been disrupted by injury and suspension, had held a meeting with Branca in a London restaurant. Argentine forward Hernan Crespo has been little used by Inter this season and Branca said he may be able to leave. "We have realised that the number of injuries has been high in recent years. We need every player and we won't be putting any player on the market," he said. "We only will do if a player asks to leave, in which case we will try to satisfy him.
