<TITLE> Market sees outflow for 'election expenses' </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)The capital market has seen a fund outflow in the run-up to national polls, according to market insiders who say a handsome portion of candidates' election expenses are being financed by selling off holdings. Markets of the country have been witnessing a downtrend in recent months as share prices fell on selling pressure. Total turnover on the twin bourses also registered losses which resulted in indices dropping. Statistics show the the Dhaka Stock Exchange all share price or DSI index surpassed 3,200 points in June this year. It slumped to almost 2,600 points in August followed by a surge in September, to touch the 3,000 mark in October. It fell again, however, to hover around 2,500 points. The DSI saw a minute rise in the last two trading sessions of the previous week amid ups and downs. "A price fall in most of the scrips and a decrease in total transactions caused this downturn," according to DSE chief executive Salahuddin Ahmed. Total turnover on the DSE came down to Tk 5.35 billion last week from Tk 9.19 billion in the week before the Eid vacations. Meanwhile, electoral candidates are seen to have considerable holdings in the capital market, say market observers, in their own names as well as "using other named accounts". "A hefty portion of poll expenses are being funded from the capital market," an official of IDLC Securities preferring anonymity told bdnews24.com. "Quite a few of our high rollers who are running for the polls have sold-off their holdings to meet those expenses." Candidates are pulling out funds from the market rather than from banks as there are risks of from the latter of being caught violating election rules regarding the ceiling on poll expenses, he added. Experts also blame the global financial crisis for the capital market's fall, though operators have been saying that the Bangladesh market faces almost no risks with few links to international markets. "But it's not only about integration with the global market. The worldwide crisis created panic among our investors which caused them to pull out funds and refrain from investing," said market expert Abu Ahmed. The market is left now with some small scale retail investors as the larger ones are mostly busy with the polls, said Ahmed, a member of the Securities and Exchange Commission's advisory committee. "This has resulted in poor turnover and trading volume in recent days." bdn
