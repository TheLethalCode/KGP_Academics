 Chittagong, Dec 14 (bdnews24.com) - A re-tender will be invited at the start of the next year for Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane expansion project, the communications adviser said on Monday. "The process of re-tender has already started. Amendments on some points of the tender are underway but will be finished in a couple of days," Ghulam Quader told reporters after a meeting on development of the port city at the Secretariat. The first tender of Dhaka-Chittagong four-lane expansion project was invited in September, 2006. Some six foreign and 10 local companies participated there. The scrutiny (technical) committee sent recommendations to the ministry for seven local and three foreign companies, but the tender was cancelled after seven months without any specific reason. As many as 95 companies responded to the invitation of the tender for the second time for the construction of ten parts of the highway. Nine construction firms won the tender with the proposal of a total of Tk 1,751 crore, while the roads and highways department estimated the expense at Tk 1,795 crore. Responding to the government proposal the nine companies agreed to submit the collateral within seven days instead of 28 days. But the Roads and Highway Department raised question about the issue that went to the court. The chief adviser was eager to implement the project on a priority basis and directed the ministry to execute it. But the ministry failed to finalise the issue until the incumbent government is completing its two years. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Saturday promised to "restore" the Dhaka-Chittagong highway four-lane expansion project in the party's electoral manifesto. "Once re-elected, we'll gear up implementation of the long-awaited four-lane expansion of the Dhaka-Chittagong highway," she said. According to a data of Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, every year more than 500 people die in road accidents on this highway. Quader said: "Chittagong will be turned into a standard international city if a number of steps are taken. The government has already taken some initiatives in this regard." On whether it required demolition of any building for the modernisation of the city, 'no' came the reply from the adviser. bdnew
