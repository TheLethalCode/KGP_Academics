 LONDON, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United will not appeal against a four-game ban and fine imposed on France defender Patrice Evra for his part in a fracas at Chelsea in April. Evra was banned and fined 15,000 pounds ($22,850) by the FA on Dec. 5 after being found guilty of four charges of improper conduct for clashing with a Chelsea groundstaff member during a warm-down on the pitch following the April 26 Premier League match. The United defender denied the charges. The Old Trafford club said on Tuesday the FA decision was "flawed in many respects" but no appeal would be made. "We retain the view that the suspension is extremely harsh, but appealing it would only prolong the process as we enter the second half of the season, when the focus of the whole squad needs to be on matches and not bureaucracy," United said in a statement on their website (www.manutd.com). "Patrice accepts the suspension, but categorically denies hitting anyone. "To serve a ban which is longer than one imposed for a career-threatening tackle or throwing an object into the crowd indicates that the disciplinary commission made a very poor decision." Chelsea were also fined 25,000 pounds by the FA on Dec. 5 for failing to ensure their groundstaff member conducted himself in an orderly fashion
