 Barisal, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Bikalpadhara candidates of seven Barisal constituencies have pulled out of the election race and resigned from their party posts on Wednesday, claiming the party failed to win public support at the grass-roots levels. "Central leaders told us that Bikalpadhara would join the Awami League-led alliance and a decision on the issue was promised by Dec 11," said Abdur Rashid Khan, the party's divisional coordinator and Barisal-2 candidate, at a press conference The seven disappointed candidates also called on party secretary general MA Mannan at his Dhaka residence where Mannan asked them to withdraw from the election race and also resign from party positions, if necessary. The six other candidates who resigned are Sayma Jalil (Barisal-2), Dr Abdur Rahman Khokan (Barguna-1), Shamsul Jalal Chowdhury (Pirojpur-1), Mohammad Abul Kashem Talukdar (Jhalakathi-1), Abu Azam Khan (Bhola-1) and Sirajul Islam (Bhola-4). They termed the secretary general's directives as "an evil design". Abdur Rashid Khan said party candidates in the rest of the country would also follow suit because of such plots. bdn
