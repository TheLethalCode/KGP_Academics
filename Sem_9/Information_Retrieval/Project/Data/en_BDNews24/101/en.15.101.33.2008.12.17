 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has ordered the Election Commission to accept the nominations of Jatiya Party presidium member Kazi Zafar Ahmed and BNP candidate for Barisal-1engineer Abdus Sobhan. "There is no obstacle now to Kazi Zafar participating in the polls," said Faisal H Khan, lawyer for the JP leader. The same observation was made by Barrister Belayet Hossain, advocate for Sobhan. The order was given by Appellate Division chamber judge Zainul Abedin on Wednesday. The chamber judge also fixed Thursday for a regular bench hearing of Awami League's Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir's appeal against the EC's cancellation of his nomination. The HC on Monday had summarily rejected the petitions of Alamgir, Kazi Zafar and Abdus Sobhan. The HC order said that Alamgir was sentenced for 10 years in a case filed by the Anticorruption Commission for concealment of wealth. His writ petition was not maintainable in view of the court. The HC bench passed a similar judgment in Kazi Zafar's case. He was also convicted in an illegal wealth case. b
