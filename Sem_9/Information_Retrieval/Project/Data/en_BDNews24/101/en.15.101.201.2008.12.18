<TEXT>
 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Thakurgaon, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has stressed measures for farmers and raising food production in a bid to bring down food prices. "We have to increase production to reduce food price. If the four-party alliance goes to power it will provide the farmers with state land for cultivation," Khaleda said at a public rally in Thakurgaon on Thursday. "The country's development was pushed back in the last two years. There was neither any investment nor any development in this period, resulting in increased unemployment," the former prime minister said. The BNP chairperson urged people to vote the four-party alliance for development. "We will make arrangement so that the farmers get fertiliser and seed easily. Subsidy in agriculture will also be increased," she said. Khaleda also pledged to launch special programmes for alleviating poverty in Monga-driven region. Effective measures would also be taken to stop land erosion by the Jamuna and Tista rivers, she said. The BNP chief also pledged providing gas to and creating employment in the northern region. The Jan 22, 2007 election was foiled through conspiracy, Khaleda alleged. "The BNP-led four-party alliance would have been reelected if the election was held. That's why the election was forestalled through conspiracy. Later an attempt was also made to split BNP." Speaking of the "torture on her family in the last two years", she said: "We had to go through torture as we love the country and want its development. My sons were sent to jail as they the government) failed to exile me abroad." "They fell sick from torture. They had to go abroad for medical treatment," Khaleda said about her two sons Tarique and Arafat Rahman. "The sheaf of paddy is the symbol of development. So we hope that you will vote to send us to the power for development," the former prime minister said. The BNP chairperson on Wednesday took her election campaign to the north. In her two-day trip she was scheduled to address at 28 public rallies in 13 districts to secure votes for candidates of the BNP-led four-party alliance. b
