<TITLE> UN's Afghan mission to expand, increase budget </TITLE>

 KABUL, Dec 18, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations mission in Afghanistan will soon have its budget doubled and staff numbers increased to more than 2,000 from 1,500, the UN's special envoy said on Wednesday. The extra money and staff reflects a growing international focus on Afghanistan where seven years after US and Afghan forces toppled the Taliban, the militants are gaining ground and violence has reached its worst levels since 2001. U.N. Special Envoy Kai Eide said following a UN meeting in New York on Tuesday, his budget would soon be doubled from $80 million a year. He called for more transparency among donor countries about how much direct aid they contribute to Afghanistan, saying they needed to take responsibility for their projects and not leave it to the UN. Afghanistan needed an "international coordination centre" with a representative from each major donor country, he said. As well as the full gamut of UN agencies, more than 100 non-governmental organisations are active in Afghanistan, often implementing projects funded by donor countries. Poor coordination between them has plagued development efforts. "There is not a lack of projects, but there is a lack of focus," Eide said. MILITARY AGREEMENT Eide said he wanted to see an agreement between Western military forces and the Afghan government, which is soon due for renewal, codify procedures for military searches of civilian homes so they are only conducted by the Afghan military. Eide said the renewed agreement should include "issues having to do with detention, with house searches, and also with regard to the use of air power" but the details of the renewal will be the responsibility of the Afghan government. NATO forces in October revised their procedures for launching air strikes and said all house searches would be led by Afghan troops unless there was a clear danger coming from the building. Faced with the growing insurgency, the United States is sending some 3,000 extra troops in January and is considering deploying up to 20,000 more troops in the next 12 to 18 months. Eide said he recognised a need for more troops in Afghanistan but said "any expanded military presence has to be accompanied by (that) change in behaviour that I have outlined." "There is a need for greater integration, better cooperation and better operational cohesion between the international forces and Afghan forces," Eide said. Air strikes that have killed civilians, insensitive house searches and wrongful detentions are the main factors fuelling Afghan resentment against the presence of some 65,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan
