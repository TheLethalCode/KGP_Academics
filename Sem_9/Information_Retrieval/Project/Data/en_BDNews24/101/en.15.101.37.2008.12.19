 ISLAMABAD, Thu Dec 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A Pakistani militant leader who is one of the men most wanted by India is not in the custody of Pakistani authorities and is at large, Pakistan's foreign minister said on Thursday. Maulana Masood Azhar is leader of the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group that for years has battled Indian security forces in its part of the divided Kashmir region. India blamed the group, along with another militant organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba, for a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament. A Pakistani intelligence official told Reuters this month that Azhar had been detained as part of a crackdown that Pakistani authorities launched after the militant attacks on the Indian city of Mumbai last month. India has blamed "elements" in Pakistan and the Lashkar-e-Taiba for the attack. But Pakistan's top diplomat in New Delhi was reported as saying Azhar was not being held in Pakistan. Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi sowed confusion when he told Pakistan's Dawn Television late on Wednesday that Azhar was in custody. However, Qureshi said on Thursday he had been mistaken when he had told Dawn Azhar was in custody. "That's not right. Other people have been detained but Mr Masood Azhar is at large. We have no knowledge of his whereabouts," Qureshi told Reuters. Tension has been simmering between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan since the Mumbai attacks, in which 179 people were killed, and India has imposed a "pause" on their nearly five-year-old peace proces
