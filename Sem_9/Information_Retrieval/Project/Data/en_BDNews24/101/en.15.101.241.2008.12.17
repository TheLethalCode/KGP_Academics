 MADRID, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - There may still be a chance for Raul, Spain's all-time leading scorer, to return to the national team, coach Vicente del Bosque said on Monday. The 31-year-old Real Madrid striker, who has scored 44 goals in 102 matches for Spain, was dropped by Del Bosque's predecessor Luis Aragones in late 2006 and missed out on Spain's European Championship triumph in Austria in July. "I am reluctant to put up a barrier to Raul and tell him that he will not return to the national team," Del Bosque told Spanish news agency EFE. "He will continue playing for Real Madrid and let's see if there is any chance to bring him back in or not," he said. Raul has been in decent form for the Spanish champions this season, scoring six goals in 15 Primera Liga matches and three in the Champions League, taking his competition tally to a record 64. He would be competing for a place up front for Spain with relative youngsters including Fernando Torres and David Villa, while del Bosque recently brought Athletic Bilbao striker Fernando Llorente into the squad for the first time
