<TITLE> Gaza quiet after ceasefire with Israel ended </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 GAZA, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Armed Islamist factions in Gaza put their men on alert on Friday after ending a 6-month truce with Israel and warned the Jewish state not to attack. But apart from the rhetoric, calm prevailed. Masked Palestinians conducted exercises in front of television cameras in the hours immediately after the Islamist Hamas group, which controls the coastal strip, unilaterally brought an end to the ceasefire. Egypt, which brokered the truce in June, said it had not been asked to intercede in a bid to repair it. But Russia later on Friday urged Hamas to reinstate the agreement. "We think it is necessary that Hamas review its earlier announced decision on ending the ceasefire," Foreign Ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said in a statement. Moscow viewed the move with "great concern" and warned that it could end in disastrous humanitarian consequences for Gaza inhabitants. Civilians on both sides seemed to shrug off the end of the ceasefire, which many in Gaza feel never delivered the expected easing of the Israeli blockade, and many in Israel feel never delivered the expected security from Palestinian attacks. The truce has in fact been eroded almost daily since early November by Israeli raids against Islamist militants and showers of largely ineffective rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. Israeli military sources reported a minor shooting incident in the morning when workers in the fields of a kibbutz farm near the Gaza border were fired on. No one was hurt and no fire returned. Two Islamist rockets exploded harmlessly in Israel. GAZA "GRAVEYARD" Masked Islamist gunmen made televised statements before Friday's Muslim prayer warning there would be bloodshed if Israel attacked. "Now we will be the fate of the enemy of God, the Jews. We will be the soldiers of our nation. We will not close an eye watching the borders and the enemy will find no way into our dear Gaza Strip," said an officer of Hamas armed wing Izz el-Deen al-Qassam. "If they come in here then Gaza will be their graveyard, a large graveyard for the invaders," he told gunmen in uniform as they drilled with AK-47 assault rifles in southern Gaza farmland near the Israel-fortified border. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has made it plain over the past week that he has no plans to order any large assault on Gaza, unless there is gross provocation, and would have preferred an extension of the ceasefire. Egypt said it had received no requests that it try to patch up the truce. A foreign ministry spokesman also defend the Egyptian policy of restricting the movement across the Rafah border point, Gaza's only outlet not under full Israeli control. "If we do open up and deal with the strip in a normal way, making Rafah the main crossing point for people and goods, that means the occupying power (Israel) can relinquish its responsibility and pass the burden on to Egypt," he said. Some of Gaza's 1.5 million Palestinian residents, who rely on supplies via illicit tunnels from Egypt as long as Israel keeps borders closed, feel the truce was a swindle. "With or without truce it is all the same. The truce was not too good, it is all the same," said Talal al-Assal. "The Jews did not open the crossings either. If it was not for the tunnels then we would have no buying or selling.." In the quiet southern Israel of Sderot, regularly in the firing line of Gaza rockets, people were watchful but hardly more alarmed than on any other day in the past month. "Of course we are worried, but there is nothing we can do. Life must go on," said Sderot resident Shimon Maman.
