<TEXT>
 WELLINGTON, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards took a career-best seven for 87 to help dismiss New Zealand for 371 on the third day of the second test in Napier on Sunday. New Zealand led the West Indies by 64 runs on first innings, thanks largely to a maiden test century from opener Tim McIntosh, but the margin would have been greater but for a wholehearted bowling performance from Edwards. When bad light stopped play 20 minutes before the scheduled close, West Indies had raced to 62 for two in their second innings with captain Chris Gayle on 36 and Xavier Marshall yet to score. McIntosh, playing in only his second test, batted for 456 minutes and faced 337 balls for his 136. He was well supported by Jesse Ryder, who hit a sparkling 57, and a typically combative 31 from Brendon McCullum. The touring side had been facing a big first-innings deficit with New Zealand cruising at 316 for four but they claimed three wickets for three runs to storm back into the match. The West Indies began the day well when Edwards had the dangerous Ross Taylor (4) caught behind with the second ball. That brought the aggressive Ryder to the crease and he raced to 50 from just 61 deliveries with seven fours. McIntosh and Ryder shared a rapid 100-run partnership without looking in any trouble until on 57 Ryder slashed at a ball outside off stump and got a faint edge to Keeper Dinesh Ramdin. McIntosh fell when a Jerome Taylor slower ball sneaked through his forward defence and clipped off stump. Taylor struck again in his next over to remove McCullum (31) and Daren Powell dismissed James Franklin for nought. Daniel Vettori and Kyle Mills added valuable runs, but New Zealand fell at least 100 runs short of what they would have expected. Gayle and Sewnarine Chattergoon came out blazing and wiped out most of the deficit before Chattergoon and Ramnaresh Sarwan fell in quick succession
