 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com) Awami League has made a written demand asking the government to be on highest alert over Sheikh Hasina's security following media reports on a threat to her life. "Yesterday, bdnews24.com, quoting Indian TV channel CNN-IBN, released a news which said that six suicidal militants belonging to Harkat-ul Jihad are active to kill Sheikh Hasina," H.T. Imam, co-chairman of the Awami League election steering committee, said on Sunday. "After the news came out, I informed the highest authorities last night about the matter," he told reporters at a press conference at the party's media centre. "Today, I asked all concerned, the chief adviser, home adviser, home secretary and IGP, to be on high alert about the security of our leader." Imam said, "Sheikh Hasina is not afraid and for this reason her election campaign will not be cut short." The Indian television network reported on Saturday that Indian intelligence agencies had warned the former prime minister that a six-member 'suicide team' of HuJI militants were out to kill her. H.T. Imam said, "It is not only an attempt to kill the leader. It is a threat to the total security of the country. It is the latest bid to create upheaval in the country in continuity with the murder of Bangabandhu." Hasina's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated along with members of his family by renegade army officers on August 15, 1975. Imam observed: "It has to be considered whether it is not only a threat to kill Sheikh Hasina but also a conspiracy to foil the election". He also mentioned that "terrorists" had earlier in the day attacked the car of Awami League candidate from Sirajganj Jannat Ara Henri in front of Sheikh Hasina's Sudha Sadan home in the capital. "One has to think whether it is a signal to foil the election." Imam also alleged to reporters that "a good number of four-party candidates have violated the election code of conduct." "BNP's Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad, the four-party candidate from Dhaka 12, violated the code of conduct by putting up coloured election posters on walls ", said Imam. Claiming to cite media reports, the AL leader said: "The Jamaat candidate in Rangpur -2 is trying to get votes generating fear through mentions of the Quran and the Hadith; at Naogaon -5 four-party candidate Abdul Latif is speaking ill of grand alliance candidate Abdul Jalil; in another constituency of Naogaon, the four -party candidate is making communal and provocative comments against grand alliance candidate Sadan Majumder." "These are violations of the code of conduct." Imam said complaints would be lodged on these issues with the Election Commission. Urging the commission to be take action, he said," The EC's process is slow-moving. These matters calls for different sort of step". bdnews
