 Sumon Mahmud bdnews24.com senior correspondent Munshiganj, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia urged voters in Munshiganj on Sunday to back the four-party alliance to save the country from catastrophe and end all conspiracy. "If you vote for the right party in the Dec 29 election it is possible to get over the current crises of the country," Khaleda told an election rally at Sree Nagar Stadium in Munshiganj. "Only the BNP led four-party alliance will be able to free the country from catastrophe." The BNP chief started for Barisal from her Dhaka Cantonment home at around 9:30am. She stopped at the stadium in Munshiganj en route to address supporters and canvass votes for BNP candidate Shah Moazzem who is running for Munshiganj-1. The two-time former prime minister also claimed: "One party conspired in the Jan 22, 2007, election knowing that it would not be able to win. That's why the election was not held. The conspiracy is still ongoing." She asked people to bring an end to that conspiracy by voting for the right representative. Citing BNP's sheaf of paddy symbol as the symbol of development, prosperity, democracy, independence and sovereignty, Khaleda said: "You have to vote for the sheaf of paddy to safeguard the country and people." "This time our slogan is 'save the country save the people'." "If we are elected in this election we will bring progress and development," she said. The BNP chairperson went on to address another rally at Louhojong Bazaar and sought votes for Munshiganj-2 candidate Mizanur Rahman Sinha. Khaleda pledged to complete the Padma Bridge and bring down the prices of commodities if voted to power. She is set to address a public rally at Bells Park in Barisal in the afternoon. On her way back to the capital she is scheduled to speak at rallies at Faridpur and Manikganj. b
