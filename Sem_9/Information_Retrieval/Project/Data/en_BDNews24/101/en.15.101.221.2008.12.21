<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Two lawyers, BNP's Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad and AL's Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh, who have represented Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina, respectively, face off among other candidates in Dhaka-12. The constituency's voters have listed pollution from the Hazaribagh tannery works, power disruption and wrecked roads as the main problems left long-unheeded by candidates they have elected to power in the past. Showing frustration, locals say the candidates of the mainstream political parties have no individual opinions outside the purview of their party decisions and "do no good for the locality". After re-demaracation of electoral seats this year, Hazaribagh has fallen into the Dhaka-12 constituency, which has as many as 260,859 voters and 105 polling centres. Akhter Hossain who lives near the Rayerbazar Dam has listed the tanneries on top of the problems of the area. "Tanneries here have destroyed the environment and the noxious vapours put health at stake," he said, adding that there was no solution in sight. "But it is the elected candidates who must address the issues of their constituencies," he said. Fruit vendor Shohrab Hossain, who has been living in the area for 20 years, told bdnews24.com: "The elected candidates don't keep the promises they make before elections and this practice is common at all levels of leadership  top to bottom." He complained that water and power problems have plagued Hazaribagh added to wrecked roads with potholes and ditches that pose severe hazards to the locals. Said one resident of Dhanmondi Road 8/A: "I've seen both the parties, and now I choose to vote for someone else, and if I don't find my choice, I'll cast a 'no' vote." "What we want is whoever is elected will ensure the basic civic rights," said another. Khandaker Mahbub Uddin Ahmad, fielded by the BNP-led four-party alliance was elected from the seat in 2001, while AL-led grand alliance candidate Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh is contesting for the first time. The two lawyers, bothe from Gopalganj, have been prominent in recent months, representing the two ex-PMs and VIP lawmakers in a raft of graft cases brought under the caretaker government's anticorruption drive. The two have launched vigorous campaigns to win voters' support in their chosen constituency. Mahbub told bdnews24.com: "The last government took initiatives to solve the tannery crisis which is a big issue in the area and our party if elected again will take quick measures to address it." He admitted that the power problem was a hard nut to crack. "But the lion's share of the issue can be resolved if our manifesto is implemented." Asked about the voters' complaints that candidates are not seen in the area after they are elected, the BNP candidate seemingly ducked the question. "MPs are supposed to stay in parliament, make and reform laws," he said. "If the parliament is healthy, the state will function well, and the government will be fine too." Taposh told bdnews24.com that he will play an effective role in the party, the government and parliament to reflect people's confidence entrusted on him. "Voters will be rewarded for electing me and there will be no compromise on that," he said. "The issues of this area remained unaddressed over the last seven years," Taposh said, adding he would take initiatives in this regard on the basis of the opinions of the "local elite." bdnews24.com/mrf
