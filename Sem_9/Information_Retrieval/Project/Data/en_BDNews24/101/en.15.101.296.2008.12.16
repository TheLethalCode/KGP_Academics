 LONDON, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney will not face disciplinary action over an alleged "stamping" in last week's Champions League match against AaB Aalborg, UEFA said on Monday. Rooney tangled with Kasper Risgard and his foot made contact with the Aalborg player's chest during the game at Old Trafford, which ended in a 2-2 draw. No action was taken by the referee but the England forward, who was sent off for stamping on Ricardo Carvalho during a World Cup quarter-final against Portugal in 2006, faced a potential suspension on the strength of video evidence. However, a UEFA spokesman told Reuters they would take no action after an investigation. Risgard said last week that Rooney had apologised to him and said he did not think the United man should be banned. Rooney is currently in Japan for the FIFA Club World Cup which United are competing in as European champions
