<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) - The BNP on Friday termed the Anticorruption Commission's claim of having found concealed wealth belonging to the chairperson's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco in Singapore as "biased and politically motivated". "A story was constructed against Coco at Thursday's ACC briefing," said BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan. He said the same had been done earlier against Coco's brother and Khaleda Zia's elder son Tarique Rahman. The Anticorruption Commission at its weekly briefing on Thursday said that Singapore authorities had frozen assets belonging to Coco, worth some Tk 11.5 crore. "The allegation against Coco is out of the question. Such an allegation just 10 days ahead of election has equipped BNP's political rivals with a weapon," Khan said at a press conference at the chairperson's Gulshan office in the city. "The commission seems to be more interested in hampering BNP rather than corruption," he added. He pointed out that the ACC had been established under the BNP government, and the party had included a promise to strengthen in its manifesto. "But its recent activities have proved that it is biased and inaccurate." "The commission had accused Khaleda Zia of possessing assets beyond known income sources, but later they found no proof of any such assets," Khan said. He commented that the way the commission disclosed the issue was also politically motivated. bdnew
