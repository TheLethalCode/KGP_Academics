 Natore, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  BNP's election symbol 'sheaf of paddy' stands for democracy, development and productivity, said BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia Friday at Natore. The former prime minister made the remark to seek vote at an election rally on Friday morning at Kanaikhali stadium of Natore. Calling upon the voters to vote for BNP-led four-party alliance candidate Sabina Yasmin Chhobi, Khaleda said, "In the past, you had voted for Chhobi's husband Ruhul Quddus Talukdar Dulu of this Natore-2 seat, who won the election and worked for you selflessly as a lawmaker." "Unfortunately, Dulu is not here today. But you have got Dulu's wife Chhobi running the polls. Please make her a winner so that she may continue to serve Natore and its people like it has always been." "When I had come here first, Natore had no proper roads. Because Dulu worked so hard for developing this area, I can see that everything is in much better shape today." "Please elect Chhobi your representative and she will ensure gas supply and all for you," said the former prime minister when the locals demanded gas supply. Khaleda then handed a sheaf of paddy to Kazi Golam Morshed, Natore-3 candidate of the alliance and asked people to vote for him. On behalf of BNP, she thanked the dew-drenched people who have been waiting under the cold dreary night sky to hear her out. From Kanaikhola, Khaleda started for Barhaigram at 6am. She was scheduled to set out for Dhaka next. On her two-day election tour of the northern districts, Khaleda left Dhaka on Wednesday. She addressed a number of public meetings at Bogra, Gaibandha, Rangpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, Dinajpur, Joipurhat and Rajshahi. Khaleda opened her election campaigning on Dec. 12 with visits to the shrines of Shah Jalal and Shah Paran in Sylhet. Then she went out to the south-western districts on a three-day tour. bdnews2
