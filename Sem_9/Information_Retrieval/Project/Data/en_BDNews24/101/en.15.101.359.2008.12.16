 Khagrachhari, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  Six members of two families, five of them children under 16, died when a fatal fire sparked by a suspected short circuit gutted several homes in Khagrachhari on Monday night. Khadiza Akhter Sonia (16), Sakina Akhter Tania (14) and Jannatul Ferdous Tuli (9), daughters of Joynal Abedin were among the dead. Saidul Islam (12), Salma Akhter (10) and Harisa Khatun, the children and wife of Joynal's brother Solaiman were also killed in the fire at a Roads and Highways residential colony at Dighinala Upazila. Brothers and neighbours Joynal and Solaiman are both employees of the Roads and Highways department. A traumatised Joynal told reporters Tuesday that his family were all sleeping when the devastating fire broke out. It spread to a nearby haystack and then two neighbouring houses, as residents failed to tame the flames, witnesses said. Employed as a night guard, Solaiman said the incident took place at 11pm when his son Saidul was burnt alive before his eyes. Fireman Rocky Chakma said an electrical short circuit could be the cause behind the fire as the colony's wiring was reported faulty for months. Khagrachari district council chairman in-charge Ruithi Karbari said the district council would give the victims' surviving family members Tk 10,000 each. A general diary has been registered with Dighinala police, OC Subhash Chandra Paul said. bdnews2
