<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  Sector commanders of the liberation war have called for a bill to be tabled in the maiden session of the next parliament to try war criminals. They also urged the nation on the Victory Day to "elect freedom fighters and shun the anti-liberation forces in the upcoming polls." "Good governance has to be established by trying the war criminals. Rule of law will not be established without their trial," said retired major general Amin Ahmed Chowdhury, Bir Bikram. Hundreds of freedom fighters gathered to mark Victory Day at the Osmani Udyan on Tuesday. Many of them were seen in tearful embraces with old friends at the emotional reunion organised by Dhaka City Corporation, which included artistes of Swadin Bangla Betar (Free Bangladesh Radio) joining in singing songs. "All freedom fighters must be united against war criminals in the election and vote pro-liberation forces to power to bring the war criminals to justice," said former army chief retired major general KM Shafiullah, Bir Uttam. "A bill to try the war criminals must be tabled in the first session of parliament." "The time has come for freedom fighters to join hands. We have remained divided for 37 years. We have no more time to waste," said sector commander retired major general CR Dutta. "Our demand before the new generation is that they bring to power the pro-liberation forces to prosecute the war criminals. Spread our message everywhere. War criminals cannot be elected, they have to be tried." Whichever party comes to power after the election, it has to give word that war criminals will be tried, said fellow sector commander retired colonel Abu Osman Chowdhury. "We asked the caretaker government to try the war criminals. But the government did not do it. The matter was not taken to the court or the United Nations. They could at least have done one thing: formed a probe committee for identification of the war criminals." Dhaka mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka said the city corporation had taken many initiatives to give concrete shape to the spirit of the liberation war. "Over sixty city roads have been named after liberation war heroes." Plans were also underway to give a new dimension to the Osmany Udyan by portraying different events of eleven sectors, he added. b
