The Probashi Kallyan Desk will help migrant workers to complete their embarkation and disembarkation cards, immigration and security formalities and hand out information on remittance and other issues. It will also provide assistance in customs clearance, information on local transport and privileged citizen benefits. The bureau of manpower employment and training under the ministry of expatriates' welfare and overseas employment will run the desk. 2025hoursThe International Organisation for Migration is providing technical support with the financial assistance of the UK's Department for International Development.
