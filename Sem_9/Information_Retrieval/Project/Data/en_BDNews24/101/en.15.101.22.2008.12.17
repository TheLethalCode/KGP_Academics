Compact Disc India Ltd., have also acquired the rights to develop games and merchandising around the triple World Cup winner, according to a notice filed with the Bombay Stock Exchange. "We'll be producing an animation film based on soccer with Pele as the central character," company chairman Suresh Kumar told Reuters. "However, it is too early to talk about the script or the storyline." Brazil's Prime Licensing, the company which holds the exclusive rights to the Pele brand, confirmed the deal. "We felt that an animation film would be the ideal way to reach a very important audience for us, teenagers and kids," the company's CEO Paulo Ferreira told Reuters by phone from Sao Paulo.
