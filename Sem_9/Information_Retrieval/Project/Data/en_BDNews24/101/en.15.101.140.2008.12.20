 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has pledged to build another bridge over the Buriganga river if the four-party alliance comes to power. "Everything, including gas, water, sewerage, bridge and roads, was developed during the BNP-led government," the former-PM claimed, at an election meeting in Kamrangirchar, on the outskirts of the capital, on Friday afternoon. "Some works were undone. If the BNP-led alliance candidate is elected again, all the planned tasks will be completed." The two-time premier introduced BNP leader Matiur Rahman Matin as the four-party alliance candidate of the constituency. Earlier, the former prime minister returned Dhaka at noon after ending an election tour of the northern region. bdnew
