 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  Chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed asked government officials on Sunday to make sure the general elections were free of partiality and to not give in to any pressure. At a views-exchange meeting with the government officials of Dhaka division, the interim government head warned them against any irregularity or neglect while they were on election duty. "You all must discharge your election duties absolutely fearlessly and impartially. "I want to tell you very clearly that there is no scope of showing any partiality, or exerting influence or acting under pressure on your part," said the CA at the meeting at the international conference centre attached to the chief adviser's secretariat. "No ill motivated irregularity, embezzlement or hush-hush business will be tolerated in carrying out election duties." Intimating that the Election Commission and the government will be constantly vigilant and closely monitoring all election-related activities, Fakhruddin said any defaulter will have to pay most dearly. He issued certain instructions on discharging election duties prior, during and after the polls to make the election free, fair and acceptable. "Dhaka, the capital city, is the life-centre of the country. You must take extra care to seal every nook and cranny here and ensure effective and total security." The chief adviser asked the police, Bangladesh Rifles and other law-enforcement agencies to foil entry of expatriate terrors and illegal arms and ammunition inside the country, especially through the borders of Mymensingh, Netrokona, Sherpur and Jamalpur districts neighbouring Dhaka. He issued strict orders to the officials to be constantly vigilant through the election period to guard against any misdeed attempted by any defunct militant outfit. Fakhruddin underscored the importance of taking special precautionary measures to watch the Garo foothills borderlands including Bhawal and Madhupur forests and similar difficult-to-access areas against any intrusions. About 200 officers including the Dhaka divisional commissioner, DMP commissioner, deputy commissioners and police superintendents of 17 districts and 121 UNOs were present. bdnews
