 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) - BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has alleged the media are not covering the four-party alliance's election campaign fully and fairly. At a rally in Keraniganj on the outskirts of the capital on Friday, she also repeated claims that "a conspiracy" surrounded the coming general election. "I've witnessed the mass upsurge during the rallies of BNP and Jamaat," said the former prime minster. "Seeing the huge crowds, a conspiracy is on to foil the election. And as part of that conspiracy, the media are not covering our rallies across the country," Khaleda claimed. "A group of journalists are with me, working effortlessly without food and sleep to cover our rallies, but they are not seeing the results of their hard work, as television channels are not broadcasting them properly," Khaleda claimed. "The state of emergency has been withdrawn, but these [television channels] are still being censored." The BNP chairperson warned the Election Commission not to engineer or hatch any plots regarding the election results. "The Election Commission could not prove itself accountable; people are still doubtful about their activities." If there is any engineering of election results, "no good will come of it", Khaleda said. The former prime minister urged the government to remain vigilant so that the election is free and fair. At the rally, Khaleda introduced BNP's Dhaka-3 candidate Gayeshwar Chandra Roy. Khaleda also promised to make Keraniganj a modern town if the four-party alliance is voted to power. Gayeshwar, Jamaat-e-Islami assistant secretary general Qader Mollah and other local and central BNP leaders addressed the rally. Khaleda had earlier addressed an election meeting in Kamrangirchar, on the opposite bank of the Buriganga from Keraniganj. She promised there to build another bridge over the river if voted to power. Khaleda returned to Dhaka around midday Friday after completing a hectic election tour of the northern districts. She addressed public meetings through the night on Thursday without retiring. Her last meeting was held at Natore at 6:40am. After a few hours break at Natore Circuit House, her motorcade left for Dhaka where she rested up before taking up her campaign again around the outskirts of the capital. She returned at around 11pm. The BNP chief is scheduled to visit Gazipur, Tangail and Mymensingh districts on Saturday. bdne
