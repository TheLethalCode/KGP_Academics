<TEXT>
 Gazipur, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia sought votes on Saturday to help people "end the agonies" of the last two years, since the takeover of the interim government. The two-time former prime minister is campaigning in Gazipur, Tangail and Mymensingh on Saturday after rounding off her three-day tour of the north on Friday. "People have suffered greatly over the last two years. I urge you all to vote for the sheaf of paddy, to bring an end to the agonies," the former prime minister said at an election rally on Saturday at Konabari College ground in Gazipur. "The people of the country no more want to see any conspiracy. They have rejected the anarchical politics of oars and sticks. "So your votes should be cast for the sheaf of paddy to elect the four-party alliance to office on Dec. 29 to protect sovereignty and development," the BNP chief said. Decrying the Awami League rule after independence, she said: "At that time there was no democracy in the country. All newspapers except four were banned." She highlighted BNP's election pledges to increase food production and create employment if the four-party alliance went to power. At the Konabari rally, Khaleda sought vote for BNP candidates Chowdhury Tanvir Ahmed Siddiqui for Gazipur-1, Hasanuddin Sarker for Gazipur-2 and Abdul Mannan for Gazipur 3. Her motorcade then headed for Tangail, where she canvassed for Ahmed Azam Khan, BNP candidate for Tangail-8, at a rally at Sakhipur. The former prime minister launched her capmaign on Dec. 12 after visiting the shrines of Shah Jalal in Sylhet. b
