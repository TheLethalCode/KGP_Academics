<TEXT>
 Tangail, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Sunday urged the people of Tangail to 'vote boat', promising to revive the area's dying handloom industry. She also called on voters to wrench the country from "looters' hands". "If voted to power, we'll take necessary steps to provide special loans for weavers to help revive the dying handloom industry. Tangail will be upgraded to a cultural hotbed," Hasina told a rally at Tangail Shaheed Smriti Uddyan. The former prime minister introduced the grand alliance candidate Jatiya Party's Abul Kashem to the people gathered, saying, "We from AL had first nominated Mamunur Rashid Mamun from this Tangail-5 seat." "Mamun's candidature was later withdrawn in the interests of the grand alliance," said the AL chief who heads the alliance. She called on all to "vote for boat and plough" and bring the grand alliance to victory. Referring to news reports on possible attacks on her life by militants, Hasina said, "Today's newspapers have published stories on threats to my life." An Indian television network reported on Saturday that the former prime minister had been warned by Indian intelligence agencies that militants were planning an attempt on her life. Newspapers printed the story on Sunday. Hasina told the Tangail rally: "I want to tell you straight that I don't bow down to anyone but God and I don't care much about my own life. I only care about a thriving and developing Bangladesh." Hasina had earlier addressed a meeting at Gulla Primary School in Bashail, which forms part of her daylong election campaign in the Gazipur-Tangail-Mymensigh region. As the Gulla meeting site was adjacent to the Dhaka-Tangail highway, a large number of bus passengers were also seen stopping their vehicles and listening to Hasina's election speech. She urged voters to rescue the country from "looters" "The news of BNP and Jamaat corruption has been publicised internationally. I don't have to tell people how they extorted huge bribes from foreign companies, laundered that money and deposited it with foreign banks," said the former prime minister. She also promised the locals: "Bashail will be upgraded to a municipality if we are voted to power, this area will have electricity and proper irrigation provisions. Any locality with a population of 5 to 6 thousand will have a health care centre." bdn
