 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Deposed BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuyian, running as an independent candidate, has said if elected he will work to make parliament more effective and to establish good governance. "Parliament must be most effective in a nation's life to promote democratic practices. We must shun negative trends and vengeful practices, and make politics beneficial to people," said Bhuiyan as he toured villages in Shibpur on Friday canvassing votes in his Narsingdi-3 constituency. "If you succeed in sending me to parliament, I'll work towards realising my election promises of promoting good governance and independent status of the judiciary, Public Service Commission and Election Commission." Seemingly popular with women voters, who greeted Bhuyian with slogans at his meetings, he also elaborated on his election vows to reduce prices of essentials, create employment opportunities and curb the costs of agricultural inputs. "This time, I've come to you seeking your support as an independent candidate who also has supporters in every political party." "I do not represent any particular party now. Instead, I prefer to represent all of you, the residents of Shibpur-Raipur with my election symbol, the 'duck'," said the former BNP leader who had been known as a 'reformist' in the party. "I've served you for the past 40 years. Fighting along with you during the liberation war, I helped keep Shibpur unoccupied by enemy troops," he said. "We all have to forget our differences and unite to work and build a thriving nation," said Bhuyian. bd
