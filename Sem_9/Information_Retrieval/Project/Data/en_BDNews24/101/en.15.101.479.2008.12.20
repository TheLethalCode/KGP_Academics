 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Saturday urged people to eliminate the "corrupt, terrorists and plunderers" in the next general election. "The people will have to choose for themselves who they vote for  the corrupt, terrorists and plunderers or humanitarians and those who will contribute to the country's development," Hasina said. Addressing a rally in Kamrangirchhar on the outskirts of the capital, she said her hopes were with the people to vote in favour of development. Hasina urged the caretaker government to remain vigilant so that the people can vote independently. "The BNP government had hiked prices during its tenure and there are allegations of embezzling money against their lawmakers," the AL chief said. If her party is voted to power, it would create job opportunities as well as reduce the prices of essentials, Hasina promised. Introducing AL's Dhaka-2 candidate Advocate Kamrul Islam, she asked people to vote for "our new candidate in this constituency, as the former lawmaker Hajji Selim could not run for false case against him." If voted to power, Hasina promised a new bridge over the Buriganga at Kholamura in Keraniganj, as had her rival BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia the previous day. She also resolved to tackle gas, housing and sewerage crises and take effective measures for flood control in the area. "I will undertake all the responsibilities of Keraniganj's development," Hasina added. AL candidate for Dhaka-7 constituency Mostafa Jalam Mohiuddin, Bangladesh Islami Oiya Jote chairman Mizbahur Rahman Chowdhury, among others, spoke the rally. Hasina went on to a rally in Motijheel in the capital. bdnews
