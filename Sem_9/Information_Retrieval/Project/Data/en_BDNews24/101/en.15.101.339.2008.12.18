 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) - Businessman Amin Ahmed Bhuiyan, named plaintiff in an extortion case against Tarique Rahman, son of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, has denied his "involvement" in filing the case. "My name was recorded in the case as plaintiff, but I had no involvement with it," Bhuiyan claimed on Wednesday speaking to reporters. He was made a "victim of dreadful circumstances" and "forced to file the case", the Metro Group chairman said. He, however, did not clarify further under what dreadful circumstances he filed the case. "I want to forget the dreadful memory," Bhuiyan told reporters tearfully. "I was a victim of circumstances just as Khaleda Zia was, when forced to sack Tarique from his party post and send him abroad," the businessman further alleged. Bhuiyan filed the Tk 1 crore extortion case against the then BNP senior joint secretary general, with Gulshan police on March 8, 2007. Referring to his involvement in BNP politics, he said, "He is my party's senior joint secretary general. Why should I sue Tarique Rahman? I have no hostility against him." Bhuyian said, "I'm not pressing the case any more." "So far I know, the case is stayed with the High Court. I believe it will be cancelled." bdnews24.com
