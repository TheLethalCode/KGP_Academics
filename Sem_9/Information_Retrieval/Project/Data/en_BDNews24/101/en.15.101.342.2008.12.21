 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has promised business-friendly and export-focused policies if people elected the four-party alliance in office. "Business have been destroyed in past couple of years, exports have slipped . We will make business-friendly laws to let small and medium businesses work independently," she said at a campaign rally at Suti BM High School ground at Gopalpur, Tangail. "Reducing import dependency, we will take initiatives to create export-oriented market," Khaleda promised. Khaleda sought vote for Ahmed Azam Khan, the four-party alliance candidate for Tangail-8 constituency. "Abdus Salam Pintu was supposed to be the candidate from this constituency but he has been detained after 'conspiracy'," Khaleda said. Pintu, a prime accused in the case over the August 21, 2004 grenade attack on Awami League rally, is now behind bars.
