 Barisal, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad on Friday lauded the army's role in the 1/11 changeover and vowed their actions would be awarded with the "highest state honour". "We respect the army's role on January 11, 2007, and we will not forget it. If the Awami League-led grand alliance is voted to power, we'll award it with the highest state honour," former military ruler Ershad said. "The country was saved due to their role," he said, while addressing an election rally at Bakerganj Government College ground in the district. AL presidium member Amir Hossain Amu, Barisal mayor Shawkat Hossain Hiron, JP presidium member Mojibur Rahman Juktibadi and other grand alliance leaders were present at the rally. Ershad sought votes for JP secretary general ABM Ruhul Amin Hawladar, who is running from Barisal-6 as a grand alliance candidate. He termed the BNP-led four-party alliance's tenure, which ruled from 2001-2006, as "misrule", saying: "The looting and corruption during the period is unprecedented around the world." "If the four-party alliance is voted to power again, the country will be ruined. To save the country and its people, the grand alliance must win in the general election." If the alliance wins, Ershad  like Hasina a day before  promised that people of all beliefs would live in peace. The JP chief brought his southwestern tour to a close with the rally in Bakerganj, having left Dhaka on Wednesday. bdnews
