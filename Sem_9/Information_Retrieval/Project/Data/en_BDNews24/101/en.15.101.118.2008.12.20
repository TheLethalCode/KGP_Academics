 KARACHI, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan will issue a coin bearing a portrait of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto to mark the first anniversary of her murder in a suicide attack. The State Bank of Pakistan will issue 300,000 of the commemorative 10 rupee (13 US cents) coins with Bhutto's image and the words "Daughter of the East, Benazir Bhutto (Shaheed)," inscribed in Urdu. Shaheed means martyr. Chief bank spokesman Syed Wasimuddin said on Friday the government had decided to issue the coins and they would be released on Dec. 27. Bhutto was assassinated in a suicide gun and bomb attack in Rawalpindi on Dec. 27 last year after speaking at a rally for a general election she had hoped to win. The government said a Pakistani Taliban commander was responsible for the attack. Her party went on to win the polls in February, helped by a wave of sympathy for her, and it heads a coalition government. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, became president in September after former army chief Pervez Musharraf stepped down under threat of impeachment
