 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) - The Election Commission is taking measures to allow some 20 more candidates to run in the general election, complying with High Court orders.

The EC had earlier 'finalised' a list of 1,538 candidates to 299 constituencies. "Returning officers have been asked to allocate symbols to those candidates coming with the court directives," said EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar Morshed.

They are Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir (Chandpur-1, boat), Habibur Rahman Mollah (Dhaka-5, boat), Abdus Sobhan (Barisal-1, sheaf of paddy), Monjur Kader (Sirajganj-5, sheaf of paddy), Siddiqur Rahman Manna (Bhola-3) and Selim Reza (Jessore-2).
