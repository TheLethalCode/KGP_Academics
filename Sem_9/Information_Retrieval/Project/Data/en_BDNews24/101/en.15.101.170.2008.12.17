 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) With an end to the state of emergency, Dhaka-based diplomats turned to the government on Wednesday to ensure "better security" ahead of the Dec 29 polls. Ambassadors and high commissioners of Australia, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland met foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain at his foreign ministry office and said they were facing problems in their movements because of electioneering in city. "They informed me that they could not move smoothly owing to election activities in the city, particularly in Gulshan area." "They requested the government to guarantee better security measures for them before, during and after the elections," Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com Wednesday. "They made it clear to me that they did not receive any threat from any quarters. This is a preventive measure," said Touhid. Dean of the diplomatic corps in Bangladesh, Swiss ambassador Dora Rapold led the delegation, with Australian high commissioner Douglas Foskett, Canadian high commissioner Robert McDougall and Swedish ambassador Britt F Hogstrom. The foreign secretary assured them that the ministry would instruct the law enforcers to make extra security arrangements for the diplomats, if necessary.
