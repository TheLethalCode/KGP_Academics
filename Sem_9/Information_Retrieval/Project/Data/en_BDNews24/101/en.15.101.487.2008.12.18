 Mustak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Bagerhat, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has pledged to build a secular Bangladesh for people of all religions. "Awami League believes in equal right of all people from all religions. If we come to power we will make arrangement so that the Hindus are not harassed," the former prime minister said at an election rally at Chitolmari Primary School ground in Bagerhat on Thursday. This was her first rally of her four-day trip to the southwestern region. The AL chief is running election from Bagerhat-1 constituency. The BNP-led four-party alliance government allegedly tortured the Hindus in the area immediately after coming to power in 2001. "We have to ensure that no such tragedy repeats itself in the future," Hasina said. "If Awami League comes to power it will double the allowances for old-age people, widows and freedom fighters," she said. "We will make arrangement for loan without collateral for the youth by expanding employment bank so that they do not have to remain unemployed after completing study." Hasina urged the people to vote boat, the polls symbol for AL. "Give us the scope to serve the country. We will bring the prices of essentials down to people's reach. Power generation will also be increased," she said. Hasina's niece, the daughter of younger Sheikh Rehana, Ajmin Siddiqui Ruponti and nephew, son of Sheikh Helal Sheikh Tonmoy also spoke at the rally. She headed for Mollar Hat after concluding the meeting. On her way to Chitolmari she visited the house of local Bangladesh Chhatra League leader Wali Chowdhury, who died in a road accident recently, to console the bereaved family. The AL chief was out at the hustings on Tuesday for Gopalganj and several other southwestern districts for three days. She is running election from two other constituencies, Gopalganj and Rangpur. bdnew
