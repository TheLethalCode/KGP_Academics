 LONDON, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Former English champions and European contenders Leeds United parted company with manager Gary McAllister on Sunday after the club lost their fifth successive match. Leeds, who now play in League One (third division), lost 3-1 at Milton Keynes Dons on Saturday and fell to ninth in the table. "The board took the decision following the recent poor run that has seen the club slip to ninth in League One," the club said in a statement on their website (www.leedsunited.com). "The decision was made to ensure that the new manager, when appointed, has the maximum number of games possible to move the club up the table." McAllister replaced Dennis Wise as manager in January and was a former player at the club who were champions of England in 1992 and reached the semi-finals of the Champions League in 2001. Saturday's defeat was their fourth successive loss in the league and they were also knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League Histon last month
