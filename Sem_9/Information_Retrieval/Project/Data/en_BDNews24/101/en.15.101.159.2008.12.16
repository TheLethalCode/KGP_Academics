<TEXT>
 KATHMANDU, Tue Dec 16,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's main opposition party said on Tuesday that Maoist former rebels had failed to return property they seized during a decade-long civil war, breaching a commitment made in a peace deal that ended the conflict. The Maoists forced thousands of people considered their enemies from their homes and seized their land and property during their insurgency that started in 1996. The rebels were brought into the political mainstream under the 2006 peace deal and emerged as the largest party in elections in April. Former rebel chief Prachanda, who became prime minister after the April vote for a special assembly, told parliament last month the former guerrillas would return the land and property or pay compensation to the owners by Dec. 15. But Bimalendra Nidhi, general secretary of the centrist opposition Nepali Congress party, said the Maoists were yet to fulfil their commitment. "They don't want to return the property," Nidhi told Reuters. "They encouraged grabbing the land during the conflict and are now finding it difficult to return." The Maoists say they did not seize land themselves but landless farmers and peasants had grabbed the land from owners. "It is a serious national problem and the government is trying to resolve it," senior Maoist leader Dinanath Sharma said. During the war, the Maoists promised revolutionary land reforms and to give land to farmers in one of the world's poorest countries, where more than 80 percent of its 27 million people live on farm income. More than 200 people have been protesting in Kathmandu in recent weeks, demanding the Maoists return their property. Protester Tej Kumari Budhathoki said she cannot go back to her home in Ramechhap district in east Nepal because her land, cows, buffaloes and goats were seized by the Maoists. "I am told they have distributed my property to others," said Budhathoki, 42, who lives in a rest house in Kathmandu. "I need security for myself and my property to go back." The United Nations says other commitments are yet to be honoured. These included the return of property to owners and of displaced people to their homes, the setting up of a panel to probe cases of disappearances as well as a peace and reconciliation commission. "These are all extremely important aspects of the (peace) process," Ian Martin, chief of the UN mission in Nepal, told independent Kantipur television recently
