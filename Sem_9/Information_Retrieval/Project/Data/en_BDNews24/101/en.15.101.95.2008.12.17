 PERTH, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)- Australia recovered from a dreadful start to finish the opening day of the first Test against South Africa on 341-9 at the Waca in Perth. The hosts began the three-Test series in shocking fashion when they were reduced to 15-3 in the first six overs. Makhaya Ntini struck twice in the third over dismissing Matthew Hayden and Ricky Ponting in consecutive balls. But a 149-run fourth wicket partnership between Simon Katich (83) and Michael Clarke (62) helped salvage the innings. Courtesy : BB
