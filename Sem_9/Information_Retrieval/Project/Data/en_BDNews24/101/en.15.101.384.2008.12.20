 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) Hundreds of vehicles were stranded on both sides of the Padma river as ferry operations at Mawa came to a halt Friday night owing to dense fog, says its manager. Ferry movement also ceased in the morning for same reason. "We have suspended ferry operations since around 8.30pm because of thick fog," Md Sirajul Haq, manager of Mawa ferry terminal, told bdnews24.com Friday night. "Hundreds of vehicles have been waiting at the both sides to cross the river." He could not predict when services would resume. "Ferry services will not resume until the fog lifts. Everything depends upon weather." Shekhor Chandra Roy, another officer at Mawa, told bdnews24.com that ferry operations ceased between 6.00am to 9.00am Friday owing to dense fog. He also said six ferries had been stranded on the river due to low visibility. Some 13 ferries in all ply across the river at Mawa. "Poor navigability is also hampering ferry movements. The ferries are taking more time than usual to cross, causing traffic pile-ups," said Roy. "The long-distance passenger boats are being delayed by at least by five hours," Syed Monower Hossain, secretary to Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority (BIWTA), told bdnews24.com Friday. "They are not allowed to move or operate under poor visibility conditions under the navigability act," he said. bdnews24
