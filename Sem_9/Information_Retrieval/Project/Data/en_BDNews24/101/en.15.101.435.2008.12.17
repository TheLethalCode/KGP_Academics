<TEXT>
 LYON, France, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Olympique Lyon's French international Sidney Govou apologised on Tuesday after being arrested and found five times over the French drink-driving limit. "I wish to apologise to my family, who must have been very disappointed, as well as to the club and to the fans, who have always been behind me," Govou told reporters at the club's training centre. "I realise I gave a bad image of the club with this offence and I really want to apologise for that," he added. The 29-year-old forward was arrested in Lyon while driving during the night after the Ligue 1 leaders 0-0 draw at home with Olympique Marseille in a top-of-the-table clash on Sunday. A test showed the striker had 2.6 grammes of alcohol per litre of blood, which is more than five times over the French legal limit of 0.5 grammes. The player, whose driving licence was immediately confiscated, was held until he sobered up then released on Monday morning and now faces a court hearing. Govou came to Lyon's training centre on Tuesday by taxi and left the same way. The club declined to comment
