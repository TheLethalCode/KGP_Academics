 LONDON, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The internet entrepreneur behind an online video game inviting users to throw footwear at US President George W. Bush sold the property on eBay in just four days, he told Reuters on Friday. Briton Alex Tew, who made internet history in 2006 when he made a million dollars selling pixels at a dollar each on milliondollarhomepage.com, set up sockandawe.com on Monday after an Iraqi journalist made headlines worldwide by pelting the visiting US President with his footwear. What Tew called a "stupid little flash game" started getting millions of hits, threatening to overload the servers for a new humour site Tew is building. "We've spent the last three days trying to keep the servers alive and we're meant to be working on our other main startup PopJam. So we whacked it on eBay," he said. "It's really cool. From Monday concept, Tuesday launch, Wednesday growth, we've had a Thursday exit -- so it's kind of a micro-Web start up if you like," said Tew, adding that the funds would go into his company. The buyer was a British-based internet media company and the price the site fetched on the online auction site 5,215 pounds ($7,818), he said. "It was just a bit of fun, a bit of an experiment," he said. "It's actually turned out to be a useful fundraising exercise for our start-up, which is good given the present economic circumstances.
