<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has again asked AL chief Sheikh Hasina to withdraw her candidates from seats where JP is running, "guaranteeing" a victory for the grand alliance. "I request Sheikh Hasina to withdraw AL candidates from seats where JP nominees are competing. I guarantee victory for the grand alliance," said the former president at an election rally in Bhaber Char in Munshiganj on Saturday. Mentioning that JP won 32 seats in the 1996 election, while he was in prison, Ershad added: "While in prison, I was approached not to support AL." "We still supported them, but after going to power, AL divided our party in two," he said. "In the last few days I have asked for votes for either boat (AL) or plough (JP), but here I am requesting votes only for the plough," Ershad said. The JP candidate for Munshiganj-3 is Mujibur Rahman and the AL candidate is Md Idris Ali. BNP standing committee member and former minister M Shamsul Islam is also contesting this seat. "If the four-party goes to power again then a reign of terror, extremism and militancy will be established," warned Ershad. "That is why we must ensure the victory of the grand alliance," he said. On his way to Munshiganj from his "President Park" residence in Baridhara, Ershad also addressed a rally at a Korail slum. "If the grand alliance goes to power then slum dwellers will be rehabilitated and houses will be constructed," promised the former president there. The slum lies within the Dhaka-17 constituency from which Ershad is running with his plough symbol under the 'grand alliance'. The four-party candidate for the seat is BNP leader ASM Hannan Shah. Ershad was scheduled to return to Dhaka after visiting Munshiganj and Narayanganj. bdne
