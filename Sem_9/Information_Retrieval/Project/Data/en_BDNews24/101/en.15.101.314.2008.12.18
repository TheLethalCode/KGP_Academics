<TITLE> Lyon under Savidan threat before winter break </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 PARIS, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Steve Savidan has been very quiet since earning his first cap for France last month but the Caen striker could well wake up when his side take on Olympique Lyon in Ligue 1 on Saturday. The former Valenciennes player, who four years ago was plying his trade in the third division, has not scored in his last four league games. Savidan, however, has not been through a five-game goals drought in over a year and the Caen fans are counting on him, despite his lean spell. "I have been a bit out of form lately," Savidan, who earned his first France cap last month in a 0-0 draw against Uruguay, told his club's website (www.smcaen.fr). "Since my first cap, things have been a bit more complicated." But the 30-year-old, who scored seven goals this season, warned: "It is a very important match, it's Lyon, they won the league in the last seven years. "It is a gala match and we will start it in a very positive, attacking mind." The Lyon match will also be an opportunity to shine before the winter break as Savidan is being targeted by Olympique Marseille, who are looking for a "killer" up front. PRESSURE ON There will be huge pressure on Lyon, who have a slender three-point lead over Marseille, Paris St Germain and Girondins Bordeaux. Defeat could result in Lyon slipping to fourth place should Marseille, Bordeaux and PSG win on Sunday. "We are still the leaders and we are three points ahead, there is no panic," said Lyon forward Anthony Mounier. Savidan, who scored his last league goal in a 1-1 draw at Nancy a month ago, made fun of Lyon's internal troubles, referring to Sidney Govou's arrest for drunk-driving last Sunday, where he was found to be five times over the legal limit. "If they all have 2.6 grammes (of alcohol per litre of blood), we have a good chance," he joked. Second-placed Marseille host Nancy, who have not won at the Stade Velodrome since 1985, while third-placed Bordeaux travel to Monaco, where they won 6-0 last season. Fourth-placed PSG host third-from-bottom Valenciennes. Stade Rennes, who are fourth one point behind Lyon's chasers, bring their 16-match unbeaten streak to neighbours Lorient on Saturday
