<TITLE> Watergate `Deep Throat' Mark Felt dies at 95: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 WASHINGTON, Fri Dec 19, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Mark Felt, an FBI official during the Watergate scandal who three decades later emerged as the "Deep Throat" source for news reports on President Richard Nixon's involvement, died at age 95, the New York Times said. Felt's death on Thursday was confirmed by his grandson, Rob Jones, the newspaper said on Friday. Felt lived in Santa Rosa, California. The political scandal in the early 1970s, after a break-in at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate residential and office complex in Washington, ultimately led to Nixon's resignation. For years, people speculated and argued about the identity of "Deep Throat," whose insider guidance was vital to coverage of Watergate by The Washington Post. In 2005, Felt revealed he was the source -- named after a popular pornographic movie of the time -- who had given vital information to Post reporter Bob Woodward about the Nixon White House's role in the Watergate affair
