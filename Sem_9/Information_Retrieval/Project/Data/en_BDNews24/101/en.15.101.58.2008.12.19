 Mustak Ahmed, bdnews24.com correspondent Narail, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) - On the last day of her election tour of the southwest, Awami League president Sheikh Hasina told Narail people on Friday they must vote for the AL and its allies to stave off corruption and militancy, and help build a prosperous and secular Bangladesh. Accompanied by younger sister Sheikh Rehana and niece Azmina Siddique Rupanti, the AL chief asked people to vote for the grand alliance candidate Workers Party general secretary Bimal Biswas running the polls from Narail-1 constituency. Hasina left Dhaka on Tuesday on her election tour of the southwest, starting with 'meeting the people' in her home district of Gopalganj. After addressing public meetings on Thursday in Bagerhat and Khulna districts, she returned to Tungipara in Gopalganj at night. The AL leader is scheduled to return to Dhaka on Friday after conducting polls campaign in Magura, Jessore and Faridpur. To the people of Narail, Hasina said, "The looters grabbed people's assets and transferred them to foreign lands. Now it's your turn to elect the right people to power and to do that, you must vote for 'boat' only and save the country." She called upon voters to vote for another AL candidate SK Abu Baker, a retired brigadier general, contesting the polls from Narail-2 seat. Assuring all of introducing free education and curbing commodities price spirals if voted to power, Hasina said, "I'm aware of the problems faced by the locals here, as I happened to be elected from this region at least twice before." "If Awami League goes to power this time, the onus will be on me to ensure the development of this region." The AL workers and supporters assembled for the meeting on time marching in small processions and braving the biting cold and foggy environment. bdnews24.
