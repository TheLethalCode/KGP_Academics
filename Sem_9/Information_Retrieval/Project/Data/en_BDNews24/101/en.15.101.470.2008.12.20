 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  Over 40,000 army personnel were deployed across the country on Saturday to assist the civil administration in the lead-up to the Dec. 29 general elections, the home ministry and Election Commission said. According to a decision of the home ministry, troops will be stationed as 'striking forces' alongside Bangladesh Rifles, coastguards, Rapid Action Battalion and armed police until Dec. 31. Troops had earlier 'returned to barracks' on Dec 17 as the state of emergency was lifted after almost two years. They began moving out again the very next day to be redeployed by Dec 20 to help maintain law and order over the election period. RAB and armed police forces will be deployed on Dec. 24. Every district will see one battalion, drawing on 650 to 750 members of the armed forces. The home ministry in an order recently detailed the role of the army to assist the law-enforcers in holding a fair and peaceful election. The armed forces will constantly coordinate with the returning officers, the order said. They will swing into action as soon as the returning or presiding officer seeks assistance. They will also help the police and ansars in securing the polling stations. Each battalion of the striking force will be directed by an executive magistrate, who will act in line with the Representation of the People Order, regulations of code of conduct for political parties and candidates and Criminal Procedures Act. The regular command and control system of the armed forces will also be maintained. The troops will be ready at one or more strategic point outside Upazila Sadar so that the presiding officers can immediately contact them just in case. bdnews
