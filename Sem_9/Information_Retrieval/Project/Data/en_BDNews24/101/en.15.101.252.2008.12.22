 FROM OUR BLOG Comment on this piece or post your own at blog.bdnews24.com Mahmud ur Rahman Choudhury On 16 December 2008, the President repealed the state of emergency that he had imposed on January 11 2007. There is little doubt that the two-year emergency will be debated in the political and legal arenas of Bangladesh for a very long time to come but even as the emergency is withdrawn, it leaves behind certain problems, which would have to be tackled by the state and the next government. The first of these problems stems from certain clauses contained in the repeal ordinance that validate the on-going anticorruption cases up to the time of the lifting of the emergency, thereafter leaving the cases to be dealt with under the laws of the land. This puts the entire legal and judicial process in a quandary because nobody is sure about which cases, up to which stage, fall under the Emergency Power Rules and which ones at what stage will be pursued further under the normal "laws of the land". Legal experts have opined that such complications have been created by ministry of law which had not been careful enough in drafting the Emergency Repeal Ordinance; some would go as far as to claim that the ministry of law had intentionally "built-in" these clauses in order to complicate the procedures for adjudicating pending cases initiated under EPRs. The secnd of these problems is that the repeal ordinance provides indemnity from prosecutions to persons who acted under the emergency or implemented it "in good faith". The problem is that, it is near impossible to justify "faith" good or otherwise and the actions stemming from that faith. One could, theoretically, start the argument about "good faith" by questioning the President's decision of imposing the emergency in the first place. Where is the "good" in the faith of a President who abrogates the fundamental rights and freedoms of an entire nation for two years because of a riotous situation temporarily prevailing in the political space of Bangladesh? One could go on with a lengthy list of such questions. The next Parliament is just a few days away from being voted in and its first task would be to have a deep look into the two-year emergency. The point is that nobody and nothing can or ought to be provided blanket indemnity on the basis of such nebulous concepts as "good faith". We are all still trying to live down the ill-effects of one such indemnity ordinance of 1975 which let free the murderers of Bangabandhu, almost his entire family and four national leaders. Those who imposed the emergency and implemented it, which includes the incumbent President, the Chief Advisor and his council of advisors, generals Moeen.U.Ahmed, Masud Uddin Chowdhury and ATM Amin, must be made to explain on what "good faith" they had imposed the emergency and robbed us of our rights, liberties and freedoms for a full two years and thereby made us poorer materially, morally and culturally, that is economically, politically and socially. As a matter of fact, one could suggest a parliamentary investigative committee followed by a judicial committee to intrusively and intensively look at the emergency from the first day it was imposed to the last day it was withdrawn before indemnifying anything or anyone. If the 9th Parliament fails to do this task of investigating the emergency before ratifying it, it would in effect be allowing a "formula" and an example which others might emulate at the slightest excuse thereby not only damming and damning our progress towards democracy but also jeopardising our existence and viability as a nation-state.
