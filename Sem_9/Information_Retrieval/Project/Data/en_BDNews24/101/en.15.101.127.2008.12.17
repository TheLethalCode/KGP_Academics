<TEXT>
 Gopalganj Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina has asked people to vote 'boat', the polls logo of Awami League, and give the party an opportunity to build a modern Bangladesh. She made the call from a public meeting in her electoral area of Kotalipara in Gopalganj on Wednesday. Hasina left Dhaka Tuesday for hustings in the southwest. On Thursday she is scheduled to go to Bagerhat and Khulna on a public relations campaign. Hasina is accompanied by her sister, Sheikh Rehana and niece Azmina Siddique Rupanti. "We want to build a modern Bangladesh by 2021 and if we go to power then we will create a scientific and digital Bangladesh," she added. "Our Bangladesh will be free of illiteracy, it will be self reliant and enjoy food autarky." The 'boat' brought Bangladesh independence and it will also give the nation economic emancipation, asserted the AL chief. Hasina also promised that every Upazila Parishad would have a women's college. "We will ensure that fertiliser is sold in the open market and farmers get seeds without any difficulty." She pledged that her party would not allow a few people to have the monopoly on business. "During the Awami League rule between 1996 and 2001, the price of essentials was within the grasp of the people but a conspiracy prevented us from going back to power in 2001." At the rally, Sheikh Fazlul Karim, AL presidium member, Sheikh Abdullah, religious secretary, Kazi Akramuddin Ahmed, member of the advisory council, among others, spoke. After the rally, Hasina came back to Tungipara and it has been learnt that she will participate in video conferencing with leaders of several districts at night. Before the rally at Kotalipara, Hasina exchanged views with local leaders in Tungipara. She promised establishment of women's college, doubling of old age and widows benefits, and free medical treatment. Hasina called for a concerted approach to the upcoming election by the 'grand alliance'. Like previous occasions, Hasina is running from Gopalganj-3 and two other seats in Rangpur and Bagerhat. Hasina drove to the southwest region for campaigning just a day after the visit of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia. HM Ershad, an ally of the grand alliance, is also carrying out electioneering in the region. bdnews2
