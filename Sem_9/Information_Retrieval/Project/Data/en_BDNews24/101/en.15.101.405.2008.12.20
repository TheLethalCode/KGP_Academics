<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has not yet started printing ballot papers for 50 'disputed' constituencies as the final candidates for those seats remained unresolved due to High Court petitions, an election official said on Saturday. He also said the media report that some 25 to 30 lakh ballots papers may have to be destroyed is not right. "We have not printed ballot papers for the disputed constituencies yet, excepting Barisal-1, which will have to be dumped now," joint secretary at the EC Secretariat Rafiqul Islam told reporters. The EC has given print orders for 250 seats up to Saturday, he said. He added that candidates for 18 constituencies had approached the EC so far with court orders on validation of their nominations. A good number of candidates are back in the race through High Court rulings after appealing against cancellation of their nominations by the EC. "The media report that the commission has destroyed some 25 to 30 lakh ballots papers is not right," Islam said. "We will be printing ballot papers up to Dec. 26 for constituencies where candidates are securing court orders," he said. "We can destroy the previous ballot papers up to one day ahead of the elections, if necessary." "It takes just one and a half hours to print ballot papers for one constituency. There is no problem with starting printing after a candidate comes to the us with a court order," he explained. But there is no scope to disobey the court order, Islam added. "When the candidates first started coming to the commission with court orders we halted the printing of other disputed constituencies," he added. Printing of ballot papers for the general and Upazila Parishad elections has been going on full swing at three government presses since Dec 14. A total of 8,10,58,698 ballot papers and 3,00,000 postal ballot papers for the parliamentary elections and over 21 crore ballot papers will be printed for Upazila elections, the EC has said. Each ballot paper will contain election logos with the names of candidates for each constituency. There will be another symbol, a 'cross', allowing voters to vote 'NO'  a first in the country. The EC had expected printing to be complete by December 23, but chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has said candidates will be validated in line with High Court orders up to Dec 28, the day before the general election. "We have the manpower and they will work round the clock till the day before polls. If the HC rules it, then we will carry out any amendment in the ballot paper up to the last moment," said the CEC. bd
