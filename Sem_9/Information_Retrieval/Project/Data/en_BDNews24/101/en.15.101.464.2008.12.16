 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  The state of emergency was officially lifted from midnight Tuesday, after almost two years of restrictions on civil and political rights. The interim cabinet approved the Emergency Powers Repeal Ordinance-2008 on Sunday, and under it the lifting of emergency rule imposed since Jan 11, 2007. The president gave his nod to its full withdrawal under powers of Article 141 a (1) of the constitution, said a gazette issued by the presidential office Tuesday. Emergency rule was declared on '1/11' under the formation of the caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. Since then, the interim government withdrew emergency measures, imposed under the Emergency Powers Ordinance, in gradual steps. On Dec 10, its long-awaited announcement of a full lift of emergency from Dec 17 onwards, ahead of the general election, was welcomed by political parties and the international community who saw it as a bar to a free and fair vote. The government lifted the ban on political rallies and meetings on Dec 12, to facilitate electioneering ahead of the parliamentary polls slated for Dec 29. The army will be deployed across the country from Dec 20 ahead of the election in line with an Election Commission directive. bdne
