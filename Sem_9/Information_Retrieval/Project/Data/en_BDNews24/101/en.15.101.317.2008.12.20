 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com) - Chief adviser Fakruddin Ahmed gave strong warnings to local authorities in Barisal on Saturday against any bias, manipulation or negligence during the general election. "The current caretaker government stands firm in holding a free, fair, impartial and peaceful Jatiya Sangsad election slated for Dec 29," said the chief adviser at a meeting in Barisal Circuit House. He told local officials tasked with election duties that bias, bids for somebody's illegal win, sluggishness or negligence must not be tolerated in the parliamentary polls. Fakhruddin urged them all to carry out their duties "intrepidly, rising above all fears, greed, duress, influence". "You must do what is essential in line with the law for giving the nation an election free from graft, black money, terrorism and muscle power," said the former Bangladesh Bank governor. He called upon them to ensure a free and fearless atmosphere for voters on election day. The CA also instructed law enforcers to stand vigil in the run-up to polls so that no untoward incident takes place to hamper the election. He instructed law enforcers to continue with crime drives to prevent troublemakers to take any advantage to hamper the election. bdnews24
