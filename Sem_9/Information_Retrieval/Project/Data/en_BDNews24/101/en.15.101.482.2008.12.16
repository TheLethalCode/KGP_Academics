 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com) - Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed on Tuesday said the army had come forward "in aid of civil power" on Dec 6, 2006 and had no intention of imposing martial law. "The government has asked us to return, and we will be happy to be back in barracks," the army chief said in a TV broadcast Tuesday. The state of emergency will be withdrawn from Tuesday midnight, after almost two years of restrictions on civilian rights and political activity. "Many, especially foreign diplomats, came to me and asked whether I was going to enforce martial law, but I replied in the negative," Moeen said, explaining the uncertain situation in the country after full emergency was imposed on Jan 11, 2007. "I told them the Bangladesh Army will not follow its neighbours or its predecessors." "There is a problem and it will be resolved politically. The caretaker has appointed us and we've discharged the government directives. So we didn't step in," General Moeen said. Looking back at two years as army chief under a state of emergency, General Moeen drew attention to the army's achievements in preventing terrorism and reinstating law and order. Alongside these, the army in cooperation with the Election Commission helped enrol some 8 crore voters in a "historical achievement", said the army chief. Moeen also highlighted the army's role in fighting and overcoming the aftermath of two devastating floods and Cyclone Sidr in 2007. He said after the second flood, coming just 15 days after the first one, they saw farmers dispirited and demoralised. "We supported them, distributed relief and helped them to return to the fields. And they went on to harvest golden grains." The army was hand in hand with the people of Bangladesh in providing food, water, relief and medical aid to the cyclone victims, Moeen said. The army chief said of the national voter roll with photographs and ID project: "This is a great achievement for Bangladesh, taking the country one step forward and benefiting the people." The army also improved the management of Chittagong port relieving the container jam here and reducing transportation costs, the army chief said. "And very recently we've automated the custom house, smoothing the clearance system." "I believe the people of the country will consider our contributions in appropriate time and will praise us." The emergency was declared on Jan 11, 2007, and enforced by the army, under the caretaker government headed by Fakhruddin Ahmed. The interim cabinet approved the Emergency Powers Repeal Ordinance-2008 on Sunday, and under it the lifting of the state of emergency imposed since '1/11'. bdn
