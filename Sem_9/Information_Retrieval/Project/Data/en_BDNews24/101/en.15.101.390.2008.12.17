 COMMENT Towheed Feroze Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) - The feeling of shock still persists and the finger pointing at possible sources of the attacks in Mumbai continue, but within all this, the use of technology in planning the mayhem remains unaddressed. As the initial feeling of total bewilderment passes, the pieces start to fall into place and in that picture we find evidence of much negligence. India today remains on high alert, with airports until just a few days ago under a total security blanket, but after the sorrow and anguish, one cannot but blame the fragile anti-terrorist infrastructure in India that permitted such a large scale disaster. One of the lessons learnt as militants walked on the streets Mumbai, undeterred by a police force with outdated weapons, is that a full blown well-equipped anti-terror force is required in India, and no less in neighbouring countries like Bangladesh. Reportedly, the terrorists had studied satellite images of the city ahead of time and were communicating during the attack via hand held GPS sets. And, if we remember some of the scenes just after the famous waterfront hotel was captured by terrorists, we find that as the militants were holding hostages in the face of AK-47, law enforcers were running about hauling their overweight, obsolete .303 rifles of WW2 vintage. Even at the rail station the casualties could have been minimised if the law enforcers stationed there had been better equipped. As the BBC went to the station in a bid reconstruct the whole event, law enforcers who managed to take a few shots at the heavily armed terrorists said unambiguously that if they had modern weapons then they could have prevented the terrorists from walking about with blatant disregard for any kind of intervention from the police. The terrorists literally walked, fired, stopped to chat and then went about shooting recklessly. They were taken down eventually but, for that, the army had to be called in and the absence of a special anti-terror force became all too clear. Understandably, by the time the authority absorbed the shock and decided to get up from their torpor and act, the whole plan was perfectly executed by the terrorists  the operations of terror were finished in the Leopold Cafe and in the rail station, the hotels were in control, hostages were kept at gun point and a inconspicuous city quarter housing people from the Jewish community was under control. The first thing this tells us is that Mumbai was not even ready for any kind of terrorist possibility though we are now informed that the Indian authority had been warned earlier. Be that as it may, after the attack the fact that stares us at the face is that terrorists are often far more tech savvy than law enforcers and the authorities. And, that seems like a very logical thing because if a handful of men want to create a mass upheaval then they have to rely on technology. Interestingly, a few days ago, the head of British MI5, Dame Manningham said that the militant threat will continue to rise because terrorists have already gone beyond the stage of attacking with indigenously made explosives to where they are able to use high tech equipment and even biological agents. The bottom line is that, as days go by, terrorists are discarding crude methods adopted in moments of uncontrollable frenzy. They are now planning the attacks from every angle, and if the Mumbai attack is any indicator, then they are doing that pretty well. If we take the event in Mumbai to be a warning, then here in Bangladesh, we also need to be exceedingly cautious - if we go back three years, we remember a nationwide bomb blast by militants that was aimed as a warning. At that time, the bombs were small and ineffective but they did what they were supposed to do  send a chilling message. Of course, Bangladesh is still a very secular state with very few pockets of extremism and despite the efforts of certain quarters to portray it as a centre of militancy, the fact is that the majority of the people, whatever their political orientation, do not endorse the adoption of destruction as a mode of change or, to send across an ideology. But, we need to be careful. Our law enforcers are similar to their Indian counterparts in training and equipment and, if there is an extremist attack somewhere in Bangladesh then chances are high that the response from law and the authority will take some time to take any concrete shape. It's indeed sad that our neighbour is now gearing up a strong anti-terror structure after the death of so many, but this should work as a warning for us. Both the political parties spoke of modernising our law enforcers but what Bangladesh needs is a fully trained anti-terror squad with the sole purpose of defusing any threat from possible sources of extremism. We, as Muslims do not believe radicals have any religion and they definitely do not represent Islamic ideology, but it's unfortunate that all those who are perpetrating acts of terror have Muslim names and were brought up as 'Muslims'. Hence, if perceptions in the West relate Islam with terrorism, the urgent task for any Muslim country is to stand up to potential acts of militancy. Just after the Mumbai attacks, security in the diplomatic zone in Bangladesh was heightened though one often fails to see any logic in stopping only CNG's and taxis to carry out searches. What if terrorists dressed as garment workers walk into the area carrying explosives in tiffin carriers? Or at the other end of the scale, someone dressed like a businessmen or diplomat carrying sophisticated terror equipment in a briefcase? We are not saying that every person has to be searched, but a good way to reduce the risk would be to install security cameras, and not just rich residential areas, facilitating investigation of suspicious movement of groups or individuals. We talk of anti-terrorism measures, parties have made election pledges to do so, but ideas are still on paper or locked in the boardroom. Hopefully measures will be taken before it takes a atrgedy to jolt us to action. After all, for us and our actions, the aphorism "chor palale buddhi bare" (wisdom increases after the robber has fled) is often very true. The views expressed are the author's ow
