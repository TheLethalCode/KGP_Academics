 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  The Met office on Friday forecast at least another 24 hours of heavy fog that may be followed by further temperature falls and possible rains countrywide. "The fog is lasting as the temperature is low and the atmosphere is holding extra humidity." Abdul Mannan, on-duty meteorologist, told bdnews24.com. He said the cold was being felt as the sky being overcast, and wind speeds being low meant the fog was not dispersing. The weatherman predicted that a colder wave may blow over northern and central regions later this month, shortly after the fog lifts. Dense fog covered northern, western and central regions, settling heavier in the river basins, with the sun barely seen in these areas through the day on Friday. Moderate to dense fog prevailed across eastern and southern regions. According to the meteorological department, temperatures of 28.5 and 13.5 degrees Celsius were recorded as the highest and lowest respectively in Sylhet and Srimongal on Friday. The capital recorded 19.4 and 16.2 as highest and lowest temperatures. bd
