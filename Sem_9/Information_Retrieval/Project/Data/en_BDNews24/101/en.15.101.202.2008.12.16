 NEW DELHI, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The International Cricket Council (ICC) has praised England for resuming their tour of India following a memorable finish to the first test in Chennai. India achieved the fourth highest successful run chase in tests, Sachin Tendulkar making his 41st test century to help the hosts reach a target of 387 in the final session on Monday. England returned home after calling off the last two games of the one-day series against India following the militant attacks in Mumbai which killed 179 people. "Although India takes the plaudits for winning the match, thanks and congratulations are also due to Kevin Pietersen and his team who played so well while under enormous pressure from forces over which they could exert no control," ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. "I have been in touch with both the BCCI and ECB since the end of the match to thank them for what was a great advertisement for cricket. "This may be a lesson for the future too," he said. "We must always try to look at the bigger picture when external events intervene as in this case. "Provided it is safe to do so, the show must always go on," he said. "We must stand together and rise above these forces that threaten our game and our way of life. "Sport has the ability to make a difference in our society and over the past few days these two cricket teams have fought back and demonstrated great unity in a world rocked by conflict and division. "I have no doubt the England players will be very disappointed after this match but they have a huge amount of which to be proud." Pakistan have not played a test in 2008 with teams refusing to visit the country because of security concerns. ICC president David Morgan is planning to travel to the second test starting in Mohali on Friday to show solidarity with the teams
