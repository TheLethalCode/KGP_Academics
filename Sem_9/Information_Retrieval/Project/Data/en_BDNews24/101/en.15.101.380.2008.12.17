<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The condition of ETV special correspondent Rashed Ahmed was critical as he was wheeled into the operating theatre of Bogra Ziaur Rahman Hospital, doctors said on Wednesday. Rashed, ETV cameraman Asaduzzaman Asad and driver Rabiul Islam were injured when their microbus collided with a bus earlier in the day as they were covering the election campaign of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in the north. Doctors said surgery began at 3:25pm in the afternoon. Ashfarul Habib Rushd, deputy director of the hospital said a bone in Rashed's face had splintered but there was no sign of brain haemorrhage. ETV cameraman Asaduzzaman and driver Rabiul Islam are out of danger, he said. Khaleda Zia paid a visit to the wounded journalists in the afternoon and prayed for their fast recovery. The accident took place near Bhuiyangati in Raiganj Upazila, Sirajganj, around 1pm when the ETV microbus had a head on collision with a passenger bus, of the Salma Classic Paribahan, on the Dhaka-Joypurhat-Hili highway. The bus fell into a roadside ditch, but no reports of injuries were immediately available. The three injured ETV men were initially rushed to Chandaikona Hospital and later transferred to Bogra. "Rashed Ahmed's condition does not seem good. Nothing can be said about him until he is taken into the operation theatre. All we can say now is that his condition is not good," deputy-director Asfarul Habib Rushd had told reporters at the time. bdnews24.com/correspo
