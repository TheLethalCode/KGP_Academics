<TEXT>
 BUENOS AIRES, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Palestino held out for a 1-1 draw against Colo Colo in the first leg of the Chilean championship final on Sunday despite playing nearly the entire second half with nine men. Deportivo San Martin won the Peruvian championship for the second year running while Atletico Nacional's match at home to La Equidad in Colombia was interrupted for seven minutes when their fans protested against the team's poor finish to the season. CHILE Palestino had two players sent off but still managed to snatch a late equaliser to hold Colo Colo in the first leg of the Clausura championship final. Argentine forward Lucas Barrios put Colo Colo ahead with a 28th minute penalty, his 36th goal of the season, after being fouled by Palestino goalkeeper Felipe Nunez, who was sent off. The home side were in further trouble when Palestine international defender Roberto Bishara was dismissed five minutes into the second half for a second bookable offence. Colo Colo twice hit the post before Francisco Ibanez equalised with a breakaway goal in the 80th minute. Palestino, founded by Chile's Palestinian community, last won the title in 1978. COLOMBIA Atletico Nacional signed off with 4-1 home defeat against La Equidad in a meeting of two eliminated teams, a result which brought furious protests from the 8,000 crowd. Several fans forced their way onto the running track at the Atanasio Girardot stadium after the visitors' fourth goal, prompting the referee to stop the game. For the rest of the match, Atletico fans on the terraces insulted and jeered the team. Colombian media said that at the end of the game, riot police used tear gas to control angry fans outside and the team were given an escort out of the stadium. Sunday's matches were all academic as Independiente Medellin and America had already made sure of finishing top of the respective semi-final groups and will meet in the two-leg final. PERU Deportivo San Martin won the championship for the second year running, handed the title after Universitario lost the right to face them in the final. Universitario had won the first stage of the championship earlier this year and were due to face San Martin, who wrapped up the second stage 10 days ago. But, under the tournament's rules, Universitario also needed to finish in the top seven of the second stage to qualify for the final. Curiously, Universitario began the weekend in 10th place, three points behind Jose Galvez, who were in seventh. Galvez's opponents were San Martin, who simply needed to avoid losing their game to win the title. In the event, San Martin drew 2-2 but the result was academic as Universitario also drew 2-2 against Melgar. San Martin went ahead in the 18th minute when Jose Galvez defender Jersson Vasquez lobbed the ball past his own keeper. Carlos Ibarra levelled for Jose Galvez four minutes later, Manuel Barreto put San Martin back in front in the 26th minute and Ibarra replied again in the 37th. URUGUAY Nacional beat arch-rivals Penarol 1-0 with a penalty won and converted by Sergio Blanco, who scored in the 71st minute after being held by Gerardo Alcoba in the area. Nacional were immediately reduced to 10 men when Sergio Garcia, who had only been on the pitch for six minutes, was sent off for provocatively celebrating the goal in front of the Penarol supporters. The win took Nacional back to the top of the championship's first stage, overtaking Danubio who were held 2-2 by Liverpool. Eduardo Aranda and Emiliano Alfaro put Liverpool 2-0 ahead and Danubio hit back through Esteban Conde, from a penalty, and Jorge Garcia in the last 20 minutes. Uruguayan media reported that 49 people were arrested before and after the game in various incidents around the Centenario stadium. One person was taken to hospital after being run over. Last month the championship was suspended for two weeks after rivals fans rioted on the pitch following a Danubio-Nacional game
