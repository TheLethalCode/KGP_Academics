 Pradip Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said the waves of great support being whipped up for the 'grand alliance' will sweep all conspiracies away. He also urged people to pick the 'grand alliance' candidates for the parliament in Dec. 29 polls to free the country from plunderers' paws. "To free the country from corruption, we must vote for the grand alliance contestants in the Jatiya Sangsad election," said Ershad at a public meeting at Manikganj on Wednesday. The rally marked the start of a three-day election tour of the southern districts. The former president asked the locals to vote for Jahid Malek Swapan, an Awami League candidate. People are thronging 'grand alliance' election meetings in great masses, Ershad claimed. At a public meeting at Magura, he said people will sweep all conspiracies away. At around 1pm, he reached Nomani Maidaan (grounds) at Magura, addressed a public meeting and entreated people to vote for the AL candidate Dr Sirajul Akbar contesting the polls from Magura-1 constituency. Later, he addressed another public meeting held at Arhparha High School grounds and said, "The people are whipping up waves of great support for the 'grand alliance'." Ershad said, "Let's all try together to make the 'grand alliance' a success. To build a prosperous nation, we have to rid ourselves of corruption and plunder." He asked all present to cast their votes for Biren Shikder, the Magura-2 candidate. JP is running the polls as an ally constituting the 'grand alliance'. Ershad will proceed towards Jessore from Magura. "We all must forget our varying philosophies and work together to realise Bangabandhu's Sonar (golden) Bangla and [Ershad's] Notun (new) Bangladesh dreams through helping our grand alliance candidates win the polls," he said at the rally at Manikganj bus-stand. Claiming that he was older brother to the AL president Sheikh Hasina, he said, "I'm begging to bag your ballots as Hasina's brother, not as the Jatiya Party chairman or an ex-president." "I created Upazilas here when I held authority. Manikganj was upgraded and given the status of a district during my presidency. For old times' sake, please vote for our candidate." JP presidium member Motiur Rahman Juktibadi, Jahid Malek Swapon and JP local leaders also addressed the meeting held at Manikganj bus-stand. Earlier, Ershad left his Baridhara residence at 8:30am on his way to Satkhira, Pirojpur and Barisal. He is scheduled to return to Dhaka on Friday night. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia returned to Dhaka Tuesday after her two-day tour of the southern region. She started for the northern region at 10am on Wednesday. Hasina is currently conducting her election campaign in the southwestern district of Gopalganj. bdnews2
