 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) - The High Court on Wednesday extended for six more weeks the stay on the admission process to seven departments of Dhaka University for the 2008-09 session. The bench of justice Mirza Hossain Haider and justice Shamim Hasnain gave the order following a petition by five madrasa-educated students pleading for the extension. Earlier on Dec. 2, the High Court postponed the admission process for one month to the seven departments under arts, social sciences and law faculties. The departments introduced new rules earlier this year barring students from seeking admission who have failed to study English and Bangla for 100 + 100 mark exams at HSC or equivalent level. The rules affect madrasa students, who argue the new criteria are discriminatory. The High Court on Oct 26 asked the university authorities to show cause as to why the disputed criteria should not be declared illegal, on a petition by the five DU admission seekers who secured GPA-5s in madrasa education board examinations. The seven departments are Bangla, English, Economics, Mass Communication and Journalism, International Relations, Linguistics and Gender and Women Studies. bd
