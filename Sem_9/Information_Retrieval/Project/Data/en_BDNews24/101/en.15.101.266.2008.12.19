<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)The Communist Party of Bangladesh has alleged that BNP and Awami League are rehabilitating "war criminals" and "autocrats" under the their respective alliances. "War criminals, rajakars, militants and autocrats have been spreading their wings exploiting the immoral politics of the bigger political parties in their battle for occupying state power," CPB president Monjurul Ahsan Khan said in an election speech on state-run Bangladesh Television. He urged people to reject "the rajakars and autocrats" in the Dec 29 general elections. "Vote for the CPB candidates or elect candidates of the left leaning parties where CPB has no candidate." The CPB has fielded just 37 candidates in 300 constituencies across the county. "If there are no candidates of the CPB and left parties, reject the rajakars and the autocrats," Khan urged. State-run BTV and Bangladesh Radio have invited 15 parties to broadcast election speeches to the nation. bnd
