<TITLE> Being a rebel is easier than governing, says Nepal PM </TITLE>

 KATHMANDU, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Leading a rebellion was a lot easier than running a country, Nepal's guerrilla chief-turned-prime minister was quoted as saying on Friday. "Sometimes I feel it was more comfortable during the people's war," the 54-year-old Pushpa Kamal Dahal, known as Prachanda, was quoted as saying by the Nepali newspaper Kantipur on Friday. Prachanda, the nom de guerre meaning "fierce", led a decade-long civil war against Nepal's former monarchy before joining the political mainstream in 2006. He became premier after an April vote won by the Maoists on a promise of a "new Nepal", but it hasn't been easy running one of the world's poorest countries. More than a third of Nepal's 27 million people live on less that a dollar a day. Prachanda has been criticised by political parties on all sides for failing to provide relief to Nepalis. Hardline Maoists are pressing Prachanda for a more "revolutionary" policy, while the centrist opposition and some of his own coalition partners criticise him for failing to return property seized by Maoists during the 1996-2006 civil war. "There was comfort during the people's war, no tension," Rajdhani, another Nepali daily, quoted him as saying after a meeting with newspaper editors on Thursday. Rights groups estimate 13,000 people were killed during the 1996-2006 war, during which the Maoists regularly bombed major infrastructure such as power plants and bridges. Prachanda's government this week declared a national power emergency and imposed power cuts of nine hours a day because Nepal's sputtering electricity grid is unable to cope with even half the demand. The government is overseeing a new constitution that is meant to be in place by 2010 under the terms of the peace deal. Despite its problems, Prachanda said his government would survive the next two years.
