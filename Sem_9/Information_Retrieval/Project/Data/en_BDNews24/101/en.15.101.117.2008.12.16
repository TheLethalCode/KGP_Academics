 LONDON, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur revealed the designs for their proposed new 60,000-capacity stadium on Monday promising it would deliver the "ultimate fan experience." "The brief I gave the architects was to design an iconic stadium that would be one of the best in Europe," club chairman Daniel Levy said in a statement. "My over-riding priority is to re-create the terrific atmosphere we have at the current stadium, within a world class stadium that offers state-of-the-art facilities. "Our fans will find themselves closer to the pitch than at any other comparable stadium in the UK. This design puts fan experience first." The new stadium will be built alongside White Hart Lane, Tottenham's home since 1899
