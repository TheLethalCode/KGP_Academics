<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24)  Dhaka batsman Mahmudullah Riad struck a hundred, but could not stop Khulna from an outright victory in the penultimate round four-dayer of the National Cricket League on Thursday. Pace duo Ziaur Rahman and Robiul Islam shared nine wickets as reigning champions Khulna recorded their second triumph with a massive 170-run win over Dhaka on the final day at Birsreshthha Shaheed Motiur Rahman Stadium in Khulna. The match between leaders Barisal and Chittagong ended in a tense draw as both sides were apparently on the verge of victory at the close of the final day's play, which started 70 minutes later than the schedule due to fog at Birsreshtha Shaheed Ruhul Amin Stadium in Chittaong. Away at Rajshahai Divisional Stadium, the match between hosts Rajshahi and Sylhet also ended in a draw as dense fog forced the organisers to abandon the third day's play on Tuesday. After the ninth round, Barisal maintained their lead with 97 points, eight points ahead of Rajshahi, who just earned three points from this round while leaders collected nine. Having secured 15 points from the ninth match, holders Khulna toppled Dhaka to grab the third position with 77 points, just two points ahead of Dhaka, who secured four points from this round. Chittagong raised their point tally to 62 while Sylhet collected 53 points. Khulna vs Dhaka Chasing an improbable target of 527, Dhaka were all out for 356 though Riad hit a stroke-filed century before pacer Ziaur Rahman and Robiul Islam wrapped up Dhaka innings. The middle order batsman converted his overnight score of 79 to 152 off 201 that featured 16 fours and one six while Nadif Chowdhury fell on 33 after resuming the innings on overnight 26. Pacer Zia, who grabbed three wickets on the third day, raised his tally to five for 82 while Robiul added two wickets to his overnight tally to finish four for 115. Dhaka resumed the day on 204 for five and added 152 losing remaining wickets. Barisal vs Chittagong At the close of the final day, both hosts Chittagong and visitors Barisal were in a win-win situation as Chittagong were just 23 runs short of the target of 313 while visitors Barisal needed just two wickets to taste their fourth win in nine outings. The result might have been different if the fog did not delay the start of the final day's play for 70 minutes. Having resumed the day on 63 for two, Chittagong were 290 for eight against Barisal as Rezaul Karim converted his overnight score of 11 to 128 before being seventh batsman out, leaving the side at 284 for seven. The third and fourth partnerships brightened Chittagong's chances for win before spinner Saju Datta pegged Chittagong back claiming three quick wickets. Overnight pair Rezaul and Tariq Ahmed added 92 runs for the third wicket before the latter fell to Salahuddin for 54 off 103 balls that included six fours. Then, Rezaul pairing with Gazi Salahuddin (39) added another 121 runs to take Chittagong to 269 for four, but the hosts collapsed to 286 for eight in the face of some good bowling by Saju Datta, who returned three for 33. Rezaul hammered 14 fours in 243 balls before being caught by Salahuddin off Nasir Hossain, who took two for 68. Sylhet vs Rajshahi After the third day's play being called off due to dense fog, Sylhet could not complete their first innings on the final day as the visitors were 64 for two in 11 overs at the close of the day. Rajshahi made 264 in the first innings. bd
