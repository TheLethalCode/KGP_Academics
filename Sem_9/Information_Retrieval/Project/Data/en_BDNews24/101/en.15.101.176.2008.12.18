<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  The voting rights of women and minorities must be protected and ensured during the forthcoming Jatiya Sangsad polls, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda told law enforcers on Thursday. "Relevant officers have been directed to maintain law and order most strictly throughout the election periodbefore, during and after the polls. "So that peace is ensured through the whole period and all voters are able to exercise their voting power on Election Day," Huda told reporters after a meeting on law and order. The voting rights of women and members of the minority communities must be specially protected and measures taken to ward off any atrocities in the wake of the election, he told officials of the law-enforcement agencies at the top level meeting on election security. The two-and-a-half-hour meeting started at 10am at the NEC auditorium at Agargaon. Huda pointed out some districts have been particularly earmarked as disturbance-prone, which have witnessed serious atrocities in the wake of elections in the past. Officials have said militants will not remain active during the election, the CEC said. Asked about risky poll centres countrywide, Huda said, "The polling centres across the country have been grouped into 'normal' and 'critical' categories. Essentially, the risky ones have been renamed as 'critical'." The normal and critical centres will each be assigned 14 and 18 members of law enforcing agencies respectively, he said. On deploying troops countrywide, Huda said, "The Election Commission had earlier considered army deployment from December 24." "But in view of emergency withdrawal from December 17, it was decided that troops would start moving out of the barracks on December 18, to be on duty everywhere from December 20 until December 31." On allegations over breaches of the election code of conduct, the CEC said, "Returning officers and police authorities have been directed to deal effectively with those accused of violating the code." The meeting was attended, among others, by election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain, home secretary Abdul Karim, and top officials of police, armed forces, BDR, Ansar, RAB and relevant ministries. bdnews
