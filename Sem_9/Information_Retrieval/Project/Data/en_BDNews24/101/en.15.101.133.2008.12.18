 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  BNP on Thursday accused Awami League of breaching the electoral code of conduct by spreading "lies and ills" against the party. "AL is misleading the people by spreading lies and ills whereas such acts are subversive of the code of conduct," BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan said at a press briefing at the party's Gulshan office. "This is a sheer violation of electoral rules," he said. "They are also speaking ill of BNP chairperson and her family, which is very unfortunate." Asked why BNP is not lodging a complaint with the Election Commission, Khan said: "We are asking the people for justice and believe they will give their judgement through their votes." Urging their political rivals to refrain from the 'bad propaganda and foul words', the BNP leader said: "We want healthy politics and so do the citizens of the country." "The BNP manifesto does not have a room for malice to any political party or a candidate." Meanwhile, Awami League filed allegations of electoral code violations against some ten leaders of the four-party alliance on Thursday. AL leaders had accused leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami and other allies of the BNP-led combine of violating the electoral code of conduct by making "false, provoking and unrestrained remarks". Islam Nazrul Khan said on Thursday, "When our chairperson is talking of development in her electoral speeches, they are hurling imaginary allegations against us, but the crowds of supporters show their approval of our contributions and competence." Pointing at instances of AL 'terror activities' during its five-year rule, the BNP joint secretary general said: "State-sponsored godfathers were created in Feni, Luxmipur, Narayanganj and Barisal districts." "BNP on the other hand launched Operation Clean Heart and created elite force Rapid Action Battalion to get tough with the terror." On the induction of Jatiya Party into the AL-led grand alliance, Khan said AL had forged a "brother-sister alliance with those they once called 'vote thieves'." Khan also complained that some media "did not do justice to BNP while it sang praises of others ignoring their misdeeds". "We want all-round cooperation from the news media,' he said. b
