 Pradeep Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has asked Awami League president Hasina to pull out her party candidates in 11 constituencies, which he says are allocated for JP under the seat deal between the two electoral allies. "If AL do not withdraw their candidates in the constituencies, the grand alliance shall be harmed," said the JP chief on Thursday. Ershad's JP is a running partner under the AL-led grand alliance for the Dec. 29 general election. He called on AL to withdraw their candidates "in the interest of the country and grand alliance". He called for talks between the two parties to resolve the issue. The former military strongman was speaking at a public gathering at Khalishpur in Khulna Thursday evening, seeking votes for JP candidate Abdul Gaffar Biswas. Ershad claimed that JP had sacrificed much in joining the grand alliance led by Hasina. "A total of 50 constituencies were earmarked for JP for the forthcoming general elections. Returning officers cancelled some four JP nominations," he said. "JP was left with 46 constituencies, but AL candidates are running in some 11 constituencies out of these." Ershad cautioned: "If it continues, the grand alliance itself will ultimately be harmed." He pointed out that Gaffar Biswas was nominated by the grand alliance in the past in the forestalled 22 Jan election. "But, he was not nominated this time." Ershad entreated AL to withdraw its candidate Munnujan Sufian from the seat. Both Hasina and Ershad were campaigning in the southwestern districts on Thursday. Hasina had been in the same Khulna constituency just hours earlier as part of her electoral campaign, seeking votes for Munnujan Sufian and introducing him to the people as a "grand alliance candidate". bdnew
