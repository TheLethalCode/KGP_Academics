<TEXT>
 Bogra, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission was still "not above dispute", claimed BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia at an election rally in Bogra on Wednesday. Urging the EC to work impartially, she said: "There are reservations against their activities. Nevertheless, we are taking part in the polls under this commission in the interests of the country and people." On alleged "attempts to break up BNP", she said: "BNP could not be disbanded as its grass roots leaders love the party dearly." She reiterated that Bangladesh had regressed 20 years under the interim government tenure. "During this time, many people were unemployed, could not to business and so progress has been stalled in the country." She promised to reduce prices of diesel, insecticides and fertilisers to boost agricultural output in the country if BNP came to power. The BNP chairperson on Wednesday took her election campaign north. She left Dhaka around 10am, with a punishing two-day schedule of 28 public rallies in 13 districts, to secure votes for candidates of the BNP-led four-party alliance. At Sherpur in Bogra, in the first rally of the day, the former prime minister had claimed that the Jan 22, 2007 election was cancelled in a "conspiracy". "BNP would have been re-elected if the election had been held. That's why it was cancelled through a conspiracy," she said. "During the BNP government there were a lot of developments in Bogra in a number of sectors. The development was possible as we wanted progress of the whole country," the former prime minister said. "Progress was stalled in the country in the last two years. The politicians and businessmen were sent to jail." "No development is possible without democracy in the country and election is crucial for that," she said. "If we go to power, we will boost production and the prices of commodities will come within people's reach," Khaleda said. Between rallies, Khaleda went to Bogra Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital to visit three crewmen of private channel Ekushey Television, injured in a crash earlier in the day as they were following her motorcade on the election tour. She also paid a visit to the birthplace of her late husband, former president and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman, in Bagbari village, Gabtoli. b
