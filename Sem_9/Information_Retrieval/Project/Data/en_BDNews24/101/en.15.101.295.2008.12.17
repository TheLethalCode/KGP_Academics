 Mushtak Ahmed bdnews24.com correspondent Gopalganj, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has vowed "independence, sovereignty and economic freedom" to the people if voted to power. Addressing local leaders in her home town of Tungipara, Wednesday afternoon, she also promised women's colleges in every upazila if her party came to power. Hasina pledged to double the old age and widows' allowances, raise the freedom fighters' allowance and provide free medical treatment. The former prime minister left Dhaka Tuesday night and will be 'meeting the people' in her hometown throughout Wednesday, as she is running from the constituency, Gopalganj-3. She is scheduled to continue from there on her three-day election tour of the southwest. Hasina's younger sister Sheikh Rehana, and Rehana's daughter Azmina Siddique Ruponti, are accompanying her. While exchanging views with the Tungipara leaders at the Bangabandhu Mausoleum Wednesday afternoon, Hasina said, "It's all up to youwhether you want to elect war criminals and the corrupt to represent you in parliament, or pick those who'll ensure your rights." "I hope you'll make the right decision. The AL's 'boat' symbol represents independence and sovereignty. The 'boat' has earned you freedom in the past. This time, the 'boat' will bring about economic independence." Calling upon her 'grand alliance' partners to engage in electioneering, Hasina said, "I leave the polls campaigning here with you, because it might not be possible for me to return to Gopalganj again before the election." As Hasina left the capital on Tuesday, she addressed a number of public gatherings in Munshiganj, Faridpur and Madaripur. According to AL leaders, the party chief will be in Gopalganj the whole of Wednesday and address a public rally at Kotalipara College. Hasina is scheduled to speak in public meetings in Bagerhat, Jessore and Khulna on Thursday. The ex-PM and AL chief hit the campaign trail by addressing public rallies in Dhaka on Monday. Hasina is running from two other constituencies, Rangpur and Bagerhat. b
