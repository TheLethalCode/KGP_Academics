 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)- The Election Commission will act in line with High Court verdicts on appeals against cancelled candidacies, said a top EC official on Wednesday. "But the commission has very little time in hand," said election commissioner Mohammed Sohul Hussain. "We shall go by the HC directives. But we have to see whether they are possible to implement in the present perspective." "Every day, around one crore ballot papers are being printed. If our work is deferred for one day, troubles will emerge for elections ahead," said the commissioner. "Lawyers for the commission will be advised to raise this point in the court." The EC will continue its efforts to prevent loan and bill defaulters being elected, even after the Dec 29 vote, the commissioner said. "Elected candidates will lose their candidacies if they are adjudged as defaulters in the court. The Election Commission will fight it out even after elections." He said he saw no fear of "sabotage" ahead of the parliamentary polls. "We are not apprehending any sabotage ahead of elections. But law enforcers will be instructed to arrest any troublemakers attempting to cash in on withdrawal of emergency." The instruction will be given at a law and order meeting chaired by the chief election commissioner on Thursday, Sohul said. Security will be enhanced in all voting centres across the country, 'ordinary' and 'important', for the forthcoming elections, he added. bd
