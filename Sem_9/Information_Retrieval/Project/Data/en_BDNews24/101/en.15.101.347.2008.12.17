<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  ETV special correspondent Rashed Ahmed was "stable, but not out of danger" after undergoing surgery at Bogra Ziaur Rahman Hospital, said doctors. Rashed, ETV cameraman Asaduzzaman Asad and driver Rabiul Islam were injured as their microbus collided with a bus earlier in the day while covering the election campaign of BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia in the north. Rashed's condition was critical as he was wheeled into the operating theatre at 3:25pm in the afternoon, a hospital spokesperson had said, while Asad and Rabiul were out of danger. Ashfarul Habib Rushd, deputy director of the hospital said a bone in Rashed's face had splintered but there was no sign of brain haemorrhage. "Doctors say his condition is now stable, but he is not out of danger. He is being kept under observation at the ICU for 72 hours," Rushd told bdnews24.com after the operation. The hospital official added that Dhaka Combined Military Hospital had been alerted to receive Rashed in case of any further emergency. Khaleda Zia paid a visit to the wounded journalists in the afternoon and prayed for their fast recovery. The accident took place near Bhuiyangati in Raiganj Upazila, Sirajganj, around 1pm when the ETV microbus had a head on collision with a passenger bus, of the Salma Classic Paribahan, on the Dhaka-Joypurhat-Hili highway. The bus fell into a roadside ditch, but no reports of injuries were immediately available. The three injured ETV men were initially rushed to Chandaikona Hospital and later transferred to Bogra. "Rashed Ahmed's condition does not seem good. Nothing can be said about him until he is taken into the operation theatre. All we can say now is that his condition is not good," Rushd had told reporters at the time. bdnews24.com
