 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has extended the deadline for submission of nomination papers by a day to Dec. 22 and scrutiny to Dec. 23 for Noakhali-1 constituency, an official said on Sunday. The EC announced a fresh schedule for election to the constituency following the death of candidate and Gonotantree Party president Nurul Islam, with the Dec. 29 election being held in 299 instead of 300 seats. "The commission in a meeting has set Dec. 22 for the deadline of nomination submission. The last date for scrutiny of nomination papers has also been extended to Dec. 23," Farhad Ahmed Khan, senior assistant secretary at the EC Secretariat, said to bdnews24.com. The last date for withdrawal of nomination which is Dec. 27 and the voting day, Jan. 12, would remain unchanged, however, he said. The decision came after acting Gonotantree Party president Md Afzal appealed to the EC on Saturday to extend the deadline of submission of nomination papers by another week. Nurul Islam, the Awami League-led alliance's nominee for the seat, died after suffering critical burns in a fire at his home on Dec. 4. His son also died in the fire. bd
