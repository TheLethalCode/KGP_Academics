<TITLE> South Korea economic reforms hindered by parliament </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 SEOUL, Sun Dec 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) -The biggest obstacle to reforms needed to guide South Korea's economy through the global financial crisis is a dysfunctional parliament where debate has been replaced by sledgehammer-swinging MPs. The presidential office and bureaucrats have drafted hundreds of measures to support the struggling export-driven economy but only about a dozen have made it through parliament. Analysts said reforms were destined for bottlenecks because of a structure that allows minority opposition MPs to block bills, while the faction-ridden ruling party has been unable to effectively use its majority power to push through laws. "Parliament is now a hollow sham that lacks deliberative discussion," said Kim Kwang-dong at the Nara Policy Institute. The latest example of the threat to reform came last Thursday when opposition MPs wielding sledgehammers tried to break into a barricaded room to block the introduction of legislation that would approve a free trade bill with the United States. Scuffles between legislators have broken out in recent months over other reform measures at a time when growth in Asia's fourth-largest economy is slowing fast. The central bank has forecast annual economic growth will sink to an 11-year low of 2.0 percent next year as exports lose steam and domestic demand falters. The Korean won has fallen more than a quarter against the dollar this year. Hahm Sung Deuk, a political science professor at Korea University, said a major problem was South Korea did not use "a winner take all" system in allocating parliamentary committee chairmanships. The minority opposition, now the left-of-centre Democratic Party, is guaranteed the chair of a certain number of committees, including a powerful legislative steering group. "Even though the number of seats is limited, the power of the minority can be maximised through this chairmanship," Hahm said. "It is very tough for parliament to make new bills but it is very easy for them to kill new bills." A financial regulator who asked not to be identified said bureaucrats had already drafted legislation for numerous reforms but they would only be introduced slowly. PARLIAMENT MAJORITY LITTLE HELP President Lee Myung-bak should be able to carry out promised reforms such as privatising state firms because his conservative Grand National Party won a majority in the 299-seat National Assembly at parliamentary elections in April. But Lee has seen his support rate fall faster than any other South Korean leader due to stumbles in leadership. He has also been hit by a factional battle in his own GNP that has further eaten into his power. Lee came to office in February for a five-year term looking to fundamentally change his country by modernising industry, expanding consumption and making the service sector more efficient so it could better stand up to challenges posed by rivals such as Japan and China. But the basic dynamics of parliament are not likely to change significantly, analysts said. They said the public had grown sceptical of Lee's reforms, feeling he set expectations too high and delivered too little. Even though Lee is unlikely to face any challenges to his leadership, his effectiveness has already been damaged. RARE UNITY The GNP had a rare moment of unity this month to railroad through the 2009 state budget and a tax-cut plan with the opposition boycotting the sessions. But the party loses political capital each time it takes unilateral action because this alienates a public that opinion polls show has little confidence in parliament and emboldens the opposition to respond with obstructive tactics, analysts said. The current situation is a far cry from the Asian financial crisis of a decade ago when a strongly supported left-of-centre president had a clear mandate to implement reform and a conservative parliament was willing to find common ground. Parliament suffered a meltdown last Thursday when the GNP initiated the bill to approve a sweeping free trade deal with the United States. Polls show the public wants the deal, along with business leaders who feel it will give South Korea a leg up over rivals in trade with the world's largest economy while raising standards at home in sectors such as financial services. But opposition Democrats used sledgehammers and crowbars to try to force their way into a GNP-run committee room to block the bill. GNP legislators used furniture barricades and fire extinguishers to turn back the charge. Lee Nae-young, a political science professor at Korea University, said the opposition Democratic Party was in even more disarray than the GNP and had no leader who could make deals with the president. "Without clear leadership, the opposition party does not know how to handle the government and the ruling party," Lee said. "Their only common ground is to turn against the ruling party.
