 JAMRUD, Pakistan, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistani Taliban militants killed three truckers returning after taking fuel to Western forces in Afghanistan, officials said on Saturday, the latest in a growing spate of attacks on NATO supplies. In a new tactic in fighting against NATO and US troops in Afghanistan, militants have launched a string of attacks aimed at chocking off supplies through the Khyber Pass, the main route for supplies in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. Militants have destroyed more than 300 trucks laden with food and military goods in attacks on depots on the outskirts of the northwestern city of Peshawar this month, forcing NATO to look for alternative routes. The latest attack occured on Friday night when militants fired rocket-propelled grenades at oil-tankers in the Landi Kotal area of the Khyber region, when they were coming back from the Afghan border. "Two drivers died on the spot while the third succumbed to his injuries today," said Khyal Hussain, a government official in Khyber. The US military sends 75 percent of supplies for the Afghan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 percent of the fuel for its troops, the US Defense Department says. The upsurge in attacks has exposed the vulnerability of NATO supplies and forced the alliance to look for alternatives routes, including through Central Asia into northern Afghanistan. There are two routes into landlocked Afghanistan from the Pakistani port of Karachi, one through the Khyber Pass and the other through the town of Chaman to the southwest, leading to the Afghan city of Kandahar. Supplies have been disrupted by the violence but some have been getting through from depots on the outskirts of Peshawar, through the Khyber Pass to the border at Torkham The main truckers' association that handles the bulk of NATO supplies between Karachi and Peshawar said this month its members would no longer transport supplies because of the violence. But an association official said on Saturday some of its members were going back because they needed the income. "While security remains our paramount concern, this is our livelihood and we have to do something to get things going," Nadeem Akhtar, general secretary of the Karachi Goods Carrier Association, told Reuters. About 60 trucks crossed the border on Saturday, according to Jehangir Afridi, a government security official in Khyber. About 5,000 Islamist party supporters rallied in Peshawar on Thursday to call on the government to block supplies for Western forces in response to US missile strikes on al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Pakistan
