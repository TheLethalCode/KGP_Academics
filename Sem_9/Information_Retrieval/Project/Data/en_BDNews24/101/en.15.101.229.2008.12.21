 Kaliakoir, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com) Awami League president Sheikh Hasina urged supporters in Gazipur on Sunday to "vote boat" to help build a prosperous, secular and democratic Bangladesh. "A colossal tide has been whipped up by the supporters of boat," the former prime minister told a rally at Chandra in Kaliakoir. Responding to Hasina's call, thousands of AL supporters assembled at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman College, braving severe cold and dense fog, yelled "Yes!" Kicking of her daylong election campaign in the Gazipur-Tangail-Mymensigh region, Hasina spoke to the huge assembly of locals from neighbouring Savar and Gabtoli. Supporters, including large groups of women, lined the highway chanting 'Joi Bangla' as Hasina travelled from Dhaka to Chandra in the morning to canvass support for AL's Gazipur-1 candidate AKM Mozammel Haque. Comparing the state of Bangladesh during AL's rule and that of the immediate past four-party alliance rule, the former prime minister said, "Commodity prices were much lower during AL's time, which soared significantly as soon as BNP and its allies took over." "They created hordes of militants and terrorists too in the process of unleashing a reign of loot and corruption." "People haven't forgotten about the atrocities and the misrule of the BNP and its allies. Shun them and vote only for 'boat'," urged Hasina. If voted to power, she promised a well-appointed hospital for the people and workers of Gazipur. She also pledged to introduce free education for all up to degree level, agricultural subsidies and open sale of fertilisers, if AL came to power The AL chief's next stop was Mirzapur High School to canvass support for Ekabbar Hossain, the grand alliance candidate from Tangail-7. bdn
