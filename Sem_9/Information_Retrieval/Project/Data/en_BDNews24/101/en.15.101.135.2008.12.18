 BEIT LAHIYA, Gaza Strip, Thu Dec 18,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An Israeli missile aimed at militants in the north of the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip killed one Palestinian and slightly wounded another, medical workers said on Wednesday. An Israeli army spokeswoman said a strike had been aimed at a rocket-launching squad in the area. Gaza medical workers said the missile hit a house in the town of Beit Lahiya. Gaza militants stepped up rocket attacks on southern Israel on Wednesday, wounding at least two people and raising tension two days before a ceasefire was due to expire. The army spokeswoman said militants launched at least 20 rockets at Israel, the highest one-day total since an Israeli raid into Gaza on Nov. 4 to destroy what the army described as a tunnel built by militants to kidnap Israeli soldiers. Two Israelis in the border town of Sderot suffered slight wounds when one of the homemade rockets hit a parking lot near a commercial centre, medical workers said. Israel responded to the earlier salvoes by launching an air strike on the Gaza Strip, hitting a rocket launcher, the army said. Tension along Israel's border with the Gaza Strip has soared in the final days of a six-month ceasefire between Hamas, an Islamist group, and the Jewish state that ends on Friday. Israel has tried to extend the Egyptian-brokered truce, but Hamas members, who seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007 from the secular Fatah movement, have said they do not expect the truce to be extended
