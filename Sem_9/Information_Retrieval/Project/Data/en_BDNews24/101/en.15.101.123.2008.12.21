 Maruf Mallick, bdnews24.com correspondent Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  The long spells of the fogs, though now receding, might hurt the country's agricultural output, a agriculturist said on Sunday. "The longstanding fogs that blanketed the country over the last few days could leave a negative impact on the agricultural output, especially potatoes might experience fungal blight," ex-secretary and former chairman of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council Dr Z Karim said. "Boro paddy, leafy vegetables and mustard may also suffer a severe setback," the former bureaucrat told bdnews24.com. FAO national consultant Shahidul Islam told bdnews24.com that pesticides have to be applied in case of blight. "But we haven't yet had any such report." Sadekul Alam, meteorological scientist at the Met department told bdnews24.com that with the decline of the fog, temperatures too would fall. "The country's north and western parts saw heavy fog during most of the week while the capital had five days under the spell," he said. The Meteorological Department said the lowest temperature recorded on Sunday was 13.6 degrees Celsius in Satkhira and the highest 27.5 degrees in Cox's Bazar. The Met office in its 6pm weather report forecast partially cloudy and moderately dry weather across the country, but moderate to heavy fogs may linger over the next 24 hours. The night's temperatures would remain more or less steady, the forecast said. bd
