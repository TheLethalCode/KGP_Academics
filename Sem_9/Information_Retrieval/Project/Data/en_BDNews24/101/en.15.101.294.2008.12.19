<TEXT>
 Pradip Chowdhury, bdnews24.com correspondent Barisal, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has warned people that if they mistakenly elect BNP and its allies to run the government next, corruption and plundering will be deeply rooted in the country's system. "The nation does no more want any backward movement, it only deserves to march ahead to prosperity," said Ershad said a public meeting at Muladi Degree College grounds at around 11:30am on Friday, the last day of his election tour of the south. The former military strongman called upon people to vote for 'boat' and 'plough', the election symbols of Awami League and Jatiya Party, respectively, to help the right candidates win the election. During the meeting, Ershad urged the electorate to vote for the JP candidates Golam Kibria Tipu and ABM Ruhul Amin contesting from Basrisal-3 and Barisal-6 respectively. Claiming that he was an older brother to the AL president Sheikh Hasina, he said, "No-one can sever our sacred brother-sister relationship. Bangladesh wouldn't have been born if [independence architect] Bangabandhu [Sheikh Mujibur Rahman] were not born." "We have no other alternative but to vote for 'grand alliance' if one wants to see Bangladesh survive and thrive." Ershad started next for Babuganj at around 12 noon. He is scheduled to address another election meeting at Bakerganj in the afternoon. Earlier, he addressed meetings at Khalishpur, Pirojpur and Satkhira. Ershad left Dhaka on Wednesday on his tour of the southern districts. bdne
