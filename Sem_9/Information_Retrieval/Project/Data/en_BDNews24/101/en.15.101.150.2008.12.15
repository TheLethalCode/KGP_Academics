 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has urged political parties and candidates to follow the electoral code of conduct during campaigning and election. "We've been receiving allegations against a number of candidates of violation of the code of conduct during their campaign," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said to reporters on Monday. "But on the whole, we've had cooperation from political parties and candidates so far and hope they will continue to follow the code of conduct in the remaining days." The EC has asked the establishment ministry to mobilise judicial magistrates for prompt trial of those violating the electoral code, fining or jailing. Administrative magistrates and election monitoring officers will also be in the field to watch for any party or candidate's violation. Pointing out that the code barred electoral campaign with motorcade, Sakhawat said the EC had directed the law-enforcement agencies to take measures, including filing cases, against those responsible for the breach. He said competing candidates or their supporters can conduct public relation campaigns from 2:00pm to 8:00pm. However, party chiefs do not have any time limits, until, of course, the deadline ends. According to the electoral code, any candidate or their supporters would be fined with not more than Tk 50,000 or six-month in prison or both for its violation. If any political party violates the code, it would be fined with not more than Tk 50,000. The maximum punishment for violating the code is cancellation of candidacy, although only the EC can make such decision after hearing. The EC Secretariat deputy secretary, law, AKM Salimullah said the EC has formed a total of 80 'electoral investigation committees', each comprising of two judicial services officials, across the country to prevent the violation of electoral code. To complaint against any violation incident, an application will have to be submitted to district judge's court's joint district judge and senior/assistant judge. Any monitoring committee can also report any violation, Salimullah added. The electoral code of conduct bans adhesion of any poster, leaflet or handbill to any wall, tree, pole in city corporation or municipal areas and any government or local government establishments or to any traffic. However, it allows hanging of those at any place. Sakhawat said the army will be deployed as mobile and strike force from Dec. 20 to maintain law and order and will leave barracks two days earlier to reach destinations across the country. About the 'NO' vote, the commissioner said a 'cross' symbol will be at the bottom of the ballot with writing "none above" to preserve the rights of voters so that they can vote for the 'cross' if they do not like any candidate. bdn
