 NEW DELHI, Dec 16(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India could further cut retail prices of petrol and diesel if crude oil prices continue to fall, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told parliament on Tuesday. The government, which sets the heavily subsidised rates at which these fuels are sold, trimmed prices on Dec. 8 after crude tumbled from its July peak of over $147 a barrel. "We have said we will watch the price further, further reduction is possible," Chidambaram said. Chidambaram, who was formerly finance minister, was answering a question on behalf of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who now holds the finance portfolio.
