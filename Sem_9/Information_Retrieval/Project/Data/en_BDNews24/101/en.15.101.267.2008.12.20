<TITLE> EU asks: bring 'proof' of rigging attempts </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)The EU observation mission in Bangladesh has asked political parties to come up with concrete proof if they believe the Dec 29 polls are being rigged, otherwise to refrain from making such allegations. "I would call on parties to refrain from making such allegations without evidence. Such unsubstantiated allegations will only discredit the election administration," said head of the EU polls mission, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, on Saturday. Speaking to reporters at a 'Meet the Press' function at the Dhaka Reporters Unity, Lambsdorff requested parties to bring "substantive evidence" of any allegations to his mission's notice. Lambsdorff, Euro MP for Germany, urged political parties to be "responsible" in attitude. The EU official saw some challenges to holding the general elections, he said, but believed "all can participate in the election process without fear for safety." "Generally speaking the security situation at this point of time poses no obstacle to having free and fair election." The polls mission chief termed the lifting of state of emergency a "positive" step and lauded the caretaker government for the decision. Deployment of troops to maintain law and order does not contradict the election process in line with the international standards, he said. His mission did not foresee intimidation of voters in the wake of army deployment ahead of polls, Lambdorff added. Over 40,000 troops were deployed across the country on Saturday to assist the civil administration in the lead-up to the Dec. 29 general elections. The army had 'returned to barracks' on Dec 17 as emergency rule lifted after almost two years. They began moving out again the very next day to be redeployed by Dec 20 to help maintain law and order over the election period. bdnews2
