<TEXT>
 MOHALI, India, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India may drop number three batsman Rahul Dravid down the order to help him regain form in the second test against England starting on Friday, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said. India, who clinched a sensational six-wicket win over England in the first test in Chennai, have no other concerns as they go into the final test. Dravid, 35, was dismissed for three and four in Chennai where India achieved a 387-run fourth innings target, the fourth most successful run chase in tests. The Karnataka batsman's international future could hinge on his performance in Mohali, having averaged a measly 17 in the preceding 2-0 home series win over top-ranked Australia. Dhoni scotched speculation over Dravid's future. "I think it is a matter of time, once he passes that 30-run mark the confidence would start," he told reporters on Thursday. "That initial period, he is not able to pass that. But we have confidence in him, he will get runs at some time." However, the team management are yet to decide whether to ask him to bat down the order. "LOOKS EASY" "It looks easy ... shifting Rahul to number five and VVS (Vangipurappu Laxman) to number three, but imagine Laxman gets a good ball and gets out. There is already pressure on Dravid and all of a sudden there are three wickets down. "Batting at number three it is only one down on the board, it gives him the freedom to play his natural game." Unconfirmed media reports said Dravid planned to bat with a squash ball in his glove for better grip, like Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist did when he hit a match-winning century in last year's World Cup final. Dhoni felt the grassy pitch may not help new ball bowlers despite hopes for swing movement in the winter. "It is deceptive, certainly on the slower side." India beat Australia by 320 runs in Mohali in October for their biggest test win in terms of runs after pacemen Zaheer Khan and Ishant Sharma reverse-swung the ball and spinners Harbhajan Singh and debutant Amit Mishra shared 12 wickets. India can move to second spot in test rankings if they clinch the series, although South Africa would regain the place if they triumph in the current series in Australia. "Ranking really doesn't bother us," Dhoni said. "If we play consistently, it will automatically go up
