 MOHALI, India, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Security advice will be key when matches are allotted for the 2011 World Cup to be jointly staged in the Indian sub-continent, International Cricket Council (ICC) president David Morgan said on Sunday. There have been concerns over the World Cup, to be jointly staged by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, due to the refusal of major teams to tour Pakistan over player safety fears. The bilateral relations between India and Pakistan have also strained following last month's militant attacks in Mumbai. The Indian government this week refused permission for the cricket tour of Pakistan which was due to start next month. "Of course, there has to be some concern about the next ICC World Cup to be played in those four countries," Morgan told a news conference. "But I'm confident between the four countries we will have a very good World Cup. I'm sure that the sub-continent will stage the World Cup. "Quite how, in terms of the spread of matches, remains to be seen. That will depend upon the then current security advice." Morgan was in Mohali to watch the second test between England and India. England resumed their aborted tour after their security concerns were allayed in the wake of the Mumbai attacks. Morgan praised England's decision and said it was unfair to compare the situation in India with that of Pakistan. September's Champions Trophy in Pakistan was postponed after a possible pullout by at least five of the eight teams
