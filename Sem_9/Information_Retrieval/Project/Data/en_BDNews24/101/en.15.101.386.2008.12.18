 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  The Supreme Court has ordered the Election Commission to accept nomination papers of Awami League's Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir and BNP's Lutfozzaman Babar for the general elections mandated for Dec. 29. The court of Appellate Division chamber judge justice Joynal Abedin made the ruling on Thursday on separate petitions filed by the former state ministers. The highest appeals court stayed the Dec.15 High Court ruling that had rejected the writ petitions filed by Alamgir and Babar. Rokanuddin Mahmud represented ALamgir while barrister Rafique-ul-Huq argued for Babar in the case. The returning officers had cancelled the nominations of Alamgir for Chandpur-1 and Babar for Netrokona-4 constituencies. The former junior ministers appealed to the EC against the cancellation, but their pleas were turned down. Meanwhile, a three member full bench of the Appellate Division, headed by chief justice MM Ruhul Amin, declared valid the nomination of a BNP candidate from Patuakhali-1 Engineer Faruk Ahmed Talukder. A High Court division bench also declared valid the nomination paper of Dr. Mohammad Shahjahan a BNP candidate from Chandpur-4, on a writ petition filed by Shahjahan. A separate HC bench also directed the EC to accept the nomination paper of ANM Abed Raja a BNP candidate from Moulavibazar-2 bd
