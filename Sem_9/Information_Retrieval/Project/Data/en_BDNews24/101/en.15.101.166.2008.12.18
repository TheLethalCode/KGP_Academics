<TITLE> Sri Lanka eye quick adjustment </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene on Thursday said they were looking for a quick adjustment to the condition ahead of the Test series against hosts Bangladesh starting from Dec 26. The Sri Lanka national cricket team arrived Dhaka on Thursday afternoon, one and a half hour later than the schedule, to play two Test series as well as a tri-nation one-day international Cup, involving also Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. "Difficult to say, we just need to settle down first, obviously you know they (Bangladesh) have got a good side, they have got quite a few new faces now in the team as well which we need to analyse, and every time we played them it has always been a challenge for us," Jayawardene told reporters at Zia International Airport when asked what kind of challenges they were expecting from the hosts. Despite having a very good side that beat India 2-1 in home Test series, the Sri Lankan captain said that they felt no complacency and are aware of the challenge coming ahead of them. "We won't be complacent and won't underestimate the challenge that we have got ahead of us. We have got a very good team and we just want to make sure that we play good cricket." Sri Lanka remained outside playing Test cricket since their home series against India in July-August, but Jayawardene believed that their preparation was good as the players were involved in the domestic cricket. "The memories are still fresh beating India 2-1. So it is always good to think about those things and make sure that we get ourselves ready for the series. "We have been playing in a lot of domestic cricket, three-day competition. Most of the guys had four or five games under their belt before they came here. So the preparation has been really good. So we are looking forward to it." Asked whether they would rout Bangladesh easily after having won the series against India, Jayawardene said, "I am not a captain to give prediction. I'd like you know just to take one game at a time and you know concentrate on that." The Lankan captain also said that they were focusing on the Test series right now rather than thinking about the one-day series. "Right now it's the Test series. Like I said I am not going to take anything easy. We are not going to be complacent, we are going to be very serious about the cricket that we are going to play here and try and enjoy them as well." In the last moment, Rangana Herath has replaced injured sensational spinner Ajantha Mendis, who grabbed 26 wickets in three Tests on way the to a series win against India, and Jayawardene saw no problem in absence of Mendis. "We don't play as individual players, we are a team that play cricket as a team. Ajantha is not here, yes it's a different combination, but whoever going to replace Ajantha will do the job," said the 31-year old captain. He, however, said that Ajantha should be fit for the second Test. "I think the medical report says he should be fit for the second Test. We will see to it. The team we have got here you know is very talented as well. So we won't rush at this juncture. If he is fit to play, we will have a fitness test back home and I know the board will make an arrangement to play him." Sri Lanka Test squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara (vice captain), Malintha Warnapura, Michael Vandort, Thilan Samaraweera, TM Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardane, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidaran, Dhammika Prasad, Chamara Kapugedera, Farveez Maharoof, Dilhara Fernando, Thilina Thushara Mirando and Rangana Herath. bd
