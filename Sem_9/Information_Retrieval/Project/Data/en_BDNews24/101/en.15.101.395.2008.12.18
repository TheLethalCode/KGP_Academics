<TEXT>
 KARACHI, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The drugs inquiry tribunal looking into Pakistan paceman Mohammad Asif's positive dope tests will hold its next hearing in London on Jan. 24. "We felt it would be best to have the hearing outside India after the tensions caused by the Mumbai attacks," Asif told Reuters on Wednesday. "We didn't want the hearing to be further delayed so we requested to hold the hearing at a neutral venue," he added. The Mumbai terror attacks that killed at least 179 people have strained relations between Pakistan and India. Asif, who has played 11 tests, failed a dope test during the Indian Premier League in June and his 'B' sample in August was also positive. He has challenged the IPL procedure used to collect samples and the findings of the tests. His case is being heard by a three-member IPL drugs inquiry tribunal whose second hearing on Nov. 29 in Mumbai was called off due to the terror attacks. Asif said he and his lawyer, Shahid Karim, were happy with the new date and venue as the sports medicine specialist and anti-doping expert assisting him were based in London. "I'm hoping the tribunal will reach a decision at its next hearing because it's very frustrating for me not to be able to play any cricket," he added. Asif has been suspended by the Pakistan Cricket Board for his failed dope test and it will not decide on his future until after the IPL tribunal reaches a decision
