 TOKYO, Sun Dec 21, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An earthquake with preliminary magnitude of 6.2 occurred off the coast of northeastern Japan on Sunday, the Japanese Meteorological Agency said, but there were no reports of damage and no tsunami warning was issued. The quake, which occurred at 6.17 p.m. (0917 GMT), registered 3 on Japan's "seismic intensity scale" of 1 to 7 in Fukushima prefecture northeast of Tokyo, meaning it could probably be felt by people in buildings and might rattle dishes in a cupboard. Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. The country accounts for about 20 percent of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater
