 ROME, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A late Mirko Vucinic double gave AS Roma a 2-0 home win over Bologna on Wednesday to send the holders into the Italian Cup quarter-finals, while Torino defied their poor league form with a 1-0 victory at Fiorentina. Montenegro forward Vucinic, a second-half substitute, scored from close range in the 83rd minute and capitalised on a blunder by Bologna defender Marcello Castellini to steal possession, race on to goal and seal it three minutes later. With captain Francesco Totti resting on the bench, the hosts had struggled to get going in their first appearance in this season's cup until the arrival of Vucinic, who also hit the crossbar with a header and failed to convert two good chances. In the next round Roma, who have now won eight consecutive games in all competitions, will meet the winner of the Jan. 13 tie between Serie A leaders Inter Milan and Genoa at the San Siro. Torino Striker Rolando Bianchi fired home a Tommaso Vailatti cross in the 19th minute to give coach Walter Novellino his first victory since replacing Gianni De Biasi last week. Fiorentina, fifth in Serie A, came close to equalising on several occasions and defender Manuel Pasqual headed over with the goal gaping at the end of the first half. Torino, third from bottom in the league following Saturday's 5-2 defeat at Bologna, will meet Lazio in January's quarter-finals. Napoli, Udinese and Sampdoria are already through to the quarter-finals after winning their last-16 ties, which have been spread over three months because of fixture clashes. Juventus complete the round with a home tie against Catania on Jan. 14, the winners meeting Napoli
