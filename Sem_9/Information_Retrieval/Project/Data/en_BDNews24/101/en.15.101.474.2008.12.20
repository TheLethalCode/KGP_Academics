 Bogra, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Three people were killed and at least 14 others injured when a truck ploughed into an election procession of BNP-led alliance in Bogra on Friday, a police sub-inspector told bdnews24.com. The deceased are Abdul Majid, Milon Mia and an unidentified one, who died on the spot, said Hafizar Rahman. The injured including Liton, a Union Parisad member, and Abdul Khaleque were admitted to Bogra Shahid Ziur Rahman Medical College, he added. The accident occurred as a Bogra-bound truck lost control and hit the people in Mohipur under Sherpur Upazila, the police officer said. A few hundred motorised and non-motorised vehicles on Dhaka-Bogra road were stranded as traffic came to a halt there after the accident. The supporters were going to Mohipur to Sherpur Bus Stand for electioneering for four-party alliance candidate Jane Alam for Bogra-5 (Sherpur-Dhunat). BNP general secretary of the thana Shahidul Islam said the opposition attacked their supporters with the truck. Awami league general secretary Ahsan Habibi said BNP were blaming them for the accident because their victory in the polls was certain. Rabiul Haque, officer in charge of the police station, said it was just an accident. bdnews24
