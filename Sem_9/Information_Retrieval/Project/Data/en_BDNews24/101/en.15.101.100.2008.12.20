 GAZA, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A boat carrying international activists delivering medical aid docked in the Gaza Strip on Saturday after sailing from Cyprus despite an Israeli naval blockade of the Hamas-controlled territory. Fifteen activists, including two from a Qatari charity, left the port of Larnaca on Friday, coinciding with the end of a six-month-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the enclave. It was the fifth such voyage by the US-based "Free Gaza" movement since it launched shuttles from Cyprus last August. Israel patrols the coastal waters around Gaza, but has not obstructed Free Gaza activists from sailing to the enclave. But earlier this month the Jewish state prevented a Libyan ship from delivering humanitarian supplies to the Gaza Strip and foiled an attempt by Israeli Arabs to set off in a boat from Israel to the territory. Israel tightened its blockade of the Gaza Strip two years ago after Hamas Islamists won a parliamentary election. Aid groups have warned of a humanitarian crisis in Gaza if the blockade is not eased
