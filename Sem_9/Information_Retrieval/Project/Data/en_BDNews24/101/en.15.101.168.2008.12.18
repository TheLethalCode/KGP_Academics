 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com) - Singapore authorities have frozen assets belonging to BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia's younger son, Arafat Rahman Coco, worth some Tk 11.5 crore, the Anticorruption Commission said Thursday. The anti-graft body has launched an investigation to find whether the source of the money  some 2.38 million Singaporean dollars or around US$1.6 million  was legal, ACC director general Col Hanif Iqbal said in a regular briefing. Coco established a company in Singapore named Zasz in April 10, 2004, Col Hanif added. The office of the attorney general in Singapore sent the relevant information following a request by the Bangladesh government. Hanif said the money was found through the 'Mutual Legal Assistance Request' under the United Nations Convention against Corruption. The ACC has already appointed an official to repatriate the money back to country through legal measures. bdnews2
