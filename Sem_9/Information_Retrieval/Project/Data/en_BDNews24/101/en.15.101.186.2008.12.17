 GENEVA, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The United Nations warned on Tuesday it may have to cut food rations to millions of hungry people in Zimbabwe despite a worsening cholera epidemic, due to a lack of funds. The rainy season under way in the region is expected to fuel the spread of the contagious water-borne disease, which has infected at least 18,418 people and killed 978 since August. Nearly 4 million Zimbabweans receive monthly food rations from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), which hopes to feed 5.1 million -- almost half the population -- from January. But donors have contributed only $16 million towards a $140 million WFP appeal for Zimbabwe, leading to smaller distributions of maize and beans to families in the past two months, according to WFP spokeswoman Emilia Casella. "The decision on whether to cut and by how much will be made in late December. We very much hope donors heed the call because decisions they make today will impact on the stomachs of children and vulnerable people in January," she told Reuters. WFP needs 47,000 tonnes of food a month for Zimbabwe, reeling from economic collapse and a political turmoil after failure to form a government since March elections. [nLG544351] Matthew Cochrane, spokesman of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said aid agencies were scrambling to boost cholera treatment and prevention programmes. But rains have begun in Zimbabwe and Congo, which typically swell the Zambezi, flooding wells and septic tanks, he said. "If we don't do what we need to do as a humanitarian community now, it could be catastrophic. We've already got a very serious situation and rain will only make it much, much worse," Cochrane told a news briefing on his return from Harare. The Federation, the world's largest disaster relief agency, plans to issue an emergency appeal for Zimbabwe in the next 48 hours, according to John Roche, head of its Africa operations. "Our main concern is a lot of Zimbabweans who work in South Africa will be moving back during this Christmas period. If we don't take measures now to keep this under control, we could have it spread much faster and wider in the region," he said. Some 751 cholera cases including 11 deaths have been reported in South Africa, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), a UN agency
