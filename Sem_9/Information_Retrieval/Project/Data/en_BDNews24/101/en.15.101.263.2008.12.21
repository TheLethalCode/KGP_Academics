<TEXT>
 Arshad Mahmud in Washington Washington, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)Less than a week after President Bush was greeted in Iraq by a shoe-throwing journalist, the White House suffered yet another embarrassment on Friday as a former senior Bush aide admitted to stealing nearly $600,000 from a government-funded centre that promotes democracy in Cuba. Felipe Sixto pleaded guilty to theft from a federally aided programme in front of a judge in Washington DC. He said little during the plea hearing except to respond "Yes, sir" and "Guilty, sir". The former aide's admission came as a big slap in the face to the Bush administration as it prepares to relinquish office after eight years, marked by a series of scandals and controversies mostly centring around the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sixto resigned in March from his job as special assistant to President Bush for intergovernmental affairs after learning that his former employer, the Center for a Free Cuba, was contemplating legal action against him. According to Justice Department records, Sixto, the centre's former chief of staff, amassed $579,274 through overcharging for radios and flashlights. He has been free on bond since he resigned but faces sentencing next March. The Center for a Free Cuba describes itself as "an independent, nonpartisan institution dedicated to promoting human rights and a transition to democracy and the rule of law in Cuba". The centre's funds, estimated at several million dollars a year, come mostly from the US Agency for International Development. The money is spent on rent, travel and equipment such as shortwave radios and laptops. Sixto worked for the centre from 2005 to 2007. He joined the Bush administration's Office of Intergovernmental Affairs in July 2007 and was assigned to deal with state legislators, Native American groups and Hispanic officials on issues such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, health, labour, transportation, environment and energy
