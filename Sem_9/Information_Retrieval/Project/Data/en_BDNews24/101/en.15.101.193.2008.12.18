<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Chief Election Commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda has said candidates will be validated in line with High Court orders up to Dec 28, the day before the general election. "Who can disregard a High Court ruling?" he said Thursday, emerging from his office to be met by reporters' questions. "We have the manpower and they will work round the clock till the day before polls. If the HC rules it, then we will carry out an amendment in the ballot paper up to the last moment," said the CEC. Asked about possibility of appealing against the HC orders, Huda said, "We do not have the energy or the patience for appeals." "Every five minutes we are getting a validation order," he said, brushing aside any suggestion that his comment contained any grievance. The CEC said relevant returning officers were being informed about the nominations being validated by the HC on the petitions of candidates rejected by the EC. Three government-owned presses are at full steam to print over 8 crore ballot papers, some half being completed, said the CEC. The EC had initially expected that the printing will be complete by December 23. bd
