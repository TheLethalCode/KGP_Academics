"Weather experts have forecast that temperatures in the quake-hit areas will be 0.5 degree Celsius to 1 C lower than usual. The areas are likely to get more rain, snow and frost too," the China Daily said, quoting provincial government officials. The temperature was 4 C (39 Fahrenheit) on Monday while the temperature in the Chinese capital, Beijing, in the north, was well below freezing. The quake damaged the homes of more than 3.5 million families in rural areas, where Spartan coal-pellet heating is the norm.
