 Tangail, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)  A day after reports that militants were out to assassinate her, Awami League president Sheikh Hasina said on Sunday she cared more for a thriving Bangladesh than her life. "Today's newspapers have published stories on threats to my life." "I want to tell you straight that I don't bow down to anyone but God and I don't care much about my own life. I only care about a thriving and developing Bangladesh." Hasina said at a rally at Tangail Shaheed Smriti Udyan. bdnews24.com broke the news quoting Indian television network CNN-IBN on Saturday that Indian intelligence agencies had warned the former prime minister a team of six militants of Harkatyl-Jihad'Al-islami Bangladesh were out to kill her. Newspapers printed the story on Sunday. She urged the people of Tangail to 'vote boat', promising to revive the area's dying handloom industry. She also called on voters to wrench the country from "looters' hands". "If voted to power, we'll take necessary steps to provide special loans for weavers to help revive the dying handloom industry. Tangail will be upgraded to a cultural hotbed." The former prime minister introduced the 'grand alliance' candidate Jatiya Party's Abul Kashem to the people gathered. "We from AL had first nominated Mamunur Rashid Mamun from this Tangail-5 seat." "Mamun's candidature was later withdrawn in the interests of the grand alliance," said the AL chief who heads the alliance. She called on all to "vote for boat and plough" and bring victory to the 'grand alliance'. Hasina had earlier addressed a meeting at Gulla Primary School in Bashail, which forms part of her daylong election campaign in the Gazipur-Tangail-Mymensigh region. As the Gulla meeting site was adjacent to the Dhaka-Tangail highway, a large number of bus passengers stopped their vehicles and listened to Hasina's election speech. She urged voters to rescue the country from "looters" "The news of BNP and Jamaat corruption has been publicised internationally. I don't have to tell people how they extorted huge bribes from foreign companies, laundered that money and deposited it with foreign banks," said the former prime minister. "Bashail will be upgraded to a municipality if we are voted to power, this area will have electricity and proper irrigation provisions. "Any locality with a population of 5 to 6 thousand will have a health care centre," she also promised. bdn
