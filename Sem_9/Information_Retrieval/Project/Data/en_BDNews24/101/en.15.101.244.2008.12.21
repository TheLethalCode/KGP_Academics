<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com)Up to 1,500 Bangladeshi hajj pilgrims have been stranded at Jeddah airport for up to two days following the cancellation of a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight. Biman said the flight was cancelled due to "technical trouble" of a plane. The officials of Bangladesh's national flag carrier said the stranded pilgrims would return home within the next two to three days as two more additional aircraft will fly to Jeddah Sunday night. "Yes, there was a problem with the flight schedule since one of our aircraft had technical trouble," Zahed Kuddus, Biman's managing director and chief executive officer, said to bdnews24.com on Sunday night. "In addition to our two 747 planes, we are sending two more DC 10 aircraft tonight to Jeddah to carry back the stranded pilgrims," said Kuddus Sunday night. The managing director said all four aircraft with passengers on board would return Monday. "I hope the stranded hajj passengers will be able to return home in the next two to three days," he said. Those stranded, many of them elderly, have been facing discomfort and distressing conditions, one of the stranded passengers told bdnews24.com from Jeddah. "About 1,000 hajjis were forced to camp out on the floor of the airport because of the cancelled flight," Mostofa Azad Chowdhury, member of Rangpur Chamber of Commerce and Industries, told bdnews24.com's Rangpur correspondent Liaqat Ali Badal by telephone. "In addition, about 500 passengers have been stranded at the airport since Friday." He alleged that the Biman office in Jeddah did not manage hotel facilities for the passengers. "According to international practice, airlines must bear the expenses of hotel, foods and transport facilities of passengers if any flight is cancelled for technical reasons," he pointed out. "Elderly men and women have been forced to wait on the floor in the chilling temperature because Biman has not managed hotels for us," he said. bdn
