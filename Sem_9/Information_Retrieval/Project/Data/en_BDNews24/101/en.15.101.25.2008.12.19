 Perth, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com) - South Africa will have to deny history to win the first Test against Australia in Perth. The Australians were 7-228 at stumps on the third day Friday, a lead of 322 with Brad Haddin not out on 39 and Jason Krejza on 28. Only one side has ever got more than 300 to win at the WACA and that was when Australia chased 339 against India in 1977-78. It was only an unbeaten eighth-wicket partnership of 66 by Haddin and Krejza that steadied the ship for Australia after the top order flopped. Matthew Hayden was in for 39 minutes of false strokes and near misses, but was unlucky to be given out caught and bowled for four to the bowling of Dale Steyn despite the fact he missed the ball by some distance. Simon Katich was unusually flat footed and caught behind on 37 off Jacques Kallis bowling. Ricky Ponting played across the line to a good ball from spinner Paul Harris and was also caught behind for 32. Michael Hussey (8) dragged a ball on from Makhaya Ntini. With the score 4-88 sensible heads were needed, but Michael Clarke slashed at a ball from Steyn when he was 25, nine runs later Andrew Symonds had a rush of blood and hit Harris straight to Graeme Smith. At 6-157 South Africa was still in the game but Krejza and Haddin spent an hour consolidating the lead to put their side in a good position for the fourth day. Earlier Mitchell Johnson became the first left-arm paceman to take eight wickets in a Test innings. Beginning the day with seven wickets, Johnson finished with 8-61 as South Africa was bowled out for 281 this morning after resuming at 8-243, giving Australia a first innings lead of 94. In the first session Johnson, bowling his second over of the day and first with the second new ball, dismissed Steyn (8) with a brute of a delivery which lifted sharply at the tailender. Steyn attempted to sway out of the way but gloved the ball as it went through to wicket-keeper Brad Haddin. It appeared that Johnson would create further history when Boucher, on eight, skied a hook shot but it landed safely just out of reach of Haddin running back and Brett Lee coming around from fine leg. Lee continued his wicketless match with a five over spell before his replacement, Peter Siddle, dismissed Boucher caught at point by Simon Katich for 26. The umpires gave Johnson the ball and he left the field to a standing ovation, holding the ball aloft and showing it to all parts of the field. Johnson set up the game up on Thursday with an extra-ordinary spell late in the day, claiming 5-2 in a 21-ball spell which saw South Africa tumble from a seemingly safe 3-23
