<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Thursday asked Bangladesh House Building Finance Corporation to cut high interest on housing loans to help resolve the housing crisis. "Alongside commercial banks, BHBFC has all along been active in providing housing loans in the country," said the adviser at the BHBFC annual conference being at Hotel Sheraton in the city. "But the high interest rate of BHBFC has to be lowered in line with the commercial banks so that people are able to build houses at minimum costs." BHBFC, the only government credit provider in the housing sector, charges 12 percent interest on loans provided for Dhaka and Chittagong city residents and 10 percent for other districts. He urged the BHBFC officials to change their mindset and broaden skills. "Waiting for customers in the office only will not do. "You must design newer projects befitting modern times and needs, take them out in the field and market the lending packages, which will reduce the number and frequency of 'bad debts and debtors'." On the newly announced tax holiday, he said, "As a means of managing housing crisis, the government has announced a 10-year tax holiday in the FY 2008-09 budget for multi-storied building projects undertaken in Dhaka and the divisional towns and their suburbs." Aziz asked the BHBFC officials to search out customers willing to build multi-storied buildings, encourage them to take advantage of the opportunity and offer them building loans. The government recently approved of a large government-private partnership project involving the construction of over 4,000 flats in Mahakhali and Mirpur of Dhaka. "Demand for accommodations is increasing every day with the increase in population and income, which is, in turn, resulting in reduced arable land by at least 1 percent," said the adviser. As part of their corporate social responsibilities, Azizul said, the private commercial banks and BHBFC offer housing loans at low rates to the builders of multi-storied buildings in Dhaka and other divisional towns. BHBFC chairman M Janibul Islam solicited the finance adviser's assistance to raise the corporation's approved capital of Tk 110 crore to Tk 1,000 crore and paid-up capital of Tk 97.29 crore to Tk 650 crore. The adviser assured the corporation that the government would soon take necessary measures for to raise its capital. Finance secretary Mohammad Tareq, BASIC Bank executive director AKM Sajedur Rahman and others spoke on the occasion. bdn
