<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com) - Awami League on Wednesday accused Jamaat-e-Islami and other allies of BNP-led four-party combine of violating the electoral code of conduct by making "provocative remarks". "Jamaat amir Matiur Rahman Nizami, secretary general Ali Ahsan Muhammad Mojahid and Islami Oikya Jote chairman Mufti Fazlul Haque Ameni on Tuesday violated the election code of conduct through false, provoking and unrestrained remarks in different meetings," said HT Imam, co-chairman of AL election conduct committee. "We will file the allegations with the Election Commission on Thursday," Imam said. "Seeing victory ahead for Awami League, a quarter has been hatching plots to destabilise the country," he said to reporters at the party's regular press briefing at AL's media centre in the city. Nizami at a Victory Day programme on Tuesday accused AL president Sheikh Hasina of using religion to gain political interest. Criticising his comment, Imam said Nizami had violated the election code uttering such a comment which was in contradiction to AL policy and ideology. Ameni on Tuesday said they would call for non-stop hartal until fall of the next government if it was formed by any secular party, without any Islamist power. At an election meeting in Faridpur, Mojahid recently commented that the Dec. 29 election will make Bangladesh a "slave country" under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina. "Such comments by Mojahid are an evil effort to weaken the country's sovereignty, and also a violation of election code of conduct," Imam claimed. bdn
