 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will take steps against 'unfit candidates' who are running for parliament securing court orders, even after election, a top election official said on Saturday. Election commissioner M Sakhawat Hussain told reporters at a press briefing that if a person was found ineligible to be a lawmaker after election, they would hold a by-election to that constituency. If that is not possible, he added, the EC would take them to court. "Those who are contesting with the approval of court [should know that] this is not the end of the story. We will appeal against them after election. "Then there will be by-election in that constituency if that elected person is ineligible to be a member of parliament." "None will be able to get away with violation of the electoral code of conduct," he warned. The court ordered the EC to validate their candidacy and allocate them election symbols. The EC will go ahead with printing ballot papers for seats with two party hopefuls if they do not resolve their dispute over candidacy in two to three days, Sakhawat said. Sakhawat said two constituencies have such disputes unresolved -- Chandpur-1 and Comilla-10. "The returning officer will have to decide on one of the candidates and allocate him/her an election symbol according to the court order. The other will get a symbol as an independent candidate." Grand alliance candidate Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir in Chandpur-1, Abdul Gafur Bhuiyan in Comilla-10 and 18 others have so far got the green light from the High Court to contest the elections. On a separate issue, Sakhawat said they had information that the police were working on spending of candidates on election campaign. EC will take action those who would be spending beyond the ceiling after investigation. He said 'striking force' was deployed all over the country from Dec. 20 onwards to keep the law and order situation normal. The law-enforcers are on alert also on the borders. "Party adherents are attacking opponents in different places. Steps will be taken against those who attacked. Election investigation committee has started working on it," the commissioner said. Sakhawat asked political parties and candidates to adhere to the electoral code of conduct. "In different places some candidates were abusing opponents through speeches and statements, which were banned in the Representation of the People Ordinance and the electoral code of conduct. It will have to stop." "There is no way of election environment being hampered. Army has been deployed all over the country. BDR, police and RAB are on alert on borders. "Earlier, extremists would try to resurface ahead of the election , but that is not the case anymore. The situation is completely under control." He said police were continuing their arms seizure operation without fuss. "[It] is good because many people hide themselves after declaration. This time they are not getting the chance." He said security forces were on extra alert in remote and minority-dominated areas and will remain alert in sensitive areas even after election. bdn
