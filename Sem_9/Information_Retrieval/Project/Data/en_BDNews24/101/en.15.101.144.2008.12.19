<TITLE> Russia to halt weapons if US drops shield: report </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 MOSCOW, Fri Dec 19,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Russia will stop developing some strategic weapons if the United States drops plans for a missile shield in Europe, Interfax news agency quoted the commander of Russia's strategic missile forces as saying on Friday. "If Americans give up plans to deploy the third positioning region and other elements of the strategic missile defense system then certainly we will adequately respond to it," Colonel-General Nikolai Solovtsov said. "We will simply not need a number of expensive programs," he added. The US missile shield plan includes interceptor missiles in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic. Washington has said the shield is needed to protect itself and its allies from attacks by rogue states such as Iran and North Korea but Russia says the shield is a threat to itself. In response to the US shield plans, the Kremlin has boosted its missile development program and threatened to position missiles in the Kaliningrad region on the European Union's borders
