 Dhaka, Dec 20 (bdnews24.com)  Sri Lanka will open their tour with the only three-day warm-up match on Sunday against Bangladesh Cricket Board XI amid foggy conditions at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. Fog is the main headache for the organisers as the country have been experiencing dense fog in past few days with sun barely visible. Rajin Saleh will lead the local side, but the visitors are yet to decide on their squad. Sri Lankan vice-captain Kumar Sangakkara may miss the match before the first Test taking place on Dec. 26-31. "I don't really know but I'll see after the physiotherapy and take a decision tomorrow (Sunday)," said Sangakkara told reporters during the practice session at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. "It is nothing serious and I hope I will be up in a day or two," said the injured batsman. Asked whether they were worried about the weather, the left-handed batsman said, "It has been a bit strange coming from Sri Lanka to here but we've got to get ahead. As long as the wickets are good and the grounds are ready for play, I don't think it'll matter much." "I think every series is different. No series is easy for us and we will take it as another Test match. We have to be up to the mark every day, go out there and perform," he added. Apart from Rajin, Bangladesh's selectors drafted in Mehrab Hossain Junior, Imrul Kayes and Shahadat Hossain, named for the two Test series, for the warm-up tie to watch them. Squad: Rajin Salah (captain), Mehrab Hossain Jr. (vice captain), Imrul Kayes, Nafis Iqbal, Faisal Hossain, Mohammad Mithun (wicketkeeper), Nazmul Hossain, Shahadat Hossain, Tareq Aziz Khan, Nabil Samad, Saikat Ali, Ashraful Aziz, Md. Rahi and Raihanuddin Arafat. Sri Lanka Test squad: Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Kumar Sangakkara (vice captain), Malintha Warnapura, Michael Vandort, Thilan Samaraweera, TM Dilshan, Prasanna Jayawardane, Chaminda Vaas, Muttiah Muralidaran, Dhammika Prasad, Chamara Kapugedera, Farveez Maharoof, Dilhara Fernando, Thilina Thushara Mirando and Rangana Herath
