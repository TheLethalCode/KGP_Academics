 Dhaka, Dec 15 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina Monday said the voters must decide if they want development or anarchy. Addressing rallies at different places in the city the former prime minister sought the people's mandate for 'the boat'. "If the Awami League is elected through people's vote then corruption and terrorism will be removed from society," she said. Hasina told supporters at one rally, "It is the voters who must decide if they want development or anarchy." At another, she promised measures for the capital to check pollution, develop an improved communication system, and construct monorails, sub-ways and flyovers. For the country, she vowed education for all and power production and water supply woes would be settled as per the manifesto. Among Hasina's stops were Kafrul Ideal school field where she addressed a rally to drum up support for Dhaka-15 candidate Kamal Ahmed Mazumder. She went on to address a public meeting in front of Amir Complex at Uttara and urged the local people to vote for advocate Sahara Khatun, AL candidate for Dhaka-18. Earlier in the day, the AL chief said her party, if elected to office, will have no laws that go against the Quran or Sunnah. She made the declaration at an election rally of Jahangir Kabir Nanak, the grand-alliance candidate for Dhaka-13 constituency. Addressing a large section of the electorate who are non-Bengalees, she said, "Those who were born in this country are the citizens of this country and if they accept Bangladesh as their own country then they will be assured of employment and all other facilities." At a rally at Karwan Bazar for Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, the AL candidate for Dhaka-11 seat, held, Hasina pledged to turn Dhaka into a 'modern city' if her party won the Dec. 29 election.

Hasina presented comparative pictures of the price of essentials between the times of the AL and BNP-led governments and asked the people to "vote for the boat", the party's polls logo. "Those who have robbed the people of their freedom do not have the right to come to power," she said. It was now clear who had inserted false voters into the electoral roll to come to power, she also claimed. "During the time of 'that government' the people suffered." She said being the daughter of 'father of the nation'Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, "I have fought for establishing your rights and I will continue to do so."
