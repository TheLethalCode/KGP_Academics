 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  The Shaheed Jewel XI recorded a 28-run win over the Shaheed Mustaque XI in a Victory Day exhibition match at Dhanmondi Cricket Stadium Tuesday. Raihan Uddin Arafat grabbed four wickets as the Mustaque XI were bundled out for 173 in 43.1 overs after the Jewel XI posted 201 for eight in the stipulated 50 overs. After being put in to bat first, the Jewel XI put up a moderate total as middle order batsman M Rahe struck a fine 71 off 88 balls that included eight fours. Apart from Rahe's innings, Mehrab Hossain (27), Kuntal Chandra (20), Midul Hasan (15) were other remarkable scorers to take their side beyond the 200-mark. In reply, the Mustaque XI faced trouble losing the wicket of opener Rasel Al Mamun with scoreboard reading two for one in 1.5 overs. Opener Fazle Rabbi and skipper Rashedul Haq tried to fight back contributing 25 and 36 before Arafat and Nazmul Islam rattled the top order. Aslam Khan (33), Niaz Morshed (21) and Newaz (18) put some runs on the board, but could not avert the defeat in the match, which was held to mark the Victory Day. Arafat later picked up another two wickets to wrap up the tail and subsequently returned four for 34 while Namul and M Rahe took two wickets each for 23 and 33. bd
