<TITLE> OPEC rallies behind record oil supply cut </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 ORAN, Algeria, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - OPEC oil ministers lined up on Tuesday to back what would be the group's biggest-ever output cut as crude prices fell further on the wider picture of the damaged world economy. Saudi Arabia was first to publicly support a reduction of 2 million barrels per day (bpd) ahead of OPEC's meeting on Wednesday. That figure was swiftly endorsed by many of the group that pumps more than a third of the world's oil. "We are in harmony, we know the situation is difficult. We have to cooperate together. We have to reach a difficult decision, but we're going to reach it. I think 2 million is the most likely cut," said OPEC Secretary-General Abdullah al-Badri. Ali al-Naimi, Saudi oil minister, told Reuters he also expected those outside OPEC to cut up to 600,000 bpd in concert with the 12-member exporter group. Russia, the world's biggest non-OPEC exporter, has suggested it could contribute to the curbs, but Mexico has avoided making any commitments. An overall reduction of 2.6 million bpd would remove about 3 percent of the world's daily output. "We know that supply is still somewhat in excess of demand, inventories are also higher than normal," Naimi told reporters. "Therefore to bring things in balance there will be a cut of about 2 million barrels per day at this meeting." The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' output restraints of two million bpd already in place have failed to counteract tumbling demand that has pushed the oil price down by more than $100 since July. And the prospect of recession further eroding worldwide fuel use pushed oil towards $43 a barrel on Tuesday , not far from a four-year low of $40.50 hit early this month. Naimi's counterparts from Venezuela, Iran and Libya openly endorsed the depth of cut, 7.3 percent of OPEC's supply target, suggested by OPEC's leading producer. Saudi Arabia has already taken steps to remove excess oil and push prices back towards the $75 level Saudi King Abdullah has identified as "fair". On his arrival in Oran, Naimi clearly spelled out the kingdom's position. "Let me tell you this -- this is Saudi Arabia -- since August to November we reduced 1.2 million barrels per day from 9.7 to 8.5," he said. Reuters reported last week that Saudi Arabia's biggest customers would receive less oil in January -- implying the kingdom had already factored in another OPEC reduction. Naimi confirmed that. "In preparation for this meeting, yes," he told Reuters. Gulf neighbour Kuwait said it, too, was wasting no time in cutting January supplies ahead of Wednesday's expected cut. INVENTORIES An oil price below $50 is uncomfortable for all in OPEC. "Everybody is suffering. That is why we want two million," said an OPEC delegate. "But we're worried about compliance." Deep cuts are more difficult to enforce as they require discipline from all OPEC members and can lead to accusations behind closed doors of cheating on quotas. According to independent observers cited in OPEC's monthly report on Tuesday, the group's compliance in November to existing cuts was only just over 50 percent. The economists at OPEC's Vienna Secretariat also echoed the view of the U.S. government: the world's thirst for fuel is expected to shrink this year and next, the first time since the 1980s demand will contract for two years running. A slump in consumption has lifted oil inventories in OECD industrialised nations to the equivalent of nearly 57 days of forward demand, a measure OPEC closely monitors. The industry norm for this time of year is about 52. Russia, the biggest non-OPEC exporter, sent a high level delegation to observe the Oran meeting. Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin said Russia could cut oil exports by as much as 320,000 bpd but told Reuters that cooperation with OPEC would progress only "step by step". Azerbaijan said it could also contribute to any OPEC decision, while Mexico said in a statement on Tuesday that its production has already declined sharply and reiterated its existing target for exports next year, making no offer to cut output. Mexico, Russia and Norway teamed up with OPEC in 1999 to revive prices that had fallen below $10 a barrel and again in late 2001 to pull prices back above $20 a barrel. Output from non-OPEC producers is declining and proclamations of cuts served to mask the effect of ageing fields and a lack of investment, analysts said
