 MUMBAI, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Guidelines agreed to by Indian news broadcasters after wide criticism of their coverage of the Mumbai attacks are unlikely to stop them from overstepping the mark again, media groups said on Friday. India's financial centre is going through a period of self-examination after the attacks, in which 179 people were killed, with the legal profession also under the spotlight as it struggles to find someone to defend the lone surviving gunman. Media industry body the News Broadcasters Association on Thursday agreed to a set of six guidelines that include no live contact with hostage takers, no mention of security operation details and no distressing images in future broadcasts. Dipankar Gupta, a sociology professor at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who helped draw up the code of conduct, said it was felt that self-regulation was the best way to bring about greater efficiency and professionalism. But Meenakshi Madhvani, chief executive of media monitoring firm Spatial Access, said the guidelines were inadequate and ambiguous and needed penalties for violations. "We are a nation of law-breakers, we don't do well with self-regulation, so there needs to be more punitive action for violations," she told Reuters. There are more than 60 English and regional-language news channels in India fighting for the attention of advertisers and viewers in 80 million TV-owning homes. Most were launched in the past three years on the back of a booming economy and lack the maturity of established broadcasters to deal with emergencies like the Mumbai attacks, Madhvani said. MEDIA CLASHES Media crews often clashed with the families of victims during the 60-hour Mumbai siege and Internet networking sites such as Facebook have since been awash with criticism of the media. Industry monitors have criticised the 24-hour live coverage of the attacks as lacking balance, being jingoistic and directing public anger towards Pakistan, charges broadcasters deny. India has blamed Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Mumbai attacks, although Islamabad strenuously denies there were any state links. On the day the guidelines were passed, TV channels pounced on Pakistan's apparent failure to capture wanted militant leader Maulana Masood Azhar, and Pakistan's protests that Indian warplanes had violated its airspace, which India denies. "Pak lies to India" and "Pakistan lets Masood Azhar go free" were among scathing headlines on news channel Times Now. Mumbai is also split over whether surviving gunman Mohammad Ajmal Kasab should receive legal representation. Many Mumbai lawyers, including the 1,000-member Bar Council, have refused to represent him, citing moral and ethical reasons. Members of the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena party this week attacked the homes of three lawyers who said they would act for him, forcing at least two of them to change their minds. Police commissioner Deven Bharti said Kasab was entitled to a lawyer and one would be appointed by the state. Shiv Sena on Thursday called for Kasab to be hanged without trial, but other legal figures say the party's tactics might backfire. "If you do not have a defence lawyer, then the trial will be declared invalid," said prominent criminal lawyer Majid Memon. "So if we do not want him to get the benefit of a defective trial, it is very important the state appoint a lawyer," he said.
