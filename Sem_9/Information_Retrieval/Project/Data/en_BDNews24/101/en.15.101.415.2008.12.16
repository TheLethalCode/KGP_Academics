 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  The nation is celebrating the 37th Victory Day on Tuesday amid calls for prosecution for war crimes of the local cohorts of Pakistan army which surrendered on Dec. 16, 1971 at the end of a painful nine-month war that saw the bloody birth of Bangladesh. The day's celebrations started with a 21-gun salute at the National Memorial at Savar followed by the laying of wreaths to pay tributes to the nation's war heroes who laid down their lives for independence. The Bengalees waged an armed struggle against the occupation of Pakistani forces on March 26, 1971 and won the make-or-break war on Dec. 16.

President Iajuddin Ahmed and chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed were the first to lay flowers and pay respects at the memorial early in the morning. The president and the chief adviser gave separate messages on the eve of the Victory Day. "The liberation warriors nurtured a dream of raising a prosperous, self-reliant and happy Bangladesh. Our efforts of realising that dream have seen our nation progressing in certain sectors considerably," the president said. "Now, it's time to strengthen our democratic systems further through rendering them more effective. All we need today is every individual's earnest cooperation, irrespective of cast or creed." "I hope all will be inspired by this auspicious occasion and contribute freely to building a great nation in the near future." The chief adviser said: "A year has gone by and the Victory Day rings the bells of jollities and merriment again. On this very day 37 years back, we had attained independence after waging nine bloody months of war." "I wish all freedom fighters and citizens at home and abroad unmixed joy and felicity on the occasion."
