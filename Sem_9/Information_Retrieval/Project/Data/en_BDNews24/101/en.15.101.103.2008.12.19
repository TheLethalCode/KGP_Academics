<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 19 (bdnews24.com)  Giant-killer Rahmatganj MFS came from two goals down to hold title contenders Sheikh Russel KC to a 2-2 draw in their first-leg last match in the Citycell B. League at Bangabandhu National Stadium on Friday. Away at MA Aziz Stadium in Chittagong, hosts Chittagong Mohammedan Sporting Club recorded an emphatic 2-0 win over struggling Muktijoddha Sangsad KS, who remained in second position from bottom with four points after 10 matches in the first-leg. With the third draw in 10 matches, Sheikh Russel raised their point tally to 18, four behind leaders Dhaka Abahani Limited, who were in invincible position with 22 points after the first leg. Dhaka Mohammedan SC and Brothers Union were joint second with 19 points each after 10 matches. Chittagong Mohammedan maintained their fourth position with five wins to secure 17 points, while Rahmatganj moved up to fifth with 14 points, leaving Chittagong Abahani in sixth place. Smarting from a 3-0 loss to Dhaka Abahani in their previous round, Sheikh Russel had a shaky start against Rahmatganj, who had stunned both giants Dhaka Abahani and Mohammedan SC, before Mubarak gave Sheikh Russel an early nine-minute lead. Left-back Mahmudul Hasan whipped a cross for Mubarak inside the danger zone and the winger faced no resistance from the Rahmatganj defenders before slotting the ball home. Nine minutes later, Moroccan medio Touati Youness broke Rahmatganj's offside trap to head Monwar Hossain's harmless lob home to double the Sheikh Russel margin. After going two goals down, Rahmatganj bounced back in the match with Ugandan striker Idris Kasirye reducing the margin from a counter attack. Idris raced past Russel's Moroccan defender Bourdif Mohamed and beat goalkeeper Titumir Chowdhury with a placing shot in the 24th minute. Three minutes later, Titumir thwarted another effort from the same striker. Russel' goalkeeper, however, could not read a 30-yard shot taken by Idris, who suddenly hammered the powerful strike that found the back of the net in the 56th minute. Sheikh Russel, put on the back foot, were lucky not to concede a defeat against the Old Dhaka outfit, who saw Idris squander two easy sitters in the dying moment. Meanwhile, in the port city of Chittagong, Akbar put Chittagong Mohammaden ahead in the 39th minute while Raphael Sagno sealed the match one minute from time. bdn
