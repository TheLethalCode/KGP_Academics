 Dhaka, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh Reforms Regulatory Commission has sought definite proposals from the business community within 10 days on making the forex control law more business friendly. "We've asked the business and trade bodies to give us definite proposals," RRC chief executive officer Apurba Kumar Biswas said Thursday. The proposals were sought at a meeting on forex law chaired by Biswas at the RRC's office. The RRC formed a sub-committee after businesses had asked the commission to amend sections of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to make it more pro-business, Biswas told reporters after the meeting. Though the business community has asked for revisions to sections of the Act, the central bank has defended them, Biswas said. "Legal instruments to control financial risks are vital to small economies like Bangladesh," he said. "The sub-committee has already met twice and is scheduled for a third meeting at the Bangladesh Bank in mid-January to finalise the issue." "We therefore sought proposals on how to make the Act pro-business by keeping the relevant sections unchanged," the RRC official said. b
