<TEXT>
 BANGKOK, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Three times champions Thailand fought back from a goal down to reach the final of the Southeast Asian championships with a 2-1 win over Indonesia on Saturday. Late goals by Teerathep Winothai and substitute Ronnachai Rangsiyo gave the Thais a 3-1 aggregate victory that sets up a final with Singapore or Vietnam, who meet on Sunday. "They were difficult to break down but I knew Indonesia wouldn't be able to keep it up," Thailand coach Peter Reid told reporters. "They put us out of our stride but we were patient, we worked through it. It takes 90 minutes to win a match." Indonesia began the match trailing 1-0 from the first leg but stunned the packed Rajamangala stadium when Nova Arianto scored with a near post header after nine minutes. Thailand fought hard for an equaliser but squandered their chances, with misfiring striker Teerathep crashing a volley against the bar while weak efforts from Suchao Nutnum and Teerasil Dangda failed to trouble keeper Markus Rihihina. But Teerathep found his scoring touch to fire home Teerasil's cross from close range in the 73rd minute and Ronnachai got a last-gasp winner after a goalmouth scramble. Singapore will host Vietnam at the National Stadium on Sunday having drawn the first leg of their semi-final 0-0 in Hanoi. The two-legged final will be played on Dec. 24 and 28
