 Dhaka, Dec 17 (bdnews24.com)  US ambassador James F Moriarty on Wednesday said Barack Obama's new administration was waiting to see a democratically-elected government in Bangladesh. The US envoy, following his meeting with foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury at the foreign ministry, told reporters that there would be no change in the new US government's policy toward Bangladesh. Washington also welcomed the lifting of the state of emergency, the ambassador said. "In terms of the future US policy towards Bangladesh, I can say that I heard back in Washington only continuity," Moriarty said. "I have heard nothing that indicates there will be any major change in the US policy towards Bangladesh for the course we look forward to working in the future with the democratically elected government. "Everybody is eager to see that happen," he said. The foreign adviser told reporters that the new US government had great interest in Bangladesh. "We hope that the warm relations between Bangladesh and the US will continue. "He (Moriarty) took part in a congressional hearing on Bangladesh in Washington. He informed me that President Obama's transitional team had a great interest in Bangladesh," Iftekhar told said. The continuation of the US policy towards Muslim-majority Bangladesh is seen by many as satisfactory since Obama's new administration hinted tough policy towards Pakistan following Mumbai attack by Islamic militants. "I have congratulated the foreign adviser for the lifting of state of emergency," said Moriarty. "This is something that we advocate, the lifting of the state of emergency." Western diplomats have been urging the military-installed government of Fakhruddin Ahmed to lift emergency rule slapped on Jan. 11 last year. The interim government lifted the state of emergency early Wednesday to allow political parties to campaign freely for the Dec. 29 election. Public meetings were banned after the emergency was imposed in January 2007 after months of political violence. "This is up to the parties to use this (lifting of the state of emergency) creatively to push their message out of the campaign and then make sure that there is a peaceful environment to hold a credible on Dec 29," the envoy said. Moriarty said he also lobbied for Bangladesh's recognition of Kosovo. "I have told him that the recognition of Kosovo is under our consideration," said Iftekhar.
