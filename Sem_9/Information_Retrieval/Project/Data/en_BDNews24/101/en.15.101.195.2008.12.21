 Dhaka, Dec 21 (bdnews24.com) - The first day's play of the lone warm-up match between visiting Sri Lanka and the BCB XI has been called off at Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan due to damp conditions following fog and inclement weather. "After removing the pitch cover around noon, it appeared damp and unlikely to dry up today (Sunday). So the day's play has been called off," said match referee A.S.M.Raquibul Hassan. The second day's play is scheduled to start at 9:30am on Monday. Sri Lanka will take on hosts Bangladesh in the first of two Tests from Dec 26 at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, with the second in Chittagong on Jan 3-7. bd
