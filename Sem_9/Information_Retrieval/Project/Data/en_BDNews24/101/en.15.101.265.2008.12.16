 Suman Mahmud Chief Political Correspondent Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia has pledged to settle thorny issues in the parliament and avoid the politics of chaos and destruction if the four-party alliance is elected to office. "We have national parliament to resolve issues. Problems can be solved through discussion and we will create such atmosphere in the parliament," said Khaleda. She sought votes for the alliance candidates in several campaign rallies in the capital on Tuesday. Referring to election violence that spilled on the streets on Oct. 28 2006, she said, "Disagreements may be there in politics. "But it cannot be a solution to create disorder in the street with oars and sticks," she said in an apparent dig at the the Awami-League alliance's protest programmes. She said the election tide was in favour of the BNP-led alliance. Criticising the interim administration, the former premier said, "This government has pushed the country 20 years back. People from all walks of life suffered during this government. So they are joyful at the prospect of the Dec 29 election." "After 1/11, politicians were persecuted and bids were made to humiliate them. Businessmen were caught and sent into jails." "Conspiracies were afoot to brand Bangladesh as a dysfunctional state." Announcing herself against corruption, she said, "We were always against graft and terrorism. The Anticorruption Commission was formed during the tenure of BNP-led 4-party alliance government. No terrorists and corrupts must be exempted." Khaleda returned to Dhaka on Tuesday after touring the south-western region for two days' electioneering. She addressed public gatherings at Karwan Bazar in support of Mohammad Shahabuddin for Dhaka-11 seat and at Green Road Staff Quarters to seek ballots for advocate Mahbubuddin Ahmad for Dhaka-12 constituency. Khaleda laid floral wreaths at the National Memorial at Savar around 2:30pm. Upon arriving in Dhaka, she went to the late president Ziaur Rahman's grave and paid her respects. The BNP chief was scheduled to return to the capital on Monday after concluding her two days in the southwest, but heavy fog suspended a ferry crossing and she made an overnight stay at Rajbari Circuit House. During the two-day trip, Khaleda addressed a total of 22 public rallies at Manikganj, Rajbari, Kushtia, Chuadanga, Magura, Jessore, Khulna, Satkhira, Jessore and Bagerhat to seek votes on behalf of party candidates for different constituencies. The former prime minister launched her election campaign on Dec 12 by visiting the shrine of Shah Jalal in Sylhet. On Wednesday, Khaleda is scheduled to take her campaign to the north. bdnews24
