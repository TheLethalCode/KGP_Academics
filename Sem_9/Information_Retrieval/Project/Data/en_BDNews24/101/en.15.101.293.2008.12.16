 Dhaka, Dec 16 (bdnews24.com) - Army chief General Moeen U Ahmed on Tuesday said the military will be happy to be back in barracks as wished by the government. The army had come forward "in aid of civil power" on Dec 6, 2006 following the caretaker government's direction, he added. "Many, especially foreign diplomats, came to me and asked whether I was going to enforce martial law, but I replied in the negative," he said, explaining the uncertain situation in the country after full emergency was imposed on Jan 11, 2007. "I told them the Bangladesh Army will not follow its neighbours or its predecessors," the army chief said in a TV broadcast aired Tuesday. "There is a problem and it will be resolved politically. The caretaker government has appointed us and we've discharged the government directives. So we didn't step in," General Moeen said. The government has asked us to return, and we will be happy to be back in barracks, said the army chief.
