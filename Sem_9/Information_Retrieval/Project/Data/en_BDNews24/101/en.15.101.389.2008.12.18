<TEXT>
 Pradeep Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondent Satkhira, Dec 18 (bdnews24.com)  Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has said Muslims faced no problem in practising religion while Sheikh Hasina was in power for five years, in a sharp rebuttal of claims by the rivals of the Awami League chief. He asked people to be careful about the 'false, misleading statements' dished out by Jamaat-e-Islami, a key component in the BNP-led four-party alliance, that is playing the religion card. He debunked Jamaat's claims for the past several days that Muslims would not be allowed to sport beard, sacrifice animals, pray five times a day and call to prayer would no be heard in the mosques if the grand alliance went to power. "During my time in power I made Islam the state religion and Friday the weekly holiday," the former president, who governed the country for nine years from 1981, said at a rally at Shimulia Government Primary School ground in Satkhira. He sought vote for Awami League candidate AFM Ruhul Haque, who is running from Satkhira-3. "If the grand alliance goes to power it will ensure the right to religion of all people. This is not a matter of Hindu and Muslim. This is a fight for survival now. The grand alliance will have to win the battle." He also mentioned the initiatives his government had taken for Hindus including institution of Hindu Welfare Trust, declaring Janmashtami, the birthday of Lord Krishna, a public holiday and a freeze on the anti-Hindu Vested Property Act. The Jatiya Party chairman is set to address two other public rallies at Bhadrakali High School in Satkhira and HP Pilot High School in Shyam Nagar. Ershad will head for Khulna in the afternoon and is scheduled to address public meeting at Peoples Jute Mill. The former president spoke at seven public meetings on his way to Satkhira from Dhaka. In every meeting he claimed himself the older brother of Hasina and sought vote for 'grand alliance' candidates. Jatiya Party is running the Dec. 29 general election under the AL-led 'grand alliance'. bdne
