 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission has wrapped up its preparations for the ninth parliamentary election slated for Dec 29, asking returning officers to use a 'special code' for receiving and announcing election results, top ranking EC officials said on Saturday. The Commission also invited political partiers to see the precautionary measures including the code. On Sunday, chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda will brief the nation in a televised address on the preparations made and call upon the parties to observe the electoral rules. The CEC met with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed on Saturday to brief him on the preparations taken by the EC after he had inspected the last leg of the Commission's preparations. "All preparations have been made and the nation will be briefed on Sunday about the preparations," Huda told the chief adviser. The CEC instructed EC officials to observe caution about receiving the poll results. "You must see if the right persons sending the results, sometimes result sheets with fake signatures on could be faxed. You must be careful about results coming through phones, faxes and emails." Election Commission secretary Humayun Kabir said some 17 Commission officials have been assigned to collect primary and unofficial results based on the individual constituencies. Representatives of different political parties, numbers not disclosed though, will also be invited to the Commission at the time of announcement of results, he said. EC joint secretary Rafiqul Islam said, "This is the first time the Commission is using a 'special code' for the results." He said, "The code will be intimated to the officials on the election day and this will prevent fake results." A gigantic canopy is being prepared for the announcement of election results, he added. EC senior assistant secretary Farhad Ahmed Khan said counting will start immediately after the voting is over. Polling agents and the presiding officers will sign before the announcement at the centres and then results will pass through the assistant returning officers to the returning officers to announce the unofficial results which will then reach the EC.
