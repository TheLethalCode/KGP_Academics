 BAGHDAD, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A car bomb killed at least 22 people and wounded 54 more when it exploded at a Baghdad bus station on Saturday, a security official said. The bomb occurred in the Shi'ite district of Kadhimiya in northwestern Baghdad, where people typically gather at a major Shi'ite mosque on Saturdays, said Major-General Qassim Moussawi, spokesman for security operations in Baghdad. The U.S. military said the blast took place just after noon. Women and children were among those killed, police said. Violence has dropped sharply in Iraq over the past year, but car bombs, assassinations and other attacks still shake Baghdad and other parts of Iraq routinely. On December 17, successive bomb blasts in central Baghdad killed 18 people and wounded over 50.
