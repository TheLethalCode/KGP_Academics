<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath justified his inclusion with a superb six-wicket haul on Monday to put Sri Lanka on top against BCB XI in the lone warm-up three-dayers ahead of the two-Test series against Bangladesh. Sri Lanka were 36 for two at the close of the second day after bundling BCB XI out for a paltry 88 in 34.1 overs at the Bangladesh Krira Shikkha Protisthan ground. After the first day's play called off due to wet condition in the country's lone sports education institute in Savar, the start of the second day was also delayed by two and a half hours due to the same reason. Opting to bat first on the damp pitch, the hosts' batsmen found going tough. Pacer Chaminda Vaas made inroad in his second over, trapping opener Nafis Iqbal, who got out first ball, leaving the side at nine for one. Skipper Rajin Saleh lasted only 10 balls to make just one before being bowled by Vaas's new-ball partner Dhammika Prasad. Herath, named for the Test series in place of sensational spinner Ajantha Mendis eho is out injured, took over. He removed five batsmen in a row to wreck BCB XI middle before spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan cleaned the tail with two for six. Herath snared six for 16 in his devastating 11.1-over spell to dismiss Raqibul Hasan (19), top-scorer Imrul Kayes (26), Faisal Hossain Dickens (four), Mohammad Mithun (0), Mehrab Hossain Junior (three) and Saikat Ali (22). "It was difficult for the right-handed batsmen to face Herath, but not for the left-handed batsmen," said the left-handed batsman Mehrab. Mehrab said he himself and other left-handed batsmen such as Imrul and Faisal threw their wickets away. In reply, Sri Lanka also fell in trouble with opener Malintha Warnapurna and one-down Chamara Kapugedera returning to the dressing room before opening their accounts. Pacer Tareq Aziz Khan brought the first breakthrough for BCB XI, disturbing Warnapurna's stumps in the second over of the innings while Shahadat Hossain removed Kapugedera for a nine-ball duck. However, opener Michael Vandort and captain Mahela Jayawardene remained unbeaten on 17 and 14 when the bails were drawn for Day 2
