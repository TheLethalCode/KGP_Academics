<TEXT>
 Chittagong, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Sheikh Hasina, addressing a rally in Chittagong on Saturday, urged people to vote for the grand alliance to develop the country "in the spirit of 1971". "If the grand alliance goes to power then war criminals will be tried," she said at Laldighir Maidan. "Today, I am addressing the last rally before the election and I want to promise you a poverty-free Bangladesh." Sheikh Hasina also dismissed all threats on her life saying she will work endlessly for the country and with the last drop of her blood. Referring to the possibility of the use of black money prior to polls, the AL president asked the nation to be vigilant. "From today, other parties will start buying votes with black money," cautioned the former prime minister. "You have to decide if you want to sell your vote for 1,000 taka or have the chance to afford essentials for the next five years." "The four party government turned Bangladesh into a terrorist state. Vote for boat for a Bangladesh free of corruption," she urged. She promised to transform Chittagong into a commercial capital, with a suspension bridge over Karnaphuli River and modernisation of Chittagong Port. On her way to Dhaka, Sheikh Hasina addressed rallies at Comilla, Feni and Munshiganj. bdnews
