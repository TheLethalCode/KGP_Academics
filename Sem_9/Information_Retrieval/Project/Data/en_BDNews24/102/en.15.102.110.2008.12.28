<TEXT>
 Netrakona, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Grand alliance candidate from Jatiya Party Fakir Ashraf Saturday announced withdrawal in favour of Awami League candidate Ashraf Ali Khan Khoshru from Netrokona-2 constituency. "On Dec 1, Jatiya Party got 49 seats from the grand alliance. My name was announced as a candidate from Netrakona -2. Because of complexity over my nomination due to a court verdict, announcement was delayed by seven days for myself to be in the field," Fakir Ashraf explained. "Meanwhile, district AL general secretary Ashraf Ali Khan Khoshru went much ahead in his campaigning. Rivalry between the allied candidates from the same constituency gave rise to confusions and anger in the alliance resulting into a crisis". "So I made up my mind to back off in the greater interest of the grand alliance," Ashraf said at a press conference at his residence in Netrakona town on Saturday. Fakir Ashraf is a Jatiya Party central committee member.
