 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com) BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, speaking to reporters Sunday on the eve of the vote, said she was happy with the "media cooperation". "The support we had from mass media all along, we hope this will continue in the future," she told reporters at the National Press Club. However, the former prime minister has not been wholly appreciative of the press over the campaign period, at one point accusing the media of showing bias against her alliance. Khaleda said on Sunday, "Tomorrow is the election; I wish for everyone's prayer, so that I can serve the country in the future." She said of exchanging greetings with journalists on the day before election that she has been maintaining the tradition since 1991. Reporters wanted Khaleda's comment on vote rigging possibilities, election results, future plans, her feelings about the election campaign and what she would do if BNP comes to power. But the BNP chief declined to answer these questions just before the vote, as she felt replying was "not in line with the electoral code of conduct". Khaleda reminded the media of her campaign's theme, "Save the country, save the people." Shawkat Mahmud, president of the Press Club, and Kamal Uddin Sabuj, general secretary, greeted the former premier at the programme. Among others, president of Bangladesh Federal Journalists Union Ruhul Amin Gazi and former BFUJ president M Mozammel Haque were present. bdnews24.
