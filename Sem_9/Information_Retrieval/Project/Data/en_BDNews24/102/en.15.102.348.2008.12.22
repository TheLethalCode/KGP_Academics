 YOKOHAMA, Japan, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Manchester United's Club World Cup victory should provide the spark to ignite their so far mediocre domestic campaign, captain Rio Ferdinand said. The Premier League champions became the tournament's first British winners when a Wayne Rooney goal gave them a 1-0 victory over Ecuador's LDU in Sunday's final in Yokohama. Their mission in Japan complete, the newly crowned world champions face a tough turnaround with a visit to Stoke City in the Premier League on Dec. 26. Ferdinand admitted that losing to LDU after flying halfway around the world could have had a calamitous effect on their season. "Hopefully this sets a tone for the rest of the season," the defender told reporters. "We've been inconsistent up to now and tonight we played like the Manchester United of the last two years." Ferdinand credited a war cry from United manager Alex Ferguson for the side's refusal to buckle following defender Nemanja Vidic's red card for elbowing an opponent in the face early in the second half. "The manager's team talk hit the nail on the head," said Ferdinand. "I won't get into what he said but he got us into gear and that's the sign of a great manager. "Winning could be the turning point of the seasonfrom being quite mediocre results-wise to challenging for all the big titles. "Sometimes you need to be told the basics and we were reminded what got us here in the first place. Even great players need reminding and we've got a few of them in our squad." DREAM TREBLE After completing a dream treble of the English, European and world titles, United can ill afford a slip-up at Stoke or at home to Middlesbrough three days later as the fixtures pile up. "We have to make sure we get as much sleep as we can before Stoke," said Rooney, named player of the tournament after scoring twice in the 5-3 semi-final win over Japan's Gamba Osaka. "We've got to try and deal with it as best we can. We worked hard for the win. I'm sure our fans will be really pleased to be supporting the best team in the world." The Club World Cup has traditionally been viewed with scepticism in Britain and the $5 million United earned for winning is loose change for the "Red Devils". However, Ferguson defended the seven-team competition, insisting it had merit and would give his team an important psychological lift. "To be world champions in December is a huge mid-season boost," said the Scot. "It gives us a platform to start playing with real purpose and chase the (Premier League) leaders." United lie fourth in the league with 32 points from 16 games, seven points behind leaders Liverpool with two games in hand
