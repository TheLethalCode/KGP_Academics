<TEXT>
 Sylhet, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia on Monday played the religion card as she urged voters to save the country and Islam by voting BNP-led four-party alliance to power in the general elections next week. "Save the country and Islam through voting the four-party alliance. Don't vote for those who defamed the religion," she said at an election campaign rally at Sylhet Alia Madrasa ground in the afternoon. "You'll have to pay the price if you commit any mistake in the Dec. 29 election. The country will be saved if you vote for a patriotic power. On the other hand, the country will be insecure under the hand of those who want to sell the country off." Khaleda reached Sylhet at around 2:00pm to take back her election campaign to northeastern city. The former prime minister kicked off her campaign at the Sylhet shrines on Dec. 12, but she returned to the town this time to canvass for BNP candidate former finance minister M Saifur Rahman for Sylhet-1 constituency. The four-party chief alleged, "A conspiracy is on against Bangladesh to make it a fundamentalist state. The conspirators in connivance with the foreigners want to ruin the country." "Some parties and alliances have been hatching plots to make Bangladesh aa fundamentalist country. Even false propaganda was conducted in foreign magazines." "I want to make it clear that Bangladesh is not a fundamentalist state; its people are devout and secular. People of all religion can peaceful co-exist here," Khaleda said. Those who have been hatching plots want the country to become another country's market and install a puppet government here, she alleged. About fighting terrorism and militancy, the former prime minister said, "The four-party alliance government had established RAB to fight terrorism and militancy." In an apparent swipe at the Anticorruption Commission for recently revealing corruption of her younger son Arafat Rahman Coco, she alleged that real corrupts were not being captured, but many are being held under graft charges in a bid to make the country devoid of leader. "That's why this election is so important. So, you'll have take the right decision." Khaleda sought vote for Saifur. "Our Saifur Rahman was always with the development endeavour in Sylhet, but now he has become older. I seek vote for him for one last time." She promised a modern educational institute in Sylhet and measures to make Sylhet a modern city if the four-party alliance was elected. She repeated the allegation that the rival grand allaince was not acted against for what she said was breach of election code of conduct. She claimed no development had taken place in the country in past two years of caretaker government rule. "The caretaker government has taken the country 20 years back in its two years." "The government has made the whole country a jail." Khaleda spoke at another rally at Kuttapara High School in Sorail, Bramhanbaria on her way to Dhaka from Sylhet. The former prime minister will start another two-day tour on Tuesday of Comilla, Chandpur, Noakhali, Laxmipur and Feni districts. Khaleda started from her Dhaka Cantonment home at around 10am, reaching Sylhet around 2pm, and was accompanied on the trip by BNP vice president Sarwari Rahman and Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish chief Maulana Mohammed Ishaq. On her way back to Dhaka, Khaleda addressed a number of public gatherings at Moulavibazar, Brahmanbaria and Narsingdi. The former prime minister returned to Dhaka early on Monday after visitng the central districts of Munshiganj, Barisal, Faridpur and Madaripur. bd
