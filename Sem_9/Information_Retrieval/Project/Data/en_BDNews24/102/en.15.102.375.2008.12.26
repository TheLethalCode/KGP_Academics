 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  The navy has protested the intrusion of three Indian survey ships into Bangladesh's territorial waters in the Bay of Bengal, but those have refused to leave, the foreign ministry said on Friday. "We've confirmed that one survey vessel backed by two navy ships has intruded into our waters," foreign secretary Touhid Hossain said to bdnews24.com on Friday. "We've already lodged a ship-to-ship protest, but the Indian vessel has refused to leave the place," he added. Both Bangladesh and India claim the waters, but until the dispute is settled no-one can carry out exploration works there, according to international law. Bangladesh will move diplomatically to persuade the Indian ships back. The foreign secretary said, "We will file a diplomatic protest note today [Friday] or tomorrow [Saturday]" to get the Indian vessels to go away. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury said the government was running an inquiry. "We are investigating the situation and will take actions as deemed necessary based on the result of the inquiry," he told bdnews24.com. The Indian High Commission was not available for comment due to holiday on Friday. The Indian ships illegally entered Bangladesh territorial waters to carry out mineral exploration activities on Thursday night. The Bangladesh Navy frigate 'Khalid bin Walid' was dispatched to the spot on Thursday night and asked the Indian ships to back off, said one maritime official declining to be named. "Three Indian survey vessels started seismic survey activities some 140 nautical miles southwest off Mongla seaport. "Right after detection of the Indian ships, frigate Khalid bin Walid went there and asked them to leave Bangladesh territorial waters," said the official. The official added that battleship BNS Meghla was also heading to the place from Chittagong port. High officials of navy and coastguards have held an urgent meeting, the official said. The Indian intrusion took place in less two months of Myanmar sending vessels and equipment to carry out the exploration in the disputed waters of the Bay of Bengal, some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island on Nov. 2. bdnews2.
