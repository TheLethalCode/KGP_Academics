 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury told the Dhaka-based diplomats on Monday the interim government needed to work with the incoming elected government to legalise the actions taken during its tenure. The adviser admitted that the ninth parliamentary polls were at "crossroads", but Fakhruddin Ahmed's government had overcome the perceived obstacles to the polls. He also said some reform measures initiated by the caretaker government did not succeed, but one of its successes was to hold the general elections for restoration of democracy. "We hope the transition, following elections, will be smooth," the adviser said to diplomats in his written speech at a briefing at the foreign ministry. "You are aware that unlike presidential system we do not have transition teams. "Yet there is a palpable need for the current government to work with the next one at least to ensure the continuity and validity of some of its actions including the many ordinances it has promulgated," said Iftekhar. "We hope this can be done." But the adviser did not talk to media on this issue. Validation of the interim administration's actions is considered crucial since the non-party caretaker government was supposed to last for only three months as per the article 123 of the constitution. But Fakhruddin's caretaker government will be in office for almost two years -- from Jan. 12, 2007 to Dec 31, 2008. Besides, the caretaker government took many policy decisions without constitutional mandate. According to the constitution, the caretaker government cannot take any policy decision. Following the meeting, dean of the diplomatic corps and Swiss ambassador Dora Rapold told reporters, "We have no doubt in mind regarding the Dec. 29 polls". Iftekhar said the interim government had initiated some reform measures before Bangladesh's return to a "sustainable democracy". "Of course, we did not succeed in everything we set out to do. "Most importantly, however, we were able to guide the events towards the elections and democratic transition. "To be honest, there were times when we were at crossroads," he said. "On the roadmap to elections, we have now crossed all major milestones and are on the last leg. From now on, it is all systems go." The adviser told the diplomats and heads of the international organisations about his ministry's success since Jan. 12, 2007. "This ministry, I am proud to say, has been deeply involved with some of the institutions-building activities, particularly the signing of the UN Anti-corruption Convention and the setting up of the National Human Rights Commission," the adviser said. US ambassador James F Moriarty, British high commissioner Stephen Evans, German ambassador Frank Meyke, France ambassador Charley Causeret, Australian high commissioner Douglas Foskett and other mission heads or their deputies were present at the briefing. Monday's meeting was the sixth of such type since the caretaker administration took office last year. bdn
