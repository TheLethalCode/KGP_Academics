<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Finance and planning adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Wednesday listed 16 challenges ahead for the incoming government to keep the momentum in the economy going. "The next government should take proper measures to address the challenges ahead," Mirza Aziz said at a news conference at the National Economic Council conference hall. He advised it to use the money saved off fuel subsidies after the price fall in the international markets. "Macroeconomic base is adequately strong now and a over six percent GDP is achievable in the 2008-9 financial year," the adviser said. "Other main indices including price inflation are staying below two digits over the last few months, local and foreign investments, export earnings, remittance flow, revenue incomes are all positive." The political government should raise production to address the world economic crisis, strengthen measures to implement ADP to achieve GDP target, increase investment in power and fuel sectors, continue programmes under social security chain in FY 2009-10, raise income tax and VAT and exlpore other internal resources avenues, and balance incomes and expenses of FY 2008-9. It should continue allocations for the human resources and information technology as priority sectors, consider infusing more capital machinery and investment-friendly policies to accelerate growth and strengthen tax administration, raise funds to minimise losses caused by climate change, up government investments in the backward areas, invest the money saved from the fuel subsidies, and boost skills to reduce losses in the public sectors. The other challenges include establishing public-private partnership to adjust prices, keeping taka competitive at a level suitable for the Bangladeshi commodities to compete in the international markets, cutting investment in the unproductive sectors and pouring money into the productive sectors, continuing with reforms in the financial sector specially in the nationalised banks and strengthening their managerial skills and modernising the share market with more regulatory control. "We are yet to feel the pinch of the global crisis but we will, if it prolongs," the adviser said. "Government investments must increase to face it off." Mirza Aziz said the biggest block to the development is power sector, therefore, "whoever takes office will have to raise power production." He admitted his failure in bridling prices. "If we could achieve 7-8 percent GDP, the price inflation would go down to 5-6 percent." Asked about the reason for the extremely high prices, Aziz attributed the hike to international markets and two floods and cyclone Sidr. Finance secretary Mohammad Tarek, Bangladesh Bank governor Salehuddin Ahmed, planning secretary Zafar Ahmed Chowdhury, NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid and ERD secretary Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan, among others, were present. bd
