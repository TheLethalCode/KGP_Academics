 Jhenaidah, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  'Outlawed' extremist parties have not been seen active in the southwest ahead of elections this time, as police have taken strict measures and maintained "good vigilance", say Khulna law enforcers. "They will not be able to resurface," says Khulna deputy inspector general of police Md Asaduzzaman Mian, of the banned militant groups which surfaced ahead of previous polls. "Their organisational base has been shattered due to RAB and police operations. Armed encounters with RAB and police have left dead more than 400 extremist leaders of the Khulna division," he told bdnews24.com. Director of RAB-12, Lt Col Md Zillur Rahman said, "We have no fresh information about activities of extremist groups." "In the past, extremists came out before polls and threatened ordinary people to vote for their preferred candidates, but this time the situation is different," he observed. This year, 'top leaders' of Purbo Banglar Communist Party, Biplobi Communist Party, Communist Juddho, Jhinaidah and other militant groups have been killed in RAB-police 'crossfire' in southwestern districts. Chief of Purbo Bangla Communist Party, Dr Mizanur Rahman (Tutul) and Jhinaidah chief Roni Biswas were among them. With the killing of the top guns, second level leaders have become terrified and gone underground, say local law enforcers. Though 'the arsenals' of the parties remain, no one has dared to take over, they say. "The clandestine parties have no activities at all and they are absent from electoral programmes," said one official, declining to be named. bdnews24.com/corres
