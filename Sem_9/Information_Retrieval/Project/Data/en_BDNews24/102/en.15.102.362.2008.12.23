 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Anticorruption Commission on Monday dismissed the BNP's allegation that the news about the money laundering by former prime minister Khaleda Zia's younger son Arafat Rahman Coco was meant to equip the political rivals with a weapon ahead of the general elections. "Not motivated by any purpose, the ACC has gathered information that Arafat Rahman Coco has illegal money amassed in a Singapore bank," ACC chairman Hasan Moshud Chowdhury said. On Thursday the ACC said it had information on the deposit of about Tk 11.5 crore lying in his name with a foreign bank. On the following day, the BNP lodged a protest saying the ACC gave "a sword in the hands of the opponents on the eve of the election." "The allegation is concocted," BNP statement claimed. Asked whether the allegation was brought against a party on the eve of the election, Hasan Mashhud replied in the negative. "After a prolonged enquiry, the ACC became hundred percent sure about the fact. There is nothing to be surprised if Siemens is involved in the matter of Coco." He further said, "The ACC is looking into the money laundering case as an acid test. This is for the first time that, through the mutual legal assistance request under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, this information was unearthed. "We believe it will be possible to file a case in this connection in a few days". Asked if his comment, as many including a leading lawyer fear, could affect the election, the ACC chairman said, "Everyone in the country is free to express their views. But Anticorruption Commission is not an electoral body and that political activities will be affected due to the operations of the commission is not acceptable." He further said, "On demand by the Bangladesh government, the attorney general of Singapore gave this information on money laundering on September 30. After a wide enquiry, the ACC became certain about it. Besides, we have waited for sometime since there was a case filed against Siemens in the USA." Hasan Mashhud said, "The comment that the activities of the commission is being directed against the innocent persons is not correct. Saying so points to a bid to damage the image of the Anticorruption Commission." He further said, "We have come to know that the [Coco] has appointed a leading lawyer so that the money of the frozen account cannot be returned to the country." The commission gave journalists a brief account of the ACC activities in a year and also the state of the present cases. ACC director general Hanif Iqbal on Dec 18 informed the media that some Tk 11.5 crore was lying with a foreign bank in the name of Coco and that account had been frozen. He said the information on the money was available through search by the Mutual Legal Assistance Request of the United Nations Convention against Corruption. On demand by the Bangladesh government, the office of the Singapore attorney general sent the information to Dhaka recently. Iqbal had told the journalists that the process to get the money back was on. The ACC said Coco and some of his cohorts in Singapore set up a company called Jaas on April 10, 2004. A huge amount of Singaporean dollars was transacted with Jaas by the China Harbour Engineering. "In the transaction cheques signed by Arafat Rahman were used." ACC decided to follow legal suit in the matter of the frozen amount of 20.61 lakh Singaporean dollars and 2.615 lakh US dollars on the basis of the bank statement of transcation by Arafat Rahman. BNP joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan on Dec 18 told a press conference that "a sword was handed to BNP's opponents through this briefing of the ACC." Besides, on Dec 20, leading lawyer Rafique-ul-Huq called it baseless and politically motivated. "By making disclosure of money laundering, the ACC director general has violated the election code of conduct and he should be punished for that," Huq said. bdnews24.c
