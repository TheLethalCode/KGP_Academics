 Abdur Rahim Harmachhi, bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - The Begunbarhi-Hatirjheel development project cost has increased Tk 420 crore because of essential land acquisition, inflating the total expenditure to Tk 1,900 crore. The annual development programme for the FY 2008-09 also has been amended and necessary sectoral allocation increased to accommodate the additional spending. The land acquisition allocation enhancement proposal was approved by the National Economic Council at a meeting on Monday with chief adviser Fakhruddin Ahmed in the chair. At a press conference held after the meeting, finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam said the project expense had increased as land acquisition is costing more. Azizul said, "An increase of Tk 420 crore required for completing land acquisition for Hatirjheel project has extended the expenditure line to touch Tk 1, 894 crore. As per rules, NEC reviewed and endorsed this change in the ADP sectoral allocation." Asked if the BGMEA Bhaban built in the Begunbarhi canal will be demolished to accomplish the project implementation properly, the finance adviser said, "The ministries will take necessary measures." In the recent past, more than one advisers have emphatically announced that all 'illegally built' structures will be pulled down. Asked whether the Hatirjheel project implementation will be hampered by the presence of the BGMEA Bhaban, land allotted to FBCCI and other business organisations when an elected government will be in power soon, he rejoined, "I don't think any government would like to see development of the capital impeded at any cost." The adviser commented that the project might be abandoned in case any government considered it useless. The 'Integrated development of Hatirjheel and Begunbarhi canal zone' working paper presented in the NEC meeting highlighted that another 35 acres of private land close to the project bounds needed to be acquired for proper implementation of the total work. The press conference was told that 245 acres of land would be acquired for implementing the Hatirjheel-Begunbarhi project to accommodate a circular road skirting the lake, two overpasses and walkways converting the site into an idyllic recreation complex. The NEC meeting on Monday was followed by a meeting of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council. The finance adviser told reporter that there would be another ECNEC meeting prior to the Dec. 29 polls. bdnews24.
