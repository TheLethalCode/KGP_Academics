 Comment on this piece or post your own at blog.bdnews24.com Towheed Feroze Okay, the papers say that the nation is poised for a historic vote. As far as we can see, the polling will be free from major 'suspicious' elements. And, I am willing to go with that. In fact, whatever the result and whichever party emerges as winners, few should be able to question the accountability of the election this time as far as the voter roll goes. None of the major political parties are in a position to fool around with voter IDs and, hopefully, no one is going to come out of the polling station with a bewildered expression and the question: Amar vote gelo koi? (What happened to my vote?) In real life, one of my friends once travelled all the way to his village only to find that his vote had already been cast. ''Arey bhai, this is auto vote,'' he was told and my friend was so offended that he thought it better to drive a taxi in Sydney than stay here. "Auto gear is far better than auto vote,'' he tells me. Well, as the nation prepares for a historic election, one can look back at the many irregularities that have been electoral mainstays in the past. Though this writer spent a good number of years of the nineties in the UK, by some twist of fate he found himself in Bangladesh right before elections and hence, the following pre-poll observances. First, I must remember my 'parato' friend (friend because we were neighbours) S.K who began his teenage years as a footballer in the first division but soon changed to something more profitable  Rongbaazi or the profession of political terrorism. One day, SK came up to me and said, 'asho maaal dekhai' (come, I shall show you an item) and my hopes of seeing the latest ADIDAS boots were punctured as he took out a gleaming silver pistol. 'Panish' he said and as I was trying to rummage through my brains for a gun brand that sounded like the male organ, it hit me that he meant 'Spanish'. By the way, S.K never went to school but since both of us played ball there was a connection and our conversations almost always involved boots, practice sessions, jerseys and game dissection of the FA. 'Jinishta kemon?' (How is the thing?) He asked, and I had to admit that it was something special. Khali koiba kare ki koron lagbo? (Just tell me who needs to be taught a lesson) S.K said and made remarkable a sound with his mouth. Later, of course the sound gave way to the usage of very colourful language like 'size koira de', (will bring him down to size) 'system koira de' (put him in the system), 'bhitre bhoira de' (send him inside) and the most common 'falae de' (put him down). As the election approached, SK and his mates were in full campaigning action. In the area, another young lad named Sujan soon rose to prominence due to his gun toting action in Dhaka College. Sujan, unlike SK, was an educated lad, with good looks but then politics got to him and sucked him into its vortex of power, paranoia and a pathetic end. But, like some leading politicians in Bangladesh, these ward based leaders never pledged allegiance to any particular party. For them it had to be a link with the party in power and so, when the government changed and I met SK, I was little prepared for the line he delivered, "party change, amago dol change" (with the change of party our 'link' has also changed). But then, I did not blame him because the politicians who used young people like him to do all the dirty work were no different. Interestingly, the candidate of the area came around for a visit flanked by the ward commissioner, who could not finish a sentence without resorting to a swear word. By the way, until that day we had never seen either of them in the past. But that day, they were like God's angels on earth going around talking to women as if they were his long lost relatives. They were, of course accompanied by the field level soldiers and the latter carried 'machines' (pronounced maachin) and the campaign of a better tomorrow went along with promises of peace and prosperity. "Pistols and peace, doesn't that sound contradictory?" I asked SK and he replied, "Arey rakho mian, politics manei pistol," (politics means pistol). Well, SK was definitely far away from the guy who was obsessed with Puma boots. Soon, another person emerged in the scene and I was told that he is called 'Kaala Jashim' (Black Jashim) and if you have followed local politics you will know that certain epithets are used to make a name sound more dangerous. And hence, we had Gal Kaata Kamal (Kamal with a cut on his cheek), Kaan chara Jamal (Jamal without an ear) and Murgi Milon (Milon the chicken). Of course, Milon was no chicken and got the name because once upon a time he used to sell chickens in the Hatirpool area. Interestingly, though I have no hair, I never got the name 'chul chara Towheed' (Towheed without the hair). Maybe, for that I needed to take out my grandfather's Greener&Greener, saw off the barrel and carry it with me. That gun is licensed by the way! "But, he was such a nice fellow; gave me the best chicken all the time," my grandmother said and refused to believe that Murgi Milon was now capable of cutting other things apart from chicken. To end, here is a very interesting encounter that I had just prior to one previous election. As I was standing outside on the road, I noticed a lot of activity and soon, a few guys came running shouting, "Bichi, bichi" and I wondered what was going on. Soon, the mystery was solved as it transpired that Bichi is the local word for bullets. One guy even came up to me and asked 'asey ni chorra?' (Do you have LG bullets?) Anyway, thankfully no one got shot though prior to polls these scenes became quite common. This year, the scene is so different. I have to say no one is shouting 'Bichi, bichi' anymore and I am not called at ungodly hours to check out someone's latest machine. In fact, there is no one to call me anymore. Sujan was killed in 2002 when, reportedly, a gun dealer pumped a dozen bullets in him and, naturally you want to know about S.K, my childhood football buddy, who later went astray. Well, SK's nickname was Polash and during his gaye holud before his wedding, he had a huge cake ordered. According to the ritual, all guests will have to take a morsel of the cake, feed it to the bridegroom and apply turmeric on his head. So, my turn came and as I moved forward, my eyes were on the cake which was already cut. The cake read Polasher Gaye Holud and someone had cut off the Po and the rest read, lasher gaye holud which means the gaye holud of a dead body. It was disturbing, but I let it pass. Just a few months later, S.K was shot and killed. Anyway, Elephant Road is a peaceful area now and people are talking of a democratic government after a proper election though one guy couldn't help saying, "It will take some time to get used to this 'painsha' (insipid) election." Well, I am happy because no one is carrying a machine. However, the machine might make a comeback if the next government is not strict in controlling armed politics. Somehow, the line from Terminator comes back to haunt me: I'll be back! The author is assistant news editor at bdnews24.com.
