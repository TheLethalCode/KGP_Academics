 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  The grand alliance is hopeful of winning almost 200 out of 299 seats in the parliamentary election on Monday. "We will secure nearly 200 seats," predicted co-chairman of the Awami League Election Steering Committee HT Imam Sunday evening, just hours before the vote. His comment came after a meeting between a team from the USA based organisation National Democratic Institute (NDI) and AL president Sheikh Hasina at the former prime minister's Sudha Sadan residence. Answering a question on whether AL alone or the grand alliance will win in 200 seats, the AL leader said: "The alliance." The seven member NDI envoy was headed by former ambassador Howard B Schaffer. "We want a good government and a responsible opposition here. We hope everybody will accept the polls result and the opposition party will behave responsible." Earlier in the day, Imam had said AL was hopeful of winning Monday's elections with more than the absolute majority. Imam however expressed some concerns, including violations of electoral law "money being spent to buy votes in many areas." The AL is happy with the voter list and the translucent ballot boxes, he said, "but in many areas voters may be stopped from voting in the face of threat and terrorism", he further observed. bdnews2
