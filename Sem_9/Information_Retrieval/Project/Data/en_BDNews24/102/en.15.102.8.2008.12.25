 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Thursday said she wanted an accountable government to come to power through the general election on Dec. 29. "We want the people of the country to be able to vote for their chosen candidate and we want that the next government will be an accountable one," she said at an election campaign rally in Nawabganj Pilot High School in the capital. "I love the people of the country. I want to serve them," she added. Hasina also unleashed a personal attack on her rival BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, who, she said, could not pass the matriculation exams and whose younger son Arafat Rahman Coco had tarnished the country's image by siphoning money abroad. Hasina pledged to develop the local weaving industry, communication systems with Dhaka City, construct dams, and dredging for the river Dahar. She introduced the AL candidate Abdul Mannan Khan for Dhaka-1 constituency and sought vote for him. Earlier in the afternoon, addressing another election campaign rally in Lalbagh, Hasina warned that people must be given the chance to vote without fear for the candidate of their choice. "You will vote for the person of your choice and attempts to prevent you will not be tolerated," she said. "This is an election where peace, development and security are pitted against terrorism, corruption and militancy." Pointing to the AL's arch-rival BNP, she said, "It is their nature to unleash terror and for that everyone needs to be on the alert. "In the last election, they stuffed one crore extra voters in the list but this time these fake names have been deleted from the new photo-based voter list." Mostafa Jalal Mahiuddin is the AL candidate for Dhaka-7. She thanked the caretaker government and the military for the photo-based voter list. "This list will be a milestone for the nation." The former prime minister took a swipe at BNP candidate Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu for the Dhaka-7 seat. "All of you know the BNP candidate and his past. In 1994, after the mayoral election, murders were committed in Lalbagh at his orders." "You have to decide if you will vote him or for a gentleman like Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin." After 2001, there has not been any development in the Lalbagh area and the promised water treatment plant did not see the light of day, the AL chief remined her audience. At the rally city AL president MA Aziz, acting general secretary Kamrul Islam and AL's deputy campaign secretary Asim Kumar Ukil were present. bdnews24.c
