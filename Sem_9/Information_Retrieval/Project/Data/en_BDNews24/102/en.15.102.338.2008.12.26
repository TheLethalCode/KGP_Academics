<TITLE> Price, poverty top Hasina's Paltan speech </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina sought votes on Friday at a huge rally at Paltan with renewed pledges to rein in runaway prices, cut poverty, and bring about a digital revolution in Bangladesh by 2021. "Vote for boat and we will reduce poverty in the country, take necessary steps to increase education rate and create a digital Bangladesh by 2021, when we will celebrate the golden jubilee of the country," she said in an echo of the party's election manifesto rolled out at the launch of the campaign. She also promised access up to undergraduate studies free of cost. "To free the country from plunderers, vote for boat," Hasina told her audience in the speech broadcast live by TV and radio networks. Hasina stood behind a bulletproof glass screen in the wake of alleged threats in the last few days to her life. Taking a swipe at her bitter rival, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, Hasina said she had legalised unaccounted-for, ill-gotten money. "When a prime minister whitens her black money, then by which means other than corruption did it come?" She alleged the BNP-led four-party alliance was trying to exploit religion for political edge--doing business using religion as capital. "But Islam is a religion of peace. It does not allow such hypocrisy," she said. Hasina said the people of the country had suffered much during past seven years because of the runaway prices of essentials and endemic corruption by the BNP-Jamaat-e-Islami coalition government. "If Awami League is voted to power, we will curb the prices of essentials and fight corruption," Hasina said. She said her 1996-2001 administration had bought MiG-29 fighter planes, frigates and sophisticated arms for the military to protect sovereignty of the country. And yet, Hasina said, she had been charged with corruption for buying the MiGs and frigates. "They allege that independence and sovereignty will be at stake if Awami League goes to power. But we bought those to protect sovereignty." Referring to the recent intrusion of Myanmar's ships into Bangladesh's territorial waters, Hasina asked, "How would the sovereignty of the country have been protected had it not for those frigates? "I cannot help but laugh when I see [BNP's] manifesto, which says 'save the country, save the people. "Rather, they should say 'kill the people, plunder public wealth, sell the country off and siphon money abroad' as these go with their grain." The BNP-led government had laid electric poles, but not added a single megawatt to the national grid, she said. That was how, she alleged, they had embezzled money sanctioned for the power sector. She promised to hike power production. "To the young voters, I would like to say that we will establish a digital Bangladesh by the year 2021, when we will celebrate the golden jubilee of our independence." The advantages of modern information and communication technology will be spread to every villages of the country. Hasina introduced the AL candidates in different constituencies in the capital and sought vote for them. bdnews2
