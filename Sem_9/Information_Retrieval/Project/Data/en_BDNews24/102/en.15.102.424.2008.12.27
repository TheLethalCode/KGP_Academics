 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Regretting "past mistakes" BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia, in a televised speech Saturday evening, promised if elected that her alliance would not repeat those mistakes and would make curbing prices the number one task. "We made mistakes  for which we are sincerely sorry and hope that you will forgive our failures and mistakes," said the two-time former prime minister. "We request you to believe that we won't repeat them as we've learned from past mistakes." Stern actions against corruption and terrorism, and transforming parliament into an effective institution will also get priority, she said. Khaleda's recorded speech was aired on state-owned Bangladesh Television and Radio at around 9:15pm, immediately following one by her rival Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina. "I firmly promise today that we'll be tough on corruption and terror and no concessions will be given to the corrupt or terrorists," said Khaleda. "Our first task will be to quickly bring the prices down to people's reach, then to raise output by reducing production costs, if necessary, with subsidies so that people get essentials like rice, lentil, flour, edible oil at reasonable prices." The former prime minister also promised measures to make parliament more effective. Referring to her election manifesto, Khaleda said: "A deputy speaker will be chosen from the opposition and the speaker and the deputy speaker will have to resign from their respective parties immediately after assuming office." "We'll also choose heads of different parliamentary committees from among the opposition members." "Once elected we'll reform the warrant of precedence to dignify the opposition leader over all ministers, second to the prime minister," the former prime minister and opposition leader said. "We'll also take initiatives to achieve national consensus by taking counsel of the opposition leader, and make efforts to achieve the target both in and outside parliament," Khaleda said. She urged the citizens of the country to join hands with the BNP for protecting the country's democracy and sovereignty. Khaleda's electioneering drew to a close with her TV address with all campaigning concluded by midnight. The two former prime ministers had earlier addressed the two largest rallies of the campaign period on consecutive days, Friday and Saturday at Paltan Maidan. bdnew
