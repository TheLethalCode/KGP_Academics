 ISLAMABAD, Fri Dec 26,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Pakistan's army has canceled leave and ordered troops to report to duty because of tension with old rival India over last month's militant attacks in Mumbai, a military official and soldiers said on Friday. Tension has escalated between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India since 179 people were killed in a militant assault on several places in India's financial hub that India has blamed on Pakistan-based militants. "Leave has been canceled because of the situation. All soldiers have been asked to report to duty," said a military official who declined to be identified. Pakistan's military spokesman was not available for comment but several soldiers confirmed that orders had gone out calling soldiers back from leave. Pakistan has condemned the Mumbai attacks, denied any role in the assault and offered to cooperate with India in investigations, but at the same time it has warned that its desire for peaceful coexistence should not be taken as weakness. India has put a pause on a five-year-old peace process that Pakistan had been trying to push forward. Indian officials have said they were keeping all options open, comments the Indian media have widely interpreted to mean that a military response was possible. Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from British rule in 1947 and went to the brink of a fourth after an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001 also blamed on Pakistan-based militants. Most analysts believe the tension is unlikely to descend into war but some residents of the Pakistani part of the divided Kashmir region are taking no chances and have been digging bunkers by their homes. "The situation has got worse and if one is to believe the statements coming from New Delhi, the days of peace seem to be numbered," said civil servant Haji Mansoor in the town of Chakothi, as workmen dug a bunker beside his house. "ANY EVENTUALITY" Chakothi is next to the so-called Line of Control, a ceasefire line from an earlier war that divides Kashmir between the rivals, and is well within range of Indian guns. "We are preparing ourselves to meet any eventuality," said Mansoor. In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistani Kashmir, civil defense staff and volunteers have been preparing equipment and conducting drills. Some Pakistani media reported troop movements from Pakistan's western border with Afghanistan, where soldiers are battling al Qaeda and Taliban militants, to its eastern border with India. But military officials and the government's top Interior Ministry official, Rehman Malik, denied that, saying there was no movement of troops from the northwest and operations against militants were continuing. The redeployment of Pakistani troops from the Afghan border to the frontier with India would give a free hand to militants operating in remote enclaves in the northwest and would deal a blow to US-led efforts to bring stability to Afghanistan. Pakistani leaders have repeatedly said they do not want war but the country would fight if war was imposed upon it. Former president and army chief Pervez Musharraf said the armed forces were capable of defending the country. "We have the ability and capacity to defend Pakistan," Musharraf told reporters in a rare public appearance as he arrived at the wedding of a former government minister's son and a sitting minister's daughter
