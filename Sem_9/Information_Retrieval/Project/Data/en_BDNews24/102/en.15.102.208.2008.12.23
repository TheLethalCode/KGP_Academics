 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Some 68,000 prisoners enrolled as voters this year, and more than five lakh election officials, may not be able to exercise their rights by postal ballot, say officials. The list of eligible voters from 67 prisons was submitted and according to the system, they should be able to vote through postal ballot, said deputy inspector prisons (headquarters) Commander Zakaria Khan on Tuesday. "But, the final decision on the matter will be taken by the EC," he added. But election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told bdnewe24.com that the applications for postal ballots were not made according to rule. "Due to the delay in application, it will not be able to print the ballot papers in time, it will not be possible for prisoners to vote," he said. Sakhawat added that all ballot printing should be completed two days before the election. The election official, however, deemed the enlistment of prison inmates as voters and the issuance of National ID Cards in their names as "two great achievements". According to rule, applications need to be made to returning officers for postal ballots within 15 days of the declaration of the electoral schedule, said Forhad Ahmed Khan, EC senior assistant secretary. "If the rule is not followed then taking votes via postal ballot becomes impossible." Meanwhile, Sakhawat also said that hundreds of thousands of officials on duty during the election will not be able to vote either. Speaking in this regard, EC deputy secretary Mihir Sarwar said, "Due to time constraint and failure to apply for postal ballot privileges within the stipulated time, most officials will not be able to vote." Some 35,216 presiding officers, 177,107 assistant presiding officers and 354,214 polling officers will be on duty during the 9th parliamentary election, with voting to take place on Dec 29. "The Election Commission will begin supplying ballot papers and concomitant electoral equipment to six divisions of the country from December 24," said Sarwar. He added that the printing of ballot papers will be completed by December 26. bdnew
