 YEVPATORIA, Ukraine,Thu Dec 25,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - An explosion ripped through an apartment building in southern Ukraine, killing 19 people, including two children, and 24 were unaccounted for, officials said on Thursday. Twenty-one residents have been pulled out alive from the five-storey block in the Black Sea resort of Yevpatoria in the Crimea peninsula, Emergencies Ministry spokesman Ihor Krol said earlier in the day. He said at least 24 people were missing. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko arrived in the town to meet rescue officials. President Viktor Yushchenko was due to arrive later. The cause of the explosion on Wednesday night had not yet been established but it was "quite possible that there had been containers with oxygen or acetylene stored in the building," said the spokesman. Officials said the blast sent concrete cascading down on two entrances to the building. "As I was walking by, I heard a bang, and then I saw this building crumble," an eye-witness told Ukraine's Channel 5 television. Television footage of the rescue efforts showed exposed living rooms and several collapsed floors through a gaping hole in the building's facade. Some 700 Emergencies Ministry workers were excavating the rubble in close to freezing temperatures, looking for survivors. From time to time, they paused in silence, and incoming mobile phone calls were heard from under huge piles of the debris, Channel 5 said. Cranes were being used in the rescue efforts. A total of some 90 machines were working at the scene. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev offered his condolences to the relatives of the dead. Russians make up over half the population of Crimea, an autonomous region which used to belong to Russia. Medvedev said Russia's Black Sea Fleet, stationed in the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol and at the center of a diplomatic spat between Moscow and Kiev during the summer, was ready to assist in the rescue efforts. Casualties caused by gas blasts in often crumbling apartment buildings are common occurrences in former Soviet republics, particularly in winter when residents use more heating. One such blast in October 2007 killed 15 residents in Ukraine's central city of Dnipropetrovsk
