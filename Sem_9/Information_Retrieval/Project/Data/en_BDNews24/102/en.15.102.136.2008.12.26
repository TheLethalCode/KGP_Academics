<TEXT>
 Syedpur, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com) Jatiya Party chairman Hussain Muhammad Ershad warned on Friday that "looters" would come back to power if the 'boat-plough row' in some constituencies was not ended. "An unresolved boat-plough dispute could let the miscreants come to power again," said the former president who has been urging Awami League to withdraw its candidates from 'JP seats'. JP was given some 46 seats in a seat-sharing deal under the AL-led grand alliance, though in several of those constituencies candidates of both parties are still contesting. Speaking at Syedpur rally on Friday, Ershad pledged to support Qoumi (non-government) madrasas if the grand alliance came to power. "The Qoumi madrasas will get government recognition if we are voted to power," Ershad said pointing out that former governments did not give official recognition to the schools. "Each of the nine wards of all union parisads will also have an Imam appointed by the government," the JP chairman promised. He expressed optimism over a grand alliance victory. "If the grand alliance had not been formed, it would not have been possible to say which party would come into power" The former military general was speaking at an election campaign rally at Syedpur Pilot High School under Nilphamari-4 constituency on Friday. AL leader colonel (retd) Maruf Saqlan and JP leader Shawkat Chowdhury are contesting for the same Nilphamari-4 seat. The BNP-led four party alliance has fielded Amzad Hossain in the constituency. Ershad, introducing Saqlan as the 'grand alliance candidate', sought votes for him and urged Chowdhury to back off the polling race. The former president also made pledges to provide gas and much more for them if the grand alliance is voted to power. Earlier Ershad paid visits to Bihari camps of non-Bengalis in Syedpur. Wooing their support he said "If in power we will try to solve your problems." Some Biharis, or 'stranded Pakistanis', also spoke at the rally. A few BNP leaders including a Syedpur pourasava councilor joined the JP at that time. Ershad spoke at different election campaign rallies at Gangachara upazilla under Rangpur-1 from morning to noon in the day. bdnews24.co
