 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com) - The Awami League-led grand alliance is manipulating the electoral environment with the "war criminals issue" ahead of election just days away now, BNP's key electoral ally Jamaat-e-Islami alleged on Wednesday. The party also alleged the administration and the rival alliance of putting barriers up to a fair election. "A quarter of the administration is biased, while the grand alliance is continuously breaching the election code of conduct", Jamaat's election spokesman and assistant secretary general Barrister Abdur Razzaq said Wednesday. He further alleged the media has been running false and fabricated news on Jamaat candidates. Razzaq demanded the government take stern action against those "who would have made an attempt on the life of BNP chief Khaleda Zia in Comilla on Tuesday." Razzaq was speaking at a press conference at party's central office. bdnews2
