<TEXT>
 GAZA, Sun Dec 28, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Israel destroyed Hamas's main Gaza security complex in an air strike on Sunday and prepared for a possible invasion of the territory after killing more than 280 Palestinians in the first 24 hours of a powerful offensive. Israeli leaders said the campaign was a response to almost daily cross-border rocket and mortar fire that intensified after Hamas, an Islamist group in charge of the coastal enclave Israel quit in 2005, ended a six-month ceasefire a week ago. Despite the air attacks, militants fired some 80 rockets into Israel, emergency services said. In one of the deepest attacks, two rockets struck near Ashdod, a main port 30 km from Gaza, causing no casualties, police said. Israeli tanks deployed on the edge of the Gaza Strip, poised to enter the impoverished enclave where 1.5 million Palestinians live. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's cabinet approved a call-up of 6,500 reservists, a government official said. "Israel will continue (the campaign) until we have a new security environment in the south, when the population there will no longer live in terror and in fear of constant rocket barrages," said Mark Regev, a spokesman for Olmert. The U.N. Security Council called for a halt to the violence. Keeping pressure on Hamas after one of the bloodiest days for Palestinians in 60 years of conflict, Israeli aircraft flattened the group's main security compound in Gaza, killing at least four security men, a health official said. The deaths raised to 286 the number of Palestinians killed since Saturday, when Israel launched what one Israeli newspaper columnist described as "shock and awe" air strikes against Hamas facilities. More than 700 Palestinians were wounded. "Palestine has never seen an uglier massacre," said Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh. His Islamist group vowed revenge including suicide bombings in Israel's "cafes and streets". One Israeli was killed on Saturday by a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip. Israeli military affairs commentators said the Israeli offensive did not appear to be aimed at retaking the Gaza Strip or destroying the territory's Hamas government -- ambitious goals that could prove difficult and politically risky to achieve ahead of Israel's Feb. 10 parliamentary election. Instead, they said, Israel -- after an air bombardment on Saturday -- wanted to strengthen its deterrence power and force Hamas into a new truce that would lead to a long-term halt to cross-border rocket salvoes. DANGER In the Gaza Strip, where normally bustling streets were largely traffic-free, Palestinians stood outside their homes to chat with neighbours about the dangers ahead as the roar of Israeli aircraft and explosions echoed in the distance. "I kept my children at home. No need to study today," one Palestinian parent said. Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak ordered schools, due to reopen on Tuesday after the Jewish holiday of Hannukah, to remain shut in southern Israeli communities. Along the Gaza border, a Reuters photographer saw Israeli soldiers cleaning the barrels of their tanks taking cover under the armoured vehicles as Palestinian rockets flew overhead. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas blamed Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip from his Fatah group in 2007, for triggering Israel's raids by not extending the ceasefire that Egypt brokered in June. "We talked to them (Hamas) and we told them 'please, we ask you, do not end the truce. Let the truce continue and not stop' so that we could have avoided what happened," he said in Cairo. In a show of national unity, Israel's leading political parties suspended electioneering for the Feb. 10 ballot, which opinion polls forecast the right-wing Likud of former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will win. U.S. President George W. Bush's administration, in its final weeks in office, put the onus on Hamas to prevent more violence. Aid groups said they feared the Israeli operation could lead to a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. The United Nations Works and Relief Agency said its food and cash distribution to 750,000 Gazans had been suspended but it hoped to bring in 10 truck-loads of medical supplies on Sunday. Gaza hospitals said they were running out of medical supplies because of a long-standing Israeli-led blockade. Hamas, which won a parliamentary election in 2006 but was shunned by Western powers over its refusal to renounce violence and recognise Israel, estimated at least 180 members of its security forces had been killed with at least 15 women and some children. Among the civilian dead were seven teenagers, students at an UNRWA school, who were killed in an Israeli air strike while waiting for a bus to take them home, said Christopher Gunness, an UNRWA spokesman. "Death is everywhere this morning," he said
