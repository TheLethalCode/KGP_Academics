 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - Grameen Healthcare Trust and General Electric Healthcare on Monday signed an agreement to provide healthcare services to the people of remote areas. "We've struck the deal with an aim to spread the latest development of health services technologies," Grameen Healthcare Trust chairman Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said at a joint press conference at Bangladesh-China Friendship Conference Centre. "We want to provide healthcare to pregnant women and infants," the founder of Grameen Bank, the co-winner of the Nobel peace prize, said. Grameen Health Care Trust is an institution of Grameen Bank family and GE Healthcare, headquartered in the United Kingdom, is a $17 billion unit of General Electric Company . The division specialises in medical imaging equipment and biotechnology. "We want to send facilities of technological development in health service through social business." He said it would also keep an eye so that none can take profit from this service of the joint venture. "We have 65 health service centres and we are struggling to manage them due to lack of equipment in diagnosing diseases," Dr Yunus said. "We need medical equipment for proper diagnosis of diseases, as treatment of all diseases is possible if those are diagnosed well." The Nobel laureate said he has thoughts to set up a modern medical college in the country. That is why, he also discussed with [US-based] Mayo Clinic. But it is yet to be finalised. He also looked forward to establishing a nursing institute and a technologist training centre from which skilled manpower will be employed in the Grameen-GE healthcare project in the future. Omar Ishrak, president of GE Health Care and chief executive officer said, under the joint venture, initially mothers and children will be provided with healthcare services and gradually the services will be spread to other people. South Asian president of GE Healthcare and CEO V Raja was also present during the press conference. bdnew
