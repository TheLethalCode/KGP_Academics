 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com) Awami League president Sheikh Hasina in a televised speech on Saturday vowed to establish a Bangladesh free from hunger and poverty, and called for a "transparent political culture" taking lessons from the past. "Let us put an end to the politics of conflicts for the sake of highest state interest," Hasina said. "Let us all ... create a transparent political culture." The two major alliance chiefs delivered televised speeches to the nation on Saturday evening hours before campaigns for the ninth parliamentary elections closed Dec 27 midnight. The two former prime ministers had also addressed the two largest rallies of the campaign period on consecutive days, Friday and Saturday, at Paltan Maidan. State-run Bangladesh Television and Bangladesh Betar broadcast the recorded Hasina speech at 8:30apm, with Khaleda's being aired soon after Hasina's ended. Hasina recounted the birth of Bangladesh, the ups and downs of the country's history. "I've described the past incidents in order to march forward taking a lesson from those experiences." The former prime minister renewed the pledges of her party's manifesto, the "Charter for Change" unveiled on Dec 12 at the start of her election campaign. "We've received such tremendous support from people for our manifesto and Vision 2021 that it has become a national charter," she said. Hasina called upon government officials to work neutrally during polling and members of law enforcing agencies to take measures so that people can vote without any fears. The AL chief and grand alliance leader came down hard on the rival BNP-Jamaat alliance, saying that the growth and flourish of militancy in the country occurred under the patronisation of the four-party government. "They created 111 godfathers across the country to establish a state of anarchy, while Hawa Bhaban ran a parallel government and parliament was total ineffective." "You all know the price of rice had soared up to double during the four-party alliance government." "They siphoned state money abroad. The recent Singapore incident, reported in foreign newspapers, tarnished country's image to the international community." She said the power sector was worst affected during the coalition government with unbridled government corruption in the sector worth Tk 20,000 crore. Hasina, who was prime minister from 1996-2001, gave a brief picture of development during her government. "In only five years, Bangladesh had earned self-reliance. Jobs were created for the poor and youth. Bangladesh had showed steady rise in the human development index." "The five years have been termed as golden period in Bangladesh's history," she added. But Bangladesh's marching forward to development was halted during the four-party alliance government, championing the country in corruption again and again, Hasina said. Recalling her family members killed in 1975, Hasina, daughter of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman said, "I've been facing threats to my life. Even after that I will continue my struggle to make the people of the country smile, of which the father of the nation dreamt." "I'm daughter of Bangabandhu, and a Muslim as well. And a Muslim does not bend her head before anyone but Allah." "I'll be serving you till I breath my last," said Hasina. bdnews
