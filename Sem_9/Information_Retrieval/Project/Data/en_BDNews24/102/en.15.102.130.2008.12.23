 BOGOTA, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - America beat Independiente Medellin 3-1 to win the Colombian Clausura championship and claim their 13th title, equalling the record held by Millonarios. The Red Devils completed a 4-1 aggregate win in the two-leg final with their victory at Cali's Pascual Guerrero stadium on Sunday. Medellin went ahead in the 17th minute when Danilson Cordoba's long ball forward caught the America defence napping and Diego Alvarez touched the ball past Adrian Berbia. Adrian Ramos crashed in a right-foot shot from outside the area to equalise eight minutes later and the hosts went ahead on the hour when Medellin's Jamel Ramos turned Ivan Velez's cross into his own goal. Jaime Cordoba finished off a breakaway to score America's third in the 89th minute. America, beaten in the Apertura championship final in the first half of the season, dominated Colombian football during the 1980s but have been hit by financial problems in the past few years. Their previous title was in 2002. Two championships per year are held in Colombia
