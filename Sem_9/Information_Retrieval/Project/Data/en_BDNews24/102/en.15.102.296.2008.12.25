<TITLE> Egypt says Israel-Gaza truce unlikely with escalation </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 CAIRO, Thu Dec 25, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit urged Israelis and Palestinians to exercise restraint to facilitate a new ceasefire between the Jewish state and Gaza's Islamist Hamas rulers. But he said, "I cannot Imagine that we can convince the two sides to go back to the calm as long as there is this escalation." Fighting across the Gaza Strip border with Israel has escalated since a six-month ceasefire which had been brokered by Egypt expired last week amid violence. "Egypt will not stop efforts (to broker a truce) as long as the parties want this, but I cannot imagine that we can convince the two sides to go back to the calm as long as there is this escalation," Aboul Gheit told reporters at a press conference with his Israeli counterpart Tzipi Livni. He added: "What we are asking them both is to restrain themselves, and then we see how to come back to that period of quiet." Livni traveled to Cairo on Thursday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the violence along the Israel-Gaza border and the prospects of renewing the truce. The talks came a day after Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip fired more than 80 rockets and mortars at southern Israel and Israel a Hamas gunman in an air strike. Livni described the latest escalation as "unbearable." "Hamas needs to understand that our aspiration to live in peace does not mean that Israel will take this kind of situation any longer. Enough is enough," Livni told reporters in Cairo. "We cannot tolerate a situation in which Hamas continues to target Israel, Israel's citizens, and this situation is going to be changed," Livni added. Livni said on Wednesday that Israel will "change the reality" of the situation in the Gaza Strip. Under a six-month ceasefire that ended in violence last week, Hamas agreed to halt rocket fire in return for Israel easing a blockade that was tightened after the Islamist group seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007
