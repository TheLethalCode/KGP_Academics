 Gaibandha, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Gaibandha police have taken eight members of the banned Islamic militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh arrested in connection with a huge haul of explosives into five-day remand. Police sought 10 days remand after the militants were produced before the additional chief judicial magistrate's court on Friday; magistrate Hakim Sharif Uddin Azad granted five. Following the arrest of three JMB activists in Gaibandha on Wednesday, four more of the same outfit were arrested on Thursday afternoon and a fifth in the evening. During Wednesday night's hauls, police retrieved huge quantities of bomb ingredients, electronic equipment, batteries, grenade casings, chemicals and books from the raids. Police said at least 55 grenades could be made using the seized materials.
