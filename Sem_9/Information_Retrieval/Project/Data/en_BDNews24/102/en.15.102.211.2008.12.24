 MADRID, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The Spanish football federation (RFEF) plans to submit a joint bid with Portugal to host the 2018 World Cup. "The board have finalised today the formal tender for Spain's candidature to organise the 2018 World Cup to be held jointly with Portugal," the RFEF said in a statement on Tuesday. The winning bid will be announced in December 2010. European champions Spain and Portugal declared their interest in hosting the tournament after FIFA said it would welcome bids for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said Spain, alone or with Portugal, were strong candidates for 2018, as were England and the Netherlands with Belgium. Australia, China, Mexico and Russia have also expressed interest. Spain have not hosted the World Cup since 1982, but Portugal built 10 new stadiums to host the European Championship in 2004. The 2010 World Cup will be held in South Africa while Brazil will host the 2014 tournament
