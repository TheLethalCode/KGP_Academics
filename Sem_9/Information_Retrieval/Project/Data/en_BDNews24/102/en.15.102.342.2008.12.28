 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  A swashbuckling century from skipper Mahela Jayawardene and big contributions from his middle-order colleagues put Sri Lanka in the driver's seat. They lead Bangladesh by 406 runs at the close of the third day of the first Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Sunday. The visitors were 291 for four at stumps with Jayawardene unbeaten on 129 when bad light stopped play with nine overs to go for the third time in as many days. The test will see a one-day break on Monday due to the national elections, and resume on Tuesday. Jayawardene, who struggled against Zimbabwe after making 15,4,0 and 0 in four successive one-day internationals, survived some nervous moments against Bangladesh pacers early to find his foot. He steered the visitors ahead with two hundred-run partnerships with Kumar Sangakkara and Thilan Samaraweera. The right-handed batsman took 109 balls to reach 50, and consumed another 68 balls to reach his 24th Test hundred by hitting paceman Mahbubul Alam Robin for four. Jayawardene struck 15 fours and one six in his 216-ball knock. Bangladesh's pace duo of Mahbubul Alam Robin and Mashrafee Bin Mortaza gave the hosts a perfect start in the morning when they removed openers Malinda Warnapure (8) and Michael Vandort (6) respectively. But the 31-year old skipper along with Sangakkara denied further damage by negotiating the bowlers well. Together they took Sri Lanka to 153 for three from 18 for two before Mehrab Hossain Junior broke the third-wicket stand in his third over. He had Sangakkara caught behind by wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahman for 67 off 134 balls, studded with eight boundaries. Jayawardene then pairing with Samaraweera quickly added another 138 runs for the fourth wicket with an average of 4.16 per over as hosts looked frustrated on the field. However, Mashrafee took the new ball to dismiss Samaraweera in the last delivery of the day's final over for 62 off 116 balls that included eight fours. Earlier, Muttiah Muralitharan had picked up the last wicket to wrap Bangladesh up for 178, giving Sri Lanka a 115-run lead in the first innings. Bangladesh, who resumed the day on 177 for nine, lasted only six balls to add just one run to their overnight score before Muralitharan had overnight batsman Mahbubul Alam (0) caught by Warnapura in the last delivery of the day's first over. Sri Lanka were 293 all out in the first innings. Mushfiqur Rahim remained unbeaten on 12 off 27 balls while Muralitharan raised his wicket tally to six for 49. bdnew
