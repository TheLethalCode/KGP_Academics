 KATHMANDU, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Nepal's leading newspapers appeared without editorials on Tuesday, a sign of protest over a weekend attack by Maoist activists on a local publishing house in which journalists were beaten and its office ransacked. On Sunday dozens of activists belonging to a labour union affiliated to the ruling Maoists attacked the office of Himalmedia, publishers of the weekly English-language Nepali Times and other magazines, injuring some staff including journalists. The attackers said they were unhappy with negative coverage. Major English and Nepali language newspapers on Tuesday left their editorial spaces blank, some with bold black borders. "We feel the attack on Himalmedia and other media houses represents a serious threat to press freedom, democracy and pluralism in this country," media groups Nepal Media Society and the Editors' Alliance said in a statement. "It is ironical that it should be perpetrated by a group affiliated to a party that won the election and leads the government," the statement said. "We feel enough is enough." About 300 journalists and human rights activists marched through Kathmandu on Monday in opposition to the attack and some people were injured as protesters clashed with police. The Maoists head a coalition government after emerging as the biggest political party in an April election. They signed a peace deal two years ago and ended their decade-long civil war against the former monarchy. But the ex-guerrillas have drawn criticism from political parties for continuing violence and intimidation. The Maoist party promises to protect press freedom and says the attack on the media house would be investigated. Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda has vowed to punish those who were guilty. Nepal's other main political parties, the European Union, the United States and the United Nations have condemned the attack. Some media reports said other labour groups and activists close to the Maoists had also threatened the Kantipur media house, which publishes Nepali and English language dailies and other magazines
