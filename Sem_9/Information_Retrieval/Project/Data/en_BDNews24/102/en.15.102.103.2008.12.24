 LONDON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Arsenal skipper and playmaker Cesc Fabregas will be out with a medial knee ligament injury for up to four months, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told reporters on Tuesday. The 21-year-old Spaniard, who was named Arsenal captain in place of William Gallas a month ago, was injured in a 50-50 challenge with Spanish team mate Xabi Alonso during Arsenal's 1-1 draw with Liverpool at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday and limped off at halftime. "He will be out for between three and four months, more likely four months. We will have to find a way to compensate for him not being on the pitch," Wenger said. "I have no complaints about the challenge, it was an honest one. It is the kind of injury you have to accept as there was no intention to hurt him and it was purely accidental.
