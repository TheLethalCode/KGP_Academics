 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  The candidates of the ninth national polls started campaigns three months before the schedules were announced breaching the electoral code, Transparency International Bangladesh said Wednesday. "Though against the electoral codes, candidates of Awami League, BNP, Jatiya Party and Jamaate Islami started spending money on campaigns even three months before the schedules were announced," said TIB researchers Shahjada M Akram and Sadhan Kumar Das. "The AL and BNP candidates spent over Tk 3 lakhs each and those of JP and Jamaat Tk 1.5-2 lakhs before they got nominations," said a TIb report. "The average expenses the 122 candidates from the four major parties made stood at Tk 15.20 lakh." TIB trustee board chairman professor Mozaffar Ahmad, treasurer M Hafizuddin Khan and executive director Dr Iftekharuzzaman were also present at a press conference at the VIP auditorium of Dhaka Reporters Unity at the Press Club on Wednesday. Prof. Mozaffar said, "Since the new electoral codes have limited the campaign expenses, the candidates spent money before nominations," but this is against the rule, he observed. "The candidates sought subterfuges through the loopholes of the codes, they even spent huge amounts during the Eid-ul Azha in the name of humanitarian assistances, and thus managed to dodge the Election Commission." Before the cancelled 2007 elections a BNP candidate spent Tk 17.51 lakh, an AL candidate Tk 13.95 lakh, a JP candidate Tk 5.79 lakh and a Jamaat candidate Tk 5.79 lakh on an average, the TIP report found. "The figures however stood at Tk 3.89 lakh (BNP), Tk 3.09 lakh (AL), Tk 1.82 lakh (JP) and Tk 2.36 lakh (Jamaat) for each candidate before the Dec 29 election." "Some 142 candidates spent a total of Tk 4.323 crore or Tk 3.04 lakh each in breach of the code," the report continued. Referring to an undisclosed candidate for the upcoming polls, the report said s/he alone spent Tk 38.50 lakh on campaigns. Mozaffar asked for auditing the funds spent by the candidates in the elections as the money belongs to people, he said. Pointing at some malpractices he said some of the candidates have set up shops to sell goods 'on credit'  which actually is meant to buy voters, he said,. "This must stop," the TIB chairman asserted. M Hafizuddin Khan said, "It's unfortunate that convicts and those under trial are contesting the polls, but survey on 40 constituencies show that the EC measures yielded positive results." b
