 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  The Election Commission will blacklist observer agencies if allegations of bias or political affiliation are proved against them, warns the chief election commissioner. "This election is different from previous elections. The observers have a significant role in the acceptability of the poll," ATM Shamsul Huda told reporters after inaugurating a training programme on Monday. "We have not received any objection against the foreign observers, but there are allegations against many of the local ones. For that the opinions of foreign observers are also very crucial," he said. Sounding a warning for the local observers, Huda said: "If the commission finds proof of allegations on charges of political involvement, the concerned agency will be black listed." The Dec 29 election will see as many as 2,500 foreign observers. The EC has also approved observer status for 137 local agencies. Of the latter, 20 organisations initially faced objections on grounds of involvement with political parties, including Awami League and BNP. The EC validated their observer status after holding hearings. The CEC believes new or first time voters will bring a major sea change in electing acceptable candidates. "About 31 percent of voters are enrolled for the first time. They will play a crucial role in electing honest and qualified candidates in the election." "I believe they will make their choice and give their vote with due consideration," he said. The Asian Network for Free Election organised the training programme at the BRAC Centre Inn. bd
