 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)The Indian high commissioner in Dhaka has been summoned to the foreign ministry over the entry of Indian survey ships into Bangladesh territorial waters, the foreign secretary said on Saturday. "The Indian envoy was summoned so Dhaka could lodge a diplomatic protest with Delhi," Md Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com. "We have received no information so far on whether the Indian ships have left our waters," the foreign secretary added. The Indian ships entered Bangladesh waters on Thursday night and left the disputed waters on Friday after the Bangladesh Navy protested the intrusion. But they entered again later, said the foreign ministry. A foreign ministry statement on Friday had said Bangladesh was demanding suspension of mineral exploration activities in the Bay of Bengal by India until the sea borders between the two countries are redrawn. The statement said the Indian ships were conducting surveys of deep-sea Block 14 in the maritime area claimed by Bangladesh under the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act 1974. The foreign adviser in an earlier statement said the government was running an inquiry. bdn
