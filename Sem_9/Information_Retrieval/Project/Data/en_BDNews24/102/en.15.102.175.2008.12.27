 Dhaka, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Spin wizard Muttiah Muralitharan followed Shakib Al Hasan's five-for feat to keep Sri Lanka in the hunt against Bangladesh at the close of the second day of the first Test at Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Saturday. Muralitharan claimed five scalps for 48 to leave Bangladesh struggling at 177 for nine at stumps when bad light stopped the second day's progress with eight overs to go. The hosts were still trailing by 116 runs after the visitors made 293 all out, thanks to a five-wicket haul from Shakib. Muralitharan, as expected, wrecked the hosts' innings, though Tamim Iqbal and Imrul Kayes negotiated the Lanka pace duo Chaminda Vaas and Dhamika Prasad well, putting on 44 runs for the opening stand. Muralitharan, introduced in the 13th over, made the inroad in his very second delivery to dismiss Tamim for 17. The ball hit Tamim on the glove and Malintha Warnapura dived to his left at short leg to take the catch Five overs later, Kayes edged Vaas to wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene for a 53-ball 33, leaving the side at 68 for two and triggering a top-order collapse. Despite showing some signs of returning to form, Mohammad Ashraful was deceived by some tidy field placing by opponent skipper, Mahela Jayawardene. He kept two fielders in the short cover region for Ashraful, who slashed a wide delivery off Vaas to find Dilshan at cover. The Bangladesh skipper's 18-ball innings saw only 12 runs, a continuation of shaky performance in 18 successive innings since his unbeaten 129 against Sri Lanka in July 2007 in Colombo. One-down Junaed Siddique was getting better as the play progressed, but the left-handed batsman was removed by a doosra from Muralitharan for 29 with Bangladesh on 95 for four, a few minutes before tea. Junaed struck five boundaries in his 68-ball knock. Shakib and Mehrab Hossain Junior tried to get out of the web with a flurry of strokeplays as both batsmen smacked Muralitharan for sixes to raise some hopes, achieving 4.1 runs per over as long as they stayed on the wicket. Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who took six wickets in warm-up match, finally broke the 41-run sixth-wicket stand to have Mehrab caught by keeper Prasanna for 29 off 39 balls that included three fours and one six. Shakib soon followed Mehrab to edge Muralitharan to Prasanna for a 45-ball 26 before Mashrafee was trapped leg before for a first-ball duck, putting Murali on a hat-trick. Shahadat Hossain defended solid the next ball to deny the champion spinner a rare hattrick, but he soon became Muralitharan's fifth victim as he was hit in the pad plumb for a 17-ball five. Mushfiqur Rahim along with Mahbubul Alam remained unbeaten on 11 and nought. Earlier, left-arm spinner Shakib continued with his impressive performance in South Africa to complete his third five-scalp streak in a row as Sri Lanka were bundled out for their lowest-ever innings total against Bangladesh. Shakib, who took six and five wickets against South Africa last month, had Thilan Samaraweera caught by Junaed Siddique to complete his fourth five-wicket haul in his 11-Test career. Samaraweera, however, was the man who rescued Sri Lanka with his stroke-filled 90. Resuming on the overnight score of 20, he clubbed 13 fours in 141 balls. The 32-year-old batsman led the recovery with Chaminda Vaas, putting on 99 runs for the seventh wicket before Mashrafee struck with the second new-ball struck in his second over of the day to trap Vaas leg before just after drinks. Vaas left for 37, triggering a lower-order collapse as Sri Lanka lost their last four wickets for 23 runs, with Shakib cleaning up the tail. Shakib raised his wicket tally to five for 70 from three for 43 as he removed Dhamika Prasad (three) and Samaraweera. Herath was run out for three. Having resumed the day on 172 for six, Sri Lanka added another 121 for four wickets to finish on 293
