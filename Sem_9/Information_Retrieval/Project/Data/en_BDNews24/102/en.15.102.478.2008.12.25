 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina warned on Thursday that people must be given the chance to vote without fear for the candidate of their choice. "You will vote for the person of your choice and attempts to prevent you will not be tolerated," she said in Lalbagh at an campaign rally of AL candidate Mostafa Jalal Mahiuddin for Dhaka-7. "This is an election where peace, development and security are pitted against terrorism, corruption and militancy." Pointing to the AL's arch-rival BNP, she said, "It is their nature to unleash terror and for that everyone needs to be on the alert. In the last election, they stuffed one crore extra voters in the list but this time these fake names have been deleted from the new photo-based voter list." She thanked the caretaker government and the military for the photo-based voter list. "This list will be a milestone for the nation." The former prime minister took a swipe at BNP candidate Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu for the Dhaka-7 seat. "All of you know the BNP candidate and his past. In 1994, after the mayoral election, murders were committed in Lalbagh at his orders." "You have to decide if you will vote him or for a gentleman like Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin." After 2001, there has not been any development in the Lalbagh area and the promised water treatment plant did not see the light of day, the AL chief remined her audience. At the rally city AL president MA Aziz, acting general secretary Kamrul Islam and AL's deputy campaign secretary Asim Kumar Ukil were present. bdnew
