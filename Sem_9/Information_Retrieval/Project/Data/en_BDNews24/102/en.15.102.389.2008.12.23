 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - Fifty percent of TIN (Tax Identification Number) certificates submitted for registering land and obtaining credit cards are fake, the NBR chairman said on Monday. "In case of buying automobiles the figure stands at about 33 percent," Mohammad Abdul Majid said at a press conference at the NBR office in the city. A recent survey by NBR reveals counterfeit TIN certificates submitted for services like land and automobile registration, and banking services like loan, credit card and letter of credit opening amount to 35.30 percent. For bank loans beyond Tk 5 lakh and L/C opening, the rate of forged TIN certificates submission is 3.92 percent and 2.38 percent respectively. A meeting of all tax commissioners, bankers and top officials of government agencies on Monday agreed to strengthen monitoring and verification measures to face this recent menace, Majid said. "We are not asking agencies to halt providing services but we made it clear that the NBR would verify it sooner or later." He also said in some cases, undercover tax officials found officials in the surveyed offices encouraging such rogue behavior. The sample size of the survey is 371 and 131 are phoney, according to the NBR chief. "We will conduct a full-fledged survey afterwards," added Majid. He also said the figures prove that these people were taxable. "But they are not listed with us." On electoral candidates not having TINs, Majid said the NBR will take measures against them according to taxation rules. "A total of 439 electoral candidates out of almost 1500 do not have TINS." bdn
