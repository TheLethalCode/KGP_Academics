 Sylhet, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Harkatul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) operations commander Mufti Abdul Hannan Munshi and two other militants were sentenced to death on Tuesday for the 2004 grenade attack on former British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury in Sylhet. Judge Shamim Md Afzal, of Sylhet divisional speedy trial tribunal, also sentenced two others found guilty to life terms, special public prosecutor Fakhruddin Ahmad told bdnews24.com. Three policemen were killed and over 50 were injured, including Choudhury, in the grenade attack on May 21 2004 that was judged to be an attempt on the high commissioner's life as he was visiting the shrine of Shah Jalal in the northeastern city. After the verdict was handed down on Tuesday, Mufti Hannan said, "The verdict was unjust. We will prove ourselves innocent with appeals to the higher court." The two other sentenced to death are Sharif Shahedul Bipul and Delwar Hossain Ripon. The two life-term convicts are militant leader Mufti Mainuddin alias Abu Zandal alias Khwaza and Mofizur Rahman Ovi, the brother of Mufti Hannan.. Tight security measures were taken in and outside the court premises since morning. Police made body and baggage searches at all entrances.
