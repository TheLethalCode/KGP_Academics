<TITLE> Johnston still the character 30 years on </TITLE>

 LONDON, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - From negotiating the price of a greenhouse while taking corner kicks to being sent off 21 times in his career, life was never dull with former Scotland international Willie Johnston around. However, despite his prodigious talent that helped Rangers to their last piece of European silverware, the 1972 European Cup Winners' Cup, Johnston is unfortunately best remembered for being sent home from the 1978 Argentina World Cup after failing a drugs test. Johnston, now 62, took two Reactivan cold remedy tablets to relieve his hay fever before Scotland's opening group game against Peru. Unknown to the Scot they contained the illegal stimulant fencamfamin, which was enough to hand him a year-long FIFA ban. "In our time we didn't get told what not to take. You'd have to be a chemist," he told Reuters in an interview in central London. For the former Rangers and West Bromwich Albion crowd-pleaser, already out of favour with the Scottish FA due to his disciplinary record, the incident marked the end of his international career and the start of rough treatment from the media. "We were wondering if I could get pardoned after 30 years of torture," Johnston said, flanked by Tom Bullimore, the co-author of his recently released biography. "If it happens it happens, I hope I'm still here. But I don't think I'll get picked for the next game," he said, winking. The sorry drugs affair has resurfaced in the bookSent Off at Gunpoint which charts the winger's immensely colourful career. "It was only because we were half-drunk one night that we said `We're going to make a right go of it.' Most good ideas come in a pub," said Johnston, now a publican in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. SENDINGS OFF Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson writes about Johnston's "famous temper" in the book's foreword. "There is no point in portraying his disciplinary record as a blip on an otherwise outstanding career," wrote Ferguson, who played alongside Johnston at Rangers. The sending off that provided the inspiration for the title of the book occurred when Rangers played Fiorentina in New York in a 1969-70 pre-season friendly. "The referee said 'You're going off.' And I said 'I'm not going off,'" Johnston recounted. "So he called a policeman, who drew his gun and said 'You're off.'" In the book Johnston adds: "I had to go anyway I needed to visit the men's room." Another, which he described as his best sending off, came in a league cup match at The Hawthorns against Brighton in the 1976-77 season. "The referee kept getting in the road. So I booted him in the arse," he said, chuckling as he recalled the incident. Johnston believes that if he were to play today he would receive better protection from officials, as most of his sendings off came when he retaliated to being scythed down by opposing players. "The referees weren't looking after us when we played," he said. "It's far easier now." GREENHOUSE YARN Johnston said he was no devil despite his disciplinary record and had a special rapport with the fans. For example, during matches over the course of two weeks at The Hawthorns he negotiated to buy a greenhouse from a front-row fan. "One day the fan found out, in the match programme, that I liked gardening," Johnston recalled. "My next step was to get a greenhouse, and when he said he had one for sale that's when I started talking to him. "I used to take my time putting the ball down, when I was taking corner kicks, and that's when I'd ask 'Right how much you want for it?' "He started at 60-70 quid (pounds) but after a couple of weeks I got him down to 40 pounds and I bought it. Then after I took the corner I shook his hand and said 'Right we've got a deal, I'll see you after the game.' "It was a cracker of a greenhouse!
