<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  With residents of the capital leaving for their home constituencies in their tens of thousands to cast their votes in Bangladesh's parliamentary polls, Dhaka was left in holiday mood - peaceful and pleasantly free of traffic and crowds. Homebound voters heaped huge pressure on the transport system already in crisis due to a large number of buses having been requisitioned for the election-related work. Car and microbus owners were less than keen to take to the roads on Sunday apprehending seizure by the authorities. They were seen instead packing buses heading home. Bus supervisor 'Azam', of Azmery Paribahan counter at Gabtali bus stand, said, "Passengers started buying long-distance tickets on Thursday afternoon to take leave on Sunday and make it a long four-day holiday." Election Day on Monday is a government holiday with Friday and Saturday being the weekend. "Lots of the capital's inhabitants who have registered as voters in their home districts are bound for home," he said. Private banker Mujibor Rahman, with his family, was heading for Barisal. He said he found it necessary to use the four days for voting in his home constituency and seeing relatives there. But all were not leaving Dhaka just to cast votes. Newly married Sumon and Faria were going to Cox's Bazar to honeymoon. Waiting at a Fakirerpul bus counter they said they both worked and have little time for themselves. So why not have fun! Huge crowds were seen at the bus terminals of Syedabad, Mohakhali and Gabtali on Saturday and Sunday. People had to wait in long queues at the ticket counters as the number of available buses were reduced due to the election-related requisition. Some shrewd bus owners raised ticket prices as demands jumped, passengers alleged. Barisal-bound Mozaffar Ahmed, who was waiting at the Gabtali bus stand, said he had to buy a Tk 300 ticket for Tk 350. Asked why he bought it for higher price, Mozaffar said, "Otherwise ticket is not available." Sadarghat launch terminal and Kamalapur Railway Station were no exceptions. Homebound passengers were forced to board the overloaded launches risking life as bus tickets were in short supply. Hanif Paribahan owner Mohammad Hanif told bdnews24.com there were pressures on every route because there were fewer buses and people wanted to leave early since there was ban on vehicles from midnight of Dec. 28 to Dec. 29. Night guard Abdur Rashid Molla at Sheorapara and Mirza Ayesha and her son Babu were also heading for their Barisal homes. Santosh, working at a Keraniganj tailoring house, was going to his Gaibandha home to cast his ballot. Police were seen in a spree of requisitioning buses and other vehicles in dozens on Sunday. The bdnews24.com correspondent at the city's Mitford Hospital said police took five buses each from the Dishari Paribahan and United Paribahan fleet. There are a lot more cases alike. bdnew
