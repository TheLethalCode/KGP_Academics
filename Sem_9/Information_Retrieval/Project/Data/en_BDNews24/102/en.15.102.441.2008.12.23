 MADRID, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Spanish Primera Liga club Almeria said on Monday they had appointed former Mexico coach Hugo Sanchez to replace Gonzalo Arconada, who was sacked on Sunday after the side's 1-0 defeat away to Sporting Gijon. Sanchez, 50, takes over with Almeria in 16th in the standings with only one win from their last 11 matches, leaving them three points above the relegation places. Widely regarded as the finest player Mexico has produced, the former Real Madrid striker became coach of the national side after the 2006 World Cup but was sacked at the end of March. Almeria said in a statement on their website (www.udalmeriasad.com) Sanchez had signed a contract through to the end of this season with an option to extend by one more term if the club avoids relegation. He is due to arrive this weekend and will take charge of his first training session on Monday, the statement said
