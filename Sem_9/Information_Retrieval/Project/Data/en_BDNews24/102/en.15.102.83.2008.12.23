<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)The chief adviser, visiting the recently automated service at Chittagong Customs House on Tuesday, and terming it "more transparent", backed automation of other government agencies. The customs house began its automation process in August this year to check irregularities and reduce hassles for businesses. The CA formally inaugurated the system on Nov. 6. He told reporters on Tuesday that if the modernisation of customs can be maintained, then it would greatly boost revenue collection. The chief adviser said the automated revenue collection process was more transparent, while service seekers also received special facilities under the system. He said such service should be introduced by other government and non-government agencies. bdnews
