 WELLINGTON, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The second test between New Zealand and West Indies in Napier ended in a draw on Tuesday after the hosts gave up the run chase with an hour to go. New Zealand finished their second innings on 220 for five, still 92 runs behind the winning target of 312, with Jesse Ryder on 59 and James Franklin two. New Zealand captain Daniel Vettori and West Indies counterpart Chris Gayle agreed to call the game off with nine overs to go after it became apparent neither side was in a position to win. The draw means the two test series ended 0-0, following a similar result in last week's rain-affected match in Dunedin. "Even though no-one won, I thought it was a good series," Gayle told reporters. West Indies were earlier bowed out for 375 in the last over before lunch thanks to a magnificent 197 from Gayle, setting the New Zealanders a victory target of 312. The home side started brightly with Jamie How (54), Ross Taylor (46) and Ryder all taking the attack to the West Indies bowlers. They were in a strong position to win the match after the tea break but every time the game seemed to be slipping away from them, the West Indies struck back with key wickets. When the dangerous Brendon McCullum (19) was given out with the New Zealand score on 203, the home side gave up the run chase and opted to settle for a draw. GAYLE SUPERB West Indies skipper Gayle was awarded man of the match for his superb innings. He shared in vital partnerships with Brendan Nash (65) and Fidel Edwards (20) to make the match safe for the West Indies. The tourists resumed at 295 for seven on Tuesday, with Gayle and Edwards adding 70 runs during the morning session to frustrate the New Zealand attack. Gayle batted magnificently and deserved to reach a double century, playing with a mixture of patience and aggression to dominate the New Zealand bowlers. He never looked in any trouble and when he eventually fell, it was the unluckiest of dismissals. A bottom edge from spin bowler Jeetan Patel cannoned straight into the boot of wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum and bounced up for McCullum to take a simple catch. Patel (5-110) was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers, recording his first five-wicket haul in tests. He was well supported by skipper Daniel Vettori (2-91), who trapped big hitting tailender Daren Powell lbw in the last over before lunch. That wrapped up the West Indies innings and gave the New Zealanders a shot at victory, however, the match that swung back and forward over all five days failed to find a winner
