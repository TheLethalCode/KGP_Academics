 Sunamganj, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Army chief general Moeen U Ahmed has said the army will do everything for people if asked by the government. "We'll do everything for people, if we are asked to. Over the last two years we've worked to restore health services in hospitals and upgrade educational standards at schools," he said. "The government's task is to provide fertiliser, seeds and water in time for crop output, and concerted efforts can not only bring food autarky but also the opportunity to export," observed the army chief. Moeen visited an army-managed floating vegetable garden at Mallikpur in Sunamganj town. "We've got to change our dietary habit and, for that, we need to diversify production of crops." "Though ours is a land of rivers, we don't make best use of the rivers and we must cultivate fisheries in the rivers and produce our own food," general Moeen suggested. "Then we can rein in the prices and the farmers will get their due." Brigadier Humayun Bakht Muhit, brigadier Morshed and Sunamganj deputy commissioner Farid Ahmed Bhuiyan accompanied the army chief. bdnews2
