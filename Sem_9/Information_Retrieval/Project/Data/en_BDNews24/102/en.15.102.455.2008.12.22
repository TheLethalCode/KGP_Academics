 ISLAMABAD Mon Dec 22, (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A large cache of weapons seized after a bloody army raid on Islamabad's Red Mosque last year has been stolen from a police station, an Interior Ministry spokesman said on Monday. Army commandos stormed the mosque complex in July last year to crush a Taliban-style movement after a week-long stand-off with well-armed militants and their supporters who refused to surrender to authorities after violence erupted outside the mosque. More than 100 people were killed. Troops recovered weapons in the complex including machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, AK-47 rifles, landmines and hand grenades, and showed them off to reporters after the assault. The weapons were then stored at a nearby police station but had gone missing, said Interior Ministry spokesman, Shahidullah Baig. "Over the passage of time, the weapons have been stolen. It did not happen in a day," Baig said. Ten policemen, including the head of the police station where the cache had been stored, had been arrested and an investigation had been launched, he said. Baig declined to say what kind of weapons had been stolen. The government said the clerics who ran the mosque, Abdul Aziz and his brother Abdul Rashid, had links with al Qaeda and Taliban militants. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al Zawahri, called for revenge after the assault. Soon after, the number of suicide bomb attacks, particularly on the security forces and police, rose significantly
