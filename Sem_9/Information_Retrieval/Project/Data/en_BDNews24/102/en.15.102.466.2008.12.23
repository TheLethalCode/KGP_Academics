<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - Hours after the recovery of three grenades in Comilla on Tuesday, BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia alleged they were intended to assassinate her since she had addressed an election rally just one kilometre from the place of recovery. Members of Rapid Action Battalion captured two militant suspects, recovering the 'hand-made' grenades from them at Nabiyabad village in Debiddhar around 4.30pm, Comilla police superintendent Imtiaz Ahmed said. Khaleda had addressed a rally at the grounds of a nearby cinema hall beside the Dhaka-Chittagong Highway some two hours before. "I've heard about the six (sic) grenades found in Comilla. There is no doubt they were meant to kill me," Khaleda said at a later rally in Raipur, Laxmipur district, at around 8:30pm. "A conspiracy is on to foil the election by killing me," she claimed. "They have become desperate, seeing the mass support at BNP election rallies. Now they are plotting to sabotage the election," said the two-term former prime minister, without clarifying who 'they' were. "They wanted to force me out of the country; as I didn't agree now they are trying to kill me," Khaleda said. "I've always led from the front in the fight for democracy," the BNP chief said. "I was by the side of people in the past; as I am now and will be in the future." Police superintendent Imtiaz Ahmed said it was not yet known which group the two militant suspects  'Naim' from Nilfamari and Abu Ansari from Debiddhar  belonged to. Naim sustained injuries during a brief exchange of gunfire, he added. Commander Abul Kalam Azad, chief of RAB's legal and media cell (headquarters), said a team from headquarters, along with Comilla RAB-11, raided the Naiyabad village on a tip-off. Quoting Imtiaz Ahmed and witnesses, bdnews24.com Comilla correspondent said, spotting the RAB members the two militants suspects hurled a grenade at them, which missed and dropped in a canal. RAB said the captives were in their custody and would be interrogated. Just earlier in the week, an Indian television network reported that the banned Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh was planning to assassinate Khaleda's political rival, Awami League president and former prime minister Sheikh Hasina. CNN-IBN reported that Hasina had been warned by the Indian intelligence agencies that a six-member suicide squad of the HuJI was planning an attempt on her life. Khaleda addressed a number of campaign rallies in Comilla, Laxmipur and Noakhali districts on Tuesday. She last headed to Feni and addressed another rally in Daganbhuiyan, before calling it a day. She will spend the night at Feni Circuit House and is scheduled to meet supporters in Feni-1, one of the three constituencies she is running for, on Wednesday. Khaleda will address Narayanganj rallies on her return to the capital later the same day. bdnews24.com/corr/st/
