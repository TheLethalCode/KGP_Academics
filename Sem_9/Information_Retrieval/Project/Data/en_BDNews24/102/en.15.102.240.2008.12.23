 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  Business chiefs on Tuesday lauded Awami League president Sheikh Hasina for her "persuasive" words spelling out an agenda for the country's ailing economy during a views-exchange meeting with them. "We are particularly thankful to her because she managed time to spend wtime ith us just a week before the election takes place, and she has hectic schedules," said Annisul Huq, president of Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI). The business leaders also thanked her adviser on private sector development Salman F Rahman for organising the event that saw top tycoons gather to hear Hasina speak at the Sonargaon Hotel. Salman, himself a former FBCCI president, convened the meeting titled "Charter for Change - Vision 2021: Role of the Private sector". Business leaders welcomed Hasina's speech that dwelt on the future of the country's economy, private sector, agriculture, small and medium enterprises, imports and exports, and rural economy. Huq told bdnews24.com that Hasina's determination to invigorate the private sector shows the "acumen she gained from running her government during 2006-2001". "We, the business community, see her speech as positive," said Huq. But he also said: "Madam, look at these people present here, none would want another hartal or shut-down suspending all activities countrywide." Responding to Huq, all the business leaders present raised their hands and chanted in unison, "No, we want no hartal." "There was no hartal in the last two years, but were you satisfied?" asked Hasina. She, however, added that people "have now got used to a 'no-hartal culture'". "I hope there will be no more hartals in future." Hasina in her speech asked industrialists and business entrepreneurs not to cream off exports and imports, but start raising manufacturing plants based on local needs. She said creating jobs for the rural poor was crucial to ensuring effective development of the society. "Poverty is our greatest problem. Whatever success you attain as a community, no market at home will ever emerge unless you help the rural poor pull themselves out of poverty and increase their buying power," said Hasina. "Only pocketing profits through exporting the same merchandise for years together would not lead you or the country anywhere. You must consider producing commodities locally, sell locally, create employment and help the grassroots rid themselves of poverty." Huq, the FBCCI chief, had said earlier, "Realising that economic prosperity is indicative of political stability, we appreciate Awami League's election manifesto very much." "If Awami League comes to power, we expect the government then will attach due priority to the gas and power generation and distribution, and render BAPEX effective. "We'll provide funds for gas exploration and infrastructure development, as necessary." Corruption and procrastination in decision making are worse impediments to industrial development than dearth of funds in the country, said Huq. "Raising the GDP to 8-9 per cent should not be a problem when political terrorism and extortion can be handled successfully," he said. Yusuf Abdullah Harun, another former FBCCI president, said, "The upcoming government will have to take care of the problem-ridden business sector which suffered considerably during the past two years." He alleged that the BNP-led government had only favoured a counted few business houses during its regime. Hasina replied that if voted to power, her government would not recognise party politics when it came to doing business Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Selima Rahman said, "Days will really change when the political parties will objectively evaluate the business people." Hasina began her speech saying: "I'll not read out my prepared speech. I understand that overall economic development will warrant your support." "Only profiteering and living well will not do. We expect you to set up factories, employ the rural poor, produce commodities for the local people and help them rid themselves of insolvency." Describing how the country had been thriving during the AL rule, she said, "If voted to power, we'll urge you to undertake certain actions to uplift the poor." Responding to the businessmen's demands, Hasina assured them of undertaking the construction of a dual highway from Dhaka to Gazipur and a new airport. "We would like to leave enterprises like the construction and maintenance of a new airport and a dual highway with private entrepreneurs," the former prime minister said. "We would like to spend government money on social development. We would specially support the development of small and medium enterprises and handicrafts." Reiterating that private sector initiatives were the main driving force in mainstream development, Hasina said, "No development is possible to sustain without the involvement of the private sector." "Besides readymade garments, you must search out demands for other products such as agricultural produces and processed food products. Then Bangladesh will no more be poor." Assuring special budget allocation for development of women entrepreneurs, Hasina said, "We'll try decentralising things so that people from all over will not have to rush to Dhaka all the time for every decision." As businessmen unanimously said they had not been so happy during the past couple of years, Hasina said, "I know. You have experienced extortions of other kinds." "You stop bribing people in power to secure business contracts. Refuse to oblige the extortionist. Then you'll have fewer things to complain about." About terrorism and terrorists, she said, "It's the military dictators who introduce terrorism. You saw me landing in jail as soon as I said a few words." bdnews24.com
