 Elenga, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina was back on the campaign trail Wednesday, after a two-day hiatus spent in the capital, urging people on her way to Rangpur in the north to 'vote boat' for progress and development. The AL president left her Sudha Sadan residence shortly before 8am for the northern districts in the morning, addressing a number of rallies on her way to Rangpur. After crossing Bangabandhu Bridge out of Dhaka, hundreds of supporters of Jannat Ara Henri, AL candidate for Sirajganj-2, blocked the party chief's motorcade. She urged them to vote the AL-led grand alliance to power. Reaching Bogra, Hasina addressed her first public gathering at Sherpur Bus stand. She sought votes for AL's Bogra-5 candidate Habibur Rahman. "I urge you to vote for the boat symbol and we are with you," she said. She attended a second rally at Matidali in Bogra, where BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is running, while Al's candidate is Md Momtaz Uddin. The AL chief then started for Gaibandha, where she was met by thousands of party activists and supporters. From Gaibandha Hasina arrived in Rangpur, her father-in-law's town. The AL chief is set to address a public gathering in Pirganj in the afternoon. She is contesting Rangpur-6, one of three seats she is standing from. Hasina is scheduled to address another rally in Dinajpur before returning to Dhaka Wednesday night. The former prime minister formally launched her election campaign on Dec 13. She was touring the southwest on four-day campaign trip last week. bdnews24.
