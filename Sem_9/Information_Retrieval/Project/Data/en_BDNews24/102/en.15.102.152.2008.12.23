<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - Businessman Kazi Tajul Islam Faruque on Tuesday wrote to police, seeking to drop the Tk 3 crore extortion charge against Awami League president Sheikh Hasina. Faruque, chairman of Wesmont Power Ltd, filed the case with Tejgaon Police Station on April 9, 2007 after the Fakhruddin Ahmed-led emergency government had taken over in January that year. But police said the law required the application to be filed with court. Faruque told reporters at a press conference at his office in Baridhara that he had filed the case because of "misunderstandings under the circumstances that had emerged then". He, however, would not enlarge on the 'misunderstandings' and 'circumstances'. "It is quite undesirable and unexpected on my part," he said. "I have withdrawn this case voluntarily. "As a responsible businessman and conscious citizen, I do not want to involve business with politics." Lutfar Rahman, officer in charge of the police station, told bdnews24.com that they had received the application. "We received the application at noon, but it has not been filed in accordance with law. Police have nothing to do at this stage." The police officer pointed out that the application should come to them through the court. Businessman Azam Jahangir Chowdhury, managing director of the East Coast Trading Limited and chairman of Prime Bank, also applied to the home adviser on Dec. 14 to withdraw a case against Hasina through an executive order.
