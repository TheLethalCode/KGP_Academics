 Comilla, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina has asked people not to sell their soul to the BNP and its allies who she said have sacks of money plundered while in office. "Today (Saturday) is a crucial day for the election. They have money plundered from state funds. They will show up with sacks of money today. "If you come across someone you hand over them to the police," the former prime minister said at a rally at Daudkandi in Comilla on her way to Chittagong on Saturday, the last day of election campaigning. Criticising the past four-party alliance government, she said: "If they go to power they will not do anything for the wellbeing of the poor. They tarnished nation's dignity by siphoning money abroad." "This election is very crucial for Bangladesh. The four-party alliance government looted people's money in the five years. They will use the money in the election." If AL wins the election and form government, it will ensure sale of fertiliser in the open market and agro products at low prices, the AL chief said. "Vote for boat, eat rice and lentil at an affordable rate and live in peace," Pointing at former BNP health minister Khandaker Mosharraf Hossain, who is running from Comilla-1 seat, Hasina said: "Ask the four-party alliance candidate why the community health care clinic has been closed. "Ask him how much money he had before he became minister and how much money he has now. We know about his money." Hasina left her Sudha Sadan residence shortly after 8am. On her way she waved hands to the people standing on the both sides of the road. The former prime minister is scheduled to address a rally in Chandina and a number of street rallies. She will have some rest at Feni Circuit House and participate in three gatherings in Feni, Chhagolnaiya and Sitakunda. Hasina will reach Chittagong in the afternoon and address a public meeting at Laldighi Maidan and come back to Dhaka in the night. bd
