 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP MP Mosaddek Ali Falu was released on bail from jail in graft cases on Monday, a top prisons official said. "He has been released in the evening from Kashimpur jail after the jail authorities received the court's bail order," deputy insopector general, prisons, major Shamsul Haider Siddiquee said. The jailer of the Dhaka Central Jail had earlier told bdnews24.com that Falu had been released. In the afternoon, the DIG told bdnews24.com that Falu would be released on receipt of the relevant papers. The jail authorities received the bail papers in the afternoon. Falu was convicted in a graft case and sentenced to five years in jail on June 2. The High Court on Dec. 18 declared Falu's detention illegal and ordered release on bail. He was arrested soon after the interim government took office in Jan. 2007. About the possible release of another former BNP MP, Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu, major Siddiqui said the jail authorities had not received any papers. "We'll act in accordance with the court orders, once we get them," he said. bdne
