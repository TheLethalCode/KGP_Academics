 LONDON, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Barcelona went 10 points clear in Spain after coming from behind to beat Villarreal at the weekend. In England, leaders Liverpool drew 1-1 at fifth-placed Arsenal, while Inter Milan headed into the Italian mid-season break having built a six-point lead. SPAIN Barcelona stretched their lead at the top of the Primera Liga to 10 points with a 2-1 comeback win away to Villarreal. Seydou Keita and Thierry Henry scored as Barca made it a clean sweep of victories over their five closest challengers. They have 41 points from 16 matches. Sevilla drew 0-0 at Real Mallorca to go second with 31, one point ahead of Atletico Madrid, who beat Espanyol 3-2 away. Valencia slipped to fourth, also with 30 points, after falling 1-0 at Real Madrid on Saturday, when Juande Ramos picked up his first league win as coach of the champions. Real are fifth with 29 points, above Villarreal on goal difference. ITALY Leaders Inter Milan head into Serie A's mid-season break with a six-point advantage over Juventus but needed a poor decision from a linesman to beat Siena 2-1 away. Brazilian right back Maicon, who scored Inter's first, was clearly offside along with at least two of his team mates but was allowed to go on and score an 83rd-minute winner. Second-placed Juve won 3-1 at Atalanta and although a wrong offside call also went their way for Alessandro Del Piero's opener, they deserved a hard-fought victory. Injury-hit AC Milan, with January loan signing David Beckham in the stands, crushed Udinese 5-1 at home to lie third. Brazilians Alexandre Pato and Kaka both scored twice. ENGLAND Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw at Arsenal in an end-to-end match at the Emirates Stadium where Arsenal were reduced to 10 men when Emmanuel Adebayor was sent off after 62 minutes. Arsenal went ahead when Robin van Persie scored an outstanding goal after 24 minutes, before Liverpool equalised shortly before halftime with Robbie Keane powering home a fine goal of his own. Liverpool moved two points ahead of Chelsea at the top, but Luiz Felipe Scolari's side will go back on top for Christmas if they win at Everton on Monday. Aston Villa moved into third place with a 1-0 win at West Ham United, while Manchester United, who beat LDU of Ecuador to win the Club World Cup in Japan on Sunday, slipped to fourth on 32 points but they have two games in hand. FRANCE Olympique Lyon, who had gone four matches without a win, won 1-0 at Caen on Saturday courtesy of a fine Karim Benzema goal to reach the halfway stage in the lead. Lyon, chasing an eighth consecutive title, top the table on 38 points from 19 games, three points ahead of second-placed Girondins Bordeaux, who recovered from being three goals down to win 4-3 at Monaco on Sunday. Surprise package Stade Rennes, who won 2-1 at Brittany derby rivals on Lorient, are in third place, a further point adrift and one point ahead of fourth-placed Paris St Germain, who were held to a 2-2 home draw by strugglers Valenciennes on Sunday. Olympique Marseille lost ground with an embarrassing 3-0 home defeat by Nancy that left them in fifth place, six points off the pace. NETHERLANDS Moroccan international Mounir El Hamdaoui scored his 15th goal of the season to keep leaders AZ Alkmaar on track for their first title since 1981 with a 2-0 win over Utrecht. Dario Cvitanich and Luis Suarez hit doubles for Ajax Amsterdam in a 6-0 thrashing of lowly Graafschap Doetinchem to keep them in second place, three points behind Alkmaar. Steve McClaren's Twente Enschede beat Willem II Tilburg for a fifth straight win to stay third above champions PSV Eindhoven, who overcame strugglers Feyenoord 1-0 with Ibrahim Afellay on target. SCOTLAND Celtic restored their four-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premier League on Sunday when they won 3-0 at Falkirk, although their second two goals came only in the closing minutes. Georgios Samaras headed Celtic ahead after 48 minutes, but Falkirk kept the pressure on the injury-hit league leaders who had to wait until the 90th minute before Japanese striker Koki Mizuno made it 2-0. Scott McDonald added the third four minutes into stoppage time. Celtic's Old Firm rivals Rangers had narrowed the gap at the top to a point on Saturday when they beat Hiberbian 1-0 with Kris Boyd scoring for a sixth successive game. Celtic top the table with 47 points from 19 games, followed by Rangers on 43 from 19. Dundee United, who drew 0-0 at Hearts, are third on 31
