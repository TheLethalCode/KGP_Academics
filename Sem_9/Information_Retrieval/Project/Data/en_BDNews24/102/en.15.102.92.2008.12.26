 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Pre-poll raids in three districts have netted explosives ranging from "powerful bombs" to "crude cocktails", which police say may have been intended for subversive activities on voting day. MEHERPUR Rapid Action Battalion on Friday evening recovered three large bombs from a school compound in Mujibnagar upazila, Meherpur. "Each of the bombs weighed one kilogramme," said Meherpur RAB commander Lt. Noor Mohammad. "They could have left at least 50 people dead if exploded at a rally." RAB recovered the bombs raiding the rear side of Chakshyamnagar High School on a tip-off and found the bombs in a bag, the RAB commander said. Noor suspected that they may have been intended for use on election day. NAOGAN Police recovered six bombs and arrested three people, including two women, in Naogan on Friday. "The six hand-made bombs and one digital video camera were recovered from a raid on a tip-off at the house of one Saiful Islam at Patharghata village," said acting officer-in-charge of the sadar police station Ekramul Haq. 'Mina' (40) 'Mazeda' (30) and 'Sayed' (25) were arrested in Bujoruk Patharghata village, but came from different areas of the district, said Ekramul. Mina is the wife of Saiful Islam. Police primarily suspected that those bombs might have been intended for use in subversive activities. RAJSHAHI Detective Branch of police recovered 25 crude bombs or 'cocktails' concealed at a construction site in Rajshahi town on Thursday night, said DB assistant commissioner Mahfuzur Rahman. Following the recovery, police picked up five students from a near by student mess - two of the BNP-backed student organisation JCD and three of the Jamaat-e-Islami-backed Islami Chhatra Shibir. They were released on Friday afternoon after interrogation. bdnews24.co
