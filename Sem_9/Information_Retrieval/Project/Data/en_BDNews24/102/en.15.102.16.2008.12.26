 NEW DELHI, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - India warned its citizens on Friday that it would be unsafe to travel to Pakistan amid heightened tension between the nuclear-armed rivals over last month's Mumbai attacks. "Indian citizens are therefore advised that it would be unsafe for them to travel (to) or be in Pakistan," India's Foreign Ministry spokesman said in response to a question about the reported arrests of Indian citizens after a bomb blast in Lahore on Thursday.
