 Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - The returning officers of Pabna and Sirajganj were withdrawn on Monday and attached to two ministries in line with the Election Commission's recommendation, an official told bdnews24.com. Deputy commissioners Khandaker Mokhlesur Rahman of Pabna and Ashraf Ali of Sirajganj were transferred to home and establishment ministries respectively as deputy secretaries, said the official from establishment ministry, preferring not to be named. "The EC asked the ministry of establishment on Monday to transfer the DCs in the interest of a free and fair election," he added. "Of the two DCs, Mokhlesur Rahman was appointed during the four-party alliance government's tenure and remained in the position although most of the DCs were transferred then," he said. The establishment ministry issued the order about their transfer on Monday, he further said. In another order, the ministry appointed Humayun Kabir, deputy director of Privatisation Commission, to Sirajganj and ASM Manjur Quadir, director of Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre, to Pabna as new DCs who will act as returning officers during polls. bdne
