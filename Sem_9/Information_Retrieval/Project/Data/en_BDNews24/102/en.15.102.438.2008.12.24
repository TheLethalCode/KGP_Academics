 Kamran Reza Chowdhury and Prodip Chowdhury bdnews24.com correspondents Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)Just five days before the parliamentary election, the parliament building is being cleared of the "special courts" which tried corruption suspects in the past two years under emergency powers rules. The law ministry on Wednesday sent a letter to the parliament secretariat for the removal and relocation of the 10 special courts, said officials of the secretariat and ministry. Out of the 10 special courts, set up following the declaration of the state of emergency on Jan. 11 last year, five will be shifted to district court premises in the old part of the city. Chittagong and Khulna will host two courts each while the rest will be relocated in Rajshahi. "We received a letter from the law ministry this afternoon about the shifting of the special courts from the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban premises," parliamentary affairs secretary Ashfaq Hamid told bdnews24.com on Wednesday night. "The time of the removal will now depend upon the law ministry," he said. Speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar told bdnews24.com by telephone from his constituency in Panchagarh, "I ordered the ministry to remove the special courts and sub-jail from the Jatiya Sangsad premises as soon as the official results of the elections are announced". The interim government of Fakhruddin Ahmed set up the special courts on May 6 last year to try special corruption suspects, most of whom were members of parliament including two former prime ministers. Ex-prime ministers and political rivals Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina stood in the special courts to face a raft of charges stemming from their terms in office. The decision to turn the highest seat of democracy into a prison and court for trying politicians has been controversial. "My image was tarnished for allowing the buildings to be used for special jails and special courts," Sircar told bdnews24.com. Sources at the law ministry said the law adviser ordered the removal of the courts from the parliament premises three days ago. But the order was communicated to parliament secretariat on Wednesday after completion of administrative formalities, they said. bdnews
