<TITLE> Terrorists active, but security seems good: Moriarty </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)US ambassador James F Moriarty Wednesday said though some "undemocratic forces" appeared active ahead of the Dec 29 polls, the security situation in Bangladesh was "very good". "The incident in Comilla served as a reminder that there are undemocratic forces out there. People that my government call terrorists, they do not like normal democratic processes," the US envoy told reporters following a visit to Dhakeshwari Temple in the capital. He added: "I think it is encouraging that the government was able to arrest them." The ambassador said he and his people had visited different areas of the country and talked to people about the upcoming polls. Moriarty said he and his people were assured that "the security situation seems to be very good" and "the government is playing a very good role, a neutral role." "We talked to people  and they tell us that they feel safer than previous elections," he said. Moriarty brushed aside the notion of any partiality by the US in favour of Awami League. "Since the two former prime ministers have left prison I met with Sheikh Hasina twice in Bangladesh." He said he had also met with Khaleda Zia once in Bangladesh, but had not been able to arrange a second visit. "I don't think it means anything other than the fact that she has been very busy outside of Dhaka," said Moriarty. "I look to forward to meeting with her at her very first convenient opportunity." The ambassador spoke to leaders of the Hindu community at the temple and inquired about their wellbeing. bdn
