 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)  The caretaker government has set in motion a Tk 208 crore project for preserving a "flawless voter list" in order to strengthen the democratic system, said finance adviser AB Mirza Azizul Islam on Tuesday. "This is part of the reform plan that the caretaker government undertook and if implemented will secure a flawless voter list for the future," Mirza Aziz told bdnews24.com. An ECNEC meeting, chaired by the chief adviser, approved the project for 'Construction of Upazila and Regional Server Stations for the Electoral Database' on Monday. Under the project, 502 server stations  one in every upazila, 16 in city corporation areas and five regional stations  will be established countrywide for the permanent preservation, regular update and central coordination of the much-lauded photo-based voter ID list. The stations, due to get some Tk96 crore funding through UNDP, are forecast to be complete by October 2010, said Mirza Aziz. The local government engineering division, of the works ministry, will implement the project under the Election Commission, he added. The project was included in the current (2008-09) fiscal year's Annual Development Programme, but as an unapproved project without any allocation. Land for 316 server stations has already been allocated, the rest to be purchased. At the moment, offices of the upazila chairmen are being used as by upazila election officers, but this privilege will expire after the upcoming upazila polls. Therefore, the project needs immediate implementation, said the workplan. bd
