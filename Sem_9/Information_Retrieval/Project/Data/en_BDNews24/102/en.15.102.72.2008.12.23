 Kamran Reza Chowdhury Senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 22 (bdnews24.com) - The makeshift anti-graft courts and jails in the parliament complex will be removed after official announcement of the Dec. 29 election results, speaker Muhammad Jamiruddin Sircar says. After the declaration of emergency on Jan. 11 last year, Fakhruddin Ahmed's interim government set up 10 special courts for the trial of suspected corrupt politicians including two former prime ministers and government officials. The government, with the approval from the parliament secretariat, also turned the speaker and deputy speaker's houses into special jails to keep BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia and Awami League president Sheikh Hasina in detention. "I will order authorities to remove the special courts and the special jails from the [ parliamnent] premises immediately after the announcement of the official results (of the ninth parliamentary polls)," Sircar said to bdnews24.com on Monday by telephone from his constituency in Panchagarh. He said the parliament secretariat was the owner of the buildings turned into makeshift courts and jails. Sircar said he handed over the buildings to the government on condition that those would be returned to the parliament secretariat after the announcement of schedule of the polls. The Election Commission announced the polls schedule on Nov. 23 but those buildings were not returned to the parliament secretariat. Meanwhile, the police have already removed the barbed-wire fence from the parliament complex . Those fences were used to restrict the movement of people when the two former prime ministers were housed and stood for trial. The speaker had earlier told bdnews24.com that his image was tarnished after he allowed the government to set up jails and courts to detain and try the politicians who were members of the legislature. "I allowed them setting up courts and jails for 'technical reasons'," he said. bdn
