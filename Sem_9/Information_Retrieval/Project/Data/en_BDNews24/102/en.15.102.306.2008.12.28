 Narsingdi, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com)  Former BNP secretary general Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, running as an independent in Narsingdi-3, addressed his last electoral campaign on Saturday, aiming for his fifth turn as an MP from his home constituency. "I have been by your side for the last 40 years. This time I don't have any party behind me, but I ask you to give me an opportunity to serve you," he said addressing a rally in Shibpur. The expelled BNP leader urged the audience to vote for his poll symbol, the duck. Running as an independent for the first time in his constituency, the former BNP 'reformist' promises restoration of democracy, an effective parliament and qualitative change in politics. "If voted to power, I'll take all the initiatives necessary for the welfare of people. We'll have to work for the sake of our next generation." Bhuiyan has been elected MP four times from Narsingdhi. He was BNP secretary general for 11 years, until chairperson Khaleda Zia expelled him from the party on Sept 3 for his role among the party 'reformists'. bdnews2
