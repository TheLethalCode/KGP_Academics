 Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  BNP expelled former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, who is running for parliament as an independent candidate, from the party on Friday, said a senior party official. "The expulsion came as Babar breached party discipline," office secretary Rizvi Ahmed told bdnews24.com. BNP leaders said those contesting the election independently and without the party mandate had been warned of reprisals earlier.. "Punitive measures have been taken against those who didn't abide by the party directives," the BNP office secretary said. As part of the measures, Joynal Abedin, Syed Shahidul Huq Jamal, Abdul Quayum Chowdhury and Kabir Ahmed Bhuiyan saw their exit from the party on Thursday, he added. The expelled BNP leaders are all running the elections as independent candidates. Police arrested Babar on corruption charges on May 28. Trial courts have sentenced Babar to a total of 17 years in prison in two of the four cases against him. But he secured High Court stays and bail and was released on Dec. 4. Deprived of the party nomination as a result of the convictions, however, Babar is contesting as an independent candidate in Netrakona-4. The High Court on Dec 18 stayed the Election Commission's cancellation of his candidacy. bdne
