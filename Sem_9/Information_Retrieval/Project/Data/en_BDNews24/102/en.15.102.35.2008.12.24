<TITLE> Khaleda 'staging a drama': Hasina </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dinajpur, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Wednesday said she doubted whether rival party BNP was swinging the lead, and claimed party chief Khaleda Zia was "staging a drama" after the recovery of grenades in Comilla the previous day. "Seeing mass support in the Awami League rallies, she is perhaps looking for chances to avoid the election by foiling it," Hasina said at an election rally in the northern district of Dinajpur. Following the recovery of three grenades and arrest of two militant suspects from a village in Comilla, a few kilometres from a Khaleda rally on Tuesday, she and other BNP leaders claimed the grenades were intended to target her in a conspiracy to foil the election. Hasina, speaking in Dinajpur, accused Khaleda of "staging a drama" after the incident. "I saw in the newspaper those grenades were found some five kilometres distant from her rally. Then why did she stage the drama. What is the motive behind it?" "Why should militants attempt to kill her, as they grew up under her patronisation? She is the patron of HuJI," Hasina claimed. She said the banned Islamist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh, which has been reported as planning an attempt on Hasina's life, was formed during the BNP-led four-party alliance government in 2001-2006. Until Tuesday night, RAB could not confirm the identity of the group to which the two suspected militant detained in Comilla belonged to. Criticising the four-party government Hasina said they had looted the money of the poor sanctioned for relief. "The country was run from 'Hawa Bhaban', (instead of parliament)," Hasina said. Hasina came down heavily on the BNP's chosen candidates: "They have nominated Abdus Salam Pintu in Tangail, the brother of an accused in the August 21 grenade attack case. In Gazipur, they have nominated a suspect in the Ahsanullah murder case. And the BNP candidate here in Dinajpur, Shafiul Alam Prodhan, is a murderer." "What else have they done except patronising killers and militants?" The people of the country have suffered much in last seven years, she said, adding that the AL-led grand alliance must be voted to power to free the people from those sufferings. If voted to power, Hasina pledged to modernise Hili Land Port in the district and to found an international airport. She introduced the AL candidates in Dinajpur's five constituencies canvassing votes for them. Sheikh Hasina was back on the campaign trail Wednesday, after a two-day hiatus spent in the capital, urging people on her way to Rangpur in the north to 'vote boat' for progress and development. The AL president left her Sudha Sadan residence shortly before 8:00am for the northern districts in the morning, addressing a number of rallies in Sirajganj, Bogra, Gaibandha, and Rangpur, her father-in-law's town. In Bogra, she attended a rally at Matidali, one of the seats for which BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia is contesting, where AL's candidate is Md Momtaz Uddin. The AL chief addressed a public gathering in Pirganj in the afternoon, part of the Rangpur-6 constituency, one of three seats in which Hasina is running. The former prime minister formally launched her election campaign on Dec. 13. She was touring the southwest on a four-day campaign trip last week. bdnews24.com/
