 United Nations, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - The UN Security Council met late on Saturday evening to discuss the situation in Gaza after over 225 people were killed in Israeli air strikes responding to rocket and mortar fire by Gaza militants against Israel. It was not immediately clear whether the 15-nation council would take any formal action. Earlier, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for an immediate halt to the violence in the Hamas-ruled Gaza strip and in southern Israel.
