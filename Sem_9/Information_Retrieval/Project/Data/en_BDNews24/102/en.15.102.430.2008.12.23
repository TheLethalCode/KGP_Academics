 Dhaka, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com)The UK government has welcomed the verdict over the 2004 grenade attack on former British high commissioner Anwar Choudhury in Sylhet, though it voiced reservations over the death penalties of three of the convicted. Three policemen were killed and over 50 were injured, including the former UK envoy, in the grenade attack on May 21, 2004, that was judged to be an attempt on Choudhury's life as he was visiting the shrine of Shah Jalal in the northeastern city. Prime accused, Harkatul-Jihad-al-Islami operations commander Mufti Abdul Hannan Munshi, and two other militants, Sharif Shahedul Bipul and Delwar Hossain Ripon, were sentenced to death on Tuesday. Two other accused received life terms. "For all the victims of the heinous attack of 2004, we are pleased that the verdict has finally been reached. Our thoughts remain with them," a spokesperson of the British high commission said in a statement Tuesday. "The UK will continue to work together with Bangladesh to overcome those who seek to profit from hatred, fear and violence," she said. "We will cooperate to address the root causes of extremism both in Bangladesh and around the world." In line with the UK's policy against capital punishment, the spokesperson opposed the death sentences of Mufti Hannan and two others, however. "Our government's position on the death penalty is clear: we oppose it in all circumstances," she said. bdn
