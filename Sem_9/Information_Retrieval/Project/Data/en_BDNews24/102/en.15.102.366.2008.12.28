 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Mobile-phone networks will work on the election day, election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain said on Sunday. "But we have recommended the suspension of network in certain areas." Voters cannot enter centres with mobile phones, he added. "Exceptions will be made in the case of persons with Election Commission approval and, violation of the order will be regarded as a grave crime," he further said. A letter from the Election Commission has been sent to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) on Sunday afternoon. The letter, signed by the senior assistant secretary at the EC Secretariat, states on election day, suspension of networks in certain areas might become essential. It also asked for necessary steps in the case such needs arose. EC officials said chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda will enlarge on the issue of the mobile network when he addresses the nation at 7:30 on Sunday evening. "The mobile network will be active on election day though there is the provision for suspension of network in some areas," said Mihir Sarwar Morshed, deputy secretary at the EC Secretariat. In the past, the CEC supported undisturbed mobile network during election. Voting will continue from 8am through to 4pm on Monday. bdnew
