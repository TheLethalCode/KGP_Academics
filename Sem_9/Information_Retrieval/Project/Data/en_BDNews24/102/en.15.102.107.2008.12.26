 Sumon Mahbub Senior political correspondent Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina on Friday appealed for votes at Paltan, as she renewed her party's pledges to cut prices, cut poverty, and usher in the country's digital age. "Vote for boat and we will reduce poverty from the country, will take necessary steps to increase education rate and make a digital Bangladesh by 2021, when we will celebrate the golden jubilee of the country." She was addressing huge crowds gathered at Paltan ground amid tight security, standing on the dais surrounded by bullet-proof glass Friday afternoon. Hundreds of thousands of people in processions had streamed to the Paltan grounds, while loud speakers were heard from all corners seeking votes for the grand alliance, said one eyewitness. The masses were also seen spilling into a large swathe in nearby Dilkusha as people joined the scene on their weekend holiday. The authorities opened the main gate of the ground around 2pm. People were being allowed to enter through one gate, the only gate between Bangabandhu National Sadium and Moulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium. They were led through several check points to enter, with newsmen also being checked twice. Security forces have also deployed patrols in the surrounding buildings, with police presence being seen at both the stadiums. The banner on stage reads: 'Be united in the struggle for change, vote for boat'. One side of the banner shows the image of Hasina and the other side a boat, the party's election symbol. AL supporters started arriving at the venue from early morning with processions from different areas. The meeting formally kicked off at around 2:30pm through reading of religious texts. Hasina arrived at around 4pm. BNP chief Khaleda Zia will hold an election meeting at the same venue on Saturday. Security set-up at Paltan has been beefed up specially in view of the two party bosses holding public meetings on two consecutive days. Hasina will also hold a public meeting at Laldighi Maidan in Chittagong on Saturday. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner's office said over 1000 security personnel of police, RAB and other law-enforcing agencies will be deployed at Paltan through the period to ensure overall security of the venue and people. The two chiefs are addressing public meetings at the venue for the first time since 2006. Hasina began her election campaign on Dec. 11 through visiting Shah Jalal's shrine in Sylhet. Khaleda followed suit the day after. The two leaders have since been touring the country and speaking to people and seeking their votes. Bangladesh Television and Betar (radio) were broadcasting Hasina's Paltan speech on Friday and will do the same with Khaleda's election speech on Saturday evening. The AL chief will address public meetings at Comilla and Feni on Saturday en route to Chittagong. Khaleda has already completed her Chittagong circuit tour. Election campaigning by all parties running the polls will be on until midnight of Dec. 27. bdnews24.co
