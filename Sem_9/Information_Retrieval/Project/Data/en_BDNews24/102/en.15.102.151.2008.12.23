 WASHINGTON,Tue Dec 23,(bdnews24.com/Reuters)-- Half dozen European countries are considering resettling detainees from the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a gesture to the incoming Obama administration, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. Citing senior European officials and US diplomats, the newspaper said European officials have put out tentative feelers to President-elect Barack Obama's team. But Obama advisers said they could only discuss the issue after the Jan. 20 inauguration. Guantanamo has about 250 detainees including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, accused of masterminding the Sept. 11 attacks. The prison has come to symbolize aggressive interrogation practices that opened the United States up to allegations of torture. Obama has pledged to close Guantanamo. Only Germany and Portugal have acknowledged publicly that they are considering resettling the detainees, the newspaper said. European nations refused repeated requests from the Bush administration to accept Guantanamo detainees, it added
