<TITLE> AL has breached seat deal: Ershad </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Rangpur, Dec 23 (bdnews24.com) - Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad has once again accused election ally Awami League of breaching the seat-sharing deal between them ahead of the forthcoming election. "AL candidates are contesting in Rangpur-4 and 5 and 10, and other constituencies which were allocated to JP earlier," said Ershad at an election rally in Rangpur on Tuesday. "This is unethical and unacceptable," he added. "I addressed Awami League president Hasina as my younger sister," Ershad told the rally at Balarhat High School ground in Mithapukur Upazila. JP is a key component in the AL-led 'grand alliance'. If the candidates from the AL and the JP contest separately in the shared constituencies, Ershad apprehended, the vote may be split to the advantage of BNP-led-four-party candidates. In Rangpur-5, Ershad introduced his party candidate Fakhruzzaman Jahangir as the "valid" grand alliance candidate, seeking ballots for him. He urged the AL candidate Ashikur Rahman to withdraw his candidacy from Rangpur-5. If voted to power, Ershad pledged to make Rangpur a division, establish a women's cadet college at Pairaband, ensure gas supply, and create jobs in the district. He also took part in rallies in Rangpur-4 canvassing support for JP candidate Karim Uddin Bharasa. bdnews24.com/co
