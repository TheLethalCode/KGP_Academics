<TEXT>
 Dhaka, December 22 (bdnews24.com)With counterfeit currencies, passports, visas and revenue stamps being nothing new, the National Board of Revenue is moving to prevent fake TINs, recently unearthed, from also flooding the forgers' market. An urgent meeting of all tax commissioners, bankers and top officials of concerned government agencies has been convened for Monday to discuss the new menace, NBR chairman Mohammad Abdul Majid told bdnews24.com. As Rajuk recently made it mandatory for those vying for government-allocated residential plots in Uttara and Purbachal to submit their TINs along with other necessary documents, applicants were seen submitting fake TINs with few qualms, officials said. The same practice was apparent during scrutiny of nomination papers of national and upazila poll candidates. "We have carried out investigations into these irregularities and found out that people are submitting counterfeit TINs with authorities while applying for Rajuk plots, bank loans and other official business," said the NBR chairman. "Fake TINs can be easily identified and trashed if concerned authorities conduct the scrutiny of such documents in consultation with the NBR." NBR officials say in the past, the use of fake TINs had been uncovered by those seeking bank loan seeking and submitting tenders. "But this time, we founf election candidates submitting counterfeit TINs, and the highest incidence of fake TIN use occurred while people submitted applications for Rajuk plots," said one taxman. The NBR also disclosed figures earlier this month showing 891 out of 2,456 nominations for candidacy in the parliamentary polls had no TINs at all. The revenue board also tells the total number of taxpayers with TINs in the country stands a little over 2.2 million, of whom only 650,ooo deposited their income tax returns this year up to Nov 12. Measures, such as tax incentives and rewards, taken by the caretaker government in the past two years have increased the number of taxpayers and raised revenue earnings,. bdnews24.
