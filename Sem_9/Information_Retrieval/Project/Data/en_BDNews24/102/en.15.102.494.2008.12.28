<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 28 (bdnews24.com)  Voters will not be permitted to take mobile phones into polling centres, the Election Commission said on Sunday - suggesting that though polls officials have still to confirm it mobile networks may be working on Election Day. "None other than those approved by the commission will be allowed to carry mobile phones in the polling centres," election commissioner M Sakhawat Hossain told reporters at EC Secretariat. "If anybody enters with a mobile phone it will be treated as a serious crime," he added. However, the commissioner ducked the question on whether mobile networks would be up and running on Monday, saying an official announcement would come later. Sakhawat asked that candidates fully comply with code of conduct. "If the election is foiled for any candidate's actions the commission will take tough measures against him or her." The commissioner also warned observer agencies. "The commission will not work further with any agency if allegation of bias are proved. They will be blacklisted." On the question of official influence, Sakhawat said: "We ask government not to contact returning officers including officials of the district administration except on election related issues." He said the EC had also taken under consideration the possibility of former officials influencing incumbent. "We have considered the issue. We ask them not to contact incumbent officials." He hoped that the ninth parliamentary election would be held properly. "We hope that the election will be held fairly as do the two leaders of the two electoral alliances," Sakhawat said. bdnews
