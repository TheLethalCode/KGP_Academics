<TITLE> A party wants rid of nationalist forces: BNP </TITLE>
<TEXT>
 Dhaka, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com)BNP leaders have alleged that 'a particular party' wants nationalist forces to quit the election race and so is stirring up unwarranted allegations. "BNP will not go away from contesting polls. Party chairperson Khaleda Zia also made this point very clear," said joint secretary general Nazrul Islam Khan on Thursday. He called on the government to work impartially. "The administration will have to work impartially to ensure a free, fair and credible election. They must not side with any party," Khan said at a press conference at the Gulshan party office. He claimed that security officials had "misbehaved" with BNP adherents in some areas of country, demanding an immediate stop to such behaviour. "Former president HM Ershad has alleged many BNP leaders are corrupts. He simply cannot do so, when he himself faces so many corruption charges," the BNP leader said. Referring to the reports of Singapore authorities freezing assets of Khaleda's son Arafat Rahman Coco, Khan said: "These are all false rumors to influence the election." "If Coco was involved in any corruption, why did charges not arise earlier?" He also condemned "the planned attack on Khaleda Zia in Comilla". "'They' tried to kill our leader there. Authorities also believed it. They alerted Khaleda Zia's security team and insisted on her not attending any public meeting." He showed a poster distributed as part of a negative campaign against BNP leader Gayeswar Chandra Roy. "A group is trying to put him down. We have complained to the Election Commission. Now it's time to see how the commission handles these complaints and whether it takes any steps." bdnews
