 Kamran Reza Chowdhury bdnews24.com senior correspondent Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Bangladesh is demanding suspension of mineral exploration activities in the Bay by India until the sea borders between the two countries are demarcated. "The government of Bangladesh would ask for postponement of any exploratory or development activity in adjoining areas till such time as the maritime boundary between the two countries is settled by mutual agreement," a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press statement Friday evening. Foreign adviser Iftekhar Ahmed Chowdhury had earlier in the day said the government was running an inquiry. "We are investigating the situation and will take actions as deemed necessary based on the result of the inquiry," he told bdnews24.com. The Indian High Commission was not available for comment due to holiday on Friday. Bangladesh and India resumed sea-boundary demarcation talks on September 15 this year in Dhaka after a pause of 22 years. Though the two-day Dhaka talks ended inconclusively, the two neighbours agreed to continue the dialogue. The next round of talks are scheduled to take place in New Delhi, according to foreign ministry sources. The foreign ministry said the Indian ships were conducting surveys of deep-sea Block 14 in the maritime area claimed by Bangladesh under the Territorial Waters and Maritime Zones Act 1974. Both India and Myanmar have rejected the 1974 Act, however, making counter claims for the same waters. Dhaka has initiated dialogues to settle the maritime disputes with the two bordering countries. Until the borders are settled none can carry out exploration in the disputed waters, according to international practices. Friday's statement said three Indian ships left the disputed waters as the Bangladesh Navy protested the intrusion, but they entered again. "While the survey ships initially moved towards Indian waters, they later came back to the earlier location where they were again located in the afternoon of 25 December 2008," said the foreign ministry statement. "When the Bangladesh Navy vessel again asked it to leave Bangladesh waters, the ship replied that it was in Indian waters," it said. Foreign secretary Md Touhid Hossain said his ministry would file a diplomatic protest note soon. "We've confirmed that one survey vessel backed by two navy ships has intruded into our waters," foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told bdnews24.com earlier in the day. "We've already lodged a ship-to-ship protest, but the Indian vessel has refused to leave the place," he added. "We will file a diplomatic protest note today (Friday) or tomorrow," said the secretary. The Indian ships entered Bangladesh territorial waters on Thursday night, when navy vessels were dispatched to the spot to ask the Indian ships to back off, said a maritime official. "Three Indian survey vessels started seismic survey activities some 140 nautical miles southwest off Mongla seaport," the official had said, adding that top navy and coastguard officials held an urgent meeting, the official said. The Indian intrusion takes place less than two months after Myanmar vessels attempted to carry out similar explorations in disputed Bay waters, some 60 nautical miles off Saint Martin's Island in early November. During recent maritime talks, both India and Myanmar have claimed waters that would leave Bangladesh's sea zone locked. India and Myanmar must settle the disputes with Bangladesh and demarcate their sea boundaries by the middle of 2009 according to the United Nations Convention on Laws of the Sea (UNCLOS). Bangladesh needs to demarcate its sea border by middle of 2011. Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar are all signatories to UNCLOS. bdn
