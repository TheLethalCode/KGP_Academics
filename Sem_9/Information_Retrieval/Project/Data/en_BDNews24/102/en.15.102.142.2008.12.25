 TOKYO, Dec 25 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Dentsu Inc, Japan's largest ad agency, said it would team up with game maker Nintendo Co Ltd to launch a video distribution service on Nintendo's wildly popular Wii console.

Viewers will need to pay to see some of the new programmes, while others will be offered free of charge and accompanied by advertisements, the spokesman said on Thursday. Nintendo has sold 34.6 million Wii consoles, which feature a motion-sensing controller that looks like a TV remote control, as of the end of September, far outselling Microsoft Corp's Xbox 360 and Sony Corp's PlayStation 3. Dentsu and Nintendo will start offering the new service in Japan next year, while the timing for overseas sales has yet to be set, the Dentsu spokesman said.
