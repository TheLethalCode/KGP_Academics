 HARARE, Wed Dec 24,(bdnews24.com/Reuters) - A former Zimbabwean newscaster and nine other opposition activists are expected to appear in court on Wednesday on charges of plotting to overthrow President Robert Mugabe's government, state media reported. Jestina Mukoko, head of the Zimbabwe Peace Project, was taken away at gunpoint in Harare on December 3 by unidentified men and the High Court had ordered police to find her. Police had previously said Mukoko was not in their custody. Recent arrests of activists have prompted opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to threaten to suspend deadlocked negotiations with Mugabe on sharing power, adding to doubts over chances for a deal that could rescue Zimbabwe from economic meltdown. The state-run Herald newspaper said the activists were to appear in court on charges of recruiting or attempting to recruit people to undergo military training to topple the government. Some of the activists had recruited people for military training in Botswana, including a police constable, the newspaper said, citing a police statement. It said the plan was to "forcibly depose" Mugabe's government and replace it with one headed by opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Tsvangirai. Zimbabwe has accused Botswana of training opposition insurgents to oust Mugabe, increasing tensions between the neighbors and adding to doubts over a power-sharing deal. Botswana, one of Mugabe's toughest critics, denied the allegations. The opposition says scores of its activists were abducted and killed in the run-up to a June presidential run-off election. Tsvangirai boycotted the vote after the attacks, allowing Mugabe to win the one-candidate poll. A September 15 power-sharing agreement has ground to a halt because of disagreement over control of key ministries. Zimbabwe has sunk deeper into crisis as the stalemate drags on. Hyper-inflation means prices double every day, a cholera epidemic has killed nearly 1,200 people. Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu accused South Africa of betraying its legacy of struggling against apartheid by failing to take strong action against Mugabe. Tutu also told the BBC in an interview that military force against Mugabe's government should not be ruled out. "How much more suffering is going to make us say 'No we have given Mr. Mugabe enough time?'," Tutu asked in an interview with the BBC's Radio 4. South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) leader Jacob Zuma called for a quick end to Zimbabwe's political and economic crisis. "The New Year must bring a speedy resolution to this utterly untenable situation," said Zuma in a Christmas message
