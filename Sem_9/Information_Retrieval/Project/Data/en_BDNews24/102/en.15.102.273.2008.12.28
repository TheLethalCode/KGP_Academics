 Dhaka, Dec 28, (bdnews24.com)  The co-chairman of the Awami League Election Steering Committee, H T Imam, is hopeful of winning Monday's elections with more than absolute majority. He expressed the optimism while talking to journalists on Sunday after a meeting between a team from the European Union and AL president Sheikh Hasina. Imam however doubted if women and indigenous people could vote. "We have told the European Union team that many have broke electoral law and we believe money is being spent to buy votes in many areas." The AL is happy with the voter list and the translucent ballot boxes, but in many areas voters may be stopped from voting in the face of threat and terrorism, he further observed. "Money is being distributed to buy votes in Feni, Barguna, Patuakhali and in several areas of Dhaka," alleged Imam. Talking about areas where female voters may be barred unlawfully, he said, "In Chittagong-8, Rauzan, Rangunia, Hathazari and Fatikchhari women voters are being threatened." "In the name of local observers, many party workers and armed terrorists have begun to operate." Earlier, Charles Tannock, head of the EU team of representatives, expressed satisfaction over the photo-based voter list. "This list is almost flawless; at least, this is more accurate than the voter list in England." "We are satisfied with the work done by the Election Commission and hopefully everyone will accept the result of the upcoming election." Nirj Deva of the European Parliament, Niell Parish, Kondrad Dillen, election observer team members Graham Ealson, Jonathan Hendricson and others were present at the meeting lasting from 1:30pm to 2:45pm. bd
