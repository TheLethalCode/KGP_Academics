 Reazul Bashar bdnews24.com correspondent Nilphamari, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com) - Gas supply, industries, jobsare some of the election pledges Jatiya Party chairman HM Ershad made to voters in his home district of Rangpur on Friday. "People here are living at the subsistence level and industries have yet to develop," Ershad said at a Nilphamari rally. "If you vote the grand alliance to power, I promise, people of Rangpur and Nilphamari will have gas connections to support industries including garment factories and unemployment will be over." The JP chief was addressing a rally at the Domar Bohumukhy High School ground on Friday in support for grand alliance candidate Zafar Iqbal Siddiquee. Later he addressed another electoral rally at Jaldhaka Degree College ground to drum up support for Faruk Quader, another grand alliance candidate. "Once in power, we'll develop this area." "We produce paddy which is transported to Dhaka whereas our area is left undeveloped," Ershad said. Before that the army veteran in different election rallies in Gangachara Upazila of Rangpur said, "I'm indebted to you and I want to pay you back but, for that, you got to send the grand alliance to power." Ershad also promised roads, bridges, 100-day employment generation project, allowances for the working groups and rationing system. In another rally for AL leader and grand alliance candidate Asaduzzaman Noor, the JP chief said, "Hasina and myself  as 'brother and sister' will certainly snatch the election victory." "You all know the history of the four-party alliance  the history of oppression, looting and money laundering." "The country has to be rescued through the victory of the grand alliance," the former president said. bdnews24.com/r
