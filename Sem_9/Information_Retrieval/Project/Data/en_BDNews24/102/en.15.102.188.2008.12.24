<TEXT>
 MOHALI, India, Dec 24 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Unpredictable weather prevented India setting England a meaningful victory target in the second test, skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said after it ended in a tame draw on the final day on Tuesday. India won the two-match series 1-0 after they claimed the first test in Chennai by six wickets having achieved a memorable fourth innings target of 387 runs. Tuesday's result in Mohali was the first draw under Dhoni, who began his captaincy with three wins, including the 2-0 home series win over Australia. Dhoni said he chose to allow opener Gautam Gambhir, out for 97 after a first innings 179, and Yuvraj Singh (86) to go for their hundreds on the last day instead of setting a target. Poor light due to fog affected all five days and Dhoni said the unpredictable weather meant he could not take any risks. "It is not always easy," he told reporters. "There was not much wear and tear on the pitch. I was not 100 percent sure we could put them in and take the wickets. "We were leading in the series, we didn't want to give England any chance. We were not sure about the weather, you're thinking 350 runs (target), but it can be easily achieved if 90 overs were possible." England, set an improbable 403 runs to get in 43 overs, were 64 for one when play was called off after tea, after two-and-half hours were lost due to fog in the morning. Dhoni praised England for their resilience and for resuming the aborted tour after last month's militant attacks in Mumbai had raised serious doubts over whether the tests would go ahead. "It was 10 days of really good cricket," Dhoni said. "Even the first test was interesting. Even here, when our top order wickets fell, it seemed it will go for an exciting end." Gambhir was named man-of-the-match while left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan, who bowled superbly to claim eight wickets in the batsmen-dominated series, emerged the player of the series. The series win helped India regain the number two spot in the International Cricket Council (ICC) test rankings. However, Dhoni said playing well was more important. "We are not considering that fact, we need to really focus on playing good cricket," he said. "The execution of our plans have been brilliant so far.
