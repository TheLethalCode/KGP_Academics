 Sumon Mahbub Senior political correspondent Dhaka, Dec 26 (bdnews24.com)  Awami League president Sheikh Hasina is set to address an election meeting at Paltan ground amid tight security, standing on the dais surrounded by bullet-proof glass on Friday afternoon. The same arrangement has been kept on the stage where she and other AL leaders will sit. Hundreds of thousands of people in processions were streaming into Paltan ground. Speakers blared speeches through loud speakers seeking votes for the grand alliance, said one eyewitness. Huge crowds were spilling into a large swathe in nearby Dilkusha. Thousands are rushing to the scene as the day being weekend holiday. Policemen are guarding all entry points of roads leading to the rally ground. The authorities opened the main gate of the ground around 2pm. People are being allowed to enter through the gate, the only gate between Bangabandhu National Sadium and Moulana Bhashani Hockey Stadium. They have to go through several check points to enter there. The media men are also being detected twice. The security forces have deployed patrol team in the surrounding buildings. The police are being seen in the stadiums. The banner in the stage is written 'Be united in the struggle of change, vote for boat symbol'. One side of the banner shows the image of Hasina and the other side boat, the party's election symbol. AL supporters started arriving in the venue since morning with processions from different areas. The gathering formally started at around 2:30pm through reading out religious text. Hasina is yet to arrive in the meeting. BNP chief Khaleda Zia will hold an election meeting at the same venue on Saturday. Hasina will hold a public meeting at Laldighi Maidan in Chittagong on Saturday. Election campaigning by all parties running the polls will be on until midnight of Dec. 27. Security set-up at Paltan has been beefed up specially in view of the two party bosses holding public meetings on two consecutive days. The Dhaka Metropolitan Police commissioner's office said over 1000 security personnel of police, RAB and other law-enforcing agencies will be deployed at Paltan through the period to ensure overall security of the venue and people. The two chiefs are scheduled to address public meetings at the venue for the first time since 2006. Hasina began her election campaign on Dec. 11 through visiting Shah Jalal's shrine in Sylhet. Khaleda followed suit the day after. The two leaders have since been touring the country and speaking to people and seeking their votes. Bangladesh Television and Betar (radio) will broadcast Hasina's Paltan speech on Friday evening and Khaleda's election speech on Saturday evening. The AL chief will address public meetings at Comilla and Feni on Saturday en route to Chittagong. Khaleda has already completed her Chittagong circuit tour. bdnews2
