<TEXT>
 NEW YORK, Dec 27 (bdnews24.com/Reuters) - Burger lovers hoping to eat their favorite meal this Christmas and smell of it too were left disappointed when a new Burger King cologne became one of the holiday season's most hard-to-find items. Burger King Holdings Inc., the world's No.2 hamburger chain, released a men's body spray called "Flame" as a novelty gift for the holidays, which it described as having the "scent of seduction with a hint of flame-broiled meat." The limited edition eau de Whopper was being sold exclusively at Ricky's cosmetics stores in New York for $3.99 a 5ml bottle but was out of stock within days and was being sold on the online auction site eBay for up to $70 a bottle. Ricky's manager Luis Bejaran told Reuters Television that the fragrance had been such a huge hit with customers searching for the perfect gift in the lead-up to Christmas. "Very popular. People keep coming in to the stores asking for the product. We're sold out, but we are getting more back in February," said Bejaran. Promotional window displays of the fragrance show the Burger Kingmascot, half naked, sprawled on a bearskin rug. Bejaran said he'd been fielding many calls from desperate customers. "A guy called up on the phone .. he was really, really eager. As soon as we told him we didn't have the product, he was like, what? You don't have the cheeseburger smelling cologne for me? My girlfriend wants me to smell that. What am I supposed to do - rub a cheeseburger on top of me, or a Whopper?" Bejaran told Reuters. Not everyone, however, likes the idea of smelling like a burger. "I think when you go to a burger joint you come home smelling like a burger, it's a bad thing. So to go out and actively try to get that smell, it's probably not a good idea. But maybe there are some couples out there who find that to be their thing - but it's definitely not mine," said New Yorker Kyle Graham
